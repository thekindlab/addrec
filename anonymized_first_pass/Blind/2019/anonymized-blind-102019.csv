0,"Thank you. It feels very soothing to read your angry lines haha :). And believe me, I would love to sue them after this comment. The problem is I'm from Switzerland where disabled individuals have almost no legal protections. So it's frustrating in a two ways. When someone discriminates you it's already super frustrating but then you can't even do much about it. However, I have written an email to the management now. I told them I want a different stove/oven and I also told them the sexist/ableist remark was totally inappropriate. I haven't yet heard back from them but I hope that they will eventually give in if I get on their nerves for long enough. I'd even go as far as paying for the new devices myself because the current situation is really not working.

What depresses me the most, however, is the fact that the architect couldn't think of this. I mean, he's not some random office worker. He's a freaking architect who designs living spaces for people as a job. How can it not cross his mind that such a stove/oven would be a problem for a blind person? It's like designing a building without a ramp and without an elevator, not even thinking about the possibility that wheelchair-bound people might want to live there.

One thing that really put me at ease was him saying the word see in a sentence. He said 'I saw something this one time' and immediately that made me feel ok to say 'see' too. Silly I know... 

The only thing that is still a struggle is to know if I am bombarding him because, of course I initiate the conversations, as he doesn't know I'm around, but does he really feel like talking to me? I don't know, other than to start the conversation and taking it from there, which sometimes meant having conversations dying out awkwardly (he wasn't in the mood for one but was too nice to say but it became clear eventually) anyway will keep working on it!

Make them give you all material including textbook in PDF format as well. Then request Jaws from them as you will need it for Microsoft Office products, if they refuse to pay for it then ask them to point you in the direction of a state agency that can provide it to you free of charge, because you cannot afford it.

If you can, get the Voice Dream Reader app (I have a calculus book on mine), and the Voice Scanner app (I use my app to read handouts).

You can also request a note taker and/or a classroom scribe, and even record lectures. 

Ask them if they have a swell machine, if they do not, then there is a portable device that a scribe can use to draw graphs that allow you to feel them in 3D (I forget the name of it), see if they can order this device for you.

There is also talking graphing calculators that they should be able to order for you. 

Then request that all test be given on some type of CCTV such as the DaVinci. You can also request 2.5x on all exams or quizzes due to your visual impairment.

For online homework from Pearsons, you need to tell the professor that he can only assign the assignments that are accessible for screen readers. Here is the link that will explain how to do this, https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/mymathlab/accessibility/index.html

A few other things I remember, salads are his favorite thing at the moment so I make different ones, chinese chicken, grilled chicken, steak, he will even add rice to it to kind clump things together, hot dogs, steak sandwhiches, he also does alot of sandwhiches andnthe cool part is you can change things up and he wont get tired of it. 

He will almost always use a bowl because he can scrape the bottom and scoop up the last bites. He does spill drinks or drop things from time to time. We don't make a big deal because we get it but he worries everyone saw it to which I reply does it matter if you can't see them? Haha 

Just keep things light, he is still the same person just with different abilities sometimes we even joke about it. I remind my husband that everyone has different abilities and disabilities and we are there to help or direct him in the right direction. 

Please remind everyone to introduce themselves  and tell him if they are leaving the room or get up and let him know if they are leaving for good or whatnot. Thats my husbands biggest gripe. It gets lonely even around loved ones. Just listen and give support which looks like you are doing well there.

53,"hello! it’s really great that you’re reaching out besides the language barriers. 

having to adjust to a new setting while blind is pretty intimidating— i moved to a big city when i started college and i initally stayed only on campus or in my dorm— i knew the city offered plenty to experience, but i was too scared. 

And that’s just moving to different cities! I can’t imagine what it must be like to move to a different country. 

For getting out more, I think it really is vital to experience public transportation with a trusted loved one. after using the bus/subway system here was my sister a couple times, and I felt confident enough to try it myself. but of course, if that’s too big if a step, simply go for a walk around the block— familiarize yourself with what restaurants/cafes are close by, find your favorite, go sit there often— it’s all up to you.

Individuals who utilize screen reading software can determine the structure of a webpage by using keyboard (and in your case for your project) voice commands to access and interact with the webpage’s content. We rely heavily on the HTML native markup (native HTML elements, links, buttons, etc.) to get a sense of a webpage’s layout. Users also rely on correct heading level and structure &lt;H1-H6&gt; and landmarks such as headers &lt;header&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”banner”, navigation region &lt;nav) or for labels containing ARIA role=”navigation”, main content region &lt;main&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”main”, articles &lt;article&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”article”, and footer &lt;footer&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”contentinfo” etc. I know you mentioned that when users give a voice command or navigate to a focusable item, you have redirects to move them to an item. I am not sure how screen readers would deal with the automatic content as it is updated when moving the focus from “Programs” to “courses”. In most case scenarios it is recommended that moving the focus and the control for moving the focus for individuals who utilize screen readers is within their control. Sometimes, when focus is automatically moved for users without it being within their control, it can cause screen readers to lose focus of the location even though you are seeing the focus move from one element to another on your screen. I think with some tweaking and testing, you can use JavaScript to make sure your focus order and where you redirect the focus is correct before testing with other individuals. It is not uncommon for developers to think the focus order is correct because they see the focus change on their screen; my advice would be to test this with a screen reader and make sure focus moves exactly where you are redirecting it. But, if you can get a screen reader like NVDA to change and read the information on a focusable form field or link for example, perhaps this idea will work well and get others on board for making screen readers work more efficiently with voice recognition programs such as Dragon Naturally Speaking.Since the form is for students to fill out information for resumes, a spelling option may be needed. If you have individuals who are blind, deafblind, or visually impaired using your screen reader and/or voice recognition to complete this form, maybe a spelling option (for all other fields except the password field), that should increase the accessibility and usability of your website. The spelling option will assist these individuals in being able to ensure that the information provided is spelled correctly.As far as the usability of your form goes … it is best practice to ensure that specific directions for how to complete each field are provided within close proximity to the field. For instance, let’s say that one of the designated form fields asks for an e-mail address, to the right of the label for this field you could place in parentheses (example, domain@example.com). Having the instructions for completing each field adjacent to the form field or as close as possible to that field is important because screen readers are only capable of reading the item that has the keyboard focus at one time. If you put all instructions at the top of the form, screen reader users as well as individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities may have difficulty completing the form because they would have to keep referring to the top of the form for the instructions. Breaking them up and placing instructions adjacent to each field or as close as possible to that field decreases distractions and provides users an easier way to complete the form because they can read the instructions for each field, fill in each field, and go through the form in a linear fashion. 

 

I hope this is helpful and makes sense. I know I threw a lot of information at you here. If you are looking for someone to test your website with a screen reader and would like to go through this by phone together once it is completed let me know. I’d be glad to assist you.

175,"hi, retinitis pigmentosa here (meaning night vision goes first, then peripheral vision, then central, and I have issues with contrast and depth perception). I was registered as legally blind a couple of years ago but still have some central vision.

1. it takes a LOT longer to get around. most people assume I'm totally blind when they see my white cane out, but I can see, it just takes me longer to figure out where everything is. if I drop or misplace something, it takes more time to figure out where it went, because I just have a small patch of central vision. I've started corralling stuff around the house on trays because it makes it easier to find. 
2. been married/with the same person for a long time (23 years), and I'm still the same person. he's OK with it, and totally supportive—we're making adjustments along the way. he's learned not to steer me around, and that I'll ask for help if I need it. (one of the biggest pain in the ass things when you go blind, I've found, is people grabbing you or making assumptions about how much you can see. or YELLING REALLY LOUDLY because they assume you can't hear too.) as far as support from family, not so much -- my aunt apparently said ""well, I've never heard of that!"" when my mom told her I had RP, and as far as I know, she still doesn't think it's a real thing. my mom also seems kind of embarrassed when I whip out the cane sometimes.
3. RP is very slow and progresses over decades. so far, it hasn't really been a problem (again, because I still have central vision and work on computers all day), and most of my employers have been supportive when I've told them.  the only time it's been a problem is socially (like, if someone sticks their hand out for a handshake at work, or tries to give me something, I really can't see it.)
4. haven't learned Braille yet and won't for awhile, again because of the central vision. please don't assume that all blind people have the same amount of sight!
5. hard question to answer, because I'm always focused on what I CAN see, if that makes any sense, not what I can't. I guess if I had to answer, I'd say it's just black, like tunnel vision. I'm also getting cataracts in my central vision now, and those look like just blurry/dark patches. a lot of people with RP also see frequent flashes of light across their field of vision, which is no fun.

hope that helps!",,,,without_nap,,,1571497435,t5_2qpec,t3_djyfmy,t3_djyfmy,4,1579425451,0,0,f4am75m,Blind,,,,,

189,"&gt;1. How has the world changed for you? Obviously sight, one of the 5 senses is now impaired or removed. How has this changed the way you act or think?

It's changed in a lot of ways that, while each item may seem small, feel much more daunting when combined.  On top of that, there are a lot of people who try to *""help""* but more often than not: 1) make things worse, 2) unintentionally expose you to the chance of further injury/frustration, 3) set you up to be taken advantage of.  Many times, all it takes is one ""incident"" to set someone's independence back by months (possibly years).

&gt;2. If you had an SO when you went blind, how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

My mother was initially supportive, but the truth came out when she was frustrated/low on cigarettes.  ""You were supposed to be the one taking care of me!  Without me, they're gonna walk all over you if you don't stop them.  Grow a spine!""  My dad left when I was young, so he was never a part of it.  I only met him once since the vision loss and he kept himself detached, struggling to not talk about my disability.  My sister's been very supportive but I try my best to not be a burden since she already has two kids and multiple jobs.

&gt;3. If you were employed at work what happened? Was there a shift in the type of work you did? Did you get fired?

The vision loss started while I was in college, so I was referred to the State Department of Labor to rehabilitate my navigational difficulties on-site with a support specialist.  I also trained with multiple common software solutions for computer applications (ZoomText, JAWS, Narrator, later on being familiarized with text-to-speech functionality).  After about a month of ""re-orientation"", most of the work I did on-site was doable.  

&gt;4. Was it hard to learn Braille?

I'm not fluent in it, but my mobility teacher was more focused on learning necessary phrases and signage recognition.  I can't read a page of Braille but my odds of finding the correct bathroom or a fire exit are a lot better than they were at first.  

&gt;5. This is sort of a weird question and is personal, not school related, but what do you see? This always interested me. Is it black? Is there nothing?

There's no concrete diagnosis since it stemmed from a pre-natal developmental injury (umbilical cord around the neck, certain functions didn't develop properly but weren't found until after birth).  The state: 20/800 in one functioning eye, the opposite eye can sometimes perceive light, deuteranopia (a type of color blindness), my field of vision is \~15 degrees (normally 170), distance is &lt;1 meter.  Yet people claim I can't be blind because I can use a modded cellphone...  

What it looks like: imagine holding your hand behind your head.  What does the hand look like?  There's no darkness, there's no weird aura, just the visual equivalent of ""No Data Available"".  You may ""know"" it's there from a combination of object impermanence and secondary sensory input (rustling hairs, the sound of whooshing air, I dunno) but there's no visual identifier for ""hand"".

1. I never actually noticed my world change, as my sight disappeared so slowly. I can't remember having a full field of vision, but I know that my field of vision is very reduced. I guess once I found out, it made more sense why I kept missing things on the outside or walking into things. I am however scared of the future and how potentially losing another sense might affect me. 

2. I was single. I will say tho that the time I was being diagnosed and having all the tests was really stressful, and it affected my friendships. My mum went into attack mode almost immediately, trying to find ways around things and getting information out to relevant people (school). My siblings are still the same, maybe just slightly jealous bc I recieve benefits. The rest of my family are all still the same too, if not just a bit more thoughtful of where to put things, and telling me if there's an obstacle that I could fall over (e.g the other week my dad told me he'd left his muddy workboots outside the door so I didn't trip). My dad also adapted our house by painting the steps for me and putting a reflective strip on a door in my house that I always walk into. All in all, my family are very supportive.

3. I didn't have a job at the time, but when I went back to my seasonal summer job this summer, I made them aware of it, and they were okay with it. I didn't particularly need specific adaptations as I can get along fairly well. However I am glad they gave me shorter shifts than other people my age there. It would have killed me to do 8-10 hours 4/5 times a week.

4. I haven't learnt braille yet, I'll explain why in q5.  However I have learnt how to use a white cane.

5. RP is where you lose your peripheral vision very slowly, and it also affects your night vision. For me, I cannot see anything in the dark, so I prefer not to leave the house at night unless I'm with someone or have a very bright torch. In the parts of my vision that I've lost, it isn't black, I just see nothing. There's where I can see, and then if your hand/object goes out of that, it simply doesn't exist. It's nothing. However in my peripherals I still have some light perception, so if someone was to turn a overhead light on, I would perceive that there's a light been turned on. So far only my peripheral vision is affected, so I can actually see perfectly in my central vision with glasses, and even without them I can still see quite well, hence why I haven't started learning braille yet. I think my advisors are planning on starting that soon tho?

Hopefully this helps you, if you have any more questions feel free to ask them!",,,,jxssmarie,,,1571471909,t5_2qpec,t3_djyfmy,t3_djyfmy,5,1579406278,0,0,f49l65r,Blind,,,,,

Hello,

 

I am a visually impaired individual who utilizes a screen reader, JAWS in conjunction with a Refreshable Braille Display. As I believe another member stated, it sounds like you are reinventing the wheel here, and although you are running into glitches, your idea and creativity is sound. As an accessibility tester, I always tell people to keep the following in mind when creating accessible web content and fillable forms:

Since each screen reader is different, each screen reader has its own set of hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts that assist users with navigating through webpages, documents, and even forms. For this reason, it may be better and will take less time if you have users utilize the screen reader with which they are the most familiar. For screen reader users, familiarity is the key to getting things done efficiently – users having the knowledge that pressing the Tab Key on a QWERTY Keyboard for instance will move them from focusable item to focusable item (links, buttons, drop-down menus, groups of radio buttons, etc.). If you implement a new screen reader into your project, it will take users some time to become familiar with the way the specific screen reader works – the nuances so to speak. Does the screen reader read by character, word, paragraph, line etc.? Does it allow users to navigate from field to field within your form and from link to link on your website? How do users switch between scan, reading, and forms modes? These questions and the answers to them may be the reason the other individual is suggesting that users use the screen reader with which they are the most familiar.On your website, it is great that you are trying to get the screen reader to read the navigation links and information as part of your website. One suggestion I do have is that you can place a “Skip to main content” or a “Skip navigation” link immediately before the main content of your website begins. This saves blind and visually impaired users the step of having to read or listen to each link as it is presented on a webpage. This takes a great deal of time to listen to each link as it is read before getting to the main content on a website. The “Skip navigation” or “Skip to main content” link allows users to activate it, which in turn, should automatically move the focus directly to the beginning of the main content.Your choice to use radio buttons instead of drop-down select menus is a good one. Users can easily navigate to a group of radio buttons and use their Up and Down Arrow Keys to choose the radio button they would like, and select it easily using the Spacebar. In order to use drop-down select menus, you would need to be sure that the correct ARIA structure is used on the top item so it tells users to press the Down Arrow Key to open the menu and then use the Arrow Keys to choose the item they would like to select.When labelling form fields, whenever possible, make sure native HTML markup (e.g., &lt;button&gt;&gt;, &lt;a&gt; for link, &lt;select&gt; for drop-down menus, etc.). Screen readers can read these native elements and interpret them correctly for users. However, if you used a custom JavaScript or Widget to create the labels and fields within your form, you may need to test the tab order or focus order with a screen reader. One popular screen reader that is used by many blind, deafblind, and visually impaired individuals is NVDA. This software is a free screen reader that can be downloaded from the NVAccess.org website. 

 

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any additional questions or I can be of any further assistance, let me know; I am happy to help.",,,,seperath,,,1571248520,t5_2qpec,t3_diqji4,t3_diqji4,2,1579205762,0,0,f3y4li6,Blind,,,,"This is from my wife...

Yo, late to the party, sorry op.
I'm 24 this month.
I sustained my retinal detachment maybe almost a year ago. I was at a practice for a boffer sport/LARP called dagorhir. Me and a friend were sparing and I caught the brunt of a missed slash with my eye(silly me for not wearing a helmet). I felt what I could remember at a sharp stab and then a full ache that soon faded. I remember feeling like something was swaying past my vision like hair or something but couldn't figure it out.

Later I first started noticing floaters in my left eye that weren't there before(vitreous detachment).

I was living in on my own and money was tight. I just shrugged it off, for like 6 months, until my next eye exam when money was less tight. I had 2 surgeries(a partial buckle and eventually a pneumatic retinaplexi) and some laser. I'm fairly lucky I'd say.  I lost vision in the upper right periphery of my left eye, not a ton, and my right eye picked up the slack. This is partly why I waited so long, I didn't even notice the vision loss until the vitreous detachment progressed a bit more and made the floaters more visible.

It's been a very scary time for me the last few months and I hardly lost much vision, so I can only imagine what it's been like for you.

I know in my case it's also been difficult talking to people about it. I feel like alot of people are very squeemish about eye inju

328,"wow, thanks a lot for the complete response, I really appreciate it!

  
my portal does not read letter by letter, only page content (words) and phrases that I create - basically combining some small content on the screen to feel more dynamic. Would you say that a spelling option is needed/good? I thought of it on the password field, for example, but it did not feel very good so I removed it...

and yes, the user can navigate using the TAB key or by using voice commands! for example, if they are in the courses tab and I say that the is a course on Programming, if they say they want to go to programming, I'll redirect to it!

as for the skip to main content, I have that implemented in a way, when the user clicks a link in the navbar, the content that changes on the screen is focused, that way, the user does not have to go through the whole navbar to access the content. Would you say that a command to go back to the navbar is useful? (considering that if they say which navbar item they want to go, I'll also click there and redirect)

I'm glad to hear that I made a good choice on the radio button! And I'll definitely use NVDA to see how it handles forms, thanks for the recommendation!

as for my form, it's for the students to fill a resume. Is explaining what it is and the respective fields (instead of just reading the label) useful? And is an instant feedback and clean function of the field good as well? Should I read the whole form after submitting?

332,"If you have white glue (like Elmer's glue) and a paintbrush around, you can paint the skin around your nails with glue. make sure to wipe it off your actual nails, then let it dry on your skin. Then, paint your nails with nail polish. Once the polish is dry, you should be able to peel the glue off of your fingers, and this will take with it any polish that got on to the skin around your nails - an annoying problem for everyone!

General polish tips: always do two coats, and let the first coat dry for at least a few minutes before you put on the second coat. Single coats are almost always patchy and see through in spots. Also, shake your polish bottle gently before applying. If you shake it vigorously, you might get air bubble in your polish.

333,"For context, my case is a bit unusual. I lost ¼ of my visual field from brain surgery as a very young adult, then as a proper adult (who still doesn’t feel like one :-) ) began to have trouble processing visual information. The processing issue became progressively worse but I kept adapting and remained completely independent and able to work. A couple years ago my ability to process visual information quickly and severely declined. Since it was likely due to brain damage caused by constant seizure activity, my docs insisted on more brain surgery, but unfortunately that only made things worse. I now have no vision on one side (both eyes) and on the other side my brain struggles to make sense of the visual input and is completely overwhelmed by it. My response to your questions will refer to my current situation.  

1. It sucks. I am learning but still extremely dependent on others, which has created quite the identity crisis. I can’t do any of my favorite activities because they are very visually intensive and involve heights. I’m forced to sit in the dark listening to podcasts most of the time, which has become very boring. At moments when I have the energy I take full advantage and try to learn and practice techniques that will give me some independence. The things that I am able to do by myself take 10 times as long as they used to and are exhausting. Even the simplest things require concentration. 

2. My SO has been with me through the rapid decline and the most recent surgery and has been unbelievably generous with his time and effort taking care of me. I am gradually adjusting to the idea that I really do NEED help and to some degree always will.  

3. My job refused to make suitable accommodations that would enable me to continue to work, and they forced me into an indefinite unpaid disability leave. I never heard from them again and eventually resigned when my surgery was planned. So yes I was fired, but in such a way that they could avoid a serious lawsuit. It was especially nasty since I had relocated from another country 8000 miles away to take the job. Now post-surgery I am trying to learn skills that will allow me to work again, though it is unlikely I’ll be able to do the same type of work...

4. I’ve had all kinds of rehab and vocational training with agencies for the blind in both the SF Bay Area and NYC, and no one has ever suggested that I learn Braille (even though I can’t read, aside from a few words with great strain). Everything is focused on tech instead these days.

However, since my most recent surgery I also see little sparkles where my central field should be. It’s like the vision equivalent of a phantom limb, and it’s extremely intrusive and hard to ignore.",,,,DoctorDubz,hemianopsia and functional vision loss,,1571538150,t5_2qpec,t3_djyfmy,t3_djyfmy,2,1579470421,0,0,f4d563g,Blind,,,blue1,"For context, my case is a bit unusual. I lost ¼ of my visual field from brain surgery as a very young adult, then as a proper adult (who still doesn’t feel like one :-) ) began to have trouble processing visual information. The processing issue became progressively worse but I kept adapting and remained completely independent and able to work. A couple years ago my ability to process visual information quickly and severely declined. Since it was likely due to brain damage caused by constant seizure activity, my docs insisted on more brain surgery, but unfortunately that only made things worse. I now have no vision on one side (both eyes) and on the other side my brain struggles to make sense of the visual input and is completely overwhelmed by it. My response to your questions will refer to my current situation.  

1. It sucks. I am learning but still extremely dependent on others, which has created quite the identity crisis. I can’t do any of my favorite activities because they are very visually intensive and involve heights. I’m forced to sit in the dark listening to podcasts most of the time, which has become very boring. At moments when I have the energy I take full advantage and try to learn and practice techniques that will give me some independence. The things that I am able to do by myself take 10 times as long as they used to and are exhausting. Even the simplest things require concentration. 

2. My SO has been with me through the rapid decline and the most recent surgery and has been unbelievably generous with his time and effort taking care of me. I am gradually adjusting to the idea that I really do NEED help and to some degree always will.  

3. My job refused to make suitable accommodations that would enable me to continue to work, and they forced me into an indefinite unpaid disability leave. I never heard from them again and eventually resigned when my surgery was planned. So yes I was fired, but in such a way that they could avoid a serious lawsuit. It was especially nasty since I had relocated from another country 8000 miles away to take the job. Now post-surgery I am trying to learn skills that will allow me to work again, though it is unlikely I’ll be able to do the same type of work...

4. I’ve had all kinds of rehab and vocational training with agencies for the blind in both <LOCATION> and <LOCATION>, and no one has ever suggested that I learn Braille (even though I can’t read, aside from a few words with great strain). Everything is focused on tech instead these days.

340,"hi there! I am one of those, who can type with Dirrect touch typing pretty well. I got used to it pretty quickly. What I did was learned where the keys are on screen and size in between those. I knew computer keyboard very well at the time I first used IOS. That was usefull, because I already knew which keys were next to which. Then that just goes to touch screen with certain differences, such as there's no tab key or caps lock, which means that q and a are moved to the most left side of the screen. g h, t y and bn are always in the center, positioned vertically, like on normal qwerty keyboards. One difference is that p and l are on the most right side of the screen. Next thing is to remember the size between those letters. Later on, you'll get really used to it and your accuracy will be improved. If you do 90% of the time, that's considered to be good, because sighted people are also making mistakes while they tipe as well, so it's not a big deal if you make mistakes.

1. Forcing a rhythm. Go to bed and get out of bed at certain times and stay awake during the day. You might need alarms to remind you. After a week to a month, your body will get used to this (more). Before that, it may feel very tiring.
2. Meditation may help with relaxing and with accepting the time you're in bed but unable to sleep. That way you can relax those hours.
3. Melatonin. Although freely available in many countries, I'd advise you to discuss this with your doctor. If it doesn't help, he/she might want to start you on stronger medication.

In regards to your best friend, they probably found out a lot of information about your disability indirectly through spending time with you which eliminates the need to ask direct questions about them. This should be the same for your exes. 

It’s different for a dating event. I feel that asking questions directly about your disability is appropriate in this situation. The purpose of these events are to find someone to go on future dates with and maybe even start a serious relationship. If I were a sighted person who came across a visually impaired person at a dating event, (I’m legally blind btw)  I would want to ask direct questions about that visually impaired person’s disability so I could figure out how that would impact a potential future relationship. Asking questions also helps appropriately respect and accommodate this visually impaired person on any future ventures we have together.

You will need to hold it still for a long time, either from an L-stand or Junbi, and then attempt to execute the exact same block again without moving anywhere including intermediate hand positions.

The half joke regarding your wife is so incredibly sexist, I’m surprise you’re not filing a lawsuit against the both of them for their behavior. So inappropriate, it’s not funny. As for the touchscreen stove, the closest I have come to that experience is at a former friends house. The landlord renovated all the apartments and installed new stoves with glass cooking services and touch controls. I pointed out to my former friend that this would be an issue if I was staying over at their place, and they were not available to assist me. Well, since they are now a former friend, this is no longer an issue. I hate when sighted people automatically assume that blind people have an easy time of picking up new information as quickly as a sighted person does. We know this is not the case, at least not always. One lesson I have learned from imperfect interactions with sighted people is this, record everything! A simple audio recording goes a long way to straighten out a misunderstanding, especially when it involves crude sexist remarks like the one directed toward you regarding your wife.",,,,Enigmus7612,Living with Retinitis Pigmentosa since birth,,1570935513,t5_2qpec,t3_dh4prd,t3_dh4prd,3,1578927740,0,0,f3ie92u,Blind,,,blue1,,

**KEY POINTS**

 The Supreme Court denied a petition from pizza giant Domino’s on Monday to hear whether its website is required to be accessible to the disabled, leaving in place a lower court decision against the company.

The case was originally brought by a blind man named Guillermo Robles, who sued the pizza chain after he was unable to order food on Domino’s website and mobile app despite using screen-reading software.

The decision not to grant the case is a loss for the company and a win for disability advocates, who have argued that, if businesses do not have to maintain accessible sites, disabled people could be effectively shut out of substantial portions of the economy.

* Attorneys for Robles argued in court papers that the Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with physical locations to make their websites and other online platforms accessible to those with disabilities.
* A      panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Robles, writing      that the “alleged inaccessibility of Domino’s website and app impedes      access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchises—which      are places of public accommodation.”
* Domino’s urged the Supreme Court to review the decision. By declining to do so, the court’s decision on Monday will leave the ruling in place, meaning      Domino’s will have to fight Robles’s accessibility claims in court.
* Attorneys for Domino’s, backed by a range of business groups, had argued that the      ADA does not apply to online platforms that were not envisioned when the law was passed in 1990. And, they said, no clear rules exist for how to make their platforms properly accessible.

476,"Hi. And thanks for your concerns. I will explain the reasons.

1- We are not asking to work for free. We are asking about ideas. An idea needs to be implemented and that takes a lot of effort.

2- You are not forced to participate. But many people sent us emails offering their help and this competition is a way to reach for fellows. Some people just like to co-operate.  We ask for help and they respond positively. That is one of the good things of this community. With the help of those friends we can continue doing audiogames. With the negativity of others, we might turn other direction and never be back.

3- Do you think we will get millionaire doing AudioGames? I'm struggling to pay the salaries of the people we have now, and two weeks ago I could not pay the small room I rent for them. I will never get the investment back, even though we are trying so hard. I'm not going to tell here how much it has cost to do the game and how much we got from sells. But relationship is now 1/10. So we still have a way to go.

4- In AudioWizards all the music was composed by blind musicians from all around the world. They got paid with 150 €. They got their money before the game was launch. I haven't seen no money yet and I have work selflessly for weeks.

5- I can't afford to contract you if you are not a programmer living in Finland. Experience on C# required. We have open two times a working application for a blind programmer in Finland. Nobody applied.  

6- I'm working full time in University as teacher and researcher, and I don't do this for the money. This company, myTrueSound, is let's say my hobby, where I spend my money and my time in doing something I think it needs to be done. I believe in accessibility and the universal right for everybody to play nice games and have fun time. Is anyone against that?

7- The game is being translated to Spanish now by blind fellows. They get paid for their work. We are looking for a voice actor, also from the blind community, who will get paid with 300 €. More than that we can't offer at this moment, because my bank account is empty. Should I stop because people think is unfair I look for help. No, absolutely not, at least not yet.

489,"I've been vaping for about 4 years. There are plenty of vapes across all the feature sets that have vibration or audible feedback. I've tried the Crafty, the Firewood 4 and the Pax 3 that all had vibration. I've also used vapes that don't, and some work better than others. It really depends what kind of vape you're looking for. 
A good place to do some research is the F***Combustion forum. I don't think I can post the link but it's pretty easy to find. Convection vs conduction vs hybrid heating, time it takes to hit temperature, bowl size, battery life vs charge time or replacement, USB C, Micro USB or custom chargers etc.  are all things to consider. It can get pretty intense. There are also vapes that you can attach to an ECig type mod, but that does tend to get a little complicated and requires caution, though there are a few complete configured kits around.

509,"Hi there :)

This is my first post but I wanted to reply to you because what you wrote really strikes a chord with me. My partner posts here and told me about your post. Her name on here is Sadie Ragbaby. I have 20/80 vision in both eyes and am completely blind in dim light (nyctalopia). I was also born 3 months early, as was my partner. It's one of many weird coincidences we share. I totally know what you mean about not being able to read signs and find your way places on your own. Between my vision and agnosia (lack of ability to recognise things due to brain injury) I find getting around and doing simple things like grocery shopping or even getting to the shop in the first place gives me really bad anxiety. I also suffer from major depression. I try to keep a brave face and not complain because Sadie's vision is a lot worse than mine and I should be more grateful for what I have. She only has light perception and life is very difficult for her. It's not easy always being brave though.

I use the magnifier and zoom on my phone and computer too. What phone do you have and are you a Mac or PC person? Apple have really great accessibility features in my opinion. I used to jokingly laugh at Sadie for using an iphone but now she laughs at me because I have more Apple devices than her :P

Last Tuesday I had an appointment with a mobility instructor from Vision Australia and we went to the supermarket to try a monocular for reading the signs in the shop. I could read them if I found them in the first place but trying to find the signs with it made me feel seasick. Usually I use apps on my phone like Seeing AI for signs and text and Blindsquare for getting around outside. Blindsquare speaks what intersections I'm approaching and what businesses are around how far away my destination is in what direction etc.

It's amazing how many things people just don't even think about in daily life that are very hard for those of us with disabilities. Even movies suck for me because with vision impairment and agnosia I don't recognise the characters unless they have very distinctive features like a hair colour that stands out and have to keep asking whoever I'm with who's this who's that. It gets annoying for people so nobody wants to do things with me other than Sadie who understands.

It gets embarrassing too. On Monday I walked from the kitchen to the lounge with a bowl of porridge (oatmeal) and cherries. I didn't gage where the table was correctly and ended up dropping it upside down all over the carpet in front of my home care worker. I do stuff like that all the time and I hate it.

I don't work. I'm in a wheelchair most of the time because of a car accident and I have to wear a machine to breathe because of severe respiratory issues. Being in a wheelchair with a cane is challenging.

I'm on social security for disability too. I don't have any great suggestions for you to make life meaningful as most of the time I wonder the same thing. I have hobbies like playing and composing music and I am trying to learn to draw but depression and anxiety make it hard to get into anything. I have a magnifying lamp which is great for stuff like craft and drawing but it's not portable so I can't use it in the lounge where I spend most of my time. Sadie and I are going to look at the Vision Australia store to see if there are any decent portable ones.

Anyway sorry for the essay. I just wanted to write to you because all of what you said is so familiar to me. If you ever want to chat you are welcome to message me. Same goes for my partner. We both don't have anyone other than each other who gets what it's like.",,,,skittykittenz,,,1570976072,t5_2qpec,t3_dh7kqq,t3_dh7kqq,2,1578982990,0,0,f3lhk0n,Blind,,,,"Hi there :)

535,"Hello! There have been very good comments about that, such as using a balls when eating a food. For beginners it's a bit tricky to get used to it and don't get things out of the plate. Finger food is also the best and I also liked an idea about the messy food stuff. In that way you can tell to him that everyone looks like hat now and not only you, and that's the normal thing. kalmaries shouldd be good as well, french fries, pizza, sandwitches, Hotdogs, nuggets, sausages and similar. Half opened doors are the hell! Besides, if you change something in your environment, inform him about the change as soon as possible, so he can react on it adequately. Also, please keep in mind, that when talking to him, first call him and then tell whatever you want so he knows that someone is talking to him. That is necessary unless the context implies otherwise, for instance if he asked a question and someone answers that question. In that case he most probably will catch up just fine. If some important things happen, briefly describe what happend. For instance I had a situation, when person came up and he did some strange action, that everyone around the table started laughing. Now, since I'm the blind from mu childhood, I could quickly sense that it was related to that person's movement so I could ask correct questions to get correct answers. Now, in your case, just describe that action and he should quickly catch up on the same page as other members.

571,"There's nothing like you're probably dreaming of, yet. Single-line displays have 8 dots per cell and up to 80 cells wide, and cost anywhere from $500 for the cheapest 20-cell display to $10,000 for the most expensive 80-cell display.

Given those prices, multi-line displays have to make compromises.

The Bristol Braille Canute is probably the closest thing to a multi-line display that actually works, is actually for sale, and really has multiple lines. Maybe that's the one you saw, it's 9 lines of 40 cells, with 6 dots per cell. Do you realize just how ridiculously large that is, though? 9 lines of braille makes for a pretty large device already. If you wanted 25 lines it literally wouldn't fit on your desk.

Anyway, the main tradeoff the Canute besides 6 dots is that it's slow to refresh. You can't use it for real-time text editing really, it's good for reading books. The price is good for how many cells you get though, under $2000.

DOT Inc is working on a tablet, I saw a demo at CSUN. Definitely not finished and not ready to buy, and it's not clear what sort of software it will have.

The Graphiti is interesting, it's a 2-D grid of dots that can be used to make shapes and images. Pretty cool and comes with some nice software, but the dots aren't small enough to make actual braille.

572,"Thank you for the clear levels of dedication and consideration you are putting into this project. There are some best practices around a visual description, which can serve as a good starting point. Discussing a photographs contents really depends on the photo itself. Different visitation patterns, like clockwise or quadrant-based or linear, can be used to help the person who can’t see the photo to build a mental model in which you can fill in all of the details you are speaking about. I’ve done a considerable amount of work in the space, and we regularly hold visual description workshops for people in the culture sector, especially museums. Happy to share specific tips and resources. Does your project allow for tactile reproductions? When coupled with guided tactile descriptions and visual descriptions, they can be a wonderful multi modal way of conveying visual information. This is the approach we took with the Andy Warhol Museum and the Canadian Museum For Human Rights, the latter of which actually has had multiple exhibits, traveling ones, consisting of lots of photographs. We’ve also found that making sure the description is able to be accessed both as a recording as well as programmatically, helps a whole lot. Someone like myself who prefers very rapid speech can easily read a 350 word description in 15 to 20 seconds, but someone else may prefer to listen to that 350 word description over the course of two minutes as a pleasant voice Recording. At the end of the day, this is about returning agency to the visitor, and there are some inexpensive ways of doing that as well as higher quality ways if you’ve got some budget for things like reproductions. Art Beyond Sight has some guidelines that we like to start with Wynn showing people how to do visual descriptions. There is good advice in those like how to use metaphor appropriately when discussing differences in colors.

Happy to share specific tips and resources. Does your project allow for tactile reproductions? When coupled with guided tactile descriptions and visual descriptions, they can be a wonderful multi modal way of conveying visual information. This is the approach we took with the Andy Warhol Museum and the Canadian Museum For Human Rights, the latter of which actually has had multiple exhibits, traveling ones, consisting of lots of photographs. We’ve also found that making sure the description is able to be accessed both as a recording as well as programmatically, helps a whole lot. Someone like myself who prefers very rapid speech can easily read a 350 word description in 15 to 20 seconds, but someone else may prefer to listen to that 350 word description over the course of two minutes as a pleasant voice Recording. At the end of the day, this is about returning agency to the visitor, and there are some inexpensive ways of doing that as well as higher quality ways if you’ve got some budget for things like reproductions. <PERSON> has some guidelines that we like to start with <PERSON> showing people how to do visual descriptions. There is good advice in those like how to use metaphor appropriately when discussing differences in colors.

I always thought the grey ones were best for me because they seem to block the most light, but it turns out that I do better with the brown ones as they are better at filtering out light scatter.



If you don't need prescription glasses, you don't need anything expensive, so you could get a few cheap pairs and see what works for you.  If you do need prescription, it's a bit more involved.  You can get surrounds that go on over your glasses and wrap around the sides to block light from all angles or prescription sports goggles.  I get a brand called Clips that are prescription lenses that come with a clip on sunglasses.  I find that this is less expensive than purchasing a separate pair of prescription sunglasses.  



When I was younger, I was made to wear transition lenses, which are supposed to get lighter indoors and darker outdoors.  I did not find these to be a good solution.

594,"As another introvert and someone who has had intense social anxiety:

I agree the part where people hear you explain your problems and then they seemingly seem to forget them the next second is the worst. I'm not blind but I do stick out, got several disorders as they are called.

I am thinking, perhaps we need more education around this. Classes in school, Emotional Intelligence is one thing I am pondering. EQ. It would help people understand others more and perhaps if they imagined themself in your shoes they would remember that you will be ""looking"" at their ear without them looking over their shoulder.

Stress fucking sucks. We all have it but you who are visually impaired must have it even more, I am trying, but I can't imagine how it is like properly.

I'm sorry that you have had such negative experiences with people.. I'm sure most of them don't mean any harm but they just don't have the same awareness. This notion has relieved some of my social anxiety coupled with other strategies. Also knowing that you are not alone. Even sighted people experience shitty social anxiety too.

Haha yes, wanting to hide in the shadows, preferably in my room but somehow always sticking out, in the spotlight.

613,"You have two options. You can use direct typing the way I did (see below), or you can try out FlickType.

The way I learned direct touch typing was with a lot of preparation. Before iOS 8 when it was added, I used touch typing for 4 years and never let myself make a mistake or drag my finger to find a letter. If I mistyped a letter in a word, I deleted the whole word and started over. It was hellishly frustrating, but I could almost immediately type with direct touch and not make any errors that autocorrect wouldn't fix. After a while, touch typing just felt slow and restrictive. I did have a Speed Dots protector on my phone for about six months, so that might have also helped me learn the positions of the keys a bit better. As far as I know, you can still get one.

FlickType is the lazy option, but it is very good and much more forgiving.

700,"Had dogs all my life. Legally blind, worked in shelters and been the primary owner of two myself.

General advice for all prospective dog owners:

1. Make sure everyone in the household is fully on board with the whole thing, and understands the responsibilities.

2. Make sure your living situation and income is stable. A dog is a 10-15+ year commitment. Can you provide a safe and appropriate home for them? Can you cover any and all vet bills?

3. Educate yourself about different breeds and different temperaments. Remember that breed isn't always the deciding factor in temperament.

4. Think about training, grooming and exercise requirements. How much hair can you tolerate? What about barking or drooling?

5. How experienced is the primary carer? How good are they at training?

6. Looks should not be the deciding factor in which breed you choose for any reason ever. That path holds only misery for you and the poor pet you've chosen.

7. When it comes time, make sure to obtain your new family member ethically. A shelter dog isn't the best idea if you're inexperienced, so go for a registered breeder. Yes, you'll pay more than a backyard breeder, but you're paying for healthier breeding practices and a happier pup. A breeder should be registered with your state/province breed club and be able to show you the parents and living conditions at their operation. They should also screen every breeding dog for health conditions common in the breed, such as hip/elbow dysplasia.

8. Prepare your home before bringing the pup back and introduce them to a single room so as not to overwhelm them. Decide right away what is and isn't acceptable behaviour and enforce that consistently. Can your pup be on the couch? If you don't want them doing something as an adult, don't let them do it as a puppy.

9. Get yourself a puppy training guide or attend lessons, even if you're confident. It's good socialising for pup. Aim for positive reinforcement training with no yelling, hitting, yanking of collar/lead, etc. Also shock, choke and prong collars are cruel and ineffective over the long term.

10. Just like a child, get into a steady routine with your pup. They want structure and predictability. They want boundaries and to be the bestest Boi. A well mannered dog is a happy dog because you know you can take him fun places because you know he'll behave.

Advice specific to dogs in VI/blind households: from my own experience I've never had any issues. Smaller dogs may pose a safety risk if they get underfoot but you can train them to stay out of your way when it matters. 'Go to bed' is an all-around amazing command to have up your sleeve.

As for breeds, if you can put in the necessary exercise to keep them happy, Labradors are always a favourite. They need early bite inhibition and socialisation but are very easy to train, easy to groom and generally have a sweet nature.

If exercise is a concern and size isn't, you might consider a Mastiff. They're big goofy couch potatoes who love to snuggle and stand on your feet. They do tend to break the bank with feeding costs but can live just about anywhere.

Certain breeds of spaniels are good companions. They need exercise but won't exhaust you. They can be difficult to train and may have strong prey drive. They tend to be single-minded when they get an idea.

If smaller dogs are your style a Bichon is a good pick, they're one of the calmer toy dogs and quite easy to care for. They do bark a lot though.

If everyone gets involved with and remains consistent with training, most dogs will make a great pet.",,,,Sarinon,,,1571032026,t5_2qpec,t3_dhlfmf,t3_dhlfmf,5,1579044812,0,0,f3ox2pr,Blind,,,,,
701,"Hi Hailee! Thanks for sharing a bit about yourself. I've found the community here at r/blind really supportive and insightful and I hope you will too.

I think a lot of us can relate to the feelings you're expressing here. We fight so hard just to do half as well as any sighted person and no one else really knows how much of a toll that takes on us. It can be frustrating to see others execute something with perfect ease while we struggle.

But I think that's sort of the point, really. Life is all about struggle, and everyone struggles with something whether we see it or not. Comparing yourself to others by any metric is an exercise in futility; either you come off better and have an undeserved sense of ego, or you come off worse and feel shitty about yourself.

The trick is to compare yourself to yourself, and not others. What have you done that you're proud of? What can you do now that you couldn't before? How have you improved?

And I'm not just talking about O&amp;M and life skills, how have you become a better person? What valuable life lessons have you learned and applied to yourself?

These are the metrics by which you can judge yourself.

Also, what resources are there for you in your area? Do you have a disability service provider that you could do some O&amp;M training with? It sounds like maybe you could use a bit of a confidence boost, and they're pretty good at giving you the skills to feel safe and secure getting out and about.

They might also be able to help you with employment, or studying for a career path. Blind/VI people are having more and more success finding work, especially in tech-based industries where the playing field evens up a little. Larger companies are generally more willing to hire, and might even have diversity policies.

I know how rough it can get sometimes. But you can either be a victim of circumstance, or you can become an agent of positive change in your own life. You can take back control, explore, expand, and overcome. It's scary, but it's worth it.

As to locking, you do this with a three-finger swipe down. Get to the orientation you like, and perform that gesture to always have BSI stay in that orientation.

1. How has the world changed for you? Obviously sight, one of the 5 senses is now impaired or removed. How has this changed the way you act or think?

Main change for me was sport , at 12 when I was blinded, I was a soccer nerd and this stopped for a few years until I got into blind soccer.  I was a very outward gregarious child and was heading for class president type roles.  Since then I’m much more in my own head and a very deep thinker. I recovered some of my gregariousness in late teens and now I’m a lecturer so spend a lot of time on my feet talking. 

2. If you had an S/O when you went blind how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

I was 12 but had gf who didn’t dump me for ages even though she wanted too.  Mom died in accident on same day so family rallied round in grief.  My sibs are amazing and all adapted quickly to being my eyes.

737,"&gt; How did you go blind?

I lost my sight after almost 32 years fighting a congenital glaucoma.

&gt; If you could see for one day what would you do?

Probably nothing, one day is not enough to accomplish what I want, and I don't really miss vision, only the functionality that comes with it.

Before going blind I was a software developer with experience in network services and operating system kernels, two things that regular users don't see.  When I started losing my sight I quit my job in order to investigate what was wrong, but because I couldn't stop learning I decided to focus into desktop and mobile development, particularly for game development, however despite gaining the knowledge I never had the opportunity to do anything with it since I ended up going fully blind, and because of that I feel rather unaccomplished.

743,"&gt; How has the world changed for you? Obviously sight, one of the 5 senses is now impaired or removed.

It's certainly a lot more challenging, requiring lots of energy-draining strategies and planning for even the most mundane of tasks without exception since blindness affects everything across the board.  As a result of this I choose to do nothing, and because of that my life has become extremely boring and dull, a limbo where nothing of interesting ever happens.

&gt; If you had an S/O when you went blind how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

I didn't have a significant other, so that part of the question doesn't apply to me.  Regarding my family they were and still are extremely supporting, too much in my opinion, to the point that they don't even let me do anything alone because they fear that I may get hurt, robbed, scammed, or somehow taken advantage of.

&gt; If you were employed at work what happened? Was their a shift in the type of work you did? Did you get fired?

I quit my job as an IT consultant at the first sign something was wrong with my vision.  At the time I intended to have whatever was wrong fixed and then return to work, but things didn't progress the way I wanted and I ended up going completely blind.

&gt; Was it hard to learn Braille?

I struggle a lot with Braille, not because I have trouble decoding it but rather because I have trouble sensing it.

&gt; This is sort of a weird question and is personal, not school related, but what do you see?

My left field of view sees whatever my brain thinks the world looks like from my perspective, giving me the impression that I'm actually seeing things when I'm in a familiar place, but I know I'm not because it's completely inaccurate when I'm in unfamiliar places.

746,"Well, when I was younger, no one listened to me. Everyone thought THEY knew how my vision was, and I didn’t. So listening to them, and allowing them to have a say is very important. Not punishing them is also a very good idea. I didn’t want to wear glasses, so instead of consoling me, my parents took my toys, and my teachers yelled at me until I did. To this day, I have a very hard time communicating with people about my disability, because I’m terrified they’ll punish me for it. I would also suggest introducing them to role models who are visually impaired as well. I’m sure there are children’s books out there on this subject, and I think I would have benefitted a lot from this. It took me a long time to figure out that it wasn’t just me. Being honest is another tip. This is more for parents, but I think teachers/employers/mentors could do this as well. Evolve them in planning and accommodating for their disability. Work with them, not above the,. Of course, this would probably by more appropriate for older children, but it is still important. 

You might think this has a lot to do with the learning process, but school is pretty much the entire life of a child. School is where everything happens for them, and it’s a very important place. Enfolding them with their opinions and their wants, gives them the knowledge that they actually DO have a choice. This will give those kids so much confidence, and will teach them how to advocate for themselves when they need it. Confidence is a very important part of being independent. They can have the skills, but they need to know they can USE the skills. 

Being independent isn’t just about tools and technology. Building the motivation, and the belief that they CAN be independent is just as important. 

This is a very good question to be asking, because I really do believe a lot of teachers and parents have no idea what they’re doing. How you treat a child with a disability impacts them for the rest of their life, so it’s great that someone is trying to make a difference for the better.",,,,K-R-Rose,,,1571693725,t5_2qpec,t3_dkucki,t3_dkucki,2,1579665966,0,0,f4nw8x2,Blind,,,,,

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been late for work because of dog rejections and I do mor than most handlers when it comes to preventing leaving hair behind. Be ready for people to not like your dog. The good thing is you can take it pretty much anywhere you want. The bad news is that some people you run into will not like your dog and you will never know why. Vet care, food, toys, grooming, it can all get very expensive. Some vet hospitals will not charge for care of a service dog but only a very small number of them. Of course with a cane you don’t need to worry about any of these things.

778,"This seems like you're putting in serious thought and care on this issue. I'll give you my take, with the caveat that I'm not speaking for everyone in the community.

Often when people write alt text they have a hyperfocus on objects and their spatial relationships. Your example with the broom is pretty representative of this. What's better is to go up one level of abstraction and think more about the purpose of why you're sharing or exhibiting the photograph.

Less useful: A photo of a smiling older woman wearing a pointy hat sitting at a table. There are candles on the cake, which are lit. There is a cat sitting on a windowsill in the background.
More useful: My grandmother's birthday party. She's about to blow out the cake, and we're all smiling.

If there is a person in a blue dress in your photo, you don't need to say the dress is blue unless it's salient to why you're sharing the photo or unless you anticipate a specific use case for the photo that requires that information.

If you want blind people to be able to participate in your exhibit—appreciated—I'd recommend going the narrative text route that you laid out. Articulate the meaning, purpose, and importance of what you see, rather than the minutiae. I wouldn't write reams of text—a picture might be worth a thousand words, but a blind person isn't going to read a thousand wrds for every photo. Fundamentally, a photo is a sighted medium, so there's some extent to which you'll be leaving blind people out by the exhibit. That's largely OK, your responsibility (moral if not legal) is to provide reasonable accommodations, and that mean the experience isn't 100% translated into an accessible format.

One big issue is that people don't like to talk about it, because they don't want others to think they are crazy, so they hide it. Other times, the client may not realize something is an issue (mild cognitive impairment or dementia or memory loss), which may not be immediately noticeable but problematic later. For example, I taught someone how to cross the street using an APS (Audible Pedestrian signal), and explained how it worked and what the signals meant. The next time I met with someone, they attempted to cross when the signal had traffic in front of them going, and I had to intercede. When asked why she did that, she said that is when I told her to cross (when I didn't). She definitely had memory problems, but she didn't realize it.

There are two other techniques. One is putting the nail polish in the refrigerator. That way, when applying it, you can feel where it is going from the colder temperature.

Another technique to help keep it a bit cleaner is getting some Vaseline and putting in on the skin around the nail (but not on the nail itself).

876,"Yes, we have had this problem but have been fortunate enough to have it partly fixed.

We moved into a newly built house on an estate where the kitchens all had induction hobs with touch controls. The oven had rotary dials with very limited feedback as to their position.

Induction hobs are good because they are more energy efficient than other electric hobs. The problem is that they almost universally come with touch controls with only visual affordances (things that help you use it) and visual feedback (things that tell you what effect you have had.)

Before we moved in to our new house we were able to arrange to have a different model of induction stove top installed which featured rotary controls with very good tactile feedback.

The rotary control knobs are shaped so the direction they point in is very obvious from the feel of them. The controls have a resistance and ""notch"" that you feel when turning a hob element on. To turn a hob on you have to push against the resistance and cross the notch after which the resistance drops suddenly which means the hob is switched on. The stove beeps when the first hob is switched on. The rotation of the knob is proportional to the power output of the hob, 90 degrees is about 33% power, 180 degrees is about 66% power. 

Turning the controls as far as they turn to push against another spring resistance gives another beep and activates a boost feature to rapidly bring a pan to the boil. 

Turn the controls anticlockwise from the off position until the stove beeps and red indicator flashes, this activates another feature of the stove which runs the element at high power until the pan gets hot at which point the element turns down to the heat setting you selected.

The controls are also positioned across the front of the stove (not the side as is common) so you don't have to reach across the hot parts of the stove to access the controls.

The stove has, just above the control knobs, bright red illuminated (LED) digits in a 2 x 2 grid mimicking the layout of the hobs. They turn on to indicate the power setting of each hob or if the are still hot. They will also flash if there is no pan on the associated hob element. They are big enough and bright enough to be helpful to a cook with at least some sight. 

I've gone into all this detail so that you may better understand what you can expect to get from a well designed stove top that also happens to be accessible without relying on perfect vision.

880,"Being described as blind can mean some sight loss, major sight loss or complete sight loss. How much sight loss you have makes a big difference to how you live.

It is useful to think that a lot of problems disabled people have is because everyone else take the easy route of making things work best for themselves, the able bodied people. It can take just a few reasonable adjustments to make things work better for disable people.

A simple example of this would be to install ramps and lifts in buildings so people in wheelchairs can get in and out and around them. For blind people the adjustments might be to put braille information around a building or use big high contrast signs that can be read by people with some sight.

Modern technology has made a big difference for blind people. Software called screen readers will speak out loud the words and controls on a computer screen. This sometimes allows blind people to do the same jobs as sighted people. Applications on mobile phones can help you navigate your way around outside. They can also help you read text or even describe what the camera can see. 

Getting a job is important for blind people as it is for everyone else because the money you earn lets you care for your family and any left over lets you have fun. Some blind people with jobs have a sighted assistant who helps them when technology can't. The assistant might help guide the blind person to meetings and tell them who is in the room. In this case the blind person might be a senior manager or other well paid worker.

Is it ""disgusting"" that Microsoft charges for Windows, or that iPhones cost more than Samsung's flagship phone? Is it ""disgusting"" that medical treatments are out of the financial reach of some people?

NVDA is better: Please justify this statement if you intend for it to be read objectively. You may find it better for your needs, just as I find JAWS better for mine. There are features that both have that the other does not have, but this does not inherently make one objectively better.

JAWS has so many conflicts: Please give an example of this problem in JAWS 2020. I've found JAWS to be versatile and usable in many different use cases.

People are still taught that JAWS is the only screen reader: Please provide evidence of this other than from the marketing department of Freedom Scientific. And even if this were the case, it is not unreasonable to expect blind people to conduct their own research, which would not be an unthinkable idea considering that people often like to ""shop around"", which is greatly aided by the internet.

Why the BrailleNote costs so much: Braille notetakers cost a lot of money because of the piezzo-electric braille cells and the Android launcher that they run. PCs cost less money because of the very basic economic principle of supply and demand.

&amp;#x200B;

JAWS has great context sensitive help and built in training materials in both text and audio, plus an impressive amount of additional in depth training available online at various prices, and all settings have a blurb that usually does a decent job at explaining what each thing does.  It also comes with allot of extra features, better OCR for reading inaccessible documents or programs, text analyzing tools for proof reading, significantly better support for business apps like microsoft office or turbo tax, a deal with the sighted assistants app Aira for up to half our long calls, code to turn ribbon menus into a more user friendly format automatically, much more customizable number reading,  a powerful bookmarking feature for websites, a bunch of high quality voices that you can download for free, ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it also has allot of unintuitive or unnecessary keystrokes, some deprecated tools that are still just kinda, hanging around for no good reason or don't work well but are referenced in the documentation, and doesn't come with it's settings very well optimized by default.  Since even with the blurbs and filtering ability, the settings center is still a sprawling behemoth, most users won't even know what they are missing until they get familiar with it, and therefore suffer needlessly.

Importantly, it's very expensive and needs to have additional (also expensive) paid upgrades over time if one wishes to stay current, and can only be paid for annually within the USA.  Lately updates have not at all been worth the subscription costs for the majority of users either, but skipping them means you'll end up paying allot more later on when useful features actually get added and you want to upgrade, do to the very unforgiving update pricing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, NVDA is completely free and mainly donation supported, and comes with some pretty great documentation built in.  It's controls are generally allot easier to remember for most, and it doesn't have nearly as many extra features to get confused by, which is obviously both good and bad.  It also tends to have less lag, and crashes less often for most people.

The community is able to create addons for NVDA, to extend it's functionality and help it stay relevant with useful features, some of which have even been rolled in to the main product in the past.  and though they may very in quality or update support, they are almost exclusively free, and since far more people know how to code them than how to script for JAWS, it would be allot cheaper and probably faster to get one written for an inaccessible program at work.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, they are also less secure which means that companies will be dubious of allowing them on their network, but that will hopefully not be a big issue for much longer as NV Access is working on it as we speak.

It also doesn't have quite as good braille support as JAWS, though it's definitely still plenty usable.  And you'll need to buy extra voices unless you don't mind the ones built in to your system, since most people can't stand the default speech synthesizer.  Also, it tends to read out emoji and other special symbols better, gets far more frequent updates, and the settings are allot easier to deal with for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used graphite Ambutech folding canes with roller marshmellow tips for most of my life, with the occasional pencil or non rolling marshmellow or aluminum cane thrown in.  I even had a super heavy steel one once, and I've used those big rolling ball tips a time or two as well.

But personally, even with the drawbacks, I just really feel as though I can get better feedback and walking speed out of those NFB 50/50 carbon fiber and fiberglass canes with the metal tips and foam handles, at least with the open palm technique.

Yeah, the tips wear out pretty quick (a couple months?) if you walk almost every day in the city, less quickly if you use two point touch or slide tap rather that constant contact, and yes, they are bendy but it actually takes a surprising amount of force to break them (particularly the non folding ones) and I still don't know how I feel about the handles, but the lightness and lack of pain when I hit people with open toed shoes alone is a big plus.  It's just so freeing.

An alternative to this may be the telescoping Ambutech canes, since they are thinner and lighter still, but I think you can still use most ambutech tips with them.  Now I know that the telescoping NFB canes are a fucking nightmare, but since these ones have that twist lock thing, I'd hope they'd be allot better than the NFB ones.

It’s a pretty fraught issue for us and blindness is so different for everyone that you really can’t make a sweeping statement about the language we prefer and have it be accurate. I know the Deaf community has more of a culture to it and deafness is a big part of it so that influences how they want to be addressed. For autism, just based on the people I’ve met, you guys seem to prefer being up front and to the point about it. Both groups are very large too. By contrast, people who are blind are a very small, very scattered group and we can be anywhere. Blindness doesn’t really define us and the cultural assumptions that it does causes a lot of problems.

It still has to be functional above all; it’s a tool and the tool itself isn’t what makes using it unpleasant, but the way people treat us for using it sure does.

And I feel like to other people all I talk about is being blind. But it’s such a fundamental part of who I am, that I can’t not talk about it. Like when everyone talks about moving out of home and finding apartments while they study. I talk about finding a university near home so that my mom can help take me around.  

And I know the feeling of hiding how sad you are from others. I always felt that even though people try to understand, they just can’t. I needed to talk to other blind people. My people. Because it is a great thing to have someone to talk to that has gone through or is going through what you are. That’s why I love using Readit. 

As for wanting to see. I kinda don’t want to anymore. I know I would be a totally different person without being blind. And I think I have grown so much. I have learnt to always ask why someone does something, not just to judge them. And to think of others, because it is so rare that someone out of no where will think of helping me, or how something will affect me. With small things like going to the movies with friends, they don’t think that I need to sit in front and they will book seats right at the back.

For the blind people that do not know braille, there is handwriting mode. So, for those who are willing to learn to use it, input on an iPhone does not have to be slow.

For those Android users for some of whom, Google can do no wrong and typing is a labor of slow love to Google for them, /sarcasm, they won't want your product anyway because Android is perfect and is the fourth member of the Holy Trinity. /sarcasm lol.

For some, though, on either platform, it may be more quick to simply double tap on an edit field, and begin typing, with braille aiding tactilly finding the right key.

No, our phones most certainly should *not* get simpler!!!

Both of them have their annoyances. eSight has a non-detachable remote that resembles something attached to a hospital bed but it has an HDMI input and a battery that will last a few hours. NuEyes is a lot more portable and comes with a nifty little bluetooth remote that you slip onto your thumb. Unfortunately headset battery life is about an hour at high brightness and maybe 2 if you keep it lower. eSight has larger, more color-accurate displays while NuEyes' are smaller, a bit greenish, and are in the topleft corner. This may be helpful if your peripheral vision is bettter than your foveal vision. The cameras on both are mediocre at best and suffer from the typical lag so you won't be doing anything that requires a quick response time on either of these. eSight claims they have a low-latency system but it was about the same as any other camera when I tried it.

Both get pretty hot during use and the weight will get uncomfortable.

I found it not too difficult to just carry a small bag with me and hook up a battery bank to my NuEyes.

1160,"I get it. Really I do. As someone who's been in that rut of frustration I understand how aggravating it is to be denied access by unfair barriers to entry. Screen readers are expensive. Braille is either expensive or huge and expensive. Every major OS and even many Linux distros, all include their own screen readers but it's never the same as being able to look at a program with your eyes. Not even close. Not to mention the plethora of developers that make your screen reader useless by ignoring accessibility guidelines and conventions.

I understand that frustration. That anger how anyone else can pop into their local bigg box retailer and walk out with a $200 Chromebook and be up and running within minutes but you had to take weeks or possibly months memorizing keystroke after keystroke so you could use the screen reader. I get it doubly so because I used to be in the sighted camp. I know intimately how far the conventional interfaces and tech are ahead of their adaptive counterparts.

My first instinct was to rail against companies that profit off of this. Yes, it's unfair. Is it disgusting? That depends on your views. It's a product of capitalism, scarcity, and Human nature. We want to be compensated for the things we create because resources are finite and our effort and energy are also finite. As long as all of that continues to be true, which it will unless we start mining asteroids with automated robots or something, then we'll continue to expect compensation for the things we make.

We all have to pay for stuff, regardless if it's Mx. Consumer buying that $200 Chromebook or a blind user purchasing a screen reader. It's not wrong for people, or companies to charge money for what they make. I think that the high prices are wrong but that's a story for another time. I agree that a lot of this stuff is way too expensive, but here's the thing. Nobody's going to listen to you if you're just ranting. There's probably a myriad of things that could be done to help bring down the cost of adaptive tech, a lot of them involving subsidies in place of major institutions shouldering the high cost and making it available to its members. It's an uphill battle that no one person could ever hope to accomplish. Trouble is, ranting is even less productive than accepting the status quo. We know. We know this stuff is expensive. We know only schools and governments can afford it. Posting up a rant about it might make some people feel good or whatever but it's probably just going to piss the rest of us off and it won't help you or anyone else.

Am I happy with the status quo? No. Absolutely not. It's bullshit. I can buy a 4K gaming monitor for less money than the cheapest Braille display. I bought a laptop, flagship smartphone, two bluetooth keyboards, and 3 pairs of bluetooth headphones and even a custom core i7 desktop for less than what some Braille notetakers cost. Sadly this is the way things are.

What you do about is up to you. Personally I've gone down the road of adapting and making do with what's available. A high-end Android phone with a bluetooth keyboard and some headphones along with a Laptop with NVDA suits my portable computing and content creation and consumption needs well enough. When I need the expensive stuff I turn to government agencies to sponsor it for me. Perhaps you would rather try another way like campaigning to reduce the cost for the end user somehow. Does that sound corny? Probably, but not as bad as posting an angry rant about it on a tiny part of a website that gets sporadic mainstream attention at most. People here and in other online VI communities are often happy to help and provide solutions to problems where you can't have the expensive stuff. Again, posting an angry rant isn't the way to do it.

- Honestly, I'd say it's made me more empathetic. As a teen, I was very much a ""fuck everyone else, their offense is their issue, haha slurs are funny"" kind of garbage person. I now try to be more caring about others because of how much nonsense I've dealt with. Being patronized like I'm a lap dog and not a functioning almost 25 year old makes my blood boil, so I tend to be less forgiving of discrimination, even if I understand where it's coming from. I also struggled with the whole ""you are a representative of the blindness community at all times"" part of it. For about 2 years I felt like I had to have on makeup, have my hair done, dress a step nicer than I ever had, and look extremely put together. Now, I have run out of fucks to give and I'll wear yoga pants and a band shirt I've had for a decade just to be comfortable.

&gt;2.	If you had an SO when you went blind, how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

- I was single when it happened, so thankfully I didn't have to deal with that piece of it. I've talked about it before, but my mother's negligence and medical neglect of me caused me to be permanently blind, since she chose not to get me the help I needed. She is very much the infantilizing type, minimizing me to more of a token she can get sympathy with. Several others in my family are also bad about it, making assumptions that just because they couldn't do something with their eyes closed, today, that I couldn't do it either. I have an aunt and an uncle that are great though and just take me at my word that I can do certain things without having my hands held.

&gt;3.	If you were employed at work what happened? Was their a shift in the type of work you did? Did you get fired?

- N/A

&gt;4.	Was it hard to learn Braille?

- Quite a bit, actually. I have constant tingles in my fingertips so feeling paper braille can be quite difficult. I was also taught with used braille books, so the soft braille was also rubbed down. If I could have learned with a borrowed braille display where I could really feel the dots, I would have struggled much less. It's still pretty hard, though, not gonna lie. Many letters, like A, K and U can be mistaken for each other if you're going too fast and miss the bottom row, or bleed together cells. It's very situation dependant as well, so it can get very complex.

&gt;5.	This is sort of a weird question and is personal, not school related, but what do you see? This always interested me. Is it black? Is there nothing?

In the end I decided that no... I'm not just being dramatic. I went without it for 40 years and my perception was that I was doing ""just fine"" but that's only because I didn't know any different.

1231,"Dad's recovered fairly well and is doing good, thanks! 

I've always been visually impaired to about the same degree, legally blind since birth. Over the years, it's gotten a little worse in some ways a little better in others.

I still very vividly remember the dream, because it was so detailed and it happened so frequently.

But first some backstory: My dad used to do HVAC/electrical work when I was a kid. He ran his own business and sometimes I would tag along if I was on a school break or something. There was one house he used to work at quite regularly (I think they were remodeling) that had a crawlspace under the floor from their basement (the basement wasn't as large as the whole house's footprint, so part of the duct work/electrical wiring was only accessible via the crawlspace). I remember crawling under there a couple times and it was very ""scratchy"" - lots of gnarled roots and sticks and things poking at you.

Well, my dream started with crawling through this crawlspace for an unusually long time and eventually emerging from the other end into a forest. After walking through the forest a bit, it would open into this clearing. The whole area was lit with a sort of ambient pale green, moonlight-like glow, but there was no visible moon or stars, just weirdly illuminated clouds.

In the middle of the clearing was a HUGE tree that had a ""treehouse"" that was an actual house -  an old two-story white house.

I'd climb the ladder into the house and inside it was all just open, completely empty rooms with squeaky wood floors. I'd walk past the stairs into the living room (never went up them) and there were doors there that opened out onto this balcony that gave a great view of the clearing and the forest beyond. I'd go stand out there and take it all in, then the wind would really pick up.

After that, I'd go back inside the house and I'd be standing there looking around, when suddenly I'd feel something wet on my arm. Then I noticed something dripping from the ceiling. Then I realized it was blood.

That's when I would look up and see all kinds of dead bodies hanging on ropes from the ceiling.

I'd freak out at this point, run out of the house, down the ladder, back through the clearing (still very windy), into the forest and the trail just sort of closed in behind me as I ran. I'd dive back into the hole into the crawlspace and start crawling toward the basement, but all of the gnarled roots and things in the crawlspace would turn to hands that grabbed me and pulled me back toward the clearing.

That's usually the point at which I woke up. I think one time I did barely make it out of the crawlspace and back into the basement.

I had this dream off and on for months. It was probably when I was around 12.",,,,codeplaysleep,ROP / RLF,,1570627914,t5_2qpec,t3_df6tpw,t1_f32helg,1,1578653807,0,0,f32x81q,Blind,,,blue1,,

1233,"Ah, that's got to be a rough adjustment for him. 

If he were 20 and adjusting to blindness, my answer may be a little different, but I'm guessing he's older and it sounds like he may not be around much longer. Given those two things, I wouldn't really focus much on him learning to accommodate his new situation like I might a much younger person who has 40 years of life as a blind person ahead of them. He no doubt will learn these skills, but I'd be more hands-off about it and let him work it out, unless he asks for help. Right now he's probably just trying to hang on to some dignity during what he knows are his final moments and I think that's going to require a bit of deference on the part of the family.

My dad had a stroke a while back and was similarly embarrassed for a while (he's since mostly recovered), not because he couldn't see, but because he was just so uncoordinated. 

I would try and find other things to do with him, first and foremost. 

If he's willing to get together for meals, plan simpler things - sandwiches, casseroles that can be served in a bowl, but won't drip like soups, etc. With my dad, we kind of planned family meals like that for a while without really telling him that's why we were doing it, but he knew and thanked us for it later. 

But mostly, I wouldn't force it. If he wants to join you at the table for conversation, but eat earlier or later, let him know that's totally fine. Or maybe he wants to skip the meal and join you all to spend time together in the living room once dinner is over. Either way, let him know you just want to spend time with him and food doesn't have to be involved. 

And then give him some space on the subject. With my dad, when we backed off about stuff like that, he'd come around and come out and join us after a bit. If we pushed the issue, he'd push back - I think because he thought it meant more to us than it did and then he'd feel even more inadequate.

It's more than just being embarrassed about making a bit of a mess - it's what the mess represents. It's about feeling like you suddenly can't do this basic thing.

Personally, I prefer ""blind person"" over ""person who is blind."" Person-first language, to me, sounds so... ""othering.""

I don't want my blindness to be seen or treated by others as a negative thing. There are good things about it and there are bad things about it.

Frankly, I'd start off by saying hello in a genuinely friendly voice and asking if I'm looking at the camera okay?  When they say, Yes, I'd add, Good!  Because I have a have a vision impairment and just want to make sure I've got the camera lined up.  Great to be here and so excited about POSITION.  Where should we start?""

So now they know, this would explain anything noticeable about your prosthetic (which allows them to relax), and they also know you are not intimidated by video and your loss of vision is just a very minor issue for you.  Why?  Because you are brilliant and impressive!",,,,SpikeTheCookie,,,1570391103,t5_2qpec,t3_de3bbq,t3_de3bbq,3,1578479898,0,0,f2t5v08,Blind,,,,,

I'm wondering if you can contact NCBI or Fighting Blindness (links below) to get them to advocate for you.  You absolutely need to be registered.  And you need access to knowledgable specialists.

One thing you can do on your own is Google your disease and the term ""research.""  Look for papers published in the past 5 years. Then reach out to the authors/researches of those papers.  Often they will have the best information because they are literally on the cutting edge.

If I was going to take someone out we would first agree on a time and place to meet, then I as the man would , take her to a place where I'm familiar with the menu or obviously reading the menu online before we go. Then afterwards maybe we would go for a walk together in a park or by the pier. Perhaps go to a cinema and watch something with described video. Then the next time I would have my girlfriend pick the dinner and activities.

1393,"Being five feet and an inch if I am wearing platform sneakers, I was never going to be a model with or without sight!

Nobody can tell you or I that having sight problems is not a pain in the ass. I get irritated when people claim that they wouldn't take a miracle cure. Of course anyone would just for the convenience. Someone once said that being blind is incredibly inconvenient and that's so true. I agree. It's not great. People sometimes ignore that in an attempt to try and sound positive but sometimes you just want someone to go yes, it is bad. Modern medicine, I am ready for your cure.

The problem now is that I am sort of tempted to try to turn this around and pep talk you which is probably not that helpful. So here's stuff I would say to anyone with or without sight problems who was looking to get into a tricky career like modelling.

If you make money out of modeling you're a  model, and that's what you tell them. Don't mention the disability, I never do. Never make excuses for yourself.  Never give them a reason to think less of you. I'm a musician and I guess it's similar to modeling in that it's a fake it till you make it career. If this feels like building yourself up too much, bear in mind it is what everyone else is doing. Get yourself set up with some sort of online presence that calls you what you want to be. Have business cards made. Put a logo at the end of your emails. People will believe it.

As to the practicalities sure, I find that being blind makes life very very expensive. I spend a stupid amount of money on cabs and ubers and stuff. In the last week I have done five jobs all over London and earlier this year I was in Tokyo and Los Angeles, and I went to Tokyo solo. It can be done. You just end up spending a huge amount of time making phone calls and if things go wrong you have to problem solve. You also have to have planned for things to go wrong. The number of times I have called a building, while I was standing in the building, for someone to come find me is huge. If that's price of doing business so be it.

1395,"I cannot respect the whole social model thing. That is exactly what I hear from RNIB, oh you can do anything you want and if you can't it's everyone else's fault. Sometimes that is true, mostly it is total rubbish. I can't drive, I can't take photos, I can't travel around solo without doing hours of preparation and running a significant risk that someone will forget and leave me standing in a building, calling the building I'm actually in, and asking them to come find me. That's one person's mistake, that's not evidence of some evil hegemony of sighted people working to keep me in my place. Obviously I don't shove that sort of thinking down the throats of the people I work with but they're not stupid, they're going to realise they're there are limits and I'm not going to patronise them by saying otherwise, and I am not going to try to tell them to blame society. Sure, get help from people, you have no choice, but don't blame them for putting up barriers if they're really not. That just makes it an argument.

Sorry that winds me up. One thing nobody gets about disability is how political it is.

I am totally happy to do let the professionals do the mobility stuff, if they can persuade her. If their approach is so clumsy that she refuses to have anything to do with them, well. I view it as the lesser of two evils that I do something basic with them rather than they sit around doing nothing for eternity. If I can get qualified to do that, great.

The fact is, to quote someone I knew years ago, being blind is when every mouthful is a surprise, and sometimes you find yourself sucking desperately at an empty fork, which is even more of a surprise. Usually you don't get to assemble a delicious custom mouthful containing just the right amount of bacon, sausage and stuffing all dipped in gravy. That's just life. But you can usually get stuff down your throat without spraying everyone in the vicinity with hollandaise sauce. Yes, I am remembering a recent eggs benedict experience I'd rather forget, but only because it tasted awful, not because it was hard to eat.

It needs to be directed properly and have a specific goal in mind.

Obviously, having a bunch of people just blindfold themselves and try to do stuff is going to be a waste of time. I have said to people when they have been whining about stuff they can't do, ""well, you don't know what you're doing yet."" When they get some idea what they're doing, it's different. I think we all understand that.

Also, to get political, this is the same NFB that protested the movie ""Blindness."" The film shows a situation in which huge numbers of people go blind all at once. NFB complained that it didn't realistically depict the day to day lives of blind people, but it's pretty obviously not trying to. It's trying to depict the initial trauma that they're talking about in that paper and it does that pretty reasonably. If huge numbers of people suddenly went blind and nobody knew what they were doing it would not be pretty.

1416,"Someone said ""tons of blind people can work."" My attitude is that just being blind should not on its own affect anyone at all being able to work. Now, a lot of blind people are not very young or have other problems too, and that's a factor, but on its own? I don't want to write off the challenges but there's a job for everyone and nobody should doubt that for a second.

That said I am probably not a helpful example. I'm a musician, which is of course blind person career number one. I am also involved in running an agency for guitarists and I make a percentage of my income renting out equipment by consigning it to studios (that is, it sits on their shelf and if someone uses it, I get paid and they take a cut.) If that seems weirdly specific it is, and it is just a result of me trying to use the opportunities that came my way.

What's more important than any of that is that I am self employed. To some extent that makes it unreliable. I don't have to be fired, they just stop calling me. On the other hand it also means that I have a lot more opportunity to negotiate for the things I need, which generally isn't much. In the end it means that I take the jobs I can do. This means, for instance, that I turn down a really depressing amount of work because I can't read music, but that's life.

Between taking the opportunities you can get, and taking the jobs you can do, in the end you don't get much choice about what you end up doing. The thing is, and the really liberating thing is, that is the same for everyone. I know lots of (sighted) people who I see as very successful and people to emulate, but over a drink in the evening they often start griping about the fact that they wanted to be doing something a bit different. Obviously you can push for things but life has a way of taking you down unexpected roads and sometimes it's a good idea to go with the flow.

Sorry if this is a giant ramble but in the end I only have one bit of concrete advice. Get over the hesitancy on assistive tech. Do I like having to walk around with a cane which basically puts a giant neon sign above my head with an arrow, reading ""look at the cripple everyone."" No, I don't. I never will.

Working is hard. I've tried before &amp; it was so difficult. It's not impossible for people who are blind/VI, but so much more difficult by many factors. So, I recieve SSI to live off of for now. My case worker  at a disability service center recently told me that a lot of blind/VI individuals have poor luck at minimal jobs such as fast food type jobs, office related work, cashiers, etc Ones that are designed to be simple are actually more difficult for us because a lot of these ""simple"" jobs require sight. She told me going to college &amp; pursuing an actual career in something I want to do would be better than settling for an average minimal job.  That was before I recieved SSI. So, what she told me would be my advice to you. ❤

As for children, I dont want them because of my vision &amp; anxiety. I'm terrified I wont be a ""normal"" mother &amp; that my child would be taking care of me more than I would of him/her because of my disability. But, dont let that discourage you!

I myself have ROP (Retinopothy of Prematurity), that has developed into Retinal Fibrosis as well. Being visually Impaired is such a struggle, so I cant fathom what it must be like to be completely blind. 

I have found that anxiety &amp; depression go hand-in-hand with disabilities. It makes it astronomically harder to cope with a disability when you have a mental illness to accompany it. I have recently started seeing a therapist in the last year for my anxiety, &amp; that has helped me vastly. 

My dream job is a physiologist or a writer or an advocate for VI/blind people &amp; a professional model on the side. I would love to write a self help/ guideline book for the VI/blind, &amp; their friends &amp; family too. 

I'm so sorry people have overlooked you for job opportunities because of your disabilities. Just because we are different, it doesnt make us any less human or valuable as beings in this world. 

As for you being bullied by misunderstood morons, I am also very sorry &amp; deeply angered by this on your behalf. No one, &amp; I mean NO ONE, deserves to be treated with disrespect or belittled in any way because of something they didnt ask for &amp; feasibly cannot change.

Being visually Impaired is NEVER an excuse for me, but always a reason. That is a pet peeve of mine: when disabled people use their disability as a crutch or an excuse. I make it a point in my life to never do that, because it's just not who I am.
