0,"I wasn’t born legally blind, but I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. (Long story). I don’t use a cane, and I don’t read Braille, and I think I have a pretty unique situation? I’m in a weird spot where I can barely squeak by as sighted, but it’s very difficult. Print is very difficult for me. It’s hard for my eyes to focus, and it’s also blurry. I have a small blind spot too. It just removes detail, and is like a blend of the colors around the blind spot. When objects are in motion, or when there is a moving background behind a stationary object or print (like subtitles) I find it very difficult to read. Larger objects I consider to have a clearer image, but I don’t necessarily trust my definition of clear as I didn’t know what that truly looks like. Finer details like text are much harder to see. Painting are a very good example of this.

I completely agree, a child born blind won’t know any other way of living and wouldn’t be so affected by a “loss of vision” because there was no loss. But to lose your vision suddenly, I can’t imagine how difficult it is to relearn everything from square one. 

I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me to share their individual journeys, I’m ashamed to say I was ignorant and never realized how many different eye diseases there are that could result in blindness/visual impairment. Yours particularly fascinated me, with the geometric patterns and colors that cloud your vision. 

Something I’ve seen consistently stated here is that people suffered from a lack of support and counseling. I think this is just awful and there should be more resources available to people who are blind or losing their vision, as it’s such a drastic change of pace. The lack of support often leaves people feeling like they have nothing to live for. Being here and seeing how many people have come out on the other side is inspiring.

38,"My first thought is that 'blind' doesn't always mean everything is black. Decide what kind of blind you want your protagonist to be. Would she see fuzzy shapes and colours? Perhaps just light and dark? That's going to impact how she functions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; what would be her most important means of taking in the world? 

It's a common misconception that blind people have better senses. It's only true in that we train our senses to help us. Most people have a primary sense they rely on for a particular task, but humans use every tool at their disposal. For example, when filling my water bottle I use a combination of sound and touch to know when to turn the tap off. Humans don't use their senses in isolation.

Most blind people have their own unconscious tricks they develop to help them perform everyday tasks, but for full efficiency we often undergo orientation and mobility training or something similar. If your protagonist doesn't have someone to train her, there may be some interesting inefficiencies in the way she does things, so factor that in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How far can could she hear or smell things from? 

It's hard to get specific here so I'll go with my experience. I have pretty good ears naturally, but because what I hear is so important to me, I can't actively tune out sounds like a lot of people can. In a crowded place I will struggle to hear the person talking next to me, but that isn't because my hearing is poor.

I use my hearing as my primary way of crossing roads. Traffic has certain patterns to it that you can train yourself to recognise. Sound like that is very directional and you can get a pretty good idea of how far away a vehicle is by the frequency of the sound, but that took years of effort to perfect and I still don't always get it right.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is, how good your protagonists' senses are depends a lot on how much effort she has put into training them.

 

&gt;What can cause misunderstandings simply because someone with sight wouldn't think about it at all?

Facial expressions, bumping into people, shaking hands, not recognising someone you should be able to recognise. Most blind people wouldn't look blind if you took away their cane/dog. I sometimes get whispers about how I don't look blind at all. Blindness doesn't have a 'look', so your protagonist might encounter some of the same ignorance that we deal with. If your society is feudal or patriarchal she might encounter a lot of ablest thinking - you can't be doing that, you're blind/a girl/a blind girl!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How would she explore a new environment?

Depends a lot on her character. Would she ask for help? How important is it to her that she appears normal? If I'm going to a new venue I usually turn up early and scout the place, touch everything, walk the perimeter so I know where my hazards are. I don't particularly like doing this in front of people.

These days I'm more secure in my disability and will typically just ask someone if they could show me to the bathroom, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What should I take into account all the time when writing?

Consistency. She's not just blind when it suits the plot, she is blind all the time in every situation. I would recommend keeping notes on little nuances as you would with any POV character and check each scene against those notes.

A good example of this done poorly is when a protagonist's power is established as x. If they  suddenly display x2 powers to defeat the BBEG without having undergone some training or transformation, the victory feels cheap to the audience. But if they are threatened by a situation we know they should be able to overcome and they just flop over like a wet tissue, it feels frustrating.

If you establish that your protagonist can safely cross a busy street 90% of the time, and then have her get run down by a horse when she's being chased, that feels believable. But if she just gets run down out of nowhere because the plot requires it, that's going to feel pretty cheap. I don't think I'm explaining this too well, but I hope you get the gist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And most importantly, what am I completely missing because I lack the perspective of a blind person?

Good question! How doe she know who someone is? Is she good at voice recognition, and if so how long does she need to spend with someone to get their voice down?

How does she choose her clothing if clothing is important? I went through a phase of wearing the same outfit day in and day out when I was 12 because I had been made fun of for my terrible fashion sense.

How will she navigate crowds of people? If she lives in an era where a cane isn't recognised, people wouldn't move out of her way.

Her friends will often forget and might, for example, point and say 'look at that' only to realise a moment later. Seriously, like, my mum still does this after 28 years.

Unless your society is super enlightened, people will look consciously and unconsciously either pity her or even revile her. People these days sometimes try to take advantage of me by, for example, cutting queue in front of me and in a couple rare cases trying to steal things from me. I'm certain that I've been taken advantage of without even realising it.

My boyfriend regularly plays tricks on me or jokes about me and sometimes it's funny, and sometimes it's downright depressing and that's someone who loves and respects me.

Bottom line here is that, although her disability doesn't define her as a character, it will define a lot of how she interacts with her world and her people. In my opinion the most important thing to get right about a blind protagonist is to strike a nice balance between superpower blindness (Daredevil) and being a completely helpless damsel (every other media interpretation of blindness). If you can manage that you're doing pretty fucking good.

Good luck!",,,,Sarinon,,,1568506716,t5_2qpec,t3_d4ahba,t3_d4ahba,10,1576889004,0,0,f09tf1b,Blind,,,,,

83,"I am totally into Amonwild's phraseology here, hit the thing with the stick to see if it is there! 

We should be clear this is just a super basic introduction to allow people to get around the house and be guided safely. I always have a sighted helper (often my longsuffering partner, thanks Phil) to make sure nobody is going to go home limping.

Obviously you start with basic verbal instruction and body position stuff that I can just feel. For actual travel their left hand goes on my left shoulder, their right hand over mine on the cane so they know where my body is pointing and where the cane is going. I'm tiny so it's not awkward. We go down an edge then maybe someone puts out an obstacle then we go find it together a few times. Then they go in front and I can then check they're not drifting or over covering which is the big problem most people seem to have. We graduate from them hearing the obstacle going down, to not knowing where it is. When we do kerbs and steps we go side by side, me on the left because I can travel left handed better than they can, then we go find the kerb. One thing I do that will make O&amp;M people scowl is have them pick a hand and mainly stick with it. What if you're carrying something etc.

Lots of attention is paid to how to guide someone but I am big on how to be guided. I get my partner to guide and I tell them to treat him like someone they don't totally trust, and develop their ability to find stuff they're about to be walked into, especially steps. I also do a lot of the doorway thing because that's also training for whoever they live with.

I think the most important thing is not even really technical. I make sure whenever we go out and about I always have my cane, which makes it OK for them to have theirs. Often we're both being guided by my partner and obviously with him I wouldn't bother with the cane, but I make a point of having it out so that in the very early days they get that it is normal and okay and not freakish. Maybe that sounds really remedial but that's the sort of level we've been at.

Does that make sense? I hope nobody has any huge objections... yikes.

It will also allow her to check the time, the weather, set reminders, make a shopping list, etc.  The TuneIn Radio option allows listening to live news like CNN, MSNBC and many topical podcasts.

It's very important that she be able to entertain herself when you're unavailable.  For example, being able to listen to the news will give you lots of stuff to talk about.

*the smaller Echo devices aren't as loud and often times seniors need more volume to hear something or the desired content is very quiet and needs the volume turned up.

193,"Honestly, a notetaker based on an old Android release isn't going to do him many favors in the long run where coding is concerned. He really needs to learn a screen reader on a standard computer.

I grew up using notetakers, albeit the older Windows CE ones from Humanware. Today, I code for my job every day, plus do some DBA work and server admin tasks over SSH. I haven't touched a notetaker in about six years, because my phone and standard computers do so much more. The simplicity and ease of notetakers is their big selling point, and they're not bad machines at all. My BrailleNote was my best friend from sixth grade through college, after all. But I didn't use it for serious coding. Hacking on JavaScript using a notetaker was a wonderful learning experience, but that was all self-taught, not part of any class. Learning Python, or PHP, or how to manage a server, or most anything beyond the very basics simply can't be done as well on a notetaker as on a computer. The sooner your student learns Windows or macOS, the better off he'll be. If on Windows, by the way, use NVDA as the screen reader if the school/state doesn't want to pay for Jaws. NVDA is free, and even written in Python.

I'll try to address both your comments in this one. I'm on mobile so I can't look back at the other one while writing this, but I'll make edits if needed. 

I promise you I am trying to write her as a person first. To clarify something, the story is NOT about her getting her sight back, and she's not only getting her sight back just to see. She's doing her best to live and train despite her blindness.

To add more context, at the start of the story, there are only two species introduced: human and eladrin (think elves). Humans are very weak, having minimal amounts of magic compared to the eladrin. The eladrin are incredibly powerful, boarding on demigods relative to the humans. However, they act as protectors from the perspective of the humans (wink, wink).  

The strongest (read: with the most magic relative to their brethren) humans are conscripted into the Eladrin military where they act as infantry. This is seen as a great honor and almost every human dreams of this. The greatest achievement a human can fulfill is becoming a member of the Eladrin's honor guard, for lack of a better name yet. Lesser honors are being chosen for other skills and allowed to live in the eladrin city. 

The character's father and brother were both taken into the military, cited as having immense power, for humans. As such, this character, despite her lack of sight, believes with her ""obviously"" high magic reserves will be taken in anyway and her sight will be restored, fulfilling her dream of being in the military and potentially the honor guard. 

So, her actions are as someone who views themselves as temporarily blind since she'll obviously be chosen and since she's so strong they'll obviously restore her sight, except she has almost zero magic within her. 

The plot device, while giving her limited sight, is very valuable in this world and is proof of the eladrin's real agenda. It's more like she finds this thing that sets her off on a journey to find the truth while giving her the ability to see the flow of magic and that ability will play into the overarching narrative of the journey. 

Her lack of power will make her come to terms with her blindness. And, taking some advice from you, I'm thinking of only allowing her to see the magic when she's either holding or actively using the plot device (it's a weapon, naturally). This way she is still blind *most* of the time. 

I understand writing to try to ""fix"" her is offensive, but in a world of magic, it's not out of the ordinary for eladrins to perform great acts of healing. Another idea I'm throwing around is the chance for her to be healed, but refusing to go through with it due to fear of losing the magic sight. 

I hope that's fixed a few things. Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I need to completely scrap this idea. Thanks!",,,,TwerkMasterSupreme,,,1567530099,t5_2qpec,t3_cyltss,t1_eyu1lq6,2,1576026181,0,0,eywi8i3,Blind,,,,,

226,"Hey! I saw in your AMA that you lost your vision to RP. I'm in a similar situation, but I'm very lucky and have only lost most of my peripherial vision so far.

So, I can't say I have faced any similar situations as you on reddit, but I wanted to comment anyways. I read through your post and a lot of the comments were pretty frustrating, to be honest. I can understand that a large majority of people have never interacted with or even thought about blind people for any real length of time, so all the questions like ""how do u even use internet??"" are expected. (But annoying). However, a lot of people seemed to just straight up deny that it was even possible for a blind person to respond to so many comments, or use emoticons (as if blind people don't have emotions?). Those comments were the worst, because obviously they have no idea what they're talking about, and they can't fathom that it's even possible to do things without sight.

It really sucks that you have to explain to so many people what seems so basic to us.

To answer your question: What probably gave the most pause to people was your use of emoticons and the way you structure your comments. You are very expressive with your text in terms of capitalization, punctuation, and emoticons. I'm guessing that people just wouldn't expect that from someone who can't see? Or, again, they're just really dumb and don't think blind people can use the internet in the same way sighted people can.

I saw that you edited your post to explain your setup and I think that was a good idea to help stop those comments, although with how much that post blew up I don't think you could've done much more.

Either way, it's not your fault and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. However, I'm glad you got to educate some folks, and hopefully they'll pass that knowledge on to others.

Blind people have ideas of what they find attractive just like anyone else does, and the idea that they do not is a misnomer.

Slightly off-topic, but related to this question: the BMI scale is absolute bullshit. My weight has fluctuated quite a bit over the years due to a few different forces at work, and I have noticed one thing. BMI does not take into account pretty much anything. It doesn’t take water weight or the weight of your muscle into account at all, for one. For another, there can be large deposits of fat on your body that are just going to be there, whether you like it or not. People with larger breasts come to mind.
Also, weight distribution makes different amounts of weight look different from person to person. I weigh about 150 pounds right now, but, by all accounts of the sighted people I am in close proximity to, I look maybe 125.

 Compiz is the best magnifier, Xfwm4 works, but there are screen reader issues with <PERSON>, KDE has magnification, but again, the screen reader doesn't really work with KDE well yet. So I use Mate, Orca, and Compiz. Btw, Orca is the best graphical screen reader for Linux. It's also the only graphical screen reader for Linux!

Yes there is bias against blind people. We would all be gainfully employed if there wasn't. It's not impossible to live a happy normal life while blind, but there is a psychological and sociological toll that it takes which you must be able to push through and process.

My right eye has the same problem with intra-ocular pressure, but although it was enough to kill my optic nerve it isn't enough to cause corneal dystrophy.

Blindness is hard to tackle in my opinion.  Your comfort zone shrinks dramatically and in my case too much to have the critical mass required to regrow it back, which means that although I've been blind for 5 years I am yet to adapt and accept.  This is caused by the fact that I used to have very narrow yet deep interests in coding which are severely hindered by my inability to see.  While I can still code I can only do so at a very superficial level and only under extremely favorable conditions, so I can't work on just about anything like I could before.  I think that we are living in a golden era which is the worst time ever to be unable to fully enjoy life due to a disability.

Regarding Braille and other skills in general I contacted the national blind association here in Portugal (ACAPO) when I went blind and they directed me to the only rehabilitation center in my country which fortunately is not too far away from where I live.

318,"Hi Killerlag

Thankyou for replying, and I totally get what you are saying. Though, if you train someone and they fall down a flight of stairs they're just as free to try and sue you as me.

Begin rant. I have very mixed views about RNIB.

Every person I have seen had given up on RNIB. I don't blame them, I did the same. Most RNIB people are well meaning but it can feel as if you are being metaphorically sent to a crappy nineteen seventies psychiatric hospital which smells of cabbage where people talk at you slowly and kindly. This happens at a time when you are clinging super hard to normality and the instituational feel is just horrifying. Is this your life from now on? It's like ice down your spine.

I also have a feeling that RNIB policy is made by people who were born with little or no sight. There's this weird propaganda that there's no reason for anyone to be unhappy about sight loss. I guess we probably agree that it's not about liking it (I don't LIKE it). It's about handling not liking it in a healthy way. But when you are new it is frightening to realise the experts don't seem to understand that distinction.

I think I am being sent the problem cases. Naturally I am totally keen to do everything I can to do it as well as I can but I've actually been quite hard put to discover what it takes for someone to become a mobility trainer or even if it's possible for me to do it, or even who controls that.

Sighted person here, but maybe I can still lend some perspective on this.

There's a few things to untangle here:

1. First and foremost, people are idiots.
2. Apparently, blind people on the internet getting accused of faking is a thing, unfortunately. Molly Burke, a popular blind Youtuber, still gets accused of faking to this day in the comment section of her videos. It makes no sense, and trying to understand what motivates these people is wasted time. Don't even bother arguing with them, you don't need to justify yourself to anyone. Feeling that you need to address or respond to personal attacks, slander, misinformation or anything like that is actually part of the problem. It's fine to let those dumb comments stand - anyone with half a brain will put them in the right context when they read them, and realize that you just didn't feel the need to dignify them with a response.   
3.  We sighted people can ask some pretty dumb questions of blind people, and be ignorant about how self-sufficient many of you are. It can honestly be quite surprising for us to see how well you use the internet for example. We rely on our vision so damn much that it's mind-boggling to us how well people can manage that lack that sense. It also took me a lot of reading, listening and watching to realize just how independent blind people can be. So, sighted people then react differently to this: Some with wonder and astonishment. Others unfortunately jump to the conclusion ""I don't understand this, it can't be true, therefore they must be faking"". Don't mistake genuine interest for accusations though: Tone doesn't come through well over the internet, and often it's just us asking a dumb, but sincere question.
4. There's some really strong groupthink on Reddit, at least in some communities. Unless you fall in line with that, you're always going to get some level of resistance, antagonism or controversy. It requires a thick skin, but it can be worth it for the 5% of awesome people or ideas you might find. But you need to develop a skill where you can quickly identify comments that aren't worth your time, and quickly brush them off. I imagine that this might be more difficult with text-to-speech though.
5. You'll always notice the ones that sting more than the positive ones. Dramatically so. It's unfortunate, but this applies to pretty much any internet media, be it Twitter, Reddit or YouTube. You may just have read 10 positive comments in a row, but that one that hurts you just stings. We all have that bias.

\- Be very open with the instructors about your thoughts and feelings about how it is going. They do listen and the sooner you say something the sooner it can be answered or resolved.

\- Be sure you are very clear abut what your needs are before you go as this will improve the quality of your match. It will also let them correct any unrealistic ideas you have about what a dog can offer. The field reps, instructors and non-instructor support staff all work together as a team to make sure you have the best preparation and experience possible.

\- When you ""graduate"" you are not done. The learning will continue for both you and the dog. Try as much as you can to stick with the rules. You can relax some of them eventually but don't do it too quickly, you and the dog will both be better off in the long run if you adapt slowly. The dog's guide work will continue to improve over their career, as long as you continue to provide the right environment and consistent support. 

\- Remember that the dog is yours and your responsibility. Family members should defer to you regarding the dog and limit their engagement. These are young loving dogs and crave interaction. That interaction should be primarily with you as they should always remain focused on you. They will work better for you if you are their primary support. Feed the dog, relieve the dog, exercise the dog, play with the dog yourself. Don't depend on others to do these things unless you are physically unable.

\- Enjoy your dog! Bond with it, play with it, snuggle it, love it. Enjoy your new mobility and freedom. Zoom through a crowded transit station! 

\- Talk to other people with guides including your classmates. Everyone will have something to offer.",,,,bondolo,Sighted Spouse,,1567881308,t5_2qpec,t3_d0y9kn,t3_d0y9kn,9,1576362512,0,0,ezfppge,Blind,,,mod,,

415,"&gt;I hear a lot of people say that if they were to suddenly lose vision their “life would be over” but I’ve seen so many people adjust really well and in most cases continue living their normal everyday lives

That probably depends on their age when they lost their sight and the degree of blindness.

My sight loss was sudden at the age of 40.  1 minute I have perfect vision, 2hrs later I have no peripheral vision, charles bonnet syndrome (geometric patterns/colours over everything I see) and have trouble reading anything smaller than 18pt print.  The cause as a stroke during heart procedure.

For it to happen suddenly and so late in life was devastating, especially as for the first few weeks I had no depth perception either so preparing food or navigating my flat was very difficult.  It didn't help that I got zero help or support from health services for at least 2 months and even then it was minimal.

Suicide was something I considered more than a few times during the first couple of months and I did indeed feel like my life was over.  I already had mobility problems so now being unable to drive basically confined me to my small apartment unless my gf took me out.

434,"so my 12 year old daughter is legally blind (completely blind in one eye, some useable vision in the other) and I use the word blind for her sometimes because its a heck of a lot easier to say shes blind or legally blind than to stand there for 20 minutes and explain that no, glasses won't actually help her to every stranger I meet. 

She can get around fine most of the time. She has enough vision that you might not notice right away that she's visually impaired, she runs around the house like any other 12 year old, but I find that when we are out and about, she's totally different with her cane and without it. Without it, she clings to my arm, or stops every time the ground changes to stick her toe out to make sure it's not a curb or a step up or down or a puddle (with no light perception in one eye, she has REALLY bad depth perception.) With her cane, she just moves so much more confidently. I think having a cane and learning how to use it are super important things, and if you just stick it  in your backpack or whatnot, no one even needs to know you have it unless youre in a situation where you want to use it.

A magic society that depends on visualization (mind's eye) to do magic. Blind folks are assumed to not be able to because of lack of sight, but some people can continue after losing sight if they were already trained. 

A blind woman ends up talented in magic and creates a new way of doing magic! (Let's say by ""feel"" or other method.)

Luckily, my work literally has a walking path over to an apartment complex so I can get to work pretty easily.

I definitely feel the pain of needing to depend on people for rides though, especially for longer distances. I have family that lives fairly close (like a 3 hour drive) that I would like to visit sometimes, but to take a train there would take like 5 hours with a layover in a big city which I'm not too keen on. Same problem with busses, so I'm basically stuck getting rides from people. 

If you still feel like you're a burden asking people for rides, have you considered compensating them?

518,"You should look more into what can be installed on each distro, since most are built on a similar base (eg ubuntu, debian, arch). I would recommend looking into something based on ubuntu or debian personally, because they're the most common and therefore it's easier to find software packages for them. 

Basically, with Linux, you can customise the UI and font sizes as much as you want. You don't have to worry about that stuff like you do with Windows or Mac. If you find that a program won't allow you the customisation that you want, then you can just uninstall it and replace it with something else. Even if a distro doesn't seem accessible at first or is missing something that you need, you can just replace it or add what you need. I should note that large amounts of customisation can be a hassle, so while it does give you the most freedom to make your system as accessible as possible, don't aim to just build your whole system from scratch if you're not familiar with Linux.",,,,mangoesaresuperior,,,1567326841,t5_2qpec,t3_cy2fgp,t3_cy2fgp,2,1575916294,0,0,eyq5z40,Blind,,,,,

522,"People have been doing research on this and creating prototypes for 60+ years. There’s a vast scientific literature on sensory substitution. But the pragmatics involved mean it’s generally not a great way to help actual people who are blind. When you get feedback from actual people who say “this isn’t the way to help”, it may be worth listening and not doubling down. 

Others with vastly more resources and expertise have created tech likely better than what you could create alone (like the Brainport lollipop of electrodes that gives tactile feedback to the tongue), and others are working on directly stimulating the visual cortex for very simplified “visuals” or trying to create artificial retinas that can be implanted at the back of the eye.

570,"Sorry my comment is months later but I hope it helps and brings comfort.

My daughter has FEVR. She was born without any sight and had two operations at a few months old to make her eyes as comfortable as possible for her. Shes now 7 and I'm telling you, these kids are robust! Shes in a mainstream school, uses a brailler, has best friends and gets around really well. She has a 1.1 braille teacher that assists her in class. She loves everyone in school and the other kids go out of their way to include her in everything.

She also figure skates (since January of this year) and has no fear of the ice. She has her second competition coming up and loves showing people what she can do.

If people tell her she cant do something, she will prove them wrong. Shes very independent and very stubborn.

Unfortunately I cant give you any advice on what may happen due to my daughter having no vision from the start. My biggest advice is, although it's scary, FEVR comes in so many forms and affects people differently, let her be as independent as possible as she grows up. It's hard as parents, we want to cotton wrap our children and make sure no harm comes to them. Let her explore, let her have those head bumps (of course help stop the big injuries), let her make mistakes and learn, let her discover her own way of doing things.  I wish you the best of luck, and as a fellow  FEVR parent - you've got this!",,,,themysticaldinosaur,,,1568667991,t5_2qpec,t3_bb2iwx,t3_bb2iwx,1,1577067441,0,0,f0k1hcc,Blind,,,,,
571,"I have a question about greeting. I'm from Europe, so it's quite common to greet people with a hug and/or cheek kisses (also when meeting them for the first time, 2-3 kisses if they are e.g. friends of friends). 

I once saw a doncumentary about a guy with no arms. He explained how people are more likely to hug him as a greeting, because (as he explains it) they don't want him to think they are uncomfortable with the situation, even if it would be more appropriate to give them a hand shake (e.g. for business meetings). He explains that he is also not always comfortable with hugging random people (which is understandable), so a preferred greeting is apperantly    a Squeeze on his shoulder. 

I'm wondering right now, is there a general way ""blind"" people (in any degree) prefer to be greeted or a way that is common to greet between not fully sighted people. I imagine getting random hugs from people when you are not expecting it can be a little surprising. 

I am happy for all the responses in this thread :) I personally don't know any ""blind"" people and I'm curious.

I always make sure to say hello and announce my name as I’m entering a space or when someone comes in to a room I am in. I also let them know if I’m about to leave the room or move anything around (furniture primarily). 

I am able to use visual cues in response to their actions regarding any touch (handshake/high five/fist bump). If someone reaches a handout, I’ll shake it. In the event I want to initiate the shake, a soft hand grab on the forearm is enough for them to know my intentions.

634,"&gt;Knife guides are possibly valuable for newly blind people who still wish to cook, but they should only be considered a temporary crutch if it can at all be helped.  There are multiple techniques and methods for chopping safely as a visually impaired person which already exist and require no extra tools, but knuckle guards and non slip cutting boardsare already soled in the mainstream market if they are helpful.  
&gt;  
&gt;Burns are similarly quite easy to avoid with common sense and patients in most cases.  Yes, it takes training or trial and error, but even touching most food while it's cooking shortly doesn't cause a burn, and touching even the inside of a hot pan unless it's full of extremely hot frying oil rarely does mroe than cause a slightly painful singe that is forgotten within a few hours at most.  
&gt;  
&gt;Grippy tongs, long silicone oven mitts with textured hand grips, dual handled frying pans, splatter guards, these things already exist and can help us augment our other skills and techniques if necessary.  
&gt;  
&gt;So designing new tools isn't really what's needed for the most part, unless your making what already exists cheaper and more available, such as talking thermometers.  No what we really need are simple improvements to existing devices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Touchscreens with no raised lines or small dips/bubbles to feel when you've moved from one button to another, and dials that spin for ever and have no stops at either end can fuck right off, along with those controls on some ovens where you don't even touch them but use gestures near the surface.  
&gt;  
&gt;When changing a value such as temperature, there should always be beeps for each press, and ideally, different sounds/pitched beeps for reaching the minimum and maximum setting.  If you can use easily differentiated tones for other controls so that you don't get them mixed up, that's even better.  E.G. temperature and time sound different from each other in some way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having long alert beeps for preheat temperature being reached (even if the oven was already on and you've since changed the temperature) are also important, and a clear way of knowing when the oven has been turned on or off is vital for safety.  
&gt;  
&gt;Click stops for dials are great especially if it's only for common increments such as every 25F past 250.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having a physical pointer embossed into or shaped into knobs, witha clear difference between one end of the pointer and the other (such as a sharp taper) really helps too.  
&gt;  
&gt;With flush stove tops which have no traditional burners (such as on induction cookers) having a tactile ring helps us to center pots.  It doesn't need to be anything much, just something we can feel like a dotted line or tiny ridge around each one, nothing tall enough to truly interfere with the smoothness.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ideally, the most important settings/numbers around the outside of the dial (the non moving part) would be engraved, have small dots or raised lines, or even better, have braille labels on them, which should be allot mroe common than it is with the advent of 3D printing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of these things apply equally to toaster ovens, microwaves, ETC as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Standardizing the use of braille on measuring cups and measuring spoons (such as on the handle just before the bowl part) is a long time coming, but still isn't there yet sadly.  
&gt;  
&gt;When ever orientation is important for proper usage, any orientation markings, arrows ETC should be tactile as well, and preferably located in an obvious place on the device.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any physical buttons/switches should have their identification symbols made tactile, either via engraving or raised print.  
&gt;  
&gt;Packaging should be marked when possible in some way to show which side should be opened, as it isn't always obvious.  Standardizing the marking/location would help with this allot.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can't think of any more right now but I know I'm only just scratching the surface.  Look at what some countries in Europe are doing and you will see how pathetically far behind other supposedly civilized countries are.  At this point, these things should be a standard part of the manufacturing process chain, and not even questioned at all, but apparently stamping out the likely insignificant additional costs of doing this is worth the time of corporate lobbyists and pencil pushers, and government officials are willing to take their word for it instead of funding research on the issue for them selves.  Yes, not all materials necessarily make this possible, but more than you might think, and with people actually bothering to try I think we could find alternative methods.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, the most important thing is to get experienced blind cookings to do in depth physical testing for you, weather at home or in test kitchens with a range of scenarios and vision levels, and to take their advice into major consideration when developing solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your interest and good luck.  I doubt your work will change anything as it's been this way for far, far too long, but even if I just educate you and possibly cause you to become interested in helping solve these problems, it's worth my time already.

642,"Partially mirroring what u/jrs12 says, in terms of hardware devices, it's easy for any device to lose out to other behaviours or assistive tech (e.g. folding canes) that blind individuals already adopt.

For instance, for your specific hardware idea, from the outset something like the 'tile key finder' seems ideal, you can attach acoustic tiles on your important objects and then use your phone to make them ring and hence make them easy to track and find. But I've not yet heard of a blind user of these, in my interviews this kind of technology is viewed really holistically - e.g. knowing of the tech, the process of getting the device, spending money on it, maintaining it / charging it, learning to use a new app, remembering to use it, and actually using it has to be seen as a better experience than the alternative (e.g. just remembering where you left objects). Also in the home, 'finding' objects regularly isn't usually the main issue, and you can always lose objects you forgot to 'tile.' Your friend will likely learn to adopt behaviours and strategies that negate the need for this kind of assistive technology in the first place.

In my own line of work (sensory substitution) the devices that gain the most enthusiasm tend to be 'digital canes' like the sunu band, enactive torch or EyeCane, which are simple to use and can paint out the 3D space around them giving the walls a real presence and it can be an enjoyable experience. Anything more complicated than that tend to drop off a cliff adoption wise, still there are lots of potential options between the digital cane and full 'vision-into-sound' technology, and I would say I'm more optimistic on this technology than u/jrs12 is, as there are excellent distance sensors, thermal cams, and computer-vision algorithms that have not yet made their way into everyday assistive tech. I've had blind users get extremely enthusiastic about thermal cams for instance.

731,"Again, selective mutism (SM) is a severe situational anxiety disorder characterized by the inability to speak and communicate in certain social settings (school, work, parties, everyday errands, etc) due to severe anxiety. They are able to speak and communicate in settings where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. People with SM experience such severe anxiety in the aforementioned social settings that their vocal cords become paralyzed, making speech impossible. It feels like the words are stuck, and no matter how hard you try you can’t speak. And if you do try to speak, no sound comes out. 

Elective mutism however, is deliberate and voluntary. Elective mutism is actually the dated term for SM. Until the 1990s, it was called elective mutism because psychologists thought people with SM chose to be mute. But then they realized that’s not true by any means, so they changed the name to selective mutism. The word “selective” doesn’t mean choice, but rather “certain”. As in their mutism is present in select/certain situations that trigger anxiety.",,,,P00ld3ad,,,1569555275,t5_2qpec,t3_d9gc0u,t1_f1lhjfk,2,1577717132,0,0,f1lhw3g,Blind,,,,,

Apple products are probably the best for accessibility needs, they have a TON of built in features.  [click here](https://support.apple.com/accessibility)  for a high level overview.  They also have a 24/7 support line with employees trained to assist with any questions regarding the features. 

Phone number:  (877) 204–3930 

The advisors who work that department are extremely dedicated, patient and helpful (I used to be one!)

The hardest thing for a sighted person to handle when they are helping a  VI person;  sighted people use shapes or colors, VI people need names, quadrants. Things like that. If you are both apple users. You can turn on voiceover on your phone and navigate it, doing so will be INVALUABLE when your sister may need help. 

Also please encourage her to call Apple now, the advisors on that team will be extremely willing to help. They will not treat her loss of vision as a bad thing, but rather just another thing. If it is degenerative, they can help with setting to make the transition easier. 

If she is a windows user, window-eyes is the best screen reader. Other options include NVDA, and JAWS I would caution  against JAWS simply because it costs money to upgrade any version and the original license is pricey.  Make sure that her computer is newer say less than 3 years, just because of how hard the programs are in the hardware. 

If she is willing  to switch or open to using a Mac, go to a Best Buy or apple store and let her play around on one. There are hundreds of nuanced settings for VI users. A Mac Mini is $600 and will have all the accessibility features of any other Mac so price isn’t too bad there. 

If she is an avid reader there is a fantastic app called BARD mobile. It is created and managed by the library of Congress. 

There are also a bunch of OCR apps to help with reading written text, determine what kind of dollar bill you are holding. Even some for gps instructions that are designed around VI users.

Exactly! She wants to get her sight back in order to be this fully realized warrior, but that's at the beginning/middle of the story.

&gt;If seeing is so crucial to military enlistment, why would anyone give her a chance at all if she has to have a magical device in order to fight?

She was supposed to be exceptional due to her immense magical reserves like her father and brother, but she wasn't born with it.

763,"I had to do some digging to find the experiment my professor was talking about. 

Basically this man was in a car accident and suffered damage to his visual cortex. His eyes however, were perfect. Doctors were puzzled as to how he could not consciously see (this was before they knew so much about the human brain and how it processes images). 

So the experiment went something like this: the man walked across a room (no string) and made it across. They hung a string across the center of the room and asked him to walk back to the other side. When he got a few feet away from the string, he ducked down. He told the doctors that it was almost like a reflex, he didn’t consciously know what he was doing. 

His eyes were functioning so his brain could see that there was an obstacle, but because of the damage to his visual cortex he couldn’t consciously see it. Instead he was guided by his own unconscious visual cues. It’s called blindsight, or subconscious sight. 

I’ll admit that I was wrong, and that example is a completely different situation when talking about a progressive eye disease or blindness due to some type of dysfunction in the eye. That’s my bad!

769,"Losing your sight is one of the most difficult things we can deal with, I am so glad your sister has someone working with her on this. There are resources available, and lots of good advice already posted- here are a couple more things I've found helpful.

First, a blog post from an individual who lost her sight, and what it was like coming to terms and learning to live with blindness. It was a powerful read, and the author is someone I really enjoy: [https://tink.uk/losing-sight/](https://tink.uk/losing-sight/)

Second, I don't know where you're located, but here in the SF Bay Area we have an organization that helps people ""learn how to be blind"" and offers all kinds of support and information. They are called ""Lighthouse for the Blind"" ([http://lighthouse-sf.org/](http://lighthouse-sf.org/)). Maybe they can help you find some similar entity in your area if you're not in the SF Bay area. 

I've found there are lots of tactile tricks and techniques for living without sight. Coming up with strategies for storage and organization that are based on feel rather than sight can be challenging at first, but often a simple trick or low-tech solution can help. 

Rather than bringing your phone into the shower and trying to read the labels of your shampoo and conditioner, a simple rubber band can help you distinguish between them quickly and without ruining your phone. 

Folding money a certain  way based on whether it's a five, ten or single is another technique I know that lots of individuals who are blind use.

Certainly learn about computer accessibility, and start sooner than later. It is emotionally exhausting to lose your sight, and I believe the challenge of learning how to use a screen reader is much more easily met when you are able to practice with some sight remaining. 

One practical aspect lots of people miss is the ability to touch type- or more accurately, keyboard. Have her memorize the keyboard, get one of the typing tutor programs, and go beyond the alphabet, help her learn the function and memorize all the other keys as well.

Most importantly, just continue to be loving and supportive. Patience and kindness will go far, as will a heaping helping of forgiveness. It will be a long journey, and your sister might not always remember how lucky she is to have you. Be strong, and she will find her way to independence and enjoying life.

832,"Hmm. I’ve never thought of that before. My best friend who is totally blind, is also pretty stoic - so he doesn’t have facial expressions, besides laughter. He went blind about 9 years ago, so he certainly learned facial expressions before that and just chooses not to express himself that way. No one has a problem with it.

I have two cousins born blind, zero sight, and they get little smirks and smiles and laugh all normally. I’m not aware of anyone teaching them this, but we described movies pretty well, so maybe they picked up on it.

I don’t think it matters. We (the blind) still have tone, and people can adjust to our individual mannerisms and personality without too much trouble. (Some people are expressive, some aren’t - and their brains already handle that). But if it’s really important to you, by all means practice with a friend or family member.

My family is large, I have 5 siblings. Everyone had gotten together at Disneyland for a sort of reunion. One sister had 3 kids and busy, another sister had gotten engaged the day before. So when I sat down after a ride for hours, no one even noticed I was gone. My retina had torn. I had worked for an eye center for awhile, I knew these symptoms were bad, and I kept trying to remember what they meant. I called my eye dr, and they won’t say anything (in the US) without seeing you, so I just sat, confused and in pain. I didn’t know I was in shock, and I didn’t know what to do at a theme park. We were staying at a beach in tents, no roads, I hadn’t used Uber or Lyft yet.

I am trying to build 3D crafts lately. Leather is my favorite medium at the moment. Veggie tan leather will keep its shape after you get it wet, and since you can cut and river together, you have a lot of possibilities! I have a friend who makes the most gorgeous little dragons. I can spray paint my leather too, so I don’t miss painting!

I also get some enjoyment from cooking. I make up my own recipes like Snickerdoodle Cheesecake :-D it’s so good!

My family is large, I have 5 siblings. Everyone had gotten together at Disneyland for a sort of reunion. One sister had 3 kids and busy, another sister had gotten engaged the day before. So when I sat down after a ride for hours, no one even noticed I was gone. My retina had torn. I had worked for an eye center for awhile, I knew these symptoms were bad, and I kept trying to remember what they meant. I called my eye dr, and they won’t say anything (in the <LOCATION>) without seeing you, so I just sat, confused and in pain. I didn’t know I was in shock, and I didn’t know what to do at a theme park. We were staying at a beach in tents, no roads, I hadn’t used Uber or Lyft yet.

841,"I have been going blind slowly for 9 years. I am now legally blind, and only see clearly a few inches away - in one eye (other is gone). I didn’t notice any change to other senses at first, but I absolutely have the best ears in the world now. Someone can shut a car door down the street and I think someone is in front of MY house. 

Extra:   It’s always been odd to me that my brain improved my ears, but didn’t auto-adjust to the new distances. Why can’t I tell the noise is 100 ft away? Or maybe my brains working on it.

There IS an extra sense I can’t explain... like I’ll just KNOW when I’m about to hit my head on something...  (and no, no hair brushed on anything). I just stop in my tracks and look / feel around. I’ve just sort of thought it was fairies - I literally have no other idea what it could be, and have never mentioned it before.

Extra:   Same goes for when I’m looking for something. Scissors for example. I just had them, where’d I put them? It could be in multiple rooms... and I just outloud say “anybody see my scissors?” And every time I’m pulled toward them. I just KNOW where-ish to look. Again, I thought it was fairies.

Mental Images:
I have a (fully) blind friend who remembers colors and everything, but I’m losing faces and things. I’m remembering sizes and shapes okay... but I have to work hard to pull up things I used to remember - people, places, fav movies. This concerns me since my vision isn’t even all gone, but it’s been bad for years so I guess my brain is weeding it out.

Or, another possibility is my blindness comes with PAIN. A lot of pain. The interior of your eye has no nerves, but I have a great deal of horrible light sensitivity, and my eye muscles also become inflamed. I can’t take blood thinners (to help) as that could worsen my vision (interior bleeding). So for years I’ve had lots of bouts of mind shattering pain, and that definitely causes some memory loss - at least for me.

Stigmatism:
So far, no one has been unkind to me, even strangers, about my loss or limitations. However I have been very unkind to myself. I’d been an artist, so my identity was absolutely lost as the vision. That takes years to re-build. I lost my job a month ago, and that re-awoke a lot of inner turmoil as well. I’d always planned to kill myself at this visual level - not out of anger, just because I don’t believe this world has anything left I’m interested in. It’s hard to explain via text without sounding suicidal - it was just a decision I’d made years ago.

However, I just got married. He makes a lot of money so I don’t have to feel guilty. He’s shockingly good at describing the world around me, the couples, colors, interactions (his mom is an author, that might be why). And now I’m having a baby. So now I can’t just die, and I’m trying to accept the anger at my limitations instead.

So my point is, you might know a lot of happy, capable blind people - but don’t assume that’s normal, or easy. Pain, personality, support, adaptability....  it’s going to be different for everyone. If I hadn’t been an artist, it would’ve been easier. If my family had believed in my illness, THAT would’ve been easier. But if I’d been an introvert who didn’t know how to ask for help? That would’ve made all this a HELL of a lot harder.

859,"1.  I hope you are seeing an eye dr. Most blindness is preventable, if caught early. They may even be able to predict how much your vision will change (with age) and show you on those eye glass machines.

2.  Age sucks in general. Bad back, arthritis...  bad vision is just one more thing to adjust to. And fortunately, there is a lot of support for age-related vision loss :-) I know cuz I was excluded from a LOT of support groups cuz I’m not old, lol!

3.  I don’t know how hard it will be for you to adjust. It was hard for me, but I’m still going through it. Keep good friends, get some hobbies that don’t need vision (like audio books, a musical instrument). Especially friends though. Having a support network will make everything easier.

4.  Practice. You can close your eyes or wear a blindfold RIGHT NOW to get used to what you can / can’t do! Don’t be afraid of it, especially when you can prepare right now! It’s not like losing a limb or throwing out your back - you can develop skills now.

5.  Lastly, let yourself feel emotion. If it’s sad, hard, or angry, don’t freaking bottle that up! You’ll turn into a beast or poison. Journal. Sing. Get some therapy if you can - get yourself right, or centered.

897,"&gt; Is there one sense in particular you feel has overly compensated? Like you can hear, feel, or smell where certain things or people are?

No, and I really wish this myth would die a death. Granted I was born blind rather than lose my sight later in life, but having known way too many people who've done the latter, still no. I do think we learn to pay attention to our other senses more, however. You may dismiss something as background white noise, whereas to me that's a detail or clue about what's around me. People who've lost their sight later in life are potentially still developing that skill. Like any other skill, not everyone--whether born blind or gone blind otherwise--will have the same level of capability. End of the day, it all comes down to observation/perception skills. If you're not an observant person, you'll miss details. It doesn't matter if those details are visual or auditory.

&gt; Do you have any instincts or reflexes that you’d expect only someone with vision to react with? (Inherently knowing there is an obstacle and being able to avoid it)

You could say that. I call it facial perception. Other people call it spacial awareness. Either way, I can tell without making contact with a wall that there's a wall there. Certain objects (note: not string, sorry prof) I can tell will be in my way and can try to avoid them. The same ability allows me to know when aspects of environment change--for example, when a hallway widens up into a more open area. If I know an area well enough (my apartment, my parents' place), I can navigate with no mobility aids at all and just rely on things like that facial perception.

&gt; Are you able to remember what things, people or places look like with mental images? Or do your other senses paint a better picture?

This is a tricky question. Never having had sight, I've never known what people, places and things look like--not in the same way you do, at least. But after 30+ years of being blind, I like to think I've gotten pretty freaking good at developing my own ideas of a place based on what's available to me. For instance, when I first moved to this city, there were two exactly identical apartment buildings next door to one another. My key opened the front doors to both buildings. I walked into the wrong one by mistake, and knew almost immediately. don't ask me how, because I couldn't tell you, but I got about a quarter the way down the hall and something felt slightly off. When I went next door, I knew why. Also, mental maps are a thing. Go to a particular place long enough, especially if you usually take the same route to get there, and you'll begin to pick up on particular details that come in handy as landmarks. Say you and a friend are walking to the bank for reasons. You're chatting away, and you pass by a parking lot with a water fountain in it. If you've done that route often enough, something in the back of your mind will ping very loudly and remind you that gee, perhaps you should have made a left when you passed that. Or perhaps that's just me.

&gt; And finally, do you feel there’s a stigma surrounding blindness? I hear a lot of people say that if they were to suddenly lose vision their “life would be over” but I’ve seen so many people adjust really well and in most cases continue living their normal everyday lives. What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

It's easy to not comprehend how you would do something without sight if you've never had to do something without sight. Putting on a blindfold for a day just doesn't count, as much as some folks would like it to. Life's hard. It's harder still when 1: you have to relearn how to do pretty much everything (this doesn't apply to me), and 2: you have to have the exact same arguments/conversations/discussions/whatever you want to call them with people who are as convinced you can't do X, Y and Z as you are they're wrong (this applies to me in so, so many ways). As you can imagine, this definitely translates to a stigma of sorts. And it's all over the place--including, depending on the jurisdiction, in education. But not just. Employment, accessing government services, daily interactions with people in general, it's really never very far away. What that looks like depends on the situation, but always comes back to a perception of blindness as being incapable. I've always said I don't suffer from my disability, but from people's perception of my disability. I believe that to be entirely and completely 100% the truth. I've had two jobs, and been to college. Those are probably my 3 biggest challenges--in all 3 cases, step 1 was overcome people's concerns about how well I'd do not being able to see. Unfortunately, this is a stigma that isn't helped by members of the very blind community it affects. There are lazy blind people. There are blind people who either choose not to do for themselves, or who've never been shown they can do for themselves. There are blind people who have never worked a day in their life, and couldn't do a job if you paid someone to hire them. And there are blind people who are perfectly happy being part of that group. I like to think they're a small minority, but it only takes one. I had to work against a member of that minority when I took the college program I did. He took that program previously, and expected people to instinctively know how he needed accommodating. This ended as you would expect--he flamed spectacularly out of that program. But because of their experience dealing with him, they were concerned about me. Once I established what had them so concerned (what I said above), it was incredibly easy to blow those concerns out of the water. I completed that program, with decent grades, and after semester 1 didn't hear so much as a word about the person who took the program before me. I'd like to say the story ends there, but it really doesn't. Every day, someone new needs an education. Some of them are willing to listen. Others not so much. I can't do much about that, and that's I think what irritates me more than anything else, but the ones who are interested in learning are usually the easiest to work with. The rest of them aren't worth my time.

Do programs that translate text into sound Also translate emojis? O: 

I could tell that the martial artists there were chill when I was little but they were all adults because I just couldn't be in the kid group and no teenage group was available.. I could sense that the adults thought I was strange for being there though, not in a bad way, just like.. unique? Also I'm a girl and I don't think I remember many woman there unfortunately. Maybe it is different today. I am starting to see life from a different angle. Even Satan used to be an Angel.

Are you me? Always ""turn your brain off, calm down, relax.."" it feels like they are saying shut up in the way they say it with the look on their face.

I am, always have been curious, but noone would have an honest conversation with me. I kept stepping on everyones toes. That's why I always felt like the clumsiest ballerina alive.

Ohh wait, but the boy who turned blind in the documentary, he clicked his tongue I think. I could just walk up to my forest near me and try it. But maybe I should search it up again, it was probably like 10 years ago that I saw it.

Radar, sonar.. I have watched a documentary a long time ago as a little girl, about a boy who could echo-locate. it fascinated me then and it still does. I am trying to imagine it when I close my eyes and sing.

Edit: I have always imagined that you who are blind can see the world for what it truely is. I am stuck with seeing the world in language, in the words that are put on things and then I will always see that object that same way.. hopefully not forever but for me an apple will probably now always look like just another apple, if I don't pay attention to it.

Edit 2: This is why I'm trying to pay attention to it. It isn't just another apple. Also, another thought popped up now, this is probably why different languages is so dear to me.

928,"Holy shit, yes you thoughts and feelings around ""everything"" is indeed something I think I have shared before. But I would never have put it into those words like that. And as a person with eyes, I only see the world in words apparently. I am starting to see that now. I know what you mean, you are not ""magical"". But you sound more ""intelligent"" in a way. Your visualization intelligence (is that a thing or did I just make that up?) seems through the roof. We are all feeling it yes, but you are putting such a huge existential crisis thought into a movie in my head that I didn't even know I could have there. I imagined it in a way I never have. But you put words on the reason why I am having trouble sleeping at night. We need to change our ways. I don't know if you can listen to or read any of my posts because they seem to be hidden for everyone but me for some reason but this is what I want help pondering. 

How do we change for the better? How can I do anything to change anything for the better?

I have been feeling myself relate more and more to you humans who are treated like you have disabilities. But personally I feel it should be said more like: you have these abilities = (random strengths you have that others don't, also ofcourse weaknesses but you got to give and take, like a video game, there is a finite number of points and you sound like you put yours in imagination and at the same time honesty. This is what I meant with I think you who are blind see the world for what it really is. I can be fed images over and over and over, TV, commercials, instagram, blablablabla, and now suddenly I will have been brainwashed to think a ceratin way.

But you seem to have skipped the brainwashing part (I have too because I don't watch TV, commercials, social media, etc) but I chose to. Some don't even know that maybe they should choose not to. Maybe if everyone starting thinking for themselves instead we would be in a much better place as you say.

I see what you are saying, if I romanticize you I will putting you further away from me and you want to be treated as you are, human as anyone else. But I'm not. I do these for every person, I try to see their strengths and weaknesses and listen to what they have to say. Thank you by the way for this incredible text. If it's okay I will be saving it on my PC with my own texts, but not to steal it or anything, I just want to bounce my own similar ideas off of them.

It's good that you are trying to make me aware, I am on the same wavelength there. Awareness is the key. Really listening to someone, even if it might not be easy to hear what they have to say. 

I have never talked to or met a blind person before today so I know what you mean with the division. I may be considered able bodied however but most neurotypical people would see me as not able brained. Or abled of emotion is probably the right word for it. I was always told growing up that since I have aspergers, since I was so stubborn, since I always caused upset wherever I went that I must be unable to understand peoples emotions. That is the opposite. I read about new research yesterday that goes perfectly along with my entire life experience, me, I am actually too emotional, thinking too much, unable to stop. But since I would make people angry with the way I was always honest and making people worried with how I showed emotion so intenesely. My little kid brain decided that I would just not speak and put on a blank mask, escaping into my own dreamworld. I never played with the other kids (only my best friend at the time because she would let me be myself and she didn't bat an eye while truely accepting who I was), I never hung out with my family. I just wrote, text after text, drew picture after picture. Trying to escape into some sort of safe bubble, but I ""escaped"" into a prison. An echo chamber with my own thoughts. And now when I love myself enough to have set myself free, I decided I am going to speak again. No more filter, no more mask, no more bubble. But it is having it's downsides too.

Like when I was small, people will be angry with me if I speak the truth. They will expect me to never cry, then when I have a breakdown and bawl from the pressure, they will be worried and ask if I am mentally unwell. 

It is like this frustrating dance of me, the kid who wasn't a kid on the inside, having to tip toe around every other adult and child who just wouldn't look the truth in the eye. Never looking in the mirror. I see now why, I see now why. They mean no harm. They mean well, but they arent used to seeing the world in certain aspects like someone like you would for example.

Basically people aren't used to raw, real, reality. They need it to be sugarcoated and filtered and prettified and numbed down by sugary drinks and action flicks who keep their minds occupied from the fact that we need to do something.

We need to look at each other with honest hearts and just fucking do something. Something positive. Change. Stop being fed what they want you to think, is all I want to scream. I don't know how I have this tiny bit stronger resiliance against it, I always have, but it has kept me unable to lie, I would just not speak at all if given the choice. 

I want to know how to convey my only well meaning wishes to people without them taking offense or becoming uncomfortable.

That is my quest, I think the key is the images we use, the language we use. And the compassion we try to convey them with.

You mentioned 80% chance of nothing happening. If it is the study that I recall correctly, the statistic is 22% ended up with visual accuity as bad as 20/100. I should mention that 20/100 doesn't qualify as legal blindness, and still retains a fair bit of vision.

1110,"Yeah but the damn thing burnt out on me, not my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

What it takes is practice. Don't try long flights at first, just do short ones and listen to the thing. Can you hear the air coming out of it, and if so, does it seem to be coming the same way. What you're trying to do is see if the trim is set right. If it isn't, this is gonna lead to you crashing all the time because the thing will drift to one side or the other. This is the first thing I recommend you focus on, because it will make your flying experience so much better if you get it set right. If yours has a knob, just try to turn it in slight increments, if it has buttons for the trim, press once in the direction opposite it drifts, so if it's drifting left, hit your right trim to balance it out. Do this until it's relatively straight, don't worry about tiny drifts.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, you want to start working on realizing when the thing is near stuff. Don't worry so much about crashes. The little guards around the blades will take your impacts.

&amp;#x200B;

Try not to fly too high. If you hit the ceiling, just throttle all the way down and let the drone fall. The reason being is that when the blades get too close to the ceiling, it's creating this suction force that yanks the drone up to the ceiling and it will stick there. When you get more advanced, you can start messing with throttling down all the way, then adding some power once the drone starts to fall, but for now, just let it drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Start playing with varying degrees of input to make turns. See how much it takes to say, turn the drone about 90 degrees or so. Avoid a lot of input, it just takes gentle manipulation to make it start forward or turn. If you give too much input, you will end up turning much harder than you want and probably will end up crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

When you notice a lack of power, land the thing. It's needing a new battery or recharge. Don't hold out until the last second, you've got enough to bring it in gently and don't need to just cut power. In fact, other than the ceiling thing, I wouldn't recommend cutting power in the air, you'll just incur unnecessary crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

Buy a cheap one. Don't worry about quality or anything like that, you might end up breaking it, but you don't want to buy an expensive one and bang the hell out of it at first. That's why I wasn't heart broken when mine burnt out. It lost the one blade motor,. so it couldn't fly because it had only 3 working blades.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I can say is do not fly it outside even if the one you get says it can handle outdoors flight. You will lose the thing. Wind currents will push it off course and you might not be able to get it back to you. Once you get comfortable with flying, if you want to risk it, I mean that's your business, but I wouldn't recommend this at first. The drone that I got was a little microdrone which could handle it and I did it outdoors and it really went flying even at the slightest wind.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and be careful how you insert your battery. Don't leave hanging wires. When you take out the battery, be damned sure you do not pull on the wire from either end. These are soldered right in there on the board and will break without too much force, so always pull on the connector to unplug the battery. You'll maybe have to get a nail under where the two connectors meet and pull out, but always put that force on the two connectors which are made to take the stress, not the wires.

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing regarding the transmitter. First of all, always turn that on first before you insert the battery into the drone. This is a safety thing because if something happens, you can just bind and throttle down. Secondly, if you do have buttons to operate the trim, some transmitters let you reset it by pressing both the left and right buttons simultaneously.",,,,bscross32,,,1569003395,t5_2qpec,t3_d6xlvz,t3_d6xlvz,7,1577280713,0,0,f0wbay6,Blind,,,,,

1128,"Is this all there is? How can we unlock the higher levels of being where we can shed our corporeal bodies and travel the multiverse in all its forms and dimensions. How can we learn to manipulate the space around us, to travel faster than light, to learn to manipulate time. Maybe FTL is really beyond possible, and we would need to concentrate on something like space folding to traverse vast distances. What if all that we are is like one big nexus to all that we could be?Everything we do, say, or even think. Everything we do creates millions of forces and counterforces. Then, we need to face the possible reality that every decision we've ever not made has been made by someone in a parallel universe and all the universes form the one large multiverse.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming back to the nexus, can we learn how to control our thoughts? Can we learn to unite the people of Earth so that our purpose becomes one. If so, how long will it take. At a 100 years I would estimate, but that's fairly generous and it will probably be more.

We cast ourselves out into space with our instruments. We probe using our telescopes out into other galaxies, nebulae and other solar systems. We want to know why other life is not presenting itself to us. But who are we that makes us important enough to warrant attention.

What if they don't want to know us. Would you want to know us in the state we are now if you saw things from the outside looking in? Give us a thousand more years maybe, but right now, even at the best, we're still half savage.

From their point of observation, centuries on Earth may pass as seconds for them. If so, could you still not see the savagery? It's funny that we fight to cure things like cancer, but our species is the cancer right now. Think about it. Cancer is invasive to the body and the immune system doesn't know how to effectively deal with it because the cancer cells are tricking it to think they are friend when they really are foe. Now, imagine you, as the lifeforms we have never seen. You are at your post on a station that's been made invisible to the Earth people. You see things on your screen passing rapidly by. We go from the roman days to gladiatorial combat to the early 1800s, and then you start to see the technology. Look at the explosion of technology from 1900 to 2000. We actually learned how to fly and the first automobile came out in mass production in 1903. Imagine that a bit differently. A baby learns to crawl and walk in the same day. Give it a bit more than a decade and our flying machines are being used to shoot down other flying machines. The same will happen later on in the 40's as well, but then, we learned to split the atom, and we dropped bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Look at the concrete encroaching from your post. Look at the animals forced from the habitats and having to either fall back or learn to adapt and survive in an urban environment. The Earth is the body and we are the invaders. So, now your supervisor calls down to you and puts the decision in your hand to make first contact with Earth. Would you do it?

Now onto the meat of the post. OP, is this what you wanted? Because I'm hardly the first to think along these lines. Just because I have a visual impairment doesn't make me some oracle of wisdom.

Through the video we are told that she is very talented, acting - music - sculpture - dance, and less subtly that she is sight impaired, clumsily walking with a short white cane someone gives her (I think her tapping technique improves later),  eventually we see her reading a large book of braille which drives the point home. 

At the same time the teacher (Lionel Richie) sings of his unrequited love as he watches her in various classes and tries unsuccessfully to get closer, even speechlessly calling her at her own home. I think you could call this stalking nowadays. 

This is the point the link above jumps to.

The teacher is summoned to the sculpture classroom where he finds the young woman has completed a life like bust in red clay of the teacher.

""I wanted you to see it so many times, but I finally think it is done"", she says.

""Tell me what you think of it?""

He responds, ""Oh, its wonderful.""

""This is how I see you!"", she implores as she reaches out and feels his face.

There is a hiatus as the guitar sings and weeps.

Suddenly Lionel pulls her hands from his face and starts singing again, ""Hello. Is it me you're looking for?""
Fade to black.

I found this thread on the Times Educational Supplement (TES) forum [Calculators for visually impaired in external exams](https://community.tes.com/threads/calculators-for-visually-impaired-in-external-exams.501639/)

One interesting suggestion is to use the Texas Instruments ""Viewpanel"" device which is meant for displaying calculator screens on an Over Head Projector but someone suggests it might work for direct viewing with a white background.

TI also make a device called the [TI Presenter](https://education.ti.com/en/product-resources/presentation-tools-how-to-use) which will output the calculator display to a TV or other video device via a composite video connection (usually a yellow coloured connector on a co-ax lead).

For both these solutions you need either an adaptor cable for a student TI calculator or the ""teacher"" version of a TI calculator.

This doesn't help with the need for big buttons.

Another option the thread comes up with is using a locked down Ipad and a Ti-89 emulator or a [talking scientific calculator](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talking-scientific-calculator/id411433609)

&gt; But since exam boards do approve iPads (when properly locked down, obviously) for candidates with various other SENs, I can't see this would be impossible.

Tests should be both a measure of learning and a learning experience—tests where you skip can't complete the questions in an accessible way are not a measure of how well you have understood the material (which means that you may think you know more than you know or vice versa), and you cannot reflect on what areas you need to revise if you can't complete questions to know you need to revise certain material.

I would also suggest looking into whether you can get a refund on your textbook. I don't live in the <LOCATION>, but in the country where I live, there's a law saying that buying a product that does not fulfill its purpose can be refunded or exchanged. If you bought the book and were under the impression that it would be accessible, but it is not able to be accessed by you (see my wording there for the crux of the issue), then you have no use for it, and the company misled you into purchasing something you cannot use. You may wish to enquire on r/legaladvice whether there is such a law in your state, and if so, whether this kind of issue would be covered in the law.","[{'start': 811, 'end': 821, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 25, 'end': 35, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

It's mostly for those more annoying questions from well meaning but ignorant people, so that /r/blind doesn't get cluttered up with them as much.

At times we get some pretty interesting questions as well, some have definitely made me think or have been a challenge to answer.

It seems that at some point it was a joke sub?  Or at least that's what people say in their defense sometimes when they make the stupid unoriginal/unfunny keyboard mashing comments.

On the upside though, it's been made very clear that those kinds of posts are not welcome or appreciated there, and they've significantly reduced in frequency.

I'm the only mod there right now, since the other guy ran out on me, then tried to come back under an offensive name, and when I gently suggested he might want to change it if he wanted our sub to be taken seriously, he ghosted.  LOL

But yeah, if your ever feeling like answering some questions from sighted people and you don't want to try using google or the reddit search to find random old threads mentioning us, than feel free to refer anyone who has a question that can't be answered by the top post on this sub there, or come on in and try to answer some for your self.

If you wana be mad at something more tangible than be mad at the fact that so many blind people in supposedly civilized countries are still in this state in the first place, left out to dry with inadequate or stifling support, often from people who aren't really equipped or knowledgeable enough to do the job properly and with governments that would more often than not prefer to make it someone else's problem and refuse to conduct proper oversight of the system.

1259,"Knife guides are possibly valuable for newly blind people who still wish to cook, but they should only be considered a temporary crutch if it can at all be helped.  There are multiple techniques and methods for chopping safely as a visually impaired person which already exist and require no extra tools, but knuckle guards and non slip cutting boards are already soled in the mainstream market if they are helpful.

Burns are similarly quite easy to avoid with common sense and patients in most cases.  Yes, it takes training or trial and error, but even quickly touching most food while it's cooking doesn't cause a burn, and touching even the inside of a hot pan unless it's full of extremely hot frying oil rarely does more than cause a slightly painful singe that is forgotten within a few hours at most.

Grippy tongs, long silicone oven mitts with textured hand grips, dual handled frying pans, splatter guards, these things already exist and can help us augment our other skills and techniques if necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So designing new tools isn't really what's needed for the most part, unless your making what already exists cheaper and more available, such as talking thermometers.  No what we really need are simple improvements to existing devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Touchscreens with no raised lines or small dips/bubbles to feel when you've moved from one button to another, and dials that spin for ever and have no stops at either end can fuck right off, along with those controls on some ovens where you don't even touch them but use gestures near the surface.

When changing a value such as temperature, there should always be beeps for each press, and ideally, different sounds/pitched beeps for reaching the minimum and maximum setting.  If you can use easily differentiated tones for other controls so that you don't get them mixed up, that's even better.  E.G. temperature and time sound different from each other in some way.

Having long alert beeps for preheat temperature being reached (even if the oven was already on and you've since changed the temperature) are also important, and a clear way of knowing when the oven has been turned on or off is vital for safety.

Click stops for dials are great especially if it's only for common increments such as every 25F past 250.

Having a physical pointer embossed into or shaped into knobs, with a clear difference between one end of the pointer and the other (such as a sharp taper) really helps too.

With flush stove tops which have no traditional burners (such as on induction cookers) having a tactile ring helps us to center pots.  It doesn't need to be anything much, just something we can feel like a dotted line or tiny ridge around each one, nothing tall enough to truly interfere with the smoothness.

Ideally, the most important settings/numbers around the outside of the dial (the non moving part) would be engraved, have small dots or raised lines, or even better, have braille labels on them, which should be allot more common than it is with the advent of 3D printing.

Most of these things apply equally to toaster ovens, microwaves, ETC as well.

Standardizing the use of braille on measuring cups and measuring spoons (such as on the handle just before the bowl part) is a long time coming, but still isn't there yet sadly.

When ever orientation is important for proper usage, any orientation markings, arrows ETC should be tactile as well, and preferably located in an obvious place on the device.

Any physical buttons/switches should have their identification symbols made tactile, either via engraving or raised print.

Packaging should be marked when possible in some way to show which side should be opened, as it isn't always obvious.  Standardizing the marking/location would help with this allot.

Yes, not all materials necessarily make this possible, but more than you might think, and with people actually bothering to try I think we could find alternative methods.

I guess another thing I could add would be that, when possible, the recipe published online and on the product packaging should augment visual indicators of progress (when you see small bubbles popping every few seconds for simmering) or (when crust is golden brown) with tactile and audible indications such as (crunchy  texture) (soft bubbling sound) ETC.  I know this would cost more to print extra, and that sometimes it wouldn't fit well without shrinking the print to unacceptable levels, but online instructions wouldn't have those limitations.

Speaking of online product recipes, they aren't always easy to find for certain products.  I think at this point it should be required that they be easily findable if the company is big enough, even if a more central database needs to be built.

 But every decision I make I make with the knowledge that I have to accommodate my eyes. I am not defined by my eyes, but they have made me the way I am today.

It has shaped me and I have grown into someone who always thinks of others because no one thinks of me. And if I can help other people because I am looking out for those who feel like I do, then it is all worth it to me. Even if life is harder for me then for others. 

And my problems are out in the open, other people berry theirs, I can’t. And I think that’s a very good thing. Because I have to ask for help and that is not something I am good at.

1480,"&gt;I think the most important thing to take into account when writing a blind character would be describing things from the point of view of the other four senses.

Yeah, that's part of the idea, forcing myself to do something really different from before. I'd probably use sound as the most important sense, as you wouldn't really want to smell stuff in the middle ages and taste and touch are kinda hard to do at a distance.

&gt; the blind woman would be begging on corners

1481,"&gt; It's good to hear that you weren't going to go with the ""blind protagonist is motivated by getting vision""

I wouldn't want to write such a story, and can't even begin to imagine what it would be like. I personally think someone that's been blind for their whole life would have some serious problems adapting to suddenly having vision.

It's a small possible plotline I have though, my MC somehow getting trapping by an illusion, and then escaping because she knows its not reality, though depending on the character that could be real evil, so I'll have to think about it.

Such a storyline would be possible but pretty pointless in my world. Magic works by emulating beasts, so if she's trapped in said beasts illusion she could just copy the illusion(if she manages to escape and capture it), and trap herself in a reflection of the world around her, so there would be no real struggle or conflict.

&gt;I forget to describe how characters look completely and I don't know if that's an issue with readers or not.

I can imagine that's a very hard thing to think ofA, hell I can see and forget describing half of my characters. Even those that get an actual look are usually cut down to race, hair color(if there) and eyes.

&gt;Big buildings, for example, just have a presence to them

That's interesting, and could probably be exaggerated by the presence of magic.

&gt;I can usually tell which friend is taller than me and which is shorter by where their voices come from when we're talking.

That's something I would never personally think about, as I'm taller than just about anyone I know, but exactly one of the small things that make a story just a little bit better and allow for better immersion.",,,,Irrelevant75,,,1568511998,t5_2qpec,t3_d4ahba,t1_f09yrs6,2,1576896489,0,0,f0a90la,Blind,,,,,

1484,"First of all, thanks for the extensive reply.

&gt;what kind of blind you want your protagonist to be

I'd make her completely blind, something like being born with extensive damage to her optic nerve, rendering her completely blind, though she has some innate sense for the souls around her, due to the location of her birth, so she'd know when she's near living beings.

&gt;when filling my water bottle I use a combination of sound and touch to know when to turn the tap off.

That really helps, because I do the same when its dark but didnt think about making a connection to, so coming up with stuff like that shouldn't be as hard as I imagined.

&gt;If your society is feudal or patriarchal she might encounter a lot of ablest thinking - you can't be doing that, you're blind/a girl/a blind girl!

I hate patriarchal societies in fiction with magic, because it makes no actual sense for people to treat someone differently for being weaker physically when that same someone could set you on fire, though general discrimination against blind people would certainly be something that would probably happen far more often than in our own society.

&gt;Most blind people have their own unconscious tricks they develop to help them perform everyday tasks

Could you name some of these tricks?

&gt;Facial expressions, bumping into people, shaking hands, not recognising someone you should be able to recognise.

Those help immensely, I didnt think of a single one of those points, thanks.

&gt;Would she ask for help?

Probably, she's pretty shameless, and still a child at the start, and because her village is so small she doesn't actually know many people of her age, so she has a skewed perception of normal.

&gt;Consistency

Yeah, that's really important, but also the hardest to do, though my characters themselves are among the most consistent things in the world, though sometimes their magic reserves conveniently conform for the plot, something that won't be possible in my new world by the nature of its magic.

&gt;How will she navigate crowds of people?

Badly, she's from a small village and will only visit a big city later in the plot, so she will be completely out of her depth at first. It won't get better, as the society will be pretty backwards in this regard too.

There's also the small detail that sensing that many human souls will completely overload her soul-sense.

&gt;Bottom line here is that, although her disability doesn't define her as a character, it will define a lot of how she interacts with her world and her people.

Yeah, I think that will be a hard line to walk.

&gt;Good luck!

Thanks.",,,,Irrelevant75,,,1568510550,t5_2qpec,t3_d4ahba,t1_f09tf1b,3,1576894379,0,0,f0a4kyh,Blind,,,,,

* As I lose my vision I'm constantly surprised at how many things have no accessible options out there, especially when it's software, of all things.

1626,"All of the above and a few little gigantic things. 

When I was her age, I didn't know what I was missing.   I took every adult's word as law and didn't know I could push their limits.   If no one said anything about the blocks I could see sitting on a table outside where I was told I could be, I didn't acknowledge them.   They thought I couldn't see them and I KNEW I wasn't allowed there so I didn't tell them I knew.    It's a developmental thing, partly brain function and admittedly trauma/abuse, too but I've seen this pattern in many children without the trauma experiences.    What I try to teach parents is that the right words and supports from her trusted adults can squash any perception of dependence or existence through permission she may have picked up and give her the option and skills to find/expand her own limits.   This is a big part of self-advocacy, too.   

It sounds like you aren't thinking outside her vision limits. Ie: if no one tells her it's on her desk, she won't know because she can't see it.   She has hands.  She can and should use those to augment her field of vision.  Tell her what area is hers and encourage her to develop her own strategies for finding out what's there.  This is humongous at home where her life is far less constrained than at school.   Reinforce to teachers that they tell her when they've added something and where it is, yes, but this is her desk.  It's not hers through permission or description of someone else.  See the difference?   
She will not have a shadow facilitating the placement of every object in her life.  She will need this skill and it will boost confidence immediately.    There's a game I play. What Can You Find?  This isn't drudgery, btw.  It's a puzzle game.   Lay out some items on a table and let her discover and explore them.   It gives you ideas about her current skill level and where she needs encouragement.  It also teaches shape, texture, placement descriprions, direction, methods for distance measurement and gives her confidence in new situations.   You can level up with impromptu stories about the items or interactive play, too.  Remember, it's a game.  

For you parents, once she's made a space hers, respect it.   Leave things where she puts them.  This is huge.   We use muscle memory for finding things and that few inches can make a big difference when it's a pair of scissors.   It doesn't mean she gets to never put her toys/school stuff away, again.  It means she can find what she needs and put it where it belongs as prompted.   I was a meticulous room cleaner even when I was her age. 

She's going to be fine.  She has parents willing to ask and learn and advocate for her.",,,,FrankenGretchen,,,1567689668,t5_2qpec,t3_cztwt4,t3_cztwt4,2,1576168556,0,0,ez4nz63,Blind,,,,,
