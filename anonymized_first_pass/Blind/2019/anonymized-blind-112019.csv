My RP has had a much quicker progression than hers. For example, she's in her 40s n can still see some colors and can read normal sized font. While me on the other hand, I read at an 18 sized font and I'm colorblind and use a cane. She also has more peripheral vision than I do. I'm also 23.

I dont think some people realise the extent of my vision loss or what I have left, i paint and do a lot of art so that's another confused moment for some people, I've never liked the reaction of ""you paint really well... for a vision impaired person (or photograph well etc)

I never minded their impairments, they were always nice to me and went out of their way to include me in their family affairs. We met with out the love of books in the library of our school the first year she moved here. She loved audio books because reading constantly tired her eyes. So whenever she came over to stay the night we would always talk about what books we were reading and eventually during the night I would read a few chapters of my book to her so she could tell if she wanted to get the audio book. Secretly I think she just liked to listen to the sound of my voice sometimes. One year we both decided to get into fanfiction writing. It started off as a friendly competition that soon grew into the two of us growing closer and closer together as we each wrote stories for each other using each other’s favorite characters and reading them to each other.

75,"Honestly, yeah I do, but if I wasn't as lucky as I am, then I'd feel like much more of a burden.

At my school, we all get given iPads when we join, for FREE, and are expected to look after them and return them or buy them off of the school when we leave. I take good care of mine and without it, I would really struggle because I use it for taking photos of boards all the time. I also use it to view the PowerPoints/Google Slides when teachers actually remember to share stuff with me.

The reason I feel like a burden though is because teachers have to move out of the way of boards for me to take photos, which often disrupts lesson flow and I feel really awkward doing so. 

I try not to make a big deal out of my eyesight, which is probably why teachers never think to sit me near the front in lessons and my 'accessability arrangements' or whatever you want to call it are only just being implemented, despite me being at this school for 4 years. Teachers frequently ignore these arrangements, which makes work both more difficult for me and it makes me feel less valued relative to the rest of the class (bearing in mind I'm in classes with people who also need coloured paper or larger text).

I don't make a big deal of it because I try to be as nice and polite as possible, which often means I'm compromising to seem as nice as possible, but I can't bring myself to constantly be asking people to read dates, titles and stuff off of the board to me.

I like having a FitBit though - it makes it much easier for me since I have it configured to have the date on and my iPad is a godsent, aside from the fact it originally came out 7 years ago so the camera kinda sucks big time.",,,,Towster15,,,1574604053,t5_2qpec,t3_e0aay7,t3_e0aay7,1,1583720663,0,0,f8jt1w5,Blind,,,,,

Whilst I'm not visually impaired myself I work with people who are every day (it's my job to provide information and support for people with sightloss). 

One thing I have always found and was taught when I first started the job (aswell as at college) was that the loss of anything is horrible to experience and grief usually follows. I work with people who know that eventually they will lose all of their sight, some days it breaks them and they feel it's not worth it. But they then realise that even though they will eventually lose their sight there are people there to support them, people there who will listen to them and not judge them for how they feel. 

It is scary, it is somthing that will always play on your mind but what you must remember is people are there to help you, technology has come along way, we have devices that can tell you what currency you have in front of you, the colour of your clothes and more. You are bound to feel scared and upset in your condition and there is nothing wrong with that. It's what makes you human.

84,"No I didn’t, but at the time I was wary around dogs anyway. When we were just standing around chatting (we were at our halls saying goodbye, goodbye was half an hour long at the end) his dog started saying hello to me and I petted him. He told me straight away that I wasn’t supposed to, and I apologised, but he knew I only did it cause his dog initiated. He took the harness off right after that though cause it was obvious by that point we were gonna talk a bit more before saying goodbye (about 5-10 mins?). I never would’ve touched any dog, working or not, without permission anyway though. 

Also, I realised you also asked how friends and family reacted and I forgot to answer. Friends reacted great, much like me it wasn’t really a big deal. When my dad met him he was a bit weird tbh, asking lots of questions about his sight in a weird way. Came across as rude and intrusive. My mum was lovely. Overly cautious at times, like exclaiming, ‘watch the step!’ But he gets by fine with his cane or dog, she just gets really worried. 

My family is quite traditional. They might’ve thought stuff like, ‘how will he take care/protect her?’ Or ‘how will he support their family, be the man of the house’ type thing. But they’ve never said it to my face if they have.

94,"Well, my girlfriend is visually impaired, she has congenital nystagmus. We met over tinder, where she had mentioned her condition (but not that it caused her problems with her vision). I get a lot from people's eyes. I am a firm believer that they tell you everything you want to know and thus they're the most attractive physical feature in my opinion. Her eyes were just... beautiful. So I swiped right and so did she. We met up and I found out that she's visually impaired. It didn't bother me at all. She can still see, just not as well as I can, I thought, and her eyes tremble which wasn't all that noticeable to begin with. But she was so self conscious about it. She hated when I'd try to look into her eyes. I find this hilariously ironic in hindsight and so does she, but never once has her condition caused me any kind of apprehension. As time went on (we've been together almost 4 years now) I became heavily involved in the difficulties of advocating for yourself to accomplish simple things like taking notes in class or making sure VR puts enough money on your bus pass to get you where you need to go. She showed me an entire world I had been oblivious to, and what I saw made me want to make a difference. I've tried to be a big motivator for her and to push her to not bend to her professors or her irresponsible VR counselor. My family and friends haven't really shown any kind of concerns or been insensitive about her impairment, but if they had been I would've happily cut them out. She's dealt with a lot in her life and when I really committed to her I decided that I'd try my hardest to be someone she could really depend on. I don't think I could be happier than I am with her.

95,"Alright, here's a little bit of insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Until a couple years ago, I thought I absolutely hated many things. These include walking in the downtown of the city, a place that is extremely crowded at all times, shopping of any kind, etc. Then I had a girlfriend a couple years ago and I started enjoying all of these. At first I thought this was because, well, I was out with my girlfriend. But then going to some places with my family made me realized the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

They weren't describing any fucking thing to me. The only stuff that I knew existed were the things that my family felt that it was important enough to draw the attention of each other to. Regardless of whether if we are in the car or walking, I would have no idea about what is around me.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my girlfriend loves to talk all the time, so she already pretty much describes what's around me in the normal flow of the conversation. I don't think I ever wondered ""huh, I wonder what stores are around me"" whenever we were walking in downtown. Mind you, this constant describing duty could quickly become a burden, but I was lucky enough to be with someone who, well, can't stop talking. :D

&amp;#x200B;

I still hate going somewhere with my family. I still absolutely love going out with my girlfriend. The biggest difference is because she describes stuff to me and I am not just aimlessly following her around.

&amp;#x200B;

If you pay more attention to getting him involved rather than indulging in your own looking pleasure, I think a simple city break could be pretty good time spent.

&amp;#x200B;

96,"I was about the same age when a doctor told me I appeared to have age-related macular degeneration. He knew he was wrong because of the whole ""age-related"" bit and sent me to a specialist. 

3 specialists later, the strongest conclusion I've reached is what they're calling atypical XLRS, or X linked Retinoschisis. It's atypical because it was noticed later than my teens and doesn't appear to be slowing down like it should. In my mid 20's I was alright with glasses. In my early 30's I've lost driving privileges and it keeps getting worse. 

Not sure if you and your doctors have talked about it, but try throwing out the term ""Retinoschisis"" and see if that goes anywhere. Your symptoms sound a lot like what I'm dealing with. 

As far as how to manage it, I don't think any one person can give you that answer for you, but I'm happy to tell you what's worked for me.

Support is important. My wife's great. She knows I can't drive and tries to make sure she's home in time from work to take care of getting the kids where they need to go. We recently moved to a city with robust public transportation so I can still have some independence in terms of getting where I need to go.

Don't be afraid to ask for help. You know how people always seem to have this discussion about whether or not it's appropriate to help people with disabilities? People want to help, so inviting them to is probably a relief to them. If I'm alone at the airport I'll ask someone looking at the boards to help me find information and I have never sensed any annoyance from them.

Try not to get frustrated that people aren't always sympathetic to your issue too, though. Visual impairment is often an invisible condition. I once had a professor reply with ""Your eyes look fine to me"" after I explained why my condition makes some things difficult. I kinda blame TV for always making blind people 100% unable to see and making their eyes totally white for that one, though. But remember that these people have always had their sight and that it's very easy to take something like that for granted. Sure, some people are assholes, but most people just aren't around this kind of stuff so it's not something they spend a lot of time thinking about. 

The hardest part has been internal stuff. Every time I have to admit I have to give something up is really hard on me. I started using a screen reader a bit ago and that was more emotional than I expected it to be. I avoid going out at night. I have to be really careful on stairs. I make mistakes because I misread things. A puzzle in a game might take longer than it should because I didn't see the hint. I'm really bad at cleaning dishes. These kinds of things add up and I start to feel like I'm a burden to my family and I'm making my wife cover for me too much. It's not the case, I *know* it's not, but it's a hard feeling to shake and it weighs on me. The mental part has proven to be the biggest challenge so far. I can learn to use the screen reader, I just hate that I have to use it, you know? It's something I'm still working on.",,,,liquidDinner,,,1574188554,t5_2qpec,t3_dynyh1,t3_dynyh1,8,1583403828,0,0,f82cjt8,Blind,,,,,

113,"So I lost vision after graduating high school, so I can't exactly speak about that personally. But my condition is genetic, so this situation is something that I've spoken with them a lot with. I've also spoken with many people I've met at blind rehab schools.
The parts you mentioned about braille illiteracy and other skills are obviously dependent on what resources are available depending on one's region/state. Assuming statistics don't contradict me, I don't think this has anything to do with integratino of blind children into public schools, it's just how much support is offered to those students. Clearly there should be numerous support for them. 
The real world isn't always accesible, nor understanding at all times. The best skills a person with vision impairments can have is how to navigate around these times. Because of this, learning how to socialize around sighted people and operate in a classroom is vital. Knowing these skills would help immensely once someone got to college and eventually the workplace.
You mentioned also about socializing and interaction. This is an area where I think segregation is not helpful at all. Yes it's far easier because everyone understands vision loss, people introduce themselves by name to identify themselves, and other things like that. When I was in various rehab schools, people would greet one another by announcing their name, etc. But the real world isn't like that. People you meet say at a college campus or coffee shop will rarely ever do that. They will see your cane and still hand you things and you don't know it. They will say hi and you won't know who it is. A lot of these situations (for me at least) involve explaining visual impairment an a concise, understandable way. Some people understand vision loss and have a great deal of empathy. Other people, not so much. It's another skill to learn how to interact and be comfortable interacting with sighted people. It's definitely not easy and as a person who is really awkward and has social anxiety, it's extra hard, but learning how to explain visual impairment to people and explain things to them really quickly is a difficult but important skill. Is socializing in college as a person with a VI? Hell yes it is, but like any other skill you have to work at it and have a lot of practice if your not good at it.
I'm probably rambling, but my main points are that preparing people for the real world is the number on priority, and limiting interaction with the sighted isn't always helpful. It's quite a shock and likely takes a lot of time to develop skills when going form really VI friendly environments to not so much, such as a blind rehab school to a college campus as was the case for me.",,,,Badassmotherfuckerer,,,1573429593,t5_2qpec,t3_duaurh,t3_duaurh,1,1581635690,0,0,f76ljkp,Blind,,,,,

136,"It's probably better for her to have one, so it's registered to her as a personal device, and all that jazz, but it's not technically necessary on a day-to-day basis.  My grandmother uses her Echo every day but the variable and non-standard layout of the Alexa app (used entirely through VoiceOver as she can't see the screen at all) is completely defeating.  And that's when the app doesn't have problems.

Once it's all set up and registered, she can just ask it to read the books, and the app can be on anyone's phone, including yours, so long as you're trusted with her Amazon password.  No app required for her.  The downside is you have to know the full and exact title and recite it correctly.

Fun fact:  you can do this WITHOUT an audible subscription.  Any Kindle books owned by someone with a registered Echo can be read - they're just read by text-to-speech in the normal Alexa voice.  That may be unpleasant for someone used to narrated audiobooks, but it does work.  Again, you need the full and correct title.

Lastly, don't forget that the Echo is essentially a fancy bluetooth speaker.  You can pair anything that has Bluetooth or is plugged into a transmitter, and the audio will come out of the Echo.  For smartphone apps, the Echo even works as voice control (play, pause, skip, etc.).

You are quite right your eye sight is still the same as it was before learning about it, and that itself can be a comforting thought. Basically, you can continue your life as you have been before the diagnosis. In that regard, nothing has really changed.

Other thing is that now that you know what is affecting you, you are now better equipped to deal with difficulties you are facing. Before learning what was affecting you, you didn't know what kind of help you might need. Now that you have better understaning of your case, you also know what kind of help you might neet.

Other cane users are usually well aware of the differences between the canes, so there is no need to worry about about offending anyone. If someone does get offended though, it's them being ignorant about different canes and their use cases. 

Not that I can blame them for not knowing though. The differences between white canes isn't general knowlegde or something that is taught in schools.

If the TVI is not available to help, due to time constraints, sit down with the student and go through the book. Ask the math teacher if they have a plan of what material will be covered, and go through the students braille books to see what might be challenging.

197,"OP mentioned sending to a boarding school when their child graduates high school. I can't really speak on boarding schools for children, but I can expand a bit on the pros of them for adults.
In my experience and for my learning and discipline levels, schools where you board at can (this is key, as what I'm saying only applies if the school is competently staffed) provide the best, efficient, and in depth training. It's similar to if someone going to college and staying in a drom. Assuming that person doesn't get distracted with too much socializing and things like that, it's pretty much class and studying and attempts to reduce a lot of distractions. 
It's similar to boarding schools. From my experience, it was just like high school in terms of schedule. You wake up, get ready, walk fifty feet to classes and attend other classes till three or so. Then there's homework/practicing skills till dinner, then leisure time or more study time till bedtime. Again for me, this was the most ideal as the distractions of home life were largely eliminated and it was pretty much all learning. It really forces you to learn the material more since you're living it all the time. And if you're able to, you would generally go home on weekends and/or holidays. 
As opposed to the other methods of schooling where you commute to and from school, you're level of work you put into the studying and learning is largely based on your level of motivation and discipline (again for me personally) 
Again, those are just the things I noticed as the benefits to boarding type schools. I can't really speak to how it would be different for children, but (again for me personally) things to get one out of their comfort zone might help more in the long run.",,,,Badassmotherfuckerer,,,1573427860,t5_2qpec,t3_duaurh,t1_f74ql26,1,1581633447,0,0,f76gumb,Blind,,,,,

256,"Let me start with saying that you are a glaucoma suspect you do not suffer with glycoma and that's a very big difference. You're not suffering with it. You should be glad that you've a heads up.  My mother and your story matches a lot. I've 7 aunt's in my family and one of them is a optometrist when she was checking my mother's eye she suspected she might have glaucoma and she sent her to a glaucouma/eye specialist who said she had a initial stage glaucouma. 
Yes we've heard about how glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in people but there's different stages to it just like cancer has stage 1 to stage 5. Pretty much the same. Because my mother had initial stage of it they performed a small laser procedure on her which lasted hardly 10 minutes and then for a month or so she had meds/drops and she was totally fine. 
Its a heredity in my mom's family so after one another aunt got checked and she realised she had a initial stage too. She went through a small laser procedure and she was fine too in month. 

Yes, glaucoma seems scary but my mom's doc had said that if treated in the initial stages it goes away and doesn't cause any problems. 

You don't glaucouma right now they said. You MIGHT get it. Is what they meant. So all you've to do is do regular check ups every 6 months. And if it's detected then in the initial stage it can be easily treated. Nothing to be scared of.

265,"Engaged to a blind man who I met at uni. Tbh he’s just really funny. Our first conversation, I couldn’t stop laughing. Then we walked home together and realised we had a lot of interests in common. Arranged to meet up. In talking to him more, I leaned a lot about him. He’s independent, determined. Everything he did, it just seemed like his blindness didn’t affect him, so I guess I didn’t really take that much notice of it, despite the fact that his guide dog was with us on every date. Even when his blindness did affect something, he was just so down to earth about it. I could tell that he was annoyed sometimes, and he went through some horrible bullying when he was young that really affected his self-esteem. But as an adult, he’s just confident and sure in himself. If he had to ask for help, he asked. And it was never a big deal. I ask him for help all the time too.

So I guess the answer is - he attracted me. His personality, the kind of person he is. The way he treats his dog. The way he treats me. Like yeah, I noticed that he was blind, but it wasn’t really a big deal. I think that was mainly because of how independent he was. He even taught me how to cook.

For anyone curious, he has 10% sight in the corner of his right eye, and light perception in the left (though it seems that all that does is make him really sensitive to light). He’ll never know what I look like, but I don’t really care. He shows that he thinks I’m beautiful in a lot of other ways. The sex is great, ngl.

And side note, the comments from ignorant people really piss me off. One lady even told me I was going to heaven for being with him, as if I’m only doing it for some kind of fucked up charity. We have a great relationship. I love him so much. And it’s not ‘hard work’ to ‘put up with him’. He’s a normal person! You have to make adjustments for someone no mater who you date. Every single person is like this.

A lot of people really confuse these ideas.  As if saying, ""Yes, I'd take medical intervention"" means you admit to needing less human rights or not being allowed to feel okay about yourself.

But that's nonsense.

And then there's another nuance, where the idea of ""easy"" is confused with ""not independent emotionally, or being needy and helpless.""    

Again, two different things.

The apps are built in to the system, so you don't have to pay for each of them which is awesome. 

If it is ANY indicator, every blind person that I have met at both The Braille Center and my local support center uses an iPhone. 

The Mac has a built in screen reader. Hover text allows you to magnify things that you need larger. VoiceOver does more than tell you what’s happening on the screen, it helps you make things happen. It gives you auditory descriptions of each onscreen element and provides hints along the way. So if you prefer using gestures, a keyboard, or a braille display you are golden.

I struggle with telling myself I'm not ""blind enough"" to use a cane but while shopping, I have to move slowly and deliberately, bringing items up to my face to read labels and such.  I know people probably look at me strangely and get mad but I wouldn't know because i can't see their faces. Lol.

we fell in love with eachother as people, with eachother's minds or souls or whatever you want to call it.

361,"I feel like there are two different approaches to captioning instagram. I do a lot of IDs on tumblr, and I will do them completely differently if it's like, a reaction gif I'm describing, or if it's like a piece of fan art.  For example:   
\[ID: Will Ferrell, holding a drink and looking shocked, with text reading ""That escalated quickly.""\]

and you can totally do that, just being careful to make the correct assumptions about what your audience knows- if you followers are mostly 12 or Amish they might not know who Will Ferrell is. But most of your followers should know who you are, so you can probably put like ""Eli is smiling and petting a horse"" rather than like ""Eli, a tall, purple skinned alien with tentacle hair, is smiling a petting a horse"" 

However, you can also treat your posts like art, and assume people WANT to know the details, and kind of 'set the scene' a little bit better. Example:

\[ID: Wide shot of Eli, a tall, purple skinned alien with tentacle hair pulled back in a messy bun, smiling excitedly and facing the camera while petting a tall, white horse. Eli is wearing a long sleeved white shirt, a brown vest, black trousers, and brown boots that come up to their knees. Eli and the horse are in a field, surrounded by grass covered in fallen leaves, trees looking out of focus in the background in bright yellows, reds and oranges.\]

It sort of establishes that this is an artsy, fall themed photo and gives the vibe of it, not just the bare bones details. But it all comes down to what you want to say and what message you want to get across. 

And one more thing! I know this is VI forum, but other people do use the image descriptions! As an autistic person, I love when someone says what facial expression a person in a picture is making because I cannot read faces to save my life. I am also colorblind, and I love IDs for that as well (when I do them myself, more than once I've had someone be like ""Thanks for the ID but that object was brown, not purple"" lol.)

Lastly! Thank you for doing this. Accessibility is so important, and by doing Image Descriptions, you're not only supporting blind/VI/autistic/colorblind/anyone else who likes reading more than pictures, but you're also making your sighted/abled audience aware of this, and maybe they will think of accessibility for all in their own lives too!

\[ID: Will Ferrell, holding a drink and looking shocked, with text reading ""That escalated quickly.""\]

and you can totally do that, just being careful to make the correct assumptions about what your audience knows- if you followers are mostly 12 or Amish they might not know who Will Ferrell is. But most of your followers should know who you are, so you can probably put like ""<PERSON> is smiling and petting a horse"" rather than like ""Eli, a tall, purple skinned alien with tentacle hair, is smiling a petting a horse"" 

However, you can also treat your posts like art, and assume people WANT to know the details, and kind of 'set the scene' a little bit better. Example:

\[ID: Wide shot of Eli, a tall, purple skinned alien with tentacle hair pulled back in a messy bun, smiling excitedly and facing the camera while petting a tall, white horse. Eli is wearing a long sleeved white shirt, a brown vest, black trousers, and brown boots that come up to their knees. Eli and the horse are in a field, surrounded by grass covered in fallen leaves, trees looking out of focus in the background in bright yellows, reds and oranges.\]

It sort of establishes that this is an artsy, fall themed photo and gives the vibe of it, not just the bare bones details. But it all comes down to what you want to say and what message you want to get across. 

And one more thing! I know this is VI forum, but other people do use the image descriptions! As an autistic person, I love when someone says what facial expression a person in a picture is making because I cannot read faces to save my life. I am also colorblind, and I love IDs for that as well (when I do them myself, more than once I've had someone be like ""Thanks for the ID but that object was brown, not purple"" lol.)

Lastly! Thank you for doing this. Accessibility is so important, and by doing <PERSON>, you're not only supporting blind/VI/autistic/colorblind/anyone else who likes reading more than pictures, but you're also making your sighted/abled audience aware of this, and maybe they will think of accessibility for all in their own lives too!

368,"LOL  there's a term for what you're experiencing.  It's called Cognitive Dissonance.  It's when you hold 2 or more contradictory beliefs or values.  It's like having a war in your head.  


So, you get to decide what you do with your own story.  


You could decide that, Holy cow, you seized the day, figured out how to move (I did this, and it was not easy) and make a life that actually works with vision impairment (which is really hard to pull off, so yay you), and you're living the dream of a life where you can relax because there's safety and security and work you like doing.  You're actually fortunate and feel the gratitude of this every day.  


Or...   


You could decide, you know, this feeling of failure is telling me that there's something more for me out there.  I should explore that!   You're actually fortunate and feel the gratitude of this every day.  


Notice  how both of these are positive.  


Or you could choose a negative version of one or both of these (which is kinda what's going on now; neither makes you feel good).  You're actually unfortunate and feel the desperation of this every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that you'll experience your story + the associated emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

Also notice I didn't ask WHY you felt you're a failure, etc.  That's also an option.  Go on a journey of self discovery about your beliefs, the message you received as a child, etc.  But the problem with asking WHY (outside of therapy or a structure to move forward), is that there's never a reason that's good enough to make you feel relief from ""I think I should feel bad about this.""     


Because, no matter what your ""WHY"" really is, the story  and emotion you tell yourself is/are everything.  


Your inner story is what creates peace or war.",,,,SpikeTheCookie,,,1572881424,t5_2qpec,t3_drhfii,t3_drhfii,13,1580854783,0,0,f6inisu,Blind,,,,,
369,"If you're running into stuff, you should probably be using a cane.

Having said this, I reluctantly started using a cane after I was called out in front of a couple dozen VI students and their parents at a panel for transitioning youth. I was there to give advice to the kids about being a successful adult, as I was in my early twenties, had my own apartment and employment, and was going to college part-time. Anyway, this older blind lady asked me, in regards to why I preferred not using a cane, ""Would you rather be seen as a competent blind person or an incompetent sighted person?""

Now that I use my cane, help (when I need it) is much easier to find. Also, most people get out of my way. On a psychological level, I replaced a lot of resentment with acceptance which then allowed me to refine my abilities to compensate for my inabilities. As a final point, I started using my cane when my acuity was \~20/1,500; like you, I don't have depth perception because I also cannot see out of my right eye, but because of glaucoma, not retinal detachment.

My son, albeit still young, has a vision instructor that teaches him Braille every day as well as the adaptive equipment and teaches him basic life skills. She will follow him through school until he graduates high school. He receives O&amp;M training with his cane two days a week and is part of a social lunch club at school to help kids socialize with each other.

That being said, I specifically moved into the district because I knew they were equipped to handle his schooling and out of a district that would just put a teacher’s aid with him daily then put him in a self-contained classroom in high school. 

Once he gets older, I plan to ultimately give him the decision to go to our state’s school for the blind where he would have to board at the school.  

I hope I’m doing the best I possibly can for him. Like you mentioned from your personal experience, he has no interest in socializing with those around him right now other than adults.

Android is slower, buggier, and is definitely more engineered than designed. The general functionality is about the same for basic navigation and interaction, but it's harder and slower for developers to update their apps to fix accessibility issues since there are so many versions of Anddroid out there, and each one has differences so it's not nearly as consistent as VoiceOver.

I had all the mobility training I needed and life skills I needed. I was and am also super bull headed and independent so I was pretty self driven.

You could consider having cataract surgery on your worse seeing eye first so you can go through the process and see what it's like with low stress.  The purpose of that surgery would be to make the back of your poor seeing eye easier to examine and to get you mentally prepared for surgery in the good seeing eye.

One of my favorites to play solo is Fallout 4. I have a mod that adds a multi-spectrum imager eyepiece to the game. West-Tek something or other. When I get to an area that's tough to see, I can cycle through night vision, infrared vision, targeting vision, and normal vision. VATS is a huge boon in the game, and building for a VATS stealth sniper is a lot of fun and allows me to keep playing despite my disability. Almost the entire game is fully voiced so that helps me a lot.  


Warframe is another good one, and good news, it's free to download and play. You can mod yourself for high survivability and strong melee damage and it's good for a lot in the game. I personally prefer the frame Inaros, and I like staves as my weapon, but there's a lot of viable options in the game. One area I struggled with was the rank-up system, but between YouTube videos and practice areas in the relay, you should be good.  


Civilization 5 is decent if you can see a bit. Once you get the basics, you don't need to read too much. You can assign your workers to auto-build improvements and they will handle most of the development for you.  


When I am feeling the itch for space exploration and survival, No Man's Sky is a fun one overall. I struggle a bit in space battles but as you develop and get better ships, that becomes less of an issue. The aliens have their own languages so reading is semi-moot.

482,"I had a vitrectomy surgery that left me with a cataract months following the surgery. Mine was still in the early stages but I had it removed.

The blindness in my right eye from my detached retina was already in an advanced state of blindness that could not be reversed and I was hoping that the cataract removal would help my vision just a little bit. It’s been a couple months since my surgery and while I see a little bit more light and slightly better clarity from a foot or two , My vision up close is gone. And from what I’ve been told, cannot be corrected with glasses. I relied on my close-up vision pretty heavily and it’s been pretty demoralizing that I’ve been left with zero clarity  in addition to my left eye with a detached retina.

The surgery itself lasted about 30 minutes and was mostly pain-free, But there was slight discomfort at times, but nothing terribly uncomfortable.

512,"Hello,
 
You are very welcome, no worries! I know developing an accessible website can take some time, juggling, and creativity. All the updates you made should make your website more accessible.
 
Although you tested your website by hovering over elements and instructions, which is good. But, also make sure you test the focus with the keyboard by using the tab key to tab to each element. The best way to provide instructions for forms and form fields would be to use the ariadescribedby= and then place the instructions in quotes. When you put the instructions in quotes, be sure to only use the regular (“”) vs. (&amp;;quot) next to each field that provides instructions. If you have instructions that are read that are similar to tooltips, you can create text tooltips, just make sure the tooltips are text only though with no widget icons. While widget icons look nice, they would actually create more work from an accessibility stand point because then you would have both a tool tip and alt text that would need to be coded into the website. Plain text tooltips are the easier more efficient way to do what you are trying to accomplish.

552,"I appreciate all the comments.  I’ve been a guide dog user for 10 years and I love the freedom of using a dog.
Once you and a guide have bonded, the things that dog can do are amazing.  Husband parks the car 5 blocks away, my dog can take me right to it.  Find his/her way through a crowded airport or mall with no problem.  Gets me back and forth to work without a thought.  Once the dog knows a route or a word it’s an effortless task to get there.  The command of find me a chair or an empty seat on the bus/coffee shop works wonders.  Find a certain store or place on a block of stores, find the push button on an elevator or a cross walk pole, find the handle on a door, the possibilities are endless.  The dog loves the challenge of the training and responds accordingly.  I’m not looking for obstacles, we breeze around them with little thought.
Yes, they may be a little more work then a cane when I get home but the companionship is such a positive that it’s all worth it.  Dogs are way less messy than kids and I have a bunch of those.  Don’t want dog hair on the couch, don’t let them up on the couch, the bed, etc.  I don’t let me guides in the furniture and the floors are easy to vacuum.  Yes, a dog can get sick but so can people and again kids.  It’s all about choices and I choose a guide dog because it makes my blind life simpler and more independent.

556,"I swim regularly for fitness. I use a standard pool with lane lines. I'm not on a team, but I do have to share the pool-though not usually my lane--with others. I can see a bit, but not enough to help when swimming even with clear goggles in good light.

With that out of the way, my main request would be a way to know the wall is coming, so I can turn. I can stop at walls without hurting myself, but I can't stop two strokes before them to do a flip-turn. Instead, I touch the wall, stop swimming, rotate, and push off the wall. It works, but means I have to stop after each length.

As to orientation, I usually swim pretty straight, by touching a lane line or side wall every time my right hand is in a position to do so (I always swim on the right side of the lane). Even then, I sometimes wander to the other side of the lane. This is mostly why I don't share a lane if I can help it.

I have no idea how you'd solve either problem. For me, at least, the solution would need to be something I could carry with me and either wear or quickly install and remove. I can't adapt the pool and leave the adaptation in place.

566,"just want to say first, we hear you and it is hard. If you haven't already, you may want to check out screenreaders or audio that can speed up, I've heard that this is part of some people get frustated by audio books since they are often much slower than reading.

That being said, huge misconception (VERY common assumption by sighted people especially) that braille is always slower. Someone who has been reading braille their whole life is often equally fast to a sighted reader. What happens is that when you're young the SAME part of your brain, your visual cortex I believe, learns to recognize these shapes--visually or by touch--as words. When someone learns to read by sight and then goes blind, it takes more time and practice because that part of your brain has to kind of ""unlearn"" and then relearn. So it's completely understandable that you're struggling with it but just know it's not hopeless. And there's no shame, too, to using a different tool instead like a screenreader. All just different roads to the same goal, information.

I was born with ROP ,(retina of Prematurity).  Im a twin and my retina in my right eye wasn't fully developed.   (Most if not all twins are premature)

In 5 years I had six eye surgeries.   The first one I had was to help my problem and stop it altogether so that whatever vision I had at the time wouldn't get worse.  Two weeks later I was told the surgery didnt work as expected and they said I could try again, so I did.  Well that surgery worked, but all it did was slow down my vision loss, which also led to other eye sight problems such as early stages of glaucoma.

Anyway, I w as s told my vision wouldn't stop getting worse.  I was told that it could be as soon as 2 years or my lifetime for me to lose complete vision.  I am 28 and although I cant drive, I am still doing the best I can.  Yes, my vision hinders me, but I will not give up.  I will keep doing the best I can with what I havd.

I have learned to embrace my vision loss, and I am hoping that your friend can as well.  It is and will be hard, but I feel as if the sooner she accepts it the quicker she will learn how to live with it.

Android is so fragmented, with many versions, and several phone options so it is harder to know what your experience is like without getting hands on with your phone.  

Samsung is able to run talkback or voice assitant, which in my opinion has better granular controls for things like navigated by character, words, etc. Pure android phones like the pixel tend to offer a better talkback experience than most by LG,Motorola, and other brands.

612,"So initially I didn't know there was a severe visual impairment. About a month into dating I realized something wasn't quite right. My attraction had nothing to do with abilities. Well not visual impairment anyway. I was just smitten with him. 

So I start asking questions. It turns out the love of my life was completely blind in one eye and rapidly losing the sight in his other. Appointments were scheduled, doctors sought out. Anything I could do to get him the treatment he needed. 

Over the past 2.5 years we have learned together how to deal with this and adapt. It's honestly not a big issue. There are times with employment that he had struggled and of course that can cause friction. 

He's now in a program that teaches you how to read Braille, O&amp;M, and AT; really everything to be fully prepared for a life with blindness. 

I would still be with him off he had any disability. I'm stronger than some from what I hear, which just breaks my heart. My mom was a special education teacher for 35 years so anyone who abandons another human they say they love over any kind of disability really disgusts me.

What it has done however, is make me think outside the box in what I do for a living. We are developing a system that VI folks can use on a daily basis for mobility and a lot of things sighted humans take for granted. 

Overall, there will be challenges in every relationship. Be it financial, disability, infidelity, and a ton of others. How you handle it as individuals as well as partners it what keeps you together.

618,"I have a lot of thoughts on this. I think that ultimately, if done right, the idea is a win for both employers and employees. Here are some considerations:

First, I think it should be more than a month. It's too easy to still be finding your place in a work environment, especially one that might be initially hostile toward a person with a visible disability or one which is not accessible öut of the box"". Let's say three months minimum.

Second, this needs to be managed by a disability-positive organization--preferably government. It's too easy for employers to engage in some kind of funny business if we're the only ones advocating for ourselves. There's already a system in many states to help people with disabilities find jobs, and some of these states even pay the first 3-6 months of a person's employment for exactly this reason. It's not much of a stretch to extend that.

I thought about some kind of insurance policy to make sure employers can't just use the system to get free workers, but I think anything we put in place would discourage employers from hiring us. I'd welcome thoughts on that.

There are what we call “freezers” people who throw themselves against the wall or stand perfectly still when he approaches. If I’m with him I say “he doesn’t bite”. If I’m not, he often taps them with his white cane until they make a noise in panic.

Was holding his hand once and man approached me and asked (at sporting event with others around) “Is he blind?” �� I replied “Yes, but he’s not deaf.”

811,"I am just wondering about the value of a boarding school. I never understood the concept, as I never attended one, but what are they supposed to gain from living on campus. To me, childhood and adolescence is a time where they should be with their family and feel comfortable in their home. I don't necessarily see the value of shipping them off to somewhere, essentially handing off control to whatever institution. I'm not just considering blind schools either, but all boarding schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had a reason to look into it as I don't have children, but I'm assuming they come home at holidays and optional weekends? So that's really the only time the parent(s) would have the ability to evaluate how well the school is doing. Nah, just my opinion, but I'd rather have them at home where I can be the one to oversee that kind of thing. Parents can absolutely be teachers of the same types of skills that you might learn at a boarding school. You could have your kid do their own laundry, pack their own lunch, get themselves up in time for school. Just start handing them some responsibilities, more as they get older, so you don't overwhelm them.",,,,bscross32,Low partial since birth,,1573406470,t5_2qpec,t3_duaurh,t1_f73dj05,3,1581603180,0,0,f74ql26,Blind,,,blue1,,

&amp;#x200B;

I probably will never have kids so take this for what it's worth, but if I did, I would never ever consider a blind school if they happened to be blind. I just don't see that kind of thing as healthy or viable. I would teach them everything I could and if there was something that I couldn't, I'd look into in-home training.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that public schools aren't necessarily great, but they teach not only the class material but socializing as well. If they do nothing but socialize with other blind people, what does that really net them when they'll be dealing with sighted people far more than they will blind people when they go out into the world. It may be more comfortable for them to socialize with people who already know what it's like, but they need to learn to interact in a meaningful way with others. That also doesn't mean they can't or shouldn't have blind friends, it just means I think there's more value in socializing with sighted kids because sighted people are the majority.

&amp;#x200B;

But your mileage may vary. Some parents just never get the hang of it, others do. My dad was great at overseeing my education without directly interfering when it wasn't needed. He was also great at teaching me the things I needed to know to live independently. When I went to college, I probably knew more about cooking and laundry than a lot of the others did, certainly my room mates. I'd still rather see them go to an independence center for that kind of training if I couldn't provide it after high school and before college than I would seeing them in a blind school for their entire pre-college education.",,,,bscross32,Low partial since birth,,1573405786,t5_2qpec,t3_duaurh,t3_duaurh,2,1581602236,0,0,f74oopm,Blind,,,blue1,,

John is a 50-year-old middle-class office worker who is shopping around for a new car for his family. He's had a lot of success with cars from Company A which he's driven consistently for the last 30 years. But in the interests of perhaps finding a better deal, he decides to visit a dealership for Company B. He tells the salesman at Company B that he's never bought a Company B car before, but he's open to the possibility of trying it. The salesman says, ""Would you like a test drive?"" John accepts, but is not entirely sold. Then the salesman says, ""We're running a deal at the moment where you can rent this brand-new vehicle for $1500 for the next fortnight, and if you like it, you can buy it."" This makes alarm bells ring in John's head, and he politely declines the offer and leaves the dealership.

Why did John refuse the offer? The salesman showed a lack of confidence in his vehicle, and his suggestion that John might not like it immediately dissuaded him from purchasing it.

Now I'll relate it to your proposal:

• Company A cars: nondisabled people
• Company B cars: disabled people
• Visiting the showroom: reading a CV

938,"tl;dr: If you work in education, government, or any other public job, you're going to have to suck it up and use person first language. In all other instances, just ask how someone wants you to address their disability.

From the teacher side on the language issue, there's not much we can do. We have to use person first language at work, full stop, no exceptions made, personal opinions on the matter are irrelevant. But I do think it's up to the person how they identify. For instance, I have yet to meet an autistic person who is okay with person first language and all of my autistic friends call me on it whenever I say ""person with autism"" in their presence (although this doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people on the autism spectrum who do prefer person first language). 

With the blind community, and serious physical disabilities, I find that the person first/disability first rules just go right out the window. Our disabilities are such a big, obvious part of us that it's a very individual choice how we want to be addressed. For example, I dislike being called visually impaired and prefer that people just say that I'm a blind person. However, I have many friends who want to be known as people with visual impairments and if I don't know somebody I will default to that language out of habit anyway.

Regarding the article itself, it feels a little disjointed and I'm not sure how personal identification would be helpful in a learning situation where a teacher doesn't want to interact with their own student.

939,"Speaking as someone who adores braille for giving me back my ability to read...yes this does make sense! Learning to read sucks. It sucks when you learn to read print and it sucks learning to read anything else. People tend to forget that.

I would encourage you to keep trying if you can, though. See if you can get a refreshable braille display; they're more portable and easier to read and most have some speech options so you can navigate the menus well enough while you're getting the hang of reading again. The big thing about reading braille, just like reading print, is developing the muscle memory for it. Sighted people have to learn how to hold their heads, move their eyes, focus their eyes, and operate a book, all of which cause strain. The same is true for braille, it's just that now you're learning how to focus your fingers instead of your eyes and you need a bit of time to grow some small reading callouses on your fingers; before those set in, it is much more uncomfortable to read and I, at least, had problems with physically sticking to book pages.

The stuff about braille being hard to learn isn't true. It can be personally difficult but it's no more difficult than learning to read print, and if you know how to read print, you already know how to read braille, you're just reading with your hands now and the letters look different. Some folks might roast me for this, but as a former print reader, I found the newest version of braille, Unified English Braille, is much easier to figure out and it matches up with print better than the older English Braille American Edition did. 

It's frustrating at first, absolutely, and perhaps the people you've met who read braille are a bit strange, but you don't have to be them and consider what you gain by learning it. If you can get yourself to read for fifteen minutes a day, you'll make progress faster than you might think. I recommend getting a copy of your absolute favorite book or something you've always wanted to read and just go for it. You're more likely to read something you like (I started with kids books I didn't want to read and just said ""screw it"" and picked up a copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer; took me about a month to read the whole thing but it was nice to read something for myself again). If you need some help with learning, I think Hadley still does mail courses for free so you don't even have to work with anyone else and can work on your reading at home.

If you do decide you just don't want to do it, that's understandable. I'd say text to speech is the next best option. Not even close to as good as reading it for yourself, but it's better than having someone read it to you like an audiobook and you can get epubs of way more things.

In my experience, people comment on what they notice first regardless of whether someone is disabled or not. If someone doesn’t know me, they’re going to see my guide dog first and get my gender wrong and that only effects me as much as I let it.

997,"Thanks for the clarification on the article! That makes a bit of sense out of it.

I know when I was a kid being referred to as ""visually impaired"" did do a lot of damage, but it was also coupled with the actions of the adults around me and I know I wasn't the only one in my peer group who felt very stigmatized by the phrase. The overall impression I had was that I was ""better"" or more of a person than my friends who were totally blind but not a full person or as ""good"" as a sighted person. When I got older and came to understand that blindness past the legal definition is a pretty wide spectrum, it made me feel a lot better and I did gain enough confidence early on to grow once I started referring to myself as blind. But that's not everyone's experience for sure. In that sense, maybe the person who wrote this article might have been able to handle things better with some added confidence, but it's hard to say. High school isn't exactly the place where anyone is confident and her teachers and aides are literally not allowed to refer to her in any other way but person first.

1070,"I can hear and pinpoint the location of aircon compressors in my neighborhood even though none of my other friends can. I can also tell my family's two dogs apart by the way they walk. In my room, I have smart light bulbs since I still have light perception and I like having relaxing colors when I'm in there. One day I started to hear a high-pitched whine and I was frantically searching around for the source. turns out I was hearing the coil whine from the power supplies inside of the smart bulbs. I've only ever heard it once though because of how exceptionally quiet it was that night. I have a surprisingly difficult time picking out human conversations however. I went to an audiologist because I thought something might be wrong with my ears but it turns out that the opposite is true. She told me I have some of the best hearing that she's ever tested. So I guess I'm just bad at picking up conversations.

One thing that I've realized is that I can also tell how sounds bounce off of surfaces. Different cities bounce noise around in different ways and when I visit one that doesn't bounce sound as well as what I'm used to I get a little freaked out until my brain adjusts. 

the more I think about it the more I realize I'm really good at picking up coil whine. I used to have a Motorola Nexus 6 which came with a fast charger. The way I knew that it had enabled fast charging was by pressing my ear against the charging brick and listening to the frequency of the coil whine. If it got louder and shifted in pitch that meant that it had worked. That was especially helpful in the later years once the connectors started wearing out and quick charge wasn't guaranteed to activate each time. I can also press my ear against my phone and listen to how much power the processors are consuming based on whether there is coil whine present or not.",,,,Laser_Lens_4,,,1574899159,t5_2qpec,t3_e27ssq,t3_e27ssq,2,1583961994,0,0,f8wt2c8,Blind,,,,,

TalkBack has a tutorial built-in. If you are tech-savvy you can probably learn it entirely on your own. That's how I did it. there are different TTS engines available, of course. If you don't like the Google TTS you can search for others in the play store so you're not limited. I haven't used any others myself but Samsung has their own TTS engine and you can get espeak if you're into that sort of thing. I think eloquence is available but I imagine it would cost money. regardless of what you choose, the important part is that you pick whatever works best for you.

You can find helpful items on Amazon from sellers like the Braille Superstore. I have a liquid level indicator so I can have tea without scalding my fingers, a pocket money brailler to put braille onto the totally-inaccessible bank notes here in Murica, and a spring steel signature guide that I carry in my wallet.

For cooking I strongly recommend you get an expensive spatula and some nice tongs. I'm talking like a $10+ spatula. Something sturdy and nice that will give you a good feel of what's in the pan. A talking scale would also do you well for measuring stuff.

Get bump dots. They're super cheap and you just stick them onto membrane swiches, like on your microwave oven, and presto you can use it without help or eye-strain.

Wanna use your PC? How much can you see? Try out the magnifier. If you use Linux well... you should seriously consider Windows or Mac OS. Linux is not VI-friendly unless you stick to the command line and even then good luck if some component loads improperly and it sticks you in recovery where there's no audio or SSH.

So, if you try out the system magnifier and it works then great! If not then there's always Zoomtext but it's very expensive and absurdly buggy. If you're going beond around 5x magnification then you should try using a screen reader. NVDA is both free and very excellent. The biggest challenge comes in learning the keystroke commands for all the apps you use. Using a screen reader is keyboard-only. No mouse.

And finally do go to your state's rehabilitation agency. They can help you with getting equipment so that you can succeed in school and work.

Stick o the major brands. Motorola, Samsung, and Google work the best. Other OEMs may or may not label all the extra buttons they add and it's just not worth the hassle.

The level of empathy tended to be lower in those I'd talked to, and even their level of basic schooling seemed worse, with basic information I had access to in junior high not known by graduates.

Many so-called soft skills, the things that affect your hireability after your resume gets your foot in the door, were either half-baked or nonexistent, to the point that it confirmed some self-ableist things I thought mostly in my first year or two of being blind.

There absolutely are fully functioning, well rounded, intelligent people with good social skills who don't make me immediately uncomfortable who were sent to blind schools, and there are absolutely people that were mainstreamed who still have no idea how to communicate any better than a 10 year old with severe anxiety.

Also, I have met very, very, very few blind people that didn't hold racist views, and even fewer who weren't homophobic or transphobic, or bigoted in some other major way.","[{'start': 0, 'end': 5, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

1123,"I have these lipliners from Amazon called ""Italia deluxe"", they're very cheap. Like $8 for a bunch of them. They go on really easily but they also last a long time and the texture is kinda dry. So they're really good for putting on without a mirror. If you practice a few times and have someone check after, you'll get the hang of what it feels like to do it properly. I put on a thin layer of lip balm and then fill I my entire lip with the pencil, no lipstick!     
    
So if you wanna do something more bold I highly recommend those pencils. I love them.    
     
Another thing I use is ""stila pearl shimmer lip gloss"". It's not that pigmented so it's really easy to just throw on and the chance of messing it up is pretty slim. It's pretty too.

1194,"So you're asking how do you not just wander off in a stray direction when walking through a large, empty field or something?

It depends, really. You get used to orienting yourself and not straying off to the side the more practice you have. There are clues, like wind direction, heat from sunlight, the sounds around you, etc. Also, keep in mind that many of us do have some remaining vision enough to know if we're walking in a straight line or not.

Inside, sounds and airflow change a lot based on furniture in the room and distance from walls and doorways, you can hear appliance sounds, etc.

It's also easier if it's an area you're familiar with. I quite often take my dog (pet, not guide dog) out at night and he likes to go around back where there's not any light. Sometimes I'll take a flashlight, but if it's late, I just walk in the dark so I don't bother the neighbors. If I'm walking around in my own yard, I can tell where I am, even without a cane. I do this by the changes in slope/unevenness of the ground, how the wind changes when it's blocked by the house or the shed, and the location of common sounds around me; the road in the distance, a neighbor's heat pump running, the way the sound of my footsteps travel, the sound of my dog sniffing along the fence line vs. sniffing around in the yard, and so on.",,,,codeplaysleep,ROP / RLF,,1574743621,t5_2qpec,t3_e1s7vw,t3_e1s7vw,7,1583861684,0,0,f8rl91z,Blind,,,blue1,,

1208,"I was super self-conscious about it at first. It took me months to get up the courage. I think a lot of people who are visually impaired probably struggle with the question of whether or not they're ""blind enough."" The majority of the time I don't ""need"" my cane  in the sense that I **can** get from point A to point B, but there are some things I've noticed about using the cane anyway:

* I don't accidentally cut people off or bump into people, because they see my cane and realize I may not be able to see them. If this does happen on occasion, people are generally more understanding. - This is huge.
* I can make better use of what vision I do have, because I'm not constantly looking at the ground to make sure I don't trip over anything.
* The vast majority of people don't stare or say anything or react in any way at all, really, except maybe to step aside if I'm coming by. Most people are too wrapped up in their own lives to care what someone else is doing. The one comment I did get recently was when I set the cane down on a counter folded up and the cashier asked what it was. I explained, unfolded it to show him, and it was deemed ""neat"" and that was that.
* My cane skills get better every time I use it, so if there ever comes a day where I do need to rely on the cane more than I do now, I'll be a lot more prepared. To me this was another big reason to go ahead and start using the cane. I'd rather be learning this at 41 and have a couple of decades of practice than suddenly learning it at 60 because I have no other choice.
* I haven't injured myself! No more walking into things on my blind side and no more missing a curb or twisting an ankle in a pothole I didn't see. This is especially evident at night, since my vision is so much worse in the dark.
* I walk a lot faster now, I guess because I'm not second-guessing myself on whether that next step I'm about to take is safe or not. I didn't realize I was subconsciously being more slow/cautious, but apparently I was.

I faked a lot of other injuries so I could just sit out and do homework for other classes. Sometimes I'd be allowed to go and use the weight room in high school, which was pretty OK, but that only happened if there was another teacher or coach in there that period. No one was allowed in the weight room unsupervised for safety reasons.

I desperately wanted to play softball when I was younger. I would have loved something like beepball. I did participate some in basketball, if we were just shooting or doing drills and not playing competitive games.

Art, I never had much trouble with, because my remaining vision allowed me to still do most things if I could get close enough to what I was working on (I actually have an art degree).

1214,"Yeah, the article's a little disjointed, but I think the author's point is that maybe she would have been more inclined to stand up for herself if her disability wasn't always ""hidden"" behind person-first language and she'd instead learned at a younger age to embrace it as part of her identity.

I'm not sure that would actually make a difference, though, because in the situations she described, there's still the teacher/student dynamic and the imbalance of authority there to deal with. 

Also, as a kid, I interacted with plenty of people outside of school and dealt with overcoming many things as a result of my vision loss and I'm not sure the words a teacher used to address me would have really had any impact on my own sense of identity, especially when those words weren't harmful or cruel.

As to the language itself, I may be in the minority, but I feel like person-first language kind of accidentally does the opposite of what it's intended to do, because we only use it for things that society considers negative or bad. No one says ""&lt;person&gt; who is beautiful"" or ""&lt;person&gt; who is smart."" 

That said, it's all sort of abstract.

1215,"I would get a second opinion - find an ophthalmologist. Floaters and flashes don't really sound like glaucoma symptoms, at least none that I've had. Most of the damage from glaucoma is caused by an increase in intraocular pressure, which can cause optic nerve and retina damage if it gets high enough. That would certainly lead to floaters and flashes, but high IOP should be treated long before that.

Did your doctor actually check your eye pressure?

There are also multiple types of glaucoma. The most common is open-angle glaucoma, but there's also narrow/closed angle glaucoma (what I had), which can be more acute, but also more treatable.

Some actual early symptoms to look out for would be pain or a feeling of pressure in/around the eyes, brow and cheek pain, blurry vision, especially in the morning when you first wake up, more difficultly seeing in low-light, red/bloodshot eye(s), or halos around lights.

Of course you should take note of any floaters/flashes, too, but those aren't what I'd consider to be ""early"" symptoms of the disease and I'd personally treat them as a medical emergency.

All that said, it sounds like, right now, you do not have glaucoma - which is great! You're just more likely to develop it... which is a bummer, but it doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to have glaucoma in your future. Lots of people are at high risk for things that never develop.

It does mean, though, that you should find a doctor you trust, who will take time to explain things to you, and start monitoring your eye health more closely.

While you've been over there feeling like you look normal but it's a bad thing cause nobody supports your vision limits, others have been bullied all their lives because they could never look 'completely normal.'  You've missed out on so many fun experiences.  Not being invited places.  Being grabbed/dragged by completely normal people who spotted you from across the room and KNEW  assistance was required. Let's be honest, you didn't explain to your friends your condition because you enjoyed the anonymity.  

See the full picture.  Self-advocavy can be a benefit for your integration but shedding your completely normal status among the TABS isn't going to make you less lonely.   It will leave you open to a different kind of exclusion and harassment you've been able to avoid to a great extent.

1289,"Hello there.  This is an interesting question.  I'm a 51 year old woman who has been legally blind her entire life, and I love to swim.  I'm not really sure what aspects of swimming you are trying to improve for us.  Are you referring to swimming as a sport, like in a professional pool that has lanes divided by those floating 'ropes?'  Or as a leisure activity, like at a beach or lake, or a pool at home or a hotel?  I can't really think of anything to make it better, unless perhaps your are interested in creating some kind of fun pool game accessory for the blind.  Like some kind of beeping beacon for 'seek and find' games, or a volleyball that beeps so we can hear where it is?  I'm interested to see what you come up with.  

  
I think if you could explain a little more in detail what you are after, you'll have a lot of great responses. 

 My only advice to anyone who wants to swim is to learn how to breathe out of your nose when you go under, because what really peeves me are people, especially grown adults, who hold (pinch)  their nose when they 'go under.'  It drives me nuts.  It looks ridiculous.  Learn how to keep your hands away from your face and blow out when your nose hits the water.  It's so gratifying.  I mean, WHO can even SWIM under water when one arm is holding your nose shut?!  It's stupid!

1294,"Hi!  Same here!!!  It IS like having a super-power.  Man, that cane can part a crowd like the way Moses parted the Red Sea!!  Especially if you have an NFB cane, that has the metal tip.  That 'tap tap tap' gets people's attention and then they realize you are blind and buddy, they move outta your way!!  

I'm Molly.  I'm 51 and like you, was born legally blind due to R.O.P.  I feel your pain, your struggles!!  My eyesight got worse with age, cataracts, etc. vitreous gel separating...  I FINALLY went to the Louisiana Center for the Blind in the late 90's and finally had my first experiences using a white cane.  They taught me O&amp;M and independent skills.  It was the best 6 months of my life!!  Being that everyone used a cane, and there was about 50+ of us, it was easy.  I wasn't so self conscious.  I loved it!!  I still have my original cane.  I'm sentimental that way.   Then I got a telescopic cane, which can be shortened to about a foot long, for easy carrying.  I don't always need my cane.  But if I go somewhere strange, especially at night, I have it with me.   It is like a beacon to let others know you are visually impaired.

Embrace that cane!  Whack people in the ankles with it if they give you trouble and then say, ""Ooops, sorry, I didn't SEE you!"" hahahaaha.  Yes, I have done that.  And I've been hit in my own ankle by my fellow's canes and damn, that metal tip does hurt!  But truly, you HAVE got to embrace your blindness.  Don't let it be a hinderance.  I know it's hard.  And frustrating.  And not fair....  but we DO have some amazing abilities.  Have you ever noticed how when you are using your cane and you walk by, say, a utility pole near the sidewalk, how you can HEAR it?   You can hear that the damn pole is there because of the echo's off of that cane tip tapping.  It is the neatest thing!  You can 'hear' bushes or walls, or other obstacles.  It is amazing.

1300,"When I was in my teens, I taught myself how to play an alto saxophone.  I was just ""ok"" with it, though my dad thought I was great.  I wasn't.  What halted my progression was that I absolutely could NOT see the sheet music.  So I had to study it with a magnifier and try to decipher what it all meant.  I never had any musical training, so sheet music was like learning another language.  Also, I never had any lessons, so that was a hindrance too.  I eventually graduated from high school and moved into the dorms at university, so that was the end of it.

When I was a little girl, I taught myself how to play a small electric piano.  Not a keyboard like you are thinking, but it was more of a child's sized piano and it was great.  Mom and Dad bought me books of music, how to play-- it all went along with this piano, and it was easier to understand and I learn.  I really wanted to play drums though.  

So they bought me a cheap drum set, and I was absolutely too embarrassed to even TRY to learn how to play it.  I don't know why.  I was only about 6 or 7 years old and felt sheer embarrassment and horror banging on those drums.  I don't know what happened to them.  Good thing they were a cheap kid's set. 

Later in life I tried a keyboard.  I sucked.  

Then I bought myself a cherry red Fender bass guitar with a maple neck, and a small amp and I tried to learn the bass lines from music by The Cure.  I was big into The Cure when I was a teen and young adult goth chick.  It was ok, but my fingers were miserable and I never did stick with it.  

I did play in a band in New Orleans in the 90's, called ""The Ghastly Plane.""  Ad in 'plane of existence.  A friend, the guy who created this band, was a metal worker, so he built a set of 'bat shaped drums' out of sheet metals and drumsticks out of rebar or metal rods.  I got to play the percussion for this band.  It was electronic goth music and it was AWESOME!!!!  But short lived...... 

A few years ago, (I'm now 51), I bought a brand new violin.  I love the violin and bass, so I thought why not.  I cannot play it.  I screech.  I gave up.  But it's a beautiful red violin with a beautiful maple neck.  Gorgeous.

What kind of eye surgery did your friend have?  What country is she living in?   

I've been legally blind since birth, and I have had eye surgery on each eye to remove cataracts and replace the lenses.  It helped immensely!  I was 38 years old when I noticed my eyesight was diminishing.  Actually, all of the lightbulbs in my house seemed to be dimming.  I really thought it was the lightbulbs.  Then one day, in the spring, outside,  I noticed if I closed one eye, a flower that was red looked purple, and if I closed the other eye, the same flower looked pink.  THAT is when I realized something was going on with MY EYES, and not the world around me.  Cataracts.  

I had some laser surgery a few weeks ago which made things worse for me.  The vitreous liquid in my left eye is separating, causing me to see this gauzy curtain thing moving in my field of vision all day long.  Some laser surgery was done to remove a tiny fragment of a leftover piece of cataract from my eye.  It made things worse because now I have a TON of floaters.  Some are very small, making me see tiny black dots, and some are large, making me thing I'm seeing things on the counter, or walls, moving.  Bats and rats, my dr. quoted.  Yep.

To suggest that a blind person can hear how many horses and men there are off in the distance is just ridiculous.  While us legally blind and completely blind people do seem to have a better sense of hearing, or a better sense of smell, it is only because we utilize those senses more than a person who has sight.

When I got to highschool though, my PE teacher just wouldn't get what I could and couldn't do: I'm blind in one eye and always had a terrible time with balls, so she decided I should be a referee instead of playing. I told her I ""don't have quite the eye to be a ref"" as a very polite way of indicating it was impossible for me to call out fouls from across the field and she dismissed that entirely. It was one of the funniest conversations in my life.

After that, I switched from physically participating to writing papers on sports: don't let this happen. People need physical activity and interaction in sports.

Eventually, another much better PE teacher took me under his wing, so to speak, and worked with me one-on-one in running, weightlifting and aerobics, along with some textbook oriented stuff. That was much better.

I've not used Apple phones much so don't take this as a complaint against them. Try before you buy, I'd say.

I tend to delete it all first thing in the morning then at lunchtime or in the evening before I go to bed, go through anything I recorded and action it as necessary.

Money and food. People tend to know I always have snacks and something to drink on me, I often end up giving them away which is a nice way to make friends so that's fine too! Also cash. I probably shouldn't carry lots but I do because I am terrified of being stranded without access to a cab. Needing that stuff is not a cripple problem but the fact that it is 100 times harder to solve these problems spontaneously is.

1364,"I lost my sight at the age of 19 so I wouldn't ever have gone to a blind school, but I wouldn't have wanted to anyway. 

A lot of people have basically already said this, but I feel really strongly about it. Say what you like, the world is not a blind world. Putting someone in a school where everything is set up for them and everyone is in the same boat is no way to prepare that person for reality. The world is full of people who went through blind schools in decades way past and frankly they have a lot of the socialisation problems people have mentioned. A lot of them end up working for the charities because their whole existence revolves around the disability, and they are listened to about provision for people these days. As a result the blind establishment can have some very strange ideas that everyone should be like them and sort of hover outside mainstream society. This gets even more political, to the point where if you aren't using braille (like me) and don't have a dog (like me) and if you don't live every second of every day as some sort of crusading martyr to the disability then you are a bad person. As you may be able to tell I've had a few disagreements with people over this. And I think it all starts in the schools.

I don't want that for myself and I don't think any sane parent wants that for their children. Mainstream school all the way. As I say I could see fine when I was at school and as a result the only thing I don't have that I would like to have is braille, and that's just for having the experience of reading.

If it's a case of getting across the town square to the other side then you'd probably go around the edge or from landmark to landmark. You have to learn routes.

As to the chick who was telling them house many horses and suchlike there were, I took that more as an aspect of their weird tribal culture, that they had these people they imbued with near magical powers. I mean, they also had people doing battle chants before they started fighting, which isn't particularly part of blind culture as far as I know. Not that I'm all that plugged in to blind culture, but I just took it as being their equivalent of a witch doctor sort of thing. And if you get into the details, she's utterly wrong in the number of horses she predicts.

As to the fighting, the way it was described to me they fight like a totally blind culture would fight. There's lots of using weapons like canes to find stuff, they have flail type weapons designed to catch anything standing up. There are bladed weapons swung sure, and on occasion people swing and miss because they can't see the target, or swing at nothing just to check. I am capable of picking up a sword and swinging it and you'd better believe I would if circumstances made it necessary. I'm not physically weak. Okay I am but if I'd grown up in a post apocalyptic culture where blindness was normal things might be a bit different, it's hardly surprising these people don't represent me.

1367,"Seconded. I was talking with a friend of mine who happens to be from a south asian (think Indian) family and we decided that someone should write a movie with a south asian lead character, and the title would be something like:

Movie Starring an Indian Person and She Just Is and it Isn't a Story Point and is Hardly Ever Mentioned because Guess What Some People Just Are and They Have Lives Beyond That.

Might need a better title but you take my point.

I think the reason it is not done very much (for blind people, gay people, indian people, whatever) is that when you are putting a story together you generally want to ensure that all of the elements work together to create a unified whole and don't distract the audience from the story you're trying to tell. The problem is that making someone blind is unusual, because most people aren't, and I think people worry that it will distract the audience from the core story which is not a completely silly concern.

In the end a person will spend a certain amount of mental effort dealing with being blind and so will your character. If you hadn't worked it out, that's sort of the problem with actually being blind, it distracts you from your real life.

1370,"The word ""shame"" comes up a lot in identity politics. Shame is something you feel when you regret something you've done. Nobody can make you feel shame unless they can make you feel like you've done something wrong, and if you have the slightest bit of self respect then they're not going to be able to do that. Nobody should be able to make you believe that being gay or blind is somehow wrong. 

People can make stupid comments and that is annoying but nobody can impose shame on you without your cooperation. Don't get sad, get mad.

I should clarify something. Being proud of the simple fact of being blind is crazy, you might as well be proud of being tall. Pride is something you earn for putting in effort, not just for something you just got given, by chance. I guess being proud specifically that you're achieving stuff while being blind is okay. I'd rather describe it as a sort of grim satisfaction, and even then I'd rather be happy about a particular day's work than just awarding myself a prize for existing.

I am also perfectly capable of maintaining my peace of mind in the face of the times I can't bury it, which are many, many times a day and that's the part that is hard won.

What I don't appreciate is the implication that I am somehow letting the side down by taking this approach. I am being much more polite about that than I feel like being. Some of us have a life beyond the disability, and if your whole identity is based on it then I don't think that's anything to be proud of. I hope that none of the people I've mentored ever read anything like that because the last thing they need is to be told that it's okay, or even good, to give up and just let your old identity fade into nothingness.

I don't want or need a special identity based on the fact I have to deal with this situation. I want an identity based on things I choose, positive things, not negative things I'm forced into. I've never been one of these people who views being blind as part of my identity. I work as hard as I can to keep my identity above it.

I don't mind actors playing blind if they do it well. I think you could tell when they made ""In The Dark"" that they had a lot of consultancy and I did not in general object to it. There were moments though. When she felt the guy's face, which was required for a point in the story, they at least had her resist doing it, but she did it. It was still lazy, she could have identified the guy by finding something she knew on him. She also did a lot of unrealistic groping to find her way around her own home.

Something else is that not every blind character has to represent us personally. As long as the character is a person who could reasonably exist it is fine. There are lots of people who were born blind who feel totally different about it to the way I feel, and I would not complain about that point of view being represented on TV.

1388,"A lot of the responses here are trying to mitigate the sight loss. As bad as sight loss is, I don't think that's the question being asked here. The question being asked here is why being thrown into this category stings.

I don't want to be thought of as a blind person either. I'd much rather be Jan. Or ""hey, you, the short girl with the dark hair."" Anything but be identified as the disability. I don't feel like a proper blind person. I still feel like a normal person, whatever that means, who just happens to have found herself in this situation. And I'm twenty years in. If it helps, this is normal stuff. I don't think anyone really feels like a disabled person. Some specific bit of language doesn't change the way you feel about yourself. 

What might change how you feel about yourself is people's reaction to you. Anyone who has been for any reason unusual, even people who are in a wheelchair for a few weeks with a broken leg, know how weird people can be. But hitting some threshold for sight loss won't change people's reaction to you. Even if your sight got a lot worse, it probably won't change people's reaction much. I can't claim to be a great life example for anyone, but I am what most people think of when they think of a blind person. I am blind as hell. Even so people constantly tell me I don't look it, which I love for the same reasons I suspect you would. Once, when I worked for a big company, an internal survey asked (among other things) how many disabled people worked in the department. Several of the people I worked with who knew me well put ""none."" I was just as blind then and they knew it, but they just didn't think of me that way, even though I often accepted help, had people read stuff for me, or took someone's arm when we went out for lunch. Some people would complain about being forgotten. I thought it was the best day of my post sight loss life. I felt like I'd won at life that day. That's the sort of thing that makes a practical difference.

1395,"I'm never that bothered about the language. From my experience, people's tendency to build sentences in certain ways is just a learned grammatical habit that has nothing to do with their attitude or behaviour. I find people who think it does are often looking for reasons to make an issue out of it. Jumping on people for using perfectly normal and everyday language is a good way to make everyone nervous of any sort of disability, and that really is toxic if you really need to use that word. I'd just say unhelpful.

There is no good reason that simply stating what you are is empowering. What power do I obtain by describing myself as a short, dark haired woman? Neither of those things are things that I put any effort into earning. I don't think it's a good idea to start taking pride in things we didn't have to work for.

How many times did I try to stand up and continue the fight although I had no energy left inside of me? I don't even remember.

Noises help you to figure out what direction you're facing, how to orient yourself and in some cases they even prevent you from walking into a large obstacle.

A few weeks ago I ordered a pizza. The delivery person didn't come for a long time and eventually I got a phone call from the delivery girl saying that she was lost. I was confused and asked her what exactly she meant by ""lost"". She was already super edgy and cranky at this point and told me in an annoyed tone that she was somewhere in my neighborhood but she couldn't find my apartment building because it was too dark. To be fair, the layout of my neighborhood can be a little confusing and it's very dark at night because some of the lamps don't work. I asked her where she was and she explained that she was close to a bunch of mailboxes. I was immediately relieved because I knew what place she was talking about. It's only about 300-400 feet from my building. Trying to be friendly, I said in a cheerful tone: ""oh okay, no problem, just walk towards the river! When you're there, turn left and that's the building."" She replied in an even crankier tone: ""what the hell are you talking about?? There's no river!! It's fucking dark out here, got it?! How the fuck am I supposed to walk to some river when it's dark?!"" I was really confused and told her there was a cobblestone path that leads right up to the river. In the end, she got super bitchy and demanded that I come down and get the pizza from her. I was a little annoyed about this because what's the point of a delivery service if you have to get dressed in a hurry and stumble out into the cold rain. Later, when I walked back home with my pizza, I kept wondering why this had been such a problem for her. It was certainly too dark to spot the river in the dark but you could easily hear the sound. I didn't even need my cane because I simply walked towards the rumbling noise and when I felt grass under my shoes I turned left to walk the last 30 feet to the building.

This is just one example of sighted people being completely oblivious to their surroundings. It's not that I'm some sort of bat with super-ears, I just listen and pay attention instead of getting all whiny and cranky because it's dark.

It was a wonderful tool for balancing my emotions and fighting negativity/depression.

1399,"Anything that in your best judgment would work with a cute sighted guy will also work with a cute blind guy ;-).

Of course there are certain differences that come up once you begin a conversation but most of them can be dealt with easily if you've got a decent amount of general human sensitivity. Here's an example of what I mean: let's say I'm asking a stranger for directions. Some people are kinda dumb and they reply something like ""it's over there"" when my white cane should make it obvious to them that ""over there"" doesn't tell me anything. Other people are great about it and they describe the way in an accurate way (with some landmarks thrown in) so that I can find what I'm looking for. Overall, women are generally better at this than men in my experience. But like I said, there's no point in giving you specific advice because there are so many potential situations where something like this could come up. You don't need to be afraid though. If you are an empathetic and curious person, it almost certainly won't be a problem.

P.s. Just one more thing I thought of: blind and visually impaired people often give off a vibe of insecurity. Many women find this unattractive in my experience. Don't let yourself be fooled by this though.

1400,"I only use canes and have never used a guide dog but I think one of the biggest differences is that a dog is a living thing and not an inanimate object. On the one hand this is great because a dog is obviously more intelligent than a cane. It can ""think along"" with you and anticipate certain obstacles or dangers. For example with my cane I first have to bump into a wall before I know that I can't walk in that direction but a guide dog would elegantly lead me along the wall. Another advantage of owning a dog is of course that pets - and especially dogs - can become very close and loyal friends. If the chemistry between you and your dog is good, it can be a wonderful relationship.

One of the downsides I see is that dogs also need to be cared for. They need to be fed, cleaned, taken for walks, played with, taken to the vet and so on. If you have a cane you can simply fold it up when you get home and forget about it. With a dog this doesn't work. Another downsides I see is that dogs have a way of making your home kind of dirty.

So, knowing how she feels about this whole thing, it makes it much harder for me to accept her assistance when she offers it (I always wonder if it's meant in a genuine way).

With strangers I feel shy sometimes but I don't feel bad. The kind of things they have to help me with are usually very small, like telling me what bus number it is or something like that.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1574473586,t5_2qpec,t3_e0aay7,t3_e0aay7,5,1583598447,0,0,f8cz897,Blind,,,,,
1402,"You actually don't need vision for any of these things. I'd say personal hygiene is one of the easiest parts of being blind for me. You feel the amount of shampoo or body soap in your hand, you can touch the tooth paste on your tooth brush to make sure it's the right amount, you can touch your butt after wiping to make sure that it's really 100% clean etc. Almost everything in the bathroom can be done just fine without vision. Now that my vision is almost at zero, I'm even taking my eye drops without seeing the bottle. In the beginning I was very scared of this because the front part of the bottle is super pointy and I could seriously injure myself if I ever miscalculated the distance but it has never happened so far. I've figured out a neat system where I lie down on the bed, rest the hand with the eye drop bottle on my forehead and pull up my eyelid with the other hand. This way, I can ensure that I'll never get too close (plus, I've now developed a good feeling for what my hand feels like if it's 2 inches closer or further away.

Some people here mention shaving but I also don't find that to be very difficult if you've got a good, electronic shaver. I usually just attach one of the different trimming-attachments and trim my beard rather than shaving it.

So yeah... sighted people often wonder how blind folks shower or use the toilet. Ironically, these are some of the easiest daily tasks. Other things that sighted people don't think much about, such as using public transport or grocery shopping can be far more challenging. For example the other day I wanted to buy some banans but I couldn't see what number they were (to weigh them). And even if I had somehow known the number, I probably couldn't have typed it into the touchscreen on the scale either. Now, usually there are other customers or an employee that I can help but on that day there was absolutely no one. I was the only person wide and far. I thought about leaving my shopping basket behind and staggering through the store with my bananas until I would run into someone but that seemed too embarrassing, so I decided to stay put and wait until someone came to save me. I ended up waiting there for almost 15 minutes. For a sighted person, this would have been enough time to get in and out of the supermarket. When you're (almost) blind, you have to accept the fact that you are **constantly** wasting your life's time everywhere you go. You get lost when looking for a new address, you acciidentally board the wrong bus, you have to wait 15 minutes until you find someone who is willing to help you etc. And you've got to manage all this waste of time while still trying to somehow maintain a normal life with work and all the things that sighted people do. I find that far more challenging.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1574206639,t5_2qpec,t3_dyjueq,t3_dyjueq,2,1583422136,0,0,f838gp7,Blind,,,,,
1403,"1. Restaurants: I usually don't eat out alone because it makes me feel awkward. When I visit a restaurant with my wife or a friend, I usually ask them to read the menu for me. I ask them to read it slowly so I can remember as much as possible (so they don't have to read it 50 times for me).

Supermarkets: Sometimes I venture out alone and I simply try to find things by myself. This works if I know the supermarket well and all my groceries are easy to find (say, milk). If I need specific products that I wouldn't be able to find on my own, I usually ask the people at the customer service to walk through the store with me. Finally, the big food shopping on the weekend is something my wife and I always do together. This is much easier for a number of reasons. Firstly, my wife is sighted and thus she finds things much quicker (and she can guide me through the store). Secondly, we don't have a car, so it's easier to carry everything home if you're two people. And thirdly, we use the opportunity to go for a walk together (the way to the supermarket and back is kinda naturey and peaceful).

Farmers/christmas markets: I don't visit them often but here I always bring along my wife. It's also more fun to explore these markets together, especially christmas markets.

2. Signatures: Many blind people have a little plastic card in their wallet that looks like a credit card. In the middle of that card is a rectangular hole. If they need to sign something, they simply tell the other person to place the card on the paper so that the hole is on the signature line. The blind person can then make their signature inside that rectangular hole.

However, this is not what I do. I simply ask the person to guide my hand, either by moving it with their hand or by telling me where to go (""a little up and now a little left""). Before I write my signature, I always ask how much space I have.

3. If you're talking about cracks in the sidewalk/street, we don't have this in my country. Our infrastructure is always very much up-to-date and all our sidewalks and streets are very smooth, even and constructed in a regular way. That said, I do use a white cane so that I don't bump into street signs or other pedestrians.

If you're talking about cracks in objects (like electronics), the answer is pretty simple: if we can't touch them and we can't see them, there's no way to know they're there. Usually there are other people though who can tell you about it.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1574912858,t5_2qpec,t3_e2m247,t3_e2m247,3,1583972196,0,0,f8xai63,Blind,,,,,

1423,"A couple of thoughts:  

First, just huge kudos for even wanting to try. Obviously you're successful and living well without it, so recognising the want and having the nerve to work on it is quite awe-inspiring. 
It's not just about books, is my first thought. You can label items, write/read notes, play card and board games, or with technology play other games (dogfighting is much enhanced when I can read my airspeed and distance to target with one hand whilst flying the aircraft with my other). So if there's anywhere at all in your life braille can come into play, that'll smooth your path. 

Second, it's not all about learning the full braille code. Braille displays can generally only show you grade 1 or 2 braille, but there are ways of getting copies of books commensurate with your fingerprint level. As a kid having relevant material to pace my learning was impossible, so it's worth investigating all your options. 

Finally, how effective is your typing, either on a qwerty keyboard or touchscreen? The NVDA screen reader and Apple's line of products let you ""braille in"".  Even though that's not reading, it will allow you to practice your dot patterns - and getting yourself thinking in braille will naturally speed the reading process.",,,,retrolental_morose,,,1573932021,t5_2qpec,t3_dx0mk3,t1_f7nhth0,1,1581952606,0,0,f7oqis9,Blind,,,,,
