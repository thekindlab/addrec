2,"“Fewer teachers of the visually impaired who are qualified to teach braille...”

I don’t think this means what you think it means. There are fewer teachers of the visually impaired. Period. All TVIs are qualified to teach braille. Most of us have at least a year’s worth of braille in school before we graduate; however, TVIs are a critical shortage area throughout the United States, simply because blind/visually impaired is not a subject area that people even realize exists. BVI is such a low-incidence area that people don’t even think about it.


In general, yes, fewer people are learning braille, but I think articles like this are a tad disingenuous. Kids aren’t learning braille because we don’t feel like teaching them braille; kids aren’t learning braille because the demographic of kids that we have now who are visually impaired is waaaay different than the demographic we had a generation ago. Advancements in medical technology means that kids who would not have survived traumatic births *are* surviving now, so:

The most common cause of blindness and visual impairment in children now is cortical visual impairment; most kids with CVI are not candidates for learning braille because they have moderate to significant cognitive involvement. I wish these studies and articles would mention this rather than only pointing out that fewer and fewer kids are learning braille. Well yeah, because more and more kids who are blind have significant and complex disabilities aside from blindness that takes braille off of the table.

35,"I've been blind in my left eye since I was 5 and I drive :) I think that at the start driving in general can be kind of scary because you are nervous (so you're more jumpy) and you're trying to pay attention to absolutely everything... I think maybe being blind in one eye adds to that a bit, because it's just one more thing, but it is not something to be scared of.

I would say to think about your limitations, if you're buying a car look for one that has nice visibility on your left side... Also train yourself to keep the car steady when you're checking your blind spot, as it's easy to jerk the car one way or the other when you're turning your head so far or when you check and there's a car there that you weren't expecting. Train yourself to have good awareness of the cars around you by using your mirrors (when they are coming up behind you and then passing you) so that you almost always know what's in your blind spot anyways.

If you're like me, being blind in one eye doesn't prevent you from living a normal life in almost any way, and this is the same! Don't make it bigger in your head than it needs to be - try to be a safe and cautious driver in general, and be aware of the ways your vision can affect you and take steps to mitigate those. You can get blind spot mirrors for your side mirrors, and many new cars have blind spot sensors...

What's worse is that the x-button or the ""no, thanks""-button are always super tiny, so I have to squint and harm my eyes by looking for those damned buttons for several minutes. It's pure torture and just so frustrating. I'm not interested in whatever BS that website wants to sell me and after giving me such an unpleasant experience, I'm even less inclined to give a damn. Sometimes pop-ups are so bad that I can't handle the situation. I have waisted too much time in my life dealing with this stuff. This is why I've made a rule for myself. If I can't find the x-button within 10 seconds, that's it. I'm leaving and never visiting your website ever again. Still, I wish web designer could finally stop annoying VI/blind people with pop-ups. By the way: yes, I do have a pop-up blocker but many types of pop-ups show up anyway.

2. Websites that fall apart when you zoom in. I don't get this. How hard is it for website developers to check whether their sites collapse when zooming in before they open them up for the masses. I mean, just take a MacBook and zoom in with the pinch-motion. It takes a few seconds. If everything on your website overlaps and your screen looks horribly chaotic now, maybe redesign it a bit. There are websites I am forced to leave again for the simple reason that I can't zoom in and if I don't zoom in it's too small for me to see. By the way: a great example of this would be reddit. I am exclusively using old reddit because new reddit is total crap. If you zoom in on new reddit, your screen becomes a total mess and the surfing experience very unpleasant.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1561572729,t5_2qpec,t3_c4r47x,t3_c4r47x,1,1570964750,0,0,es3xj2d,Blind,,,,,

117,"Most pills feel different or are different sized. There's also varying sized bottles and possibly other formulas you could switch to for more variances.

For example, I had a chalky white pill that had a distinct, slightly mildewy smell. It was also in a giant bottle that none of my other pills came in. But, if I had more chalky or mildewy smelling pills, I'd have considered other formulas, which all came in capsules of varying bright colors if I remember correctly. I had a lot of medications, between 16-20 pills a day and more when I was taking pain meds, but I had mostly different types.

- 12 chalky, mildewy fuckers

- One squishy, ovular thing

- One big as fuck antibiotic that was roughly the size of my thumbpad and felt like swallowing a spoon

- 1-4 round pills in a blister pack, I think I started with 4?

- 2+ large, round ones

- 1-3 hard capsule shaped pills

- 1? pill, smaller, in a blister pack I think? or maybe that was until I got the bottle? I can't remember

- slightly powdery round ones, I think they were grape but could be wrong

I kept track just by knowing which pill was which and how many I needed. If I had to do it now, I would probably just keep a lid for each of the bottle sizes and use my pen friend to record them, or go to a pharmacy that has the device that records info onto a label and gives you a player.

I was always kinda unclear on how far people can see, and in how much detail. It's still not entirely clear. The ability to see bugs smaller than a grain of rice without a magnifying glass kinda blows any sense of scale into question.

166,"It's worth mentioning that, the suggesting that VI have their own distribution in Linux, it isn't segregation any more than the suggestion that everybody have their own diary - the whole idea of Linux is that everyone has a unique install that works for the needs and the wants of the user.

Just about everyone starts with a popular distro and modifies it to their needs over time - ussually making it drastically different in time. 

It has a steep learning curve, I'll admit, but it's totally worth it. Find a distro that you *can* use - and be decisive about your choice. Switching distros won't help you learn.

Then simply start researching how to change the things you dislike. Some things will be too confusing at first, and so you just deal, but some things you'll find are quite easy.

180,"Discord is not inaccessible. It's far from being a shining example of accessibility, but after a ton of persistent chatting with the Discord people they finally started turning it around.

Android supposedly gives the best experience. I haven't used Android for a few years so I can't comment on that, but it sounds like things still work pretty well there.
The PC client used to be pretty bad, but over the last few months things have improved considerably, with most if not all of the most important controls being labeled. The interface is a bit cluttered with a lot of stuff going on, but as long as you use your screen reader's landmark and form field navigation keystrokes you should get to grips with it pretty easily. If you don't have an Android device this is definitely the recommended way of accessing it.

Discord on iOS is pretty terrible, and as far as I know they literally have one guy working on it so it might be a while until this starts changing. You can read and write chats, but just about every other control is not labeled and VoiceOver just clicks on them. iOS 13 puts in a slight effort to identify what they do and you can figure them out with some persistence, but considering the options you get change based on if you're just looking at a server or join a voice channel or are doing something else the experience isn't pleasant and I mainly restrict my use of the iOS app to replying to messages via notifications.

So, in summary use the computer version if you don't mind.

184,"This is, more or less, my experience as well, however, I believe the performance issues I have are due to my watch being series 0, the very first Apple watch. xXLosingItXx, which series do you have? I have heard that the newestes version, series 4, is almost as smooth and quick as using an iphone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the Apple watch on day one. I stopped using it after a while, but I pick it back up from time to time and I have just started using it on a daily basis again. I love it's haptic time telling method. I find talking watches intrusive some of the time, and I have trouble telling the exact time with braille watches. The watch is also handy when I'm climbing at the rock gym, and doing cross country skiing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from the, above mentioned, points, an Apple watch called complicated, which I just found, is great, and the other reason I'm using the watch again. With the complicated app, you can create widgets for your watch face that basically pull data from any where you want. For example, I have one that shows me the subject and sender for incoming emails from my various accounts. I have a second widget that pulls in posts from some sub reddit feeds I picked, plus some Rss feeds etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The health tracking is also very good if that matters to you. I would think it's the most accessible health tracker out there.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that said, I have found the series 0 watch to be very under powered and lacking. I believe Apple has made things a lot better with the newests watches, but I'm only saying that from what I have heard. I think most people would not have enough use for the watch to make it's steep price tag worth it, but I have found uses for the thing.",,,,EndlessReverberation,,,1560980662,t5_2qpec,t3_c2ltj1,t1_erkzrcr,2,1570305063,0,0,erl89je,Blind,,,,,

This one is almost good. You can easily access and create servers.

THis requires you to two-finger tap and hope you aimed properly in order to bring up the menu to edit/delete your text. It's more than useable.

Desktop. This one I have the least experience with. Last time I used it was a broken mess with hashes instead of names for every server and non-existent screen reader nabigation. Sounds like it's gotten better lately.

iOS. THis one is pretty crap. It's where the Android client used to be. You can't easily switch serbers and scrolling text in the main view is a colossal pain.

My girlfriend is blind, we have been dating for a year. I have learned alot since we started dating so maybe I have a little bit to share.

Obviously everyone is different, but this is what seems to work for us.

I do my best to position myself as her companion and not her care taker.

The little things are important. If a cashier holds out a receipt, dont grab it for her, notify her that its there. She will tell you if she would like you to grab it.

If someone asks if she needs help, do not answer for her. You are there to help her, WHEN SHE ASKS.

Understand that when you are walking somewhere with her that she is unfamiliar with, she is somewhat trapped with you. Respect that in that situation she has placed alot of trust in you and given you control, do not take advantage of that control. We have gotten into minor arguments while out and about and it is not a pleasant experience to be unable to get away. Along those lines, I ask that the blind partner respect that they gain alot of power over a person who has surrendered their own autonomy in order to not impose.

I'll admit it can be tough to date a blind person at times, its important to communicate that to your partner. Dont burn yourself out.

Just treat her with respect. If you like her and she likes you and you both think it will work, go for it. It's a scary thing to start, but it quickly becomes normal, and really not that much different then dating a sighted person.

Obviously this is all from the perspective of the sighted partner in the relationship. If I got anything very wrong I'm sorry. I'm still learning everyday about how to date a blind person.",,,,SirJoner,,,1561489707,t5_2qpec,t3_bvw1ee,t3_bvw1ee,1,1570917402,0,0,es15osk,Blind,,,,,

He’s six by the way, so not identical circumstance. He absolutely loves audio books and can independently choose what he wants to listen to with his Amazon Echo. 

He also loves films under the ‘disney’ umbrella  (the obvious cartoons, but also the marvel ones) as the audio descriptive on the blu rays is second to none. 

As for games, although you won’t quite get the full blockbuster game experience there are a number of games for VI gamers, even some for Xbox. The names escape me but a quick google search should help you out. 

There is also a company called ‘Remap’ that could probably help you out with some visual aids as well. I saw recently that they provided someone that had very limited vision with what is essentially a VR headset. They configured it in such a way that the whole picture was shown in a small area where they had good vision and gave the experience of a sighted person watching on a 50+ inch TV. Could be worth reaching out as this might allow you to game. 

When it comes to work, keep trying, give it your best, and ultimately if you decide that it is too stressful or tiring on your eyes then there are always other careers that you can explore. 

Most important thing is speaking to your family and friends rather than remaining silent. If everything looks fine from the outside then they are likely to think that is the case.

After trying without success to be a public defender, he was motivated to enter the Judicial Branch, which he achieved by passing the tests given in the opposition competition of the National School of the Judiciary.

García Hurtado had to break down barriers and stigmas in order to demonstrate that lack of vision is not a limiting factor to advance.

""We people with disabilities are a minority who have to fight with our environment, and many times with our family because many people (blind) could not do anything because the family prevented them wanting to protect her,"" says Garcia Hurtado, 34.  

He believes that as a judge he is required to do more and that there are people who have questioned themselves, as they have done, to a lesser degree, with the two blind public defenders. He says the judge is in a leading position in a court, being the focus of attention as he directs the hearing.   

He states that the person has to be independent and fight for what he wants, being persistent until he achieves his goals.  

""We always use, even if you don't say so, the desire to want to demonstrate one and want to demonstrate to others,"" he says.

He understands that the family is very important for school inclusion, as well as the individual's own desire to learn, and how he takes it in terms of spaces that have not been designed for people with disabilities, and the number of students who are accepted in a classroom.

**Vocation for the law**

He always wanted to study law, but he didn't focus on the judiciary because he analyzes that human beings tend to pigeonhole themselves in what has been done. That's why he chose public defender because there were already two other blind people. ""I tried to enter that contest, and it was a great disappointment because I could not prove my knowledge because I could not pass the psychometric, I lived a time of mourning for that loss,"" he says.

As time passed, a friend encouraged him to participate in the contest for justice of the peace, to which he applied without any expectation, for the disappointment he had in the public defender.   

""When I passed the psychometric, things changed, and it was already a matter of a challenge that I had ahead of me, I had to do it in the best way and I did not remain to lament"", she emphasized.

He finally entered the judiciary school in June 2014, where he graduated.  

His first official appointment was as a justice of the peace in Monte Cristi, but he did not go for the needs in Santiago, where he was offered to be an itinerant judge, a position he decided to accept.  

He was appointed in the penal area, but then had the option to choose in the labor court, so he serves as itinerant justice of the peace in the labor court of Santiago, where he replaces when there is no incumbent. Occasionally, he has worked on the liquidation of files to avoid default.

The number of files he knows depends on the needs he has to meet.

**How do you work?**

For the knowledge of the cases, during the hearing the secretary is assisted, who says, has public faith and complements it. Outside the courtroom, he or she relies on an assistant attorney, especially for those things he or she cannot do.

""I wouldn't be able to read a document that is on paper, it should be on digital to read it, so I ask him what I want to know about the document because the scanners are there and they are made but that's not all,"" she says.

He also specifies that in this type of area he needs to know if a document has a stamp or not as if a letter is stamped, in short, graphic things that he needs to know.  

The magistrate usually wears dark glasses, which he preferred to wear during the interview at his office in the Palacio de Justicia in Santiago, which caught my attention, so I asked him why at the end of the conversation.

The magistrate explained that the first reason is that the light bothers him, and the second, for aesthetic reasons, due to the fact that at times he cannot control the movements of his eyes.  He also wears glasses in court.

Garcia Hurtado manages very well in his work environment, without needing much help.  He uses his work tools, puts on his robe and cap, goes to the bathroom and audience room behind the office, and takes the stand without asking for help. At one point during the interview, he asked his assistant to provide him with a cell phone charger, realizing that his device had been turned off.

216,"Everyone here is probably going to say iPhone, and they're probably right, but let me describe my experience as a blind android user.

&amp;#x200B;

The one big advantage Android has over iOS in terms of accessibility is the ability to add 3rd party speech engines that can be used system-wide. I'm using Eloquence (the TTS engine that comes with JAWS).

&amp;#x200B;

It's true that Apple has a huge head start with VoiceOver compared to TalkBack on Android. It's faster to navigate via VoiceOver thanks to split-tapping, and braille support is pretty rudimentary on Android right now. Talkback also handles braille in a weird way: by using a separate app rather than integrating it into the screen reader. but accessibility is getting better and better as time goes on. If you don't want to be a guinea pig, than I suggest going with iPhone, but if you want to help improve the experience for blind android users, consider buying an Android phone. I would recommend the Pixel 3a or 3a XL.

&amp;#x200B;

Android phones are also cheaper than iPhones. The aforementioned Pixel 3a XL is half the price of the current iPhone, and it comes with a headphone jack. Accessories are also cheaper thanks to the industry standard USB type C port vs Apple's proprietary (and expensive) lightning port.

&amp;#x200B;

Android is also more customizable. I have a home screen widget that tells me the closest bus times. Most of the big accessibility apps are available (at least the ones I use) like Voice Dream Reader, Nearby Explorer, and BARD mobile.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple devices do hold their value ridiculously well, though. I was able to trade in my iPhone 6 plus (released in 2014) for over $200 USD just a few weeks ago.

That said, I am totally OK with skipping paper Braille. My teachers tended to jump around in textbooks, so there were nights I'd have to try and cram 6 or 7 volumes in my backpack along with everything else. There were times that thing weighed in at 35 and 40 pounds on our scale and I was only in grade five. 
Part of the problem is kids who are visually impaired just don't want to be thought of as blind. I know one person who could barely see a computer monitor at the maximum system magnification but refused to use even ZoomText or a similar dedicated magnifier, so just struggled through. I suspect they're not the only one.
Personally I'd like to get a display again, but as others have mentioned most of them are too expensive. If Orbit had ever gotten their crap together and had a steady supply of devices, and the various partners that were all about the OR20 before it came out had stuck with it, we'd be seeing the big display makers investing in R&amp;D to make actually good cheap displays. Still may happen one day, but at this point as far as I know the Orbit is very hard to get except direct from the company. That's fine, except if one is trying to import it, chances are you'll pay almost twice the price in import fees, taxes and the overall shipping cost if customs decides they want some money.

232,"I'm going to say the unpopular thing: learn to use a screen reader. I code every day for work, using NVDA on Windows. After enabling audio indentation alerts, and tuning the punctuation so it speaks the symbols I need to know about, things work quite well. I'm still frustrated by sighted colleagues who can look at colors or other visual indicators to find missing braces and the like, but that's not common.

Now, the important thing is that I've been visually impaired to the same degree my whole life. Transitioning to screen readers is much, much harder than I had it, knowing them from little up. I'm not saying you'll be up and running in a week, or that you can instantly work out how to remember and parse text so you don't need to read the same line over and over to figure it out. I'm not saying things will be great. What I *am* saying is that a screen reader may be the best of some uncomfortable options for you at this point. It's the only way I know of to work more or less efficiently with the limitations you explained. I can understand wanting to keep doing things the sighted way, but when copy/paste becomes a challenge, it sounds like it's time to at least investigate a screen reader.

Please note that this is *not* the same as learning braille. That's a whole other level, and I don't know that you need it. I find it helpful, but not essential.

239,"I’m actually working on a similar project with my blind friend right now. At present he plays a lot of our games with a sighted helper either another player or non-player to help with hand management and piece description and strategy. We’re actually speak it with the game designers and the RNIB (based in the UK) who are working with us to make games more accessible. The basic principle is to keep it simple. 

Try different solutions until something works. For card games with lots of text, we’re looking at embossing a Braille code that can be read and then giving the option to look up the code on a word document or in paper form. 

For very visual games you can emboss a pattern on sticky plastic and put that on the game board allowing the player to feel the map and piece locations.

Dice seem to be our biggest hurdle since the games we play rarely use traditional d6s. But we’re working on that and will likely come up with some sort of 3D printed solution.

The thing with the bus is that, depending on how frequent your route is, leaving work thirty seconds later or having to wait at a stop light while walking to your stop could make a 20-30 minute difference in your ETA at home.

I still do most things on the computer by sight including navagation with the mouse etc. But having the additional voiceover makes it so much easier especially when it comes to eye strain.

283,"I have experience in this field as a job and have seen a variety of setups. Here’s what I can say as a general consensus of that I’ve seen.

For Mac 

- MAC computers are alright for basic things. If she’s going to be using any large files, the lag cause by VoiceOver may become and issue, although with a newer Mac this hasn’t been an issue. 

- VoiceOver is by far the least buggy, and integrates well with most websites and programs.

- While annoying, MAC touchpada tend to be better for VoiceOver users, as the touchpad allows for gestures. 

Overall if she already knows the OS, I would recommend a Mac.

Now for Windows:

- many people find NVDA annoying, as it’s very buggy, and most workplaces do not not allow it. The only time NVDA is superior to JAWS is the internet. JAWS tends to crash when on the web, and due to internet explorer becoming obsolete (JAWS is built around IE) this problem will only get worse. 

- on the other hand, JAWS is much easier to learn, and most trainers and agencies prefer it. While still not easy, the stability outside the web and plethora of materials available are helpful. Again, most companies only allow JAWS, and some will pay for it too. I know it’s expensive, but the yearly subscriptions are a good price. You can download it for free to test it out too. 

- some people prefer external keyboards because the keys are easier to distinguish, and many JAWS and NVDA commands are easier with a NUMPAD.

I’ll be frank, if she’s continuing to lose her vision, get her to learn a screen reader NOW. I’ve seen too many people make the mistake of relying on their little bit of vision and struggling.

321,"I dunno. Sometimes I think its a stress thing, but most of the time I think its just a default if I start thinking deeply about something. My mind wanders and my hands in my eye. In my early teens I trained myself to stop doing it in public.

I don't have any suggestion for a technique for how to stop. But my suggestion is to get a male member of the family or a friend that's a few years older to talk to your kid about it.

Thing is, not being able to see, you can tell me something looks weird, I can hear it twenty, fifty times, but I'm not really understanding the potencial for how bad it can look.

I used to rock, in public, and I didn't stop that until I was like 13 or 14. Not to be crass here, but at some point I realized I'd never get laid, rocking in front of women and that's what made me stop. To me it just felt natural. People told me it looked weird, but it was never made clear to me that it wasn't, like slightly weird but super weird as in  only really autistic people do that.  So the earlier your kid knows its highly socially inappropriate the earlier he'll stop especially when the rewards for stopping are social.

349,"It’s been almost a year for me (11 months) and I am just now beginning to get to my new normal. At first they said this was probably temporary, and then they didn’t know... and then the hard truth, a couple of months later was that the vision wasn’t coming back. The doctors said my brain would figure it out and adapt with the vision I had left. The headaches would subside and the dizziness would ease up. I remember wanting to scream and rip my eyes out and find a way to undo all of it, to go back to seeing how I used to see. It was a harsh reality to know that I would never be able to see that way again. It’s a long road getting to acceptance (at least for me it was). I felt alone and helpless as I thought I had lost the independence that I loved so much. I kept it all inside and isolated myself.

So 11 months later, Ive done a bunch of soul searching and found a good antidepressant. My depth perception is still terrible but I can work around it.

I'm legally blind (20/800 in my dominant eye, with a usable field of vision of &lt;1 meter), but it's been deteriorating throughout my life.  While there are often visual cues/turn-ons for many types of people, if you find someone that appeals to you, it's often the subtle actions that stick out more.  You can hear the way their voice changes slightly when they talk to you.  Their hands aren't stiff and formal like in a handshake; they take the moment to actually feel the connection and see how you change after you both cross that social threshold.  

You can still appreciate aspects of both men and women without being sexually drawn to them.  While there are obvious physical differences between them that stand out, you can still find what appeals to you most.  A while back, I found out that a gay friend of mine liked bearded men.  He asked to feel my beard once, I shrugged and said ""sure"".  After about 10 seconds of it, I asked why he liked them so much.  He said that he liked the way it rustled through his fingers, how easy it was to feel other parts of the face from there (strong jawline, cheekbones, skim smoothness), and also how much leverage he could work with once things got rowdy.  While I appreciated his ... honesty, it's not something that appealed to me as a person.  That said, different people are stimulated in different ways.  I encourage you to find out what stimulates you in a person; just make sure to be open to different experiences.

440,"&gt;But I really have no idea what depth perception is supposed to look like.

It's really quite a subtle effect.

If I close one eye, it's not as if everything all of the sudden just changes, and I'm like ""whoa, I can't judge depth any more"". If I had to venture a guess, I'd say 90% of my estimation of depth is based on contextual clues and prior knowledge about the world around me - not on stereo-vision:

* Occlusion: Things in front of other things occlude them
* Parallax: When I move, foreground elements shift in relation to background elements more or less, depending on how far way they are from each other
* Sizes of well-known objects: If something appears tiny, given its usual size, it's far away, and vice versa

Depth perception helps in visually **ambiguous** situations - elements with the same color and texture occluding each other for example. So, a single tree branch with leaves in front of other trees or a forest disappears into a green, chaotic mess if I close one eye.

With both eyes open, it helps to separate it from the background: I can pretty clearly recognize the outline of the branch as something that is closer to me, and it feels more dominant and more ""clear"" in my field of vision than the greenery behind it.

With stereo-vision, we basically get a double image for everything that isn't in the plane of focus. That double image is not something you'd ever really notice, unless you pay attention to it, but it's there. And the further away (front or back) something is from the plane you're currently focussing on, there more extreme the shift gets between the two images.",,,,PistachioCaramel,,,1560639137,t5_2qpec,t3_c10chw,t1_er9tet2,19,1570051622,0,0,eraas77,Blind,,,,,

I host a podcast about visual accessibility in board games and we recently recorded a couple of episodes about fifteen gateway games for the blind and visually impaired. I see that your main goal is for her to practice braille, but there also are plenty of accessible games out there that work with some sighted assistance alone. If you are interested, you should check out episodes 11 and 12. I also had a guest on my show who has a collection of over two hundred games and has brailled over 170 of them and shares some tips and things to keep in mind. This was in episode 8.

The link to the podcast is https://sightless.fun/podcast

471,"My first gilded comment - thank you :)

I'm glad it actually helped - I was afraid that it was all a bit abstract, and I was explaining more the *how* it works than what it *feels* like (which is quite difficult to convey).

I was thinking of another comparison (which I didn't put in the first comment, because it was already getting long): The way depth perception *feels* to me is a bit like the effect of [ambient occlusion](https://vr.arvilab.com/blog/ambient-occlusion) in computer graphics. AO is basically an advanced lighting/shading method in 3D rendering that also takes into account that objects can shadow themselves, depending on their shape. So it's not just ""directional light hits object, casts shadow on another object"".

If you look at the very first image in that post, you'll notice that there is no actual directional light source casting any shadows (that image consists *only* of an AO layer). All the shadows that are in there are the effect of that soft, diffuse ambient light not quite getting into all the nooks and crannies. Such an AO layer then would get combined with regular lighting, [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Show_how_3D_real_time_ambient_occlusion_works_2013-11-23_10-45.jpeg).

Unless seen on its own, in a greyscale clay render like that, it's also quite a subtle effect. But it really accentuates the shape and plasticity of objects. That first image with the AO-only layer is like pure shape-ness, if you will. It puts emphasis on the edges of things, and helps separate them from their background.

So that's sort of what depth perception feels like to me. At least that's the closest visual approximation I can think of, that can be shown with 2D images. Unlike the picture of the sunflower field in your biology book :) I still don't quite understand how that could possibly work as an explantion.",,,,PistachioCaramel,,,1560644518,t5_2qpec,t3_c10chw,t1_eradgv2,7,1570058350,0,0,erahyax,Blind,,,,"My first gilded comment - thank you :)

You are correct that dimensions matter in braille. Spacing also matters a lot.  A dot that is in a slightly different position can mean something totally different, so precision matters. 
The braille labeler everyone is talking about can offer that.  If you go to a blind association and offer to pay for some phrases on plastic,  they might be willing to do them for you. 
If you were looking for more of an esthetic simulated braille that is still technically readable,  you could do rounded pushpins or brads. They wouldn't be as easy to read, but they might be more eye catching.

However,  exposure to print is a HUGE part of learning to read.  I strongly believe that if a child cannot see well enough to read size 24 font in an academic setting, they should be learning braille.  Reading is how we learn how words are spelled,  how we learn about sentence structure and grammar, and how we learn about worlds beyond us.

The ones with the most sight who are still considered legally blind (b3s) do not use any kind of speaker if they don't want, but instead their guide skis with a brightly coloured bib for them to follow.","[{'start': 414, 'end': 422, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I was trying to learn how the mechanism works to see if it can be made more cheaply, but I really have no access to the equipment to take it apart and study it.  You can make a custom keyboard that works with a computer on the cheap, but that doesn't address the tactile aspect.  As I understand it, the readers are a series of pegs that pop up or down depending on what you're typing and it seems to me that can be DIYed cheaply by somebody knowledgable.  I have been told that prices of existing equipment are so inflated largely because the government generally pays for it and the system by which the government pays for things promotes abuse of the prices.  That's a little oversimplified, but that's the gist of it.  There can be little innovation in the field if those capable of innovating it don't have reasonable access to what already exists.



There's also practically no incentive for sighted people to learn braille, so there will always be a disconnect there.  I read an article a few months ago that one of the reasons many blind people don't learn braille is largely due to sighted people not producing enough of it.  That made me wonder if there are screen readers capable of reading braille visually or other tools that make it easier for blind individuals to produce braille items (something a bit more technologically advanced than the braille typewriters or a board and stylus).

Becoming visually impaired is a newer and very distressing experience for me and I’ve had very little support. So I guess OP making fun of me directly after I told him I didn’t find it funny pushed my buttons.

I don’t think it’s very respectful of you to say people within the blind community who don’t find it amusing are uptight, too easily offended or need to lighten up, though, as you’ve stated in your other comments. You can feel free to disagree, of course.

646,"Where to begin?

First off, I think characterising these behaviours as blindisms is faulty to start with, since there are individuals who are not blind and engage in them too. Autists are one example. The reason I raise this, is that there's often a double standard imposed on disabled people, where compensatory behaviours that others engage in with no problem, are regarded as signs of inadequacy. If a sighted person can't drive and doesn't like walking a lot, it's just the way they are; if a blind person does it it's the end of the world, etc.

A behaviour being off-putting is a value judgement. There's no particular objective reason why rocking is off-putting but tugging on one's beard, or braid, or drumming one's nails on a desk, is not. The position that purely aesthetic judgements should impinge on people's own bodily autonomy is a very bad starting point. Similar stances over things like tattoos, piercings, unusual hair dyes, were common, and are fortunately being dissolved, without these people having to belong to specific designated groups or have a separate culture of their own. Likewise, social impositions, often on women, like shaving one's legs, or wearing high heels, are slowly being seen for what they are: aesthetic preferences without normative force.

A blind job-seeker is going to have all kinds of obstacles. If, however, any other consideration than they being able to perform the job is used to discriminate against them, we should push back, not say that it is their fault and society should determine that an aesthetic preference overrides someone's right to employment. Likewise, a blind person who has unusual eyes shouldn't be forced to cover them up.

&gt; To imply that blindisms should be accepted as social norms implies that you consider blind people belong to a fundamentally distinct group.

It doesn't. People with blue hair don't constitute a distinct group, and I don't think they should be barred from employment either. Same for people with deep scarring on their faces, or who are unusually shaped and do not conform to aesthetic norms.

That said, there's merit in saying blind people constitute a somewhat separate group within society. Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation, since there wouldn't be common behaviours to speak of and the word blindisms wouldn't occur to anyone.

That people do not identify as non-blind doesn't mean much. People do not identify as cis, either; it's trans people who brought this identification into the foreground.

Finally, I'm against stigmatising any behaviour that doesn't cause harm to individuals or to society. When you say, should people rock without stigma, to me the immediate answer is, tell me what harm rocking causes, and then we can see why it should be stigmatised. Just like people shouldn't be stigmatised for having blue hair or a tattoo on their body. The comparison with queer people is interesting, in that many behaviours that people consider characteristically queer were long stigmatised, without having any impact on job performance or anything else, and this is fortunately slowly disappearing, not through queer people adapting to aesthetic arbitrary standards, but through people realising it doesn't matter and is not their business. That blind people are often considered to have problems working is true, but rocking is immaterial to that, just as women not having been regarded as able to do a man's job has nothing to do with them having breasts.",,,,modulus,,,1561051835,t5_2qpec,t3_c2kr1p,t1_ermo7z2,1,1570356731,0,0,erng14x,Blind,,,,,

652,"Hi there,

&gt; What is your setup and what do you do on a daily basis?

At home, I have a desktop computer with windows 8.1, JAWS and NVDA. I don't think I've used JAWS on it in the last 6 months. I use a wireless keyboard since I don't depend on the monitor and can control the computer from different seats so long as I can hear it clearly.

I use the computer for reading, writing, browsing the web, dealing with email, the odd programming task now and then, listening to music, chatting, talking to people through voip, and occasionally recording audio.

I have a laptop with Windows 10 and NVDA for when I'm away. Mostly for browsing online, listening to music, reading ebooks, and voip applications.

I wouldn't begin to know how to do these things on a Mac. It's probably possible though, but VoiceOver is in my opinion not very efficient.

At work I have a desktop with Windows 7, NVDA, and JAWS. I use NVDA 99% of the time for word processing, dealing with spreadsheets, email, consulting legal databases, searching and reading legal articles, browsing the web, etc. JAWS I use for a few web applications we use at work for digital signing and clocking in and out which NVDA doesn't play nicely with.

&gt; Will a keyboard with tactile feedback help initially with her learning? Or will she learn to touch typing quickly?

What do you mean by tactile feedback, a mechanical keyboard with buckling spring switches? Or some sort of indication of the letters on the keys? Not sure what you mean here. At any rate, touch typing is easy enough to learn, and she may already know how to do it (at least a lot of sighted people can). Screen readers can be configured to read each key press and that might be helpful at first, though it will probably become annoying and slow as she becomes more confident.

&gt; Do you prefer a desktop computer or laptop? 

A desktop has some advantages. A larger keyboard with a numpad, which often screen readers use, better audio hardware, and easier to use in different positions.

&gt; Do you use any special computer peripherals?

At home I have a braille display (Ecoplus, 80 cells) and at work I have a Freedom Scientific Focus (40 cells).

&gt; How significant is monitor quality for you?

I'm totally blind, so not at all significant. At home I keep it turned off and only have it around in case I need sighted help.

&gt; If you work physically at an office, how does the IT depart help with your accessibility?

Not very much. They installed the screen reader, and will channel requests about the internal applications (I work for a very large employer). Other than that, they're not very well versed on it and it's mostly up to me to work things out.",,,,modulus,,,1559809612,t5_2qpec,t3_bxctqj,t3_bxctqj,1,1568977012,0,0,eq5pcjt,Blind,,,,,

The first is, to show you have skills (hard skills) that are in demand. That could be through education or experience, but experience is more difficult because you need to get a job in that field in the first place. 

The second is, ensuring you have good soft skills. Many people with vision loss, especially ones born with it, don't always have good soft skills because it isn't explicitly taught. They including things like communication, teamwork and problem solving skills. For example, a salesperson who has good knowledge of products, but unable to explain them to a customer or convince the customer he is trustworthy, would not do well.

The third is, most employers will automatically be wary of hiring someone with a disability, usually because they have no idea how to deal with that (even in companies that have robust accessibility services). They don't know what unexpected issues may come up, or the costs associated for adaptive technologies. You would want to research what solutions work for you, so you can bring up the solutions during the interview and reduce some of that anxiety. And while they may not be fair, the important thing to consider is that an interview's job is not just to find an adequate candidate for the position, but to weed out anyone who may be problematic (it costs roughly 10 times to 20 times more to fire someone than to hire them).

While I was walking down the hall, I could see two teens who were making out on a bench in the courtyard. When I ran into the guy later, I spoke to him a bit and happened to mention I saw him making out with someone. His response was ""You could see through windows?!?!"". I was kind of surprised that he was in his teens and didn't realize that (He also had a cognitive delay, so perhaps that may have been a contributing factor).

One of my clients a few years ago lost some peripheral vision due to a brain injury, and had a few other issues as well (balance being one, and some visual confusion with her remaining vision). When walking down the sidewalk, she had trouble judging where to walk (she would waver left and right significantly). I suggested she look at a landmark down the sidewalk, and walk towards that, so she could walk in a straight line. She says ""like that red sign?"". I look down the sidewalk, but couldn't see the sign she was talking about. It wasn't until we walked halfway down the block that I could finally see the sign.

728,"I highly recommend sticking with the Mac. If you get a MacBook Pro, you can always dual-boot it with Windows if a work situation calls for it, so you get the best of both worlds.  I lost my vision suddenly 5 years ago and was a hardcore gamer, animator, and overall power user for both Mac and Windows. I largely preferred the Mac. 

Now, I have a 2015 MacBook Pro with 16Gb of RAM and a large SSD partitioned with Windows 10. My Windows partition has Jaws and NVDA, but in my line of work I hardly use it except for website testing. I'm an accessibility specialist now, testing apps and sites. At work, I have a smaller MBP and the whole company is Mac-based since the primary platform on which the company app is based is iOS. Most startups are Mac-based, while more office/traditional settings tend to be Windows based. I do quite a lot of Google doc management, Jira and browser-based work, plus just draft policy and email, plus drop into Xcode ever so often. 

At home, I program with TextEdit or Xcode, run scripts in Terminal or iTerm, play games, write, and am perfectly functional in MacOS. I like the versatility and mobility with my laptops since I'm no longer doing any work that requires the powerhouse of my old Mac Pro desktop, which I had decked out for animation rendering, editing, and gaming. My Apple 30"" display is gathering dust :( 

Personally, through all of this and having learned both Jaws and VoiceOver at the same time, I largely prefer VoiceOver. Less buggy, much more integrated, plus the concepts and skills transfer over to VoiceOver on iOS. Practically all native Apple apps are accessible out of the gate, it has a lower learning curve, and the screen magnification,  color inversion, and other VI options are quick to implement and set up.  I had vision issues when I was an animator and used to have a Wacom Bamboo pen tablet with a touch ring sensor. I bound the touch ring to the screen zoom commands and was able to smoothly magnify the screen when working, using the pen for all cursor movement and controls rather than a mouse. It was a great setup and worked well and kept me at my animation speed despite the vision issues until I lost it all.

Edit: At work, since VoiceOver is built into MacOS, there isn't anything IT needs to do other than give me a Mac for me to use it. I can just turn VO on and go from there. They've worked closely with me to help develop their internal IT software distribution app in an accessible way.

I did several things, and took a few risks. This was back in the early 2000s, I had a Braille 'n Speak 2,000. I would do two things with it. I would make it say shit as the teachers were coming in, like, ""fuck fuck fuck son of a bitch"", and dumb shit like that. The second thing I did was teach people how to braille their name with it, telling them every part of it, and showing them both the uncontracted, and contracted versions if it could be done. The, ""How many fingers am I holding up"", question... I would either make up a random number, sometimes like 30 or something, or say something like I don't know, but you asking someone you know can't see that kind of question doesn't say much about your intelligence. The tapping thing, where someone would come up on you and tap your shoulder and run off, I just developed good reflexes and would grab their wrist. Then they started doing it crosswise, and I got good at anticipating it. I remember one of the guys did this in a crowd of people and actually made me grab someone else who didn't do anything, and after that, he didn't do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm saying is try to deal with this on your own, for two reasons. First, you'll feel accomplished if you do, and won't have to get people worried on your behalf, or basically scream and scream until someone listens. Those two can be equally stressful. Second, because if you do it right, then that can get your foot in the door and then you might actually make friends. If someone has to step in and deal with it for you, like a teacher or guidance counselor, then they probably will not want anything to do with you and you may not make friends, and might end up basically outcast.",,,,bscross32,,,1559762260,t5_2qpec,t3_bwuhb1,t3_bwuhb1,2,1568944739,0,0,eq3sncr,Blind,,,,,
804,"Hi. I'm kind of at that point with my vision where I am going to need a cane, so I definitely see where you're coming from and I'm sorry you're having such trouble with it. I think the issues get worse the longer you hold out though. There's some pride there, some fear of what people might think of you, etc. These things are relatively minor compared to what the cane can do for you though. I think safer navigation is just one thing it can do. The more important thing is it makes you not look like the ass hole if you do run into someone or something like that, so you'll probably get yelled at less. Mostly though, I'd just try to remember that you'll most likely never see those people again and let it pass. From their point of view, they just see some girl slam into them not watching where she was going. If you had your phone out too because of GPS directions or something, that makes it look even worse, like you're too busy texting or on IG or something to pay attention.

&amp;#x200B;

My best advice is if anything in your life that deals with vision is giving you trouble, find a nonvisual way of doing it. I recently had to put bump dots on my microwave, for instance. I refuse to get a talking one lol. Long ago, I realized I needed to stop giving myself eye strain by reading print and use a screen reader and get the materials in an accessible format. I think just sort of swallowing that bitter pill and moving past those types of things into a different way of thinking and doing things will help a ton. Then, you'll look back wondering why you tried to hold on to the old way of doing things.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me ask everyone a question. How are we supposed to bridge the gap between the blind and the sighted if some of us are wielding big sticks and driving off the sighted every time they try to approach us. You can't have it both ways. You can't complain about the way you're treated but then treat others like shit. What'll end up happening is the people who have questions will grow reticent to post them here, and it may even deter them from doing whatever it is they were going to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to give some examples of ignorant questions and ways they could be phrased a bit differently to show the questioner does really want to learn rather than propagate stereotypes or show their ignorance. By the way, I did want to make it clear that I at least, see a difference between ignorance and willful ignorance. The latter being ignorance you have no desire to do anything about. Ignorance itself isn't a bad thing. It's more to do with how you approach dealing with it. Anyway, here's the examples. 

Q. (bad) Who picks out your clothing? How do you dress yourself?

OK, this one asked this way is pretty offensive because it rather strongly hints that we're incapable of dressing ourselves. I count this in two ways. First, the actual mechanics of putting clothing on our bodies, and second, picking out pieces that go together.

Q. (good) HHow do you pick out what you're going to wear? How do you deal with colors when picking your outfit so everything matches?

Something along that vein would be good. It doesn't imply invalid status, or some form of incompetence. Plus, it just sounds more intelligent.

&amp;#x200B;

Q. (bad) What are you doing out here? Are you lost? Where's your carer/assistant/attendant?

This one's offensive because it drips with condescension and some level of disdain. We didn't teleport out there on the streets. We didn't break out of a group home or asylum. We're quite able to travel, and it's an insult to demean us because \*you\* have it in your head that we're useless.

Q. (good) Do you need any help? Can I help you find something?

One thing I think people just \*do not\* get is that losing vision and becoming more dependent on auditory solutions is \*not\* the same as being born blind and dealing with this your whole life. The structure of your thinking is different. Born blind people seem to think in audio, or images made up of audio rather than visuals. It's not that way for me. Even now with most of my usable vision to the point where reading isn't viable, I still think in actual images, imagine things visually, etc. You can't just be like OK, time to switch that up. It's a difference in the way we're wired. I think we can adapt to a point, and I have been using screen readers consistently for 10 years, but I'm still not as good with them as totally blind people.

Finally, I had to give up and get one of the other counselors to ask her for me. Also, the deaf counselors would come along and dump everything on our plates. There was some stuff I didn't like but I got it anyway lol. They couldn't really ask us if we wanted this or that and so just dumped random food on our plates without us having any idea what it was. For blind kids, that kinda sucks. I have a bit of vision, I'm still not good at identifying food visually though.

836,"Actually iOS has a magnifier app that's kind of hidden. If you go into settings &gt; general &gt; accessibilty, then under vision, you will see two things, zoom and magnifier. Zoom is all about magnifying the screen. It will allow you to drag around the screen with 3 fingers with a lot larger print. Of course, it cannot fit the entire screen because its been zoomed way in, but it's an option. Then for what you're really after, magnifier uses the camera like a magnifier. You can even add it to the accessibility shortcut, so that if you triple tap home, you end up with it. It can be combined with voiceover if needed, in which case, you'd see two options. What I've done is actually something different. I've added it to the control center instead of the accessibility shortcut, because I really only want that turning voiceover on and off. So now, when I go to the control center, magnifier is an option there.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some things you can do with it:

*  Zoom in and out the live image
* adjust the foreground and background colors to what is most comfortable
* lock the focus to view things at the same distance without it trying to compensate
* take a snapshot, then move around the frame, and even zoom further in on it.

856,"1- when it happens suddently, it feels very confusing. Like you’re all good one day and then boom.  I had a retina detachment back in the day, I basically went to sleep and woke up blind in an eye, it was very scary. When both eyes decide to fuck around at the same time it feels almost claustrophobic in a way. When you don’t really know your environnement even though it’s the one you’ve been living in for years, when you can’t be sure where you are or how to go somewhere or how to do something yet. 

2- the feelings described above kind of fizzle out once you get used to your environment and how to navigate the world. What also helped me is learning new skills and relearning old skills. Also talking with other blind people asEll as getting involved in communities that have nothing to do with blindness. 

3- i’ll give you 3 perspectives

a) after my retina surgery when I got fairly normal sight back after being completely blind for 3 days : it kind of felt freeing, reassuring and amazing. But one thing U didn’t feel was safe. From that point on, I knew that I could go blind again at any goven point. Unintentionally sla your head ? Blind. Go on a rollercoaster ? Blind. Headbangs too hard to good music ? Blind. It feels like the privilege you were given can constantly be taken back. And in the case of retina detached, it will most likely be taken back. 

b) when after being visually impaired for a year, I bought a video magnifier. That thing changed my life seriously. I could use it to read and do paperwork, to check prices when grocery shopping, to read instructions, to assist me when drawing, to get a closer look at non-accessible screens and signs… endless other stuff. It felt like a game changer like I was capable of doing everything i thought I could never do again, very revolutionary in a way, but it’s because it was a first time I was helped by a tool that cannot be taken away from me and not by a medical procedure that can stop working overnight. I liked the stability. 

c) when I got very fancy glasses. I could never explain how they work as english isnt my first language and it is quite intricate. But i’ll try. You see binoculars ? That, but attached on the right glasses lense (not the left because it’s blind anyway and that stuff costs over 700€)
Basically it helps me either see things from veryyyyyy close or I can screw a second lense on the existing thing and see from veryyyyy far. I use the thing to read normal print books, to study, to draw, etc. Anything that I have to do while looking very close at the paper. And i use the second lense at the cinema, at concerts or when watching TV with subtitles. 
Again this changed the game. A lot more things suddently became accessible and it’s like i discoverered a whole new world I had forgotten about. Again, the fact that it’s a tool and not an invasive procedure that might stop working after a year really helped making me feel safer and like I had found a balance in life. Basically felt like I was finally in control of my life. Really great feeling. 

Rediscovering stuff you had forgotten existed or looked a certain way is quite a special feeling honestly. But I don’t know how that would feel for someone who was born blind.",,,,noaimpara,,,1559555425,t5_2qpec,t3_bw554q,t3_bw554q,2,1568801422,0,0,epvwlc8,Blind,,,,,

873,"Someone I know has sighted body language, she lost her sight around the same age as you. 

When I first knew her I didn't see her use a cane until I took her to an airport and she suddenly produced a symbol stick. ""It saves a lot of explaining and justifying why I'm asking for help"" she said.

Eventually she was given a long cane with a roller tip and found it liberating, but at the same time it can be tiring and make her hands ache with using it. She now has a collection of canes from the battered old spare one, a symbol stick for guided journeys, the slightly worn daily one, and the super light pristine special occasions cane.

I see people not appreciating how limited her vision is. Sometimes it's funny when she tries to leave a house through a cupboard door, other times it is more serious when they try to guide her and don't notice head height obstacles they lead her into. Because she had the cane in her hands we can only think ""now do you understand?"" 

Canes are optional, and from what I've seen, a very useful option. They can be left behind or packed away when not needed, then picked up to be used when helpful, like an umbrella or a sun-hat, a handbag or a rucksack, sunglasses or reading glasses.

If people react to seeing a white cane it is down to their emotional state and not your possession of a cane. People are strange, they'll react if they feel your handbag is too big or your sunglasses are too fancy. Just shrug it off if you can, and acknowledge that often you can't and that's OK too.

- You have to search out the events
- you have to arrive early to make sure the AD system is on and to get the headsets
- you sometimes have to explain to the front desk people what you need
- when you get in to the theatre it is not working.

My take-aways are :

- Make it easy to find the performances - e.g. if their is a regular pattern when AD is available
- make it easy to pick up and deposit the headsets
- make sure your front-desk staff are trained and are motivated to be sympathetic
- make sure it works, either by automatic or  manual tests

# Customization
- Sudle haptic feedback for most sound queues - navigating and tapping items, turning the rotor, various errors
- Ability to turn on and off every sound and haptic feedback effect individually, in addition to just having a master switches for sounds and haptics
- Ability to create custom punctuation pronunciation levels in addition to the usual none, some and all. These allow you to change whether a character is just past to the speech synthesizer, or spoken in a different way. This can be used for example to change the default pronunciation of the # character from ""number"" to ""hashtag"" or even shorter just ""hash"". These punctuation schemes are synced over iCloud to other iOS devices and macs and can be exported out into a file that can be shared with other people or backed up for importing later.
- The ability to make custom activities - a set of settings that can be quickly switched to manually or be applied when you enter a specific app or enter a specific context like working in a word processor. Currently as of Dev Beta 1 the settings you can apply include the voice, speech rate and volume as well as the punctuation level.
- You can reassign existing gestures/bluetooth keyboard commands and add new ones to perform different actions. These include basic things like navigating to different kinds of elements, adjusting speech settings, quickly going to the home screen, app switcher and the notification and control centers, to really advanced and powerful ones like running any shortcut. Most gestures can be changed, with the exception of the 1-finger swipes that move through items and the double-tap which performs a tap on whatever is focused.
- You can now completely turn off reading of Emoji. If you interact with people that like to spam them without introducing much benefit or include them in their usernames on social media, you can now kill them on an OS level.
- You can now customize how VoiceOver handles image descriptions. Ever since iOS 11 Apple has been using the new machine learning features to guess objects and text on pictures and having VoiceOver read them out if you performed a 3-finger tap to get additional information. Now, you can have VoiceOver read them automatically if they're available or have it play a sound to let you know about them.
#Braille
- VoiceOver now includes the open-source Liblouis braille translator to provide braille translation for braille displays. This has basically become an industry standard and is also used by Microsoft and Google and offers a large number of languages. However if you prefer the old braille tables they are still available as well.
- There is now a separate rotor for changing the braille language table. Previously, this was tied to the speech language rotor.
- Typing on a braille display has been sped up greatly, which should be particularly noticeable when using contracted braille.
- VoiceOver now displays position information inside a list in braille. So for example, if you focus the airplane mode switch in the settings app in addition to the switch itself being indicated in braille you'll also see a message like ""1/50"", indicating that this is the first item out of 50 of the list of settings. This doesn't appear to be indicated with Speech for the moment, at least in the context of lists.
#Misc
- Performance in general has been improved rather noticeably, particularly when quickly dragging your finger through a lot of items or when switching through screens in an app.
- The camera app provides additional guidance while taking a picture. IN addition to telling you when 1 or more faces are in frame and where they are, you are now told if you are tilting your device and get additional audio, haptic and spoken feedback when you hold the phone level.
- If you make a screen recording, VoiceOver speech is now included in the recorded audio. Previously, it wasn't. This makes the feature extremely helpful if you want to report accessibility issues to an app developer, because you can just make a recording and demonstrate exactly where and how things aren't reading how they should be.",,,,vwlsmssng,friend / family / other,,1561055320,t5_2qpec,t3_c2w1jj,t1_ernd17n,4,1570360852,0,0,ernliz0,Blind,,,blue2,"Don't worry, I've cut &amp; pasted and tweeked it a little for visual readers

935,"This is quite a long post; I sincerely hope you read all of it, preferably aloud because you are more likely to remember it that way.

Imagine that you are on a small boat far out in the ocean, and you see a storm coming. But you think it won't be that big, so you keep rowing further out. But the storm begins, and you begin to get cold from the wind and rain. But you keep paddling, because you have a destination to reach, and you don't want to be stopped by a storm. You know that storms kill people, but you are stronger than that. You are getting colder, but you keep paddling. You eventually get hypothermia, which could have been avoided if you have rowed back to shore when the wind and rain were not as strong.

Now imagine that you live in the desert, and you have to walk for hours every day to get water. But one day your urn breaks, and the water begins to spill. What do you do?—Do you continue to use a faulty urn that has passed its usefulness as a water-carrying device, or do you use a newer urn?

Like the broken urn, your eyes are no longer useful. Like the broken urn, using them is pointless and requires much more effort than if you were to use alternative techniques.

Many of the accommodations you have just been given are not going to be effective. Large print, magnifiers and the like are only useful for people who can depend on their vision, not for you who have stated that are forced to take rest breaks and suffer both physical pain from eye strain and incessant eye-shaking.

The other accommodations of a reader and scribe are also only useful if you have people to help you. Don't you want to be self-sufficient—to be able to know that you can be independent? Without them, you are unable to read and write. Literacy is a basic human right.

You have a choice. You can row further into the metaphorical storm, where using your vision will lead to stress and pain; or you can make a promise to yourself to stop using your vision, replacing it with alternative techniques like a screen reader, braille and a long white cane, not just in exams, but all the time.

An essential question you need to ask yourself is why you are continuing to use primarily visual techniques. Is it out of bravery? It can't be, because brave people know when their efforts are hopeless. Is it out of denial? By continuing to deny the obvious, you are only rowing further into the storm; will you continue to deny the futility of rowing in the storm when there are hurricane-strength winds? Is it out of a fear of being different? You're already blind, and everyone knows it, so acting more blind can't hurt your reputation. Is it out of a fear for the future? Just look at the blind people like us who can stand proudly and are not ashamed of being blind.

When I was your age, I felt comfortable with my blindness. I could read braille for long periods of time with no fatigue; can you do this using your techniques? I could walk comfortably without assistance or incident in all lighting conditions, putting full trust in my cane; can you do this using your techniques? I used assistive technology to effortlessly complete schoolwork, and I didn't need to take rest breaks; can you do this using your techniques?

The decision is yours: Do you want to continue using a broken urn; do you want to keep sailing into the storm? If not, share this post with your parents so they understand your change of heart, then celebrate with them because you have come to understand that you are no longer going to be limited by your ineffective vision. And if you decide that you would like to stay away from the blind community, I hope you think about what users like u/-shacklebolt- and I have suggested from time to time, because if your vision continues to decline, you will have no choice in accepting the reality of your vision impairment in a few years' time; but if you decide to embrace it earlier, I know you will be much better for it.",,,,CloudyBeep,,,1560831281,t5_2qpec,t3_c1sxb4,t1_erfg3sw,3,1570174372,0,0,erga4qc,Blind,,,,,

948,"In 9th grade, packed 3000 person high school at lunch, up on the mezzanine above the cafeteria area so a very open spot, a girl was running and tripped over my cane and fell flat on the ground and started crying and kind of groaning in pain.  Didn't hear anything snap but she might have sprained her wrist or ankle or something.

I remember she had a large backpack on and she was really quiet and shy which just made things so much worse for her, I half heartedly reached my hand down for her and asked if she was okay, not expecting her to take it and of course she didn't, then she ran off (don't really blame her honestly).

Then I was left to just sorta, drift away as if nothing had happened.

I thought about that one for a while, still makes me sad.  But in that situation, there isn't allot you can do to salvage it if you both aren't that outgoing, and the societal shit just unnecessarily overcomplicates everything

&amp;#x200B;

Many incidences of my cane going between girls legs from behind do to them standing in the middle of the hall texting which felt incredibly scummy every damn time, and also hitting girls feet with open toed shoes, which happened so much I just tuned it out, but the constant underlying feeling of guilt was always there and many of them honestly did do pretty dumb shit to make that happen.  Always felt super extra mega bad though when it was a nice girl who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time though.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, some guy spun around with a big snowboard on his backpack and gave me a black eye with the corner without even noticing, and another guy was called by a teacher and ran all the way down the hall at a sprint, bending my cane at a 30 degree angle as he passed without even noticing, so...

I know it's not the most ideal, and not everyone is good with a phone, but if you try to get as much said as possible at once, you could use ""voice over"" or ""talkback"" and type something with it off, then turn it back on and hand them your phone?  You can set up a quick shortcut to turn these off and on (tripple click home on Iphone) or you can just get used to typing with it activated.

But is that really any better than texting?  Not really...  But then again I don't think I'd mind that anyway...  As long as your eloquent with your words, you can get allot of personality across, particularly with all the emoji that can now be read out by screen readers.

Modeling clay/putty/play dough is never not fun as well, and there is also this puffy paint stuff, along with raised/scratch and sniff stickers.

Wicky sticks are another option, though again a bit expensive, and they can lose their stickyness after a time.

Sand dollars, sea shells, feathers, and those circular glass things with the flat bottom and rounded top about the size of a penny were a favorite of the art teacher at the Oregon School for the Blind summer camp I went to as a kid.

You can also get special scissors that have various wavy blades which create interesting cuts.

Hot glew and string is another option, but you'll probably have to have them place the string down where they want it and tape the ends, then have you do the glewing.  Pretty cool though!

These are just general guidelines that tend to help most people, ones that very well may be discarded for others with more experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Another tip is to center the frying pan onto the burner before turning the stove on, Making sure that the handle isn't going to be hanging really in your way, but can be found when needed. When you want to check to see if the pan is hot enough, just get a few drops of water on your fingers and flick it at the pan.  It will loudly sizzle if it's ready.

Also, try putting your oil in the fridge so that it's a different temperature from your body,  and therefore much easier to feel flowing, that way you wont' use far too much by accident.  Works for other stuff like liquid medicine and vanilla extract too!

Personally I just rub the oil all around with my hand and make sure it's all covered with a thin but slick layer, including up the sides, and that seems to work well.  If you find it hard to manage with stuff on your hands, then try using one hand for all of the messy stuff if possible, so you always have a cleaner one to pick clean stuff up with, turn things on/off ETC.  It helps reduce cleanup.

If your pan moves a bit during cooking and you want to recenter it, try using a fork or the handle of your spatula to trace the outline of the burner and nudge the pan into the center again without having to touch the hot outside.  Using a smaller burner for a smaller pan/pot, and a larger burner for a bigger one helps avoid this too.

It helps to have a spoon rest as well, though it's certainly not necessary, so you can always find your stirring tool without having to leave it in the pan and possibly have to fumble for it.

For serving, it's smart to put the plate/bowl as close to the pan as possible while using a utensil to help scrape things out slowly, and getting the edge of the pan right against the dish, which is admittedly a bit tricky to do sometimes without singeing your self slightly particularly with plates, but you get used to it.

Oh and, try to avoid serving over the stove if you can, cuz no one wants food in their burners stinking up the place.

&amp;#x200B;

As for danger, as long as you don't lean in super close while cooking something which is loudly popping, or carelessly throw something big and frozen into a pan with allot of oil in it, the worst that could happen is likely a first degree burn that you'll forget about in two days max.

&amp;#x200B;

For marking your stove's knobs, you can put a piece of duct tape or some puff paint or something on, or cut a small score into, the pointer part of the knob with a sighted person's help, then mark the 3, 6, and 9 O Clock positions with more puff paint, those bump dot things, or the poor man's alternative to that, those little drawer stops from the hardware store, assuming you have no way to make braille labels.

Those are just suggestions though, there are tons of ways to mark stuff and as long as it stays on, and you can use it  accurately, it doesn't really matter what you use.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'd say in the end, the biggest thing is, as the Navy Seals say, ""Slow is steady, steady is smooth, smooth is fast.""

I wanted to get only a braille display (as I use my note taker in terminal mode with my iphone primarily) but was able to get a better deal on a secondhand note taker at the time. Pricing is such a huge barrier when you’re an individual buying your own device. Innovative products like the Orbit Reader 20 (which has suffered supply issues) are and hopefully will continue to address that problem.

In terms of volume, I do most of my reading with text to speech. Braille is still incredibly useful for things like being able to read while on the phone or in a meeting, labeling things, or just taking a break from constantly listening to things. I primarily taught myself braille as a young adult, and I’m really glad that I did. When you're older, there are a lot of forces that discourage you from learning braille. Difficulty accessing instruction, negative attitudes from people who believe that adults can't learn braille, plus barriers to getting funding for braille devices, especially if you haven't already learned braille (what a catch-22.)

I think it’s a shame that more blind children aren’t being given access to braille instruction and materials. They’re the ones that could most benefit from knowing how to read and write with braille, and the primary reasons they’re not given acces to braille have nothing to do with what’s best for them.

You could also print up and laminate a high contrast sign that says BUS to hold up at approximately the time you expect the bus to come. Then ask what bus it is when they get there. If you have a specific route you use daily, you could make up a sign with the route number on it.

I'm home for a week in late spring.

Well, this older local crosses my path close enough for me to know it's a woman and she's got bags.  (within cane range, so well inside any reasonable personal boundaries even by NYC standards) ) She turns her face toward me and snarls the beginning of something, catches my cane with both feet and hits the pavement.   The whole process took a full second.   I immediately bend over to try and help her but she shrinks away from me and refuses to say anything so I can't find her.   A crowd materializes as I'm reaching for her.   I'm in tears.  She's silent until a gentleman offers assistance.   I hear this convo.  ""Are you OK?""     ""No!   That bitch  tripped me with her cane!   She was moving so fast I KNEW she could see me!   Just threw me to the ground with that white stick!"". She's got a flock of rescuers, now.    I'm bawling.  I'm reconsidering my value to humanity, my right to sidewalk use and whether I should be out alone at all.    Then, a woman touches my arm and says"" Are you OK?   I saw what happened.""    I'm snotty and shaking at this point. "" I tried to help her.  She wouldn't say anything.  I couldn't find her to help her up."".  She says ""I saw that, too.""   With some derision, ""She'll be OK.""    

I can see the flock lifting her to her feet.  We're still about a yard from each other judging by her voice.  I don't exist.  She's lamenting my carelessness, her mashed tomatoes and how I'm just going to walk away 'scott free.'

I explain to my onlooker that I just need to know what direction intersection X is in and she tells me how to get there.

No, sweet friend, the road will not be easy or predictable but if you're taking care of yourself, you will find most people will respect how you're doing it.

(within cane range, so well inside any reasonable personal boundaries even by <LOCATION> standards) ) She turns her face toward me and snarls the beginning of something, catches my cane with both feet and hits the pavement.   The whole process took a full second.   I immediately bend over to try and help her but she shrinks away from me and refuses to say anything so I can't find her.   A crowd materializes as I'm reaching for her.   I'm in tears.  She's silent until a gentleman offers assistance.   I hear this convo.  ""Are you OK?""     ""No!   That bitch  tripped me with her cane!   She was moving so fast I KNEW she could see me!   Just threw me to the ground with that white stick!"". She's got a flock of rescuers, now.    I'm bawling.  I'm reconsidering my value to humanity, my right to sidewalk use and whether I should be out alone at all.    Then, a woman touches my arm and says"" Are you OK?   I saw what happened.""    I'm snotty and shaking at this point. "" I tried to help her.  She wouldn't say anything.  I couldn't find her to help her up."".  She says ""I saw that, too.""   With some derision, ""She'll be OK.""    

I can see the flock lifting her to her feet.  We're still about a yard from each other judging by her voice.  I don't exist.  She's lamenting my carelessness, her mashed tomatoes and how I'm just going to walk away 'scott free.'

I explain to my onlooker that I just need to know what direction intersection X is in and she tells me how to get there.

I stumble away still clearly not OK as I hear Flock Leader say to my angry collider ""You understand the white cane means she's blind, right?""

No, sweet friend, the road will not be easy or predictable but if you're taking care of yourself, you will find most people will respect how you're doing it.   If you work out solutions that work for you, then you get to experience a level of autonomy a lot of people never know exists.   I've only ever had such an experience as that once but it haunts me to this day.   Even so, if I need my cane, he's out.   I don't hesitate to use whatever tool I need to be as autonomous as possible.   Life is too short to be apologizing for avoidable incidents or someone else's ignorance.","[{'start': 1674, 'end': 1684, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
