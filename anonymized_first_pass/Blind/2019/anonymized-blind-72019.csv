5,"I have visually impaired friends &amp; family members.

Bucket lists are very personal when it comes to what sights and spectacles (no pun intended) you want to see.

Mountains, waterfalls and festivals are all the obvious ones but what you can also think about are things you might want to do independently before you need a guide to support you and describe what they are seeing. Festivals where you get lost in the crowd, learning partner dancing such as salsa.

You could prune your list of those things you could do without sight, meals, music that kind of thing, or those things you could still do with a guide or partner such as running a marathon or tandem cycling.


A bit of dull practical advice instead. Learn to use accessible software on your phone (e.g. Apple VoiceOver or Android Talkback, try both if you can) and accessible software on a computer. NVDA software for desktops is free and using it would teach you some of principles of screen readers that would transfer to a commercial software if you were to end up using one.

10,"You need to set up NVDA Remote on both systems. Now, there are some decisions you can make about this, depending how technical you are.

If you can open the relevant port on your router at home, you're better off doing that, as it's faster than using a server. If you can't do that, you need to use an NVDA Remote server. You can run one of your own on a dedicated server or use someone else's.

On the computer you want to control, you go to the NVDA menu, tools, remote, options, and choose autoconnect to server on startup. If you're opening a hole on the firewall, choose host control server, otherwise, use external server. Finally, choose allow this computer to be controlled, and a password, which you can have generated randomly. You will need to remember or take note of this password to control your computer. If anyone has this password they can control your computer and your whole security is shot.

On the laptop, go to NVDA menu, tools, remote, connect. From there, choose client, control another machine, on host put the external IP of your computer, or the server hostname, and then enter the password.

Yet, I cannot deny what is happening to me. Even as I type this, I can't read any of this text with my left eye. It is all distorted like looking through wavy glass. I can only see *much* larger fonts... and, even then, I have to concentrate to see what the letter is.

44,"Yes, me. 38 F. I was born with retinopathy of prematurity, which has increased my risk of all the diseases commonly found in middle aged &amp; elderly adults.

My first &amp; second retinal surgeries were at 18. Then cataract removal at 23. Third &amp; fourth retinal surgeries around 31. At 37 I was diagnosed with moderate glaucoma &amp; last year my retinal surgeon casually mentioned myopic macular degeneration ( mimics dry AMD).

He said I have probably had it for the majority of my life. His only suggestions are to take the AREDS2 vitamins, watch &amp; wait. I have noticed a significant decrease in vision in the last year and a half. I have always been very nearsighted, but now I am starting to feel low vision.

This is just an educated guess, but I think that the cholesterol drugs work because the drusen (yellow fat deposits visible with AMD) represent the clogging of the tiny blood vessels in the macula.

49,"I do my clinical rotations in the public school system as well as in a self-contained SPED private school. The public school has gone 100% electronic, which has made things easier for me in my limited experience at handling IEP/504 issues as a professional. The private school is in the process of going 100% paperless for everything save for the culinary arts program, so all staff will be getting an iPad for data tracking and file management. 

I love the electronic way since I can just search for a patient or student file whenever I need it. If your school doesn’t go the electronic route, my best suggestion would to be an extremely organized file cabinet. At home, I use a locking safe with a clearly labeled file for everything. For example, I’m also an EMT student (I take my state and national licensing exam next month), so I have a file labeled “Continuing Medical Education and Certifications.” For my BCBA stuff, I have another file called “Behavior Analyst Licensure and Certifications.”

88,"I just order online using an iPhone app now. (and if you didn't know, there are ways to use an iPhone pretty effectively with limited or no vision). But your other option, as people have said, is to ask for help. If you don't necessarily need a cane for navigation but just want to identify yourself as legally blind, there are I.D. canes for this purpose. They're usually a lot shorter and flimsy since they're only meant to be carried. They also fold into several sections and can be easily stored away when you don't need them.

Coming at the whole situation from a totally blind perspective, it's worth finding nonvisual ways to do things as soon as possible if your vision is fading, particularly if you find it hard to avoid bumping into things and people. I can imagine it's a tough adjustment if you're used to looking at everything. Some of the NFB centers actually give their students blindfolds to wear during training; this is a very extreme but also very effective way to deal with vision that is fading and potentially not stable. Most of the instructors are also blind, and depending on what kind of person you are, this is either very empowering and inspiring or very terrifying (it was definitely the former for me).

Your wife not being attracted to you is something that can be dealt with, I think. You could do couple therapy. You could make love to her with your eyes closed. There's so many things you'll be able to do as a couple if you have a better vision, I think none of you are considering that.

This allows you to zoom In using the camera and still have your own peripheral. The biggest issue I found was that it used digital zoom and camera quality was lost upon zooming in.

Not that he can't use it. Might work out for a phone for non-productivity tasks but that's about it.

For a classical OS with a desktop screen reader it's a bit harder. JAWS, NVDA, and Voiceover on Mac are all quite competent. VOiceover is probably the easiest to learn but you'll have to pay the Apple tax. In any case most apps on Mac OS are available on iOS so... yeah, iPad.

Thinking into the future it would be a good idea for him to learn a screen reader on Windows. JAWS on particular will come in handy later in life for work since that's what employers will buy. If you absolutely need a desktop OS then you can cheaply set up a Windows machine with NVDA, the only truly free screen reader.

129,"&gt; Textbooks for school?

Every school student should get the materials they need to study without delay. You don't get a second chance at learning with your age group.

The free market doesn't work here so I would want the state to intervene.

If you made it mandatory for all novels to be available as audio-books you may restrict the publishing of books sold in small quantities or distributed for free. 

Audio-books are also dual use, many people have them to listen to when driving or working. I'd be inclined to let the market operate freely here.

Potentially AI and voice synthesis could make it very cheap and easy for robots to generate good audio-book versions,


&gt; Audio description for movies and shows?

This is a facility really only of benefit to VI consumers so I would want state intervention to make this happen for a reasonable proportion of content.

Again to mitigate the chilling effect of state regulation I would allow a threshold on the number of units shipped / downloaded before accessibility became mandatory.

For real though, I only hear about this from disability activists, or news coverage of shitty things being done to disability funding in the US. Never hear a candidate bring it up, despite roughly 20% of folks having some kind of disability. 

We have the ADA, but still most buildings don't comply because there's a million ways to get an exception. Literally, right in my town someone opened an LGBT+ clinic (for profit, most folks don't take Medicare/Medicaid) where the main entrance is up several flights of stairs, sidewalks are beat to shit from giant tree roots... 

Because the person who opened the clinic thought the aesthetic of an old home in the historic district was pretty and that's more important than accessibility... In a *medical clinic*. And they were complaining that government regulations were restricting them from certain medical designations (tax something) because their doors/hallways weren't wide enough and there's no lift. Apparently that's unfair lol. 

I went out political canvassing in my wheelchair and they sent me to the neighborhood with the best accessibility. Out of over 60 houses, I could only reach the front door of two because of steps. Which, after research, I found there's literally no reason almost all homes have steps to the door-- not even to keep dirt out, they literally do it just because it's tradition. And even in new homes that's somehow okay. (Not to mention our HOA fought us for months over our wheelchair ramp because it ""disrupts the aesthetic of the neighborhood"".)

Shit is fucked and this really should be more of a priority, but I feel often like things are so bad most moderately-severely disabled folks have a hard time even getting out of the house and folks use that to pretend we don't exist.

147,"I have some quick thoughts before I turn my computer off and go to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

1) It took me years to come to terms with losing my sight and even now it sometimes hurts. Don't feel it's not valid to fear what may come and mourn what may be lost.

&amp;#x200B;

2) I've made great efforts to keep hobbies going. I've had to abandon some and modify others. For example, I loved Whitewater kayaking for years but it simply became too dangerous, I still lark around on flatwater. I recently took up target shooting ( I still have a few degrees of central vision to see the sights with) which is a sport that can even be accessible to the totally blind. There is a surprising amount of support out there for a wide range of activities, I know someone who plays Cricket (similar issues to playing baseball) and I am seriously considering trying Skiing.

&amp;#x200B;

3) My imagination is always worse than the reality. The unknown loss is paralysing but when it comes to dealing with the present it has always been far more achievable than I thought. I have less than 5 degrees field of view and when reading I can see no more than 1 or 2 words at a time. 10 years ago this was unimaginable disability and now it's just how the world is.",,,,DeafBlindAndy,,,1562757752,t5_2qpec,t3_cbemqk,t3_cbemqk,8,1571780475,0,0,etf2hu5,Blind,,,,,

A fire extinguisher is a good thing have on hand. My wife sometimes teaches blindness living skills and cooking. Fire safety and fire extinguisher operation is one of the lessons she always offers.

Playing with fire extinguishers is a lot of fun and it is a good experience to have before you need it in an emergency. 

A fire extinguisher is better than water for almost any type of fire and water is very dangerous for some types of fires, grease or electrical especially. Fire extinguisher demos and practice are often available at community disaster readiness fairs. I would encourage anyone to try it if they get the chance.

So yeah mine started out as some blurriness. I have allergies and get that in season. So I didn't think anything of it. But the blurriness wasn't going away. Then one day I noticed wavy text. Immediately I knew something was wrong. But I assumed it was a tumor pressing my optic nerve, because tumors can cause these symptoms. AND I have had a pituitary tumor since the 80's. I have to be on meds for life to keep it down. But the doctor said it's okay you're in menopause you can go off them. So I'd been off several years. So when I saw the wavy lines I was like omg the tumor is outta control. So instead of going to the opthalmologist, I went to my endocrinologist and had an MRI. Yes my tumor had started again but was very small and here are the meds you gotta stay on for life - and go see an opthalmologist. So when I got to him he asked oh boy why did you wait so long to come to see me? Umm because we all thought it was a brain tumor. ��

  


So now I have loss of central vision in my left eye. They said it's not bad but I can't see well out of it anymore. And when I look at text now, the waviness is gone (went away after first injection) but I see a slash through horizontal lines or anything. He said that's never going to go away.

189,"Humor
Being open and honest .
depending on your personal preference of being completely independent and finding your way or if it’s ok to help you.

in other words if you drop something, if there is something in your walking path, or holding doors a few extra minutes until you catch up . 
Those type of things.
 I’m not blind ,but one of my dearest friends is when I think about how we became friends I remember her being funny and open about what was OK and not OK to her.  This takes the pressure off ,and stopped any awkwardness from me not knowing if I should be her eyes.

I remember feeling dumb and nervous around her because it was a different experience. I didn’t want to insult her by accident.
 example  
Saying “ look, oh my god that girl just walked in with flesh colored leggings”
Even after the obvious faux pas of saying look. I wondered if I had to explain why the women looked nude with the entire outline of her Vag on display.

Underneath we are all the same. We have trauma, different experiences, stress but we all just want to be likes and accepted.

So my advice is humor
Also, for the first few times take the initiative. Ask if they would like to have coffee or whatever it is that you like to do. Make sure that you are also trying to discover yourself with activities and hobbies so that you have that in common.

I remember feeling strange about inviting my friend to the beach,Because the sand is hard to walk on and she couldn’t see the view. 
She laughed at me saying
“I can still feel the sun on my skin the sand in my toes. The smells of all different things, and the water is still refreshing”
This was the beginning of her helping me open up all my other senses.
It’s amazing all the different experiences sighted people miss because they get distracted.
She is one of the only friends that intuitively knows if I’m feeling depressed or excited. My other friends don’t notice
Until my hair is a rats nest and their are bags under my eyes.
You will do  great. Just remember your value. If you don’t click with someone that’s ok. You may have a disability, but you also have an advantage. You would be surprised how dulled sighted or hearing people’s senses are

People aren’t protesting in the streets whenever a disabled person is discriminated against.

As a blind man i can donate blood. 
As a gay man i cannot. 

As a blind man who can perform the duties of my job i do not fear for being fired due to who i happen to fall in love with or what i do in my bedroom. 
As a gay man i am not afforded this right in every state of my country. 

As a blind man i can get social security to help me survive when i don't have a job just because I'm disabled and because my country allocates money for this. 
As a gay man this is not an option. 

As a blind man i never have to worry about my right to marry or my ability to request a wedding cake from the best bakery in town. 
As a gay man the right to marry is relatively recent and i can still be refused service from that bakery because of who i marry. 

As a blind man i am not automatically assumed by police to be a problem of any sort. 
As a man of color i have a built in anxiety with police despite not being guilty of anything in my entire life because innocent people of color are killed by police officers regularly. 

As a blind man i can walk the streets holding the hand of someone i love without worrying about someone pulling over in a fit of rage to beat me to death. 
As a gay man this isn't always the case.

This doesn't need to be an us versus them scenario, because the disabled population are made up of people in all of the other minority groups. When minority groups work together to build up one another, the hand is always then extended in the future to bring other minority groups to the spotlight. Don't try to take the spotlight from the lgbt community just because you feel disabled people should have more visibility. That way of thinking makes it so that no one gets the spotlight and everyone languishes. 

Yes, of course disability rights need an overhaul in the United States. But this minority group is fighting to get rights at all. 

Also, one reason that the disabled aren't brought up more is because of the money that is piped into the programs that support us at one time or another. People don't like it when you tell them you're going to dip into their pay check and take money for other people who aren't working for a living to use. Now you're advocating to take more of their money to improve the lives of those people? The folks on the right aren't ever going to be happy with that as a collective whole and i get the feeling that there are those on the left who would be upset about it as well. That's no way to win voters. Instead those fights can be fought at a later time when victory is already won. 
Another thing to consider: who is voting? The people who are empowered to live their lives and the minority groups who have been helping get them to that point. Disabled folks aren't as active when it comes to voting days because of the hassle it is to vote at a ballot box, the technical ability it takes to request a ballot online, and general apathy toward the government while trying to get by day to day. 

TL;DR don't make this an us versus them scenario. The disabled minority group are largely made up of various other minority groups so it's a false comparison. Politicians play to their voters to win.

 $5 folded in the middle lengthwise (nearly square)

293,"There are plenty of countries in the world where a blind person would have extreme difficulty navigating independently.

You mentioned being able to take the bus--this would be absolutely impossible in certain Asian countries, even in the biggest cities of tens of millions of people! And taking a bus with a service animal? No, absolutely not. Buses can be jam-packed, filled up to the roof, and then the roof is also filled with people on the outside. And the buses don't actually stop at stops--you have to run to catch the bus on a busy street, while the bus is rolling! Note that sighted women also have extreme difficulty riding public transport in many countries across the world, so you are not alone. You really should be thankful you're even able to ride the bus. Seriously.

If you are encountering difficulty with people not believing you, make it more obvious that you are blind. Carry a cane, for example. Carry an official-looking card that explains that you are blind, with a phone number to call for verification (or print your own note on business cards).

I think you also need to accept the fact that your service animal is out of its element there. It's almost like bringing a service llama to Canada and expecting everything to be hunky-dory: no one is going to accommodate your service llama, I guarantee you. In the same way, it seems that no one is going to accommodate your service dog in a small town in Ecuador. Period. Once you accept this fact, you can either go about changing the system (call your public officials, the bus/transport ministry, get petitions going, call shops/malls, ask to speak to managers, go on Facebook/Twitter, make noise) or you can try to get around without your service animal. As for the wild dogs, you're going to have to find a way to repel or distract them; that's your best bet.

As for being short-changed or over-charged, maybe try starting with a prayer? Something like ""God bless you and your children, could you please help me pay for this correctly?"" And always end with something, ""May God keep your children safe. I have paid you correctly, right?"" Small-town uneducated people may not feel guilty about taking advantage of you, but they may be God-fearing and moral enough if reminded of it in your small interaction with them.

Sidewalks are also not a guarantee in many countries, yes. Even in countries like Canada, you are not guaranteed a sidewalk on every single street. This, of course, makes it difficult to travel on new terrain by yourself, so you may have to be reliant on others to go with you the first time.

And that brings me to my final point: in a place like small-town Ecuador, you may need to accept the fact that you cannot travel around independently, not without issues at least. So you need to buddy up with sighted persons, repeatedly ask for help, and graciously accept offers of help. This is what people in other countries do. Small-town Ecuador actually doesn't sound that bad, honestly: you are describing yourself navigating all these places independently. I know many countries where you simply would not be able to do that. You would have to have a service human, not a service animal.

It's almost like bringing a service llama to <LOCATION> and expecting everything to be hunky-dory: no one is going to accommodate your service llama, I guarantee you. In the same way, it seems that no one is going to accommodate your service dog in a small town in <LOCATION>. Period. Once you accept this fact, you can either go about changing the system (call your public officials, the bus/transport ministry, get petitions going, call shops/malls, ask to speak to managers, go on Facebook/Twitter, make noise) or you can try to get around without your service animal. As for the wild dogs, you're going to have to find a way to repel or distract them; that's your best bet.

As for being short-changed or over-charged, maybe try starting with a prayer? Something like ""God bless you and your children, could you please help me pay for this correctly?"" And always end with something, ""May God keep your children safe. I have paid you correctly, right?"" Small-town uneducated people may not feel guilty about taking advantage of you, but they may be God-fearing and moral enough if reminded of it in your small interaction with them.

Sidewalks are also not a guarantee in many countries, yes. Even in countries like <LOCATION>, you are not guaranteed a sidewalk on every single street. This, of course, makes it difficult to travel on new terrain by yourself, so you may have to be reliant on others to go with you the first time.

And that brings me to my final point: in a place like small-town <LOCATION>, you may need to accept the fact that you cannot travel around independently, not without issues at least. So you need to buddy up with sighted persons, repeatedly ask for help, and graciously accept offers of help. This is what people in other countries do. Small-town <LOCATION> actually doesn't sound that bad, honestly: you are describing yourself navigating all these places independently. I know many countries where you simply would not be able to do that. You would have to have a service human, not a service animal.

I really wish you luck!","[{'start': 2951, 'end': 2961, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2670, 'end': 2680, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2389, 'end': 2399, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1435, 'end': 1445, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1215, 'end': 1225, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

If the dev says they're working on it and it's taking longer than expected maybe don't be a whiny bitch about it.

FUnnily enough it's usually the giant devs that are guilty of not listening. It's not always the right way, especially when the developer is literally telling people they're working on it.

341,"I'm so sorry. I wish I could say something that would help, but I don't feel that I can. I hope what I say next doesn't make you feel even more down; if it does, I sincerely apologize.

Firstly, I'm totally blind, so I cannot understand specifically what it feels like to lose your vision, or the hope of having it restored. As I've been blind basically from birth, my brain lacks the information to make sense of the visual input, so it's pretty much an impossibility. I do, however, have a progressive hearing loss, which is something that also comes with my condition. I understand completely the feeling that a vital sense is fading, and that it's eventually going to go away. Sometimes, the not knowing when is almost worse. I could, at some point, get cochlear implants, which would hopefully restore my hearing to a more ""usable"" level, meaning, basically, being able to hear speech more clearly. Sometimes it seems to me that that's all anyone cares about. One of my fears with getting implants is that it will severely ruin, or even destroy, my perception of music. It's one of the  few things that can make me genuinely happy, and the thought of losing it (not to mention everything else involved, like several weeks without sound before switch-on, which is just terrifying) brings me to the point of total despair sometimes. I guess my point in saying all this is that I understand the feeling, and you're not alone in it, for what that's worth.

If some surgery existed that would allow me to restore my hearing (as said, vision isn't an option for me) and would have the same effect? I honestly can't say. I get having difficulty making friends; I think I come across as fairly odd and aloof in person, and I find social interaction exhausting, so I have few good ones. Reduce my chances even further? I think I'd lean toward no, honestly. I don't want to be lonely all my life, if I can help it. I think, if I had a loving relationship, I'd opt not to have the surgery. Losing my hearing is terrifying, but if I had someone by my side who I knew loved and would stick by me, I'd want to do everything I could to make them happy. If, as in your case, my hypothetical SO said she might not be able to find me attractive after it, then my answer would be clear. Of course, I'm not you, and the decision is yours. I guess I'm just sort of rambling at this point. I wish you all the best, and I hope you found something in here helpful. It's not easy what you're going through, and I think you're very strong for facing it. I'm sure you'll make the best decision, either way.",,,,ColonelKepler,,,1564605585,t5_2qpec,t3_ckddn9,t3_ckddn9,3,1573357476,0,0,evmaz2k,Blind,,,,,

346,"Hi, I had a retinal detachment in my right eye in January of this year. I am 15 so it was pretty rare but not unexpected because i have high degree myopia which put me at risk of retinal detachments so it was going to happen eventually. I will probably get one in my left eye too someday.

By the time i had realised what was happening and gotten to the hospital (i was turned away the first time) it was pretty much too late and it was decided it was emergent because my macular had detached has well. I lost 95% of my vision to a point i could only see a tiny bit of light in the upper corner.

I had an operation around 2-3 days later and it was reattached for a week or so my vision was red and i couldn’t see very much at all. Now the red had gone but i can’t see very well out of the centre of my eye, so when i’m doing something like reading i close shut that eye otherwise it’s difficult.

Since you’re on vacation, the best solution for the light sensitivity is to wear a wide brim hat/carry a parasol. If you don’t have tinted glasses you can just wear sunglasses inside and/or a hat. If there’s a shady area, you can take a break in take advantage of it. 

Also, be open with your friends about it. Undoing the whole I’m a burden thinking can take time but the first step is recognizing those thoughts so keep up the good work.

414,"I believe the intention was to make it for the fully impaired. Because of this, I was planning on taking the mouse out of the equation altogether. My initial best idea was to have 9 hotkeys such as qwe, asd, zxc which would each correspond to a 3x3 within the game. From here you would be able to navigate using another set such as the arrow keys, with this both hands could be in use and you could quickly navigate between them. I also planned on using audio ques for each movement and to say what number is in the box so if the row was 134 it would say each number as the box is highlighted.

Another option is to give each square a value like how chess has c3 or d8 but I felt saying d8, 3 would make moving around tedious and would be annoying if you went back over squares each time.

I do like the idea of an auto-correct mechanic that would tell you if doing something wrong, I will look into that more for sure.

When you play is it difficult for you to look around the board quickly to check for something and do you believe it would be more difficult for somebody fully blind (more than the obvious lack of visual).

Another important piece of Sudoku is usually putting ""guesses"" in boxes, often done by writing the number in smaller format usually  in two boxes, doing this on the computer is difficult enough already but while blind do you think having it say ""maybe 2, maybe 8"" if you had set those as guesses?

Rides - not sure where you live but here in LA county, if you are disabled in any way you can apply for ACCESS and drivers will come and get you and take you where you need to go. Doctors appointments, grocery shopping, religious events, picnics...doesn't matter. Very cheap fares (less than a dollar). Check with your city or county or the government to see what is offered.

I'm also trying to learn the accessibility features of my phone, and did things like made my TV fonts larger and easier on my eyes. If we learn what is available to make our lives easier now, later we will know what to ask for when we need help.

I have ROP: I had a situation in my life where I got pushed high up in the CS department at my University, because I'm likable, I guess, until teachers didn't want to help me at all. So I saw a counselor and told her I wasn't sure about doing anything else because I didn't want to run into the same problem, and she told me to take a break from school.

485,"Yeah you’re right get rid of the mouse most blind people don’t use them, but I still think jumping to the top left at any given time is handy.

As far as my challenges playing sudoku I’ll be honest I haven’t played in years, ever since reading newspaper sized font has become too much of a strain. This morning I tried it to get an idea but yes I would have trouble jumping back and forth to check mainly because when your eyes make a leap like that you’re really just jumping to something in your peripheral which I don’t have. So without those initial landmarks it was super hard to see how what I was looking at lined up with what I had just seen. 

So I worked essentially one 3x3 at a time. I have a mouse over magnifier I found I could look at a little more than a 3x3 block like a 5x5 at a time between the magnification and limited peripherals, without my eyes confusing which row or collumn numbers went in.

That also happens to be about the amount I could memorize at a given time.  So I would pick a block look at a neighboring block memorize it go back and tick off those numbers and repeat. I play chess both over the board and online and I find memorizing chess positions to be way easier. 1 there are 17 more squares in sudoku. 2 there are way more blank squares in chess. 3 humans are bad with memorizing numbers.

Similarly, if a potential employer says something to tip me off that fear of my blindness is why I'm not being hired, i have options to pursue justice for outward discrimination.

Games specifically tend to have really big problems with over promising and under delivering. It upsets people no end and fairly often those missing features are never implemented, regardless of how the community reacts. 

I mean if you bought a bath that didn't have taps but said it would and due to that you can't have a bath you should give it a 1 star review. You didn't get what you where told you would get, a maybe promise of getting the taps mailed to you in 3 weeks isn't going to change that review much. 

While they are correct most games who don't say they will be accsessable don't get review bombed for not being accsessable but if you buy a bath without taps that never claimed to have taps and showed you a picture of it with none you aren't going to be as upset when it shows up without them.

508,"This question will have different answers depending on if you are in a place with good transit or not. I've never had a license due to poor vision, and grew up in a suburb (almost no transit whatsoever, and everything is 2-3 miles away so not super walkable)  so I've always relied on friends for rides. I like to think it was never a burden, though I'm sure it may have been at times, but they were (are) my friends, and I was there for them in other ways, where I could help out. It wasn't a ""you help me, I help you"" system, nobody kept track, we were just there for each other, as friends should be. 

If the meet up is a party, maybe get a 6 pack of your friends favorite beer so they can drink some (bonus points if you like it too!). I did this recently when my buddy (who lives 20 min away by car) picked me up to hang out at his house, and dropped me off later that night. He likes cider so I got one we both like, had 3, left the others at his place. If it's a bar, buy your friend a drink as thanks (in my experience they'll probably return the favor anyway :) )

If your friends are nearby, maybe walking to one house and all take a cab to the destination? Benefits everyone since you won't pay for or have to find parking, and you can all split the fare.

I don't have a good public transit system in my city so whenever I am in a city that does have a good system (especially subway or light rail) I will use that as much as possible because I find it enjoyable!

512,"I'll tell you, math/physics were never my best topics in school. I did only good enough to not fail. My best were actually literature and writing. When I entered high school, however, I fell in love with chemistry and decided to get a grasp on it, and to do so I had to get a very good grasp on math, of course.

It definitely doesn't come naturally to me, but slowly and with a lot (really, a lot) of effort put in hours studying, exercising and getting better, I finally got at least minimally good at it. Today those topics don't scare me anymore. I have a great deal of respect for them, but I don't refrain from doing anything because of mathematic complexity anymore.

Regarding my visual impairment, I had a pretty good central vision until about a year ago. My retinal degeneration really caught me by surprise in the middle of my graduation. A lot changed since then, I had to make changes so great I didn't even think they were possible until there was no other way. I stopped being able to use paper and pen. I stopped being able to use regular computers. I went from regular sized font to 300% sized font, all of this in less than six months. 

Today I adapt as needs change, and they change everyday. I currently use my windows notebook in high contrast mode, with brightness, font size and overall size all to the maximum. I'm making the transition between PDF and audiobooks as it's increasingly harder to keep reading for more than a few minutes at a time. This has been the hardest transition by far, but I'm finding my way through.

596,"In my experience,  I have found that people who know braille set themselves up for greater success in life.  Using braille at an early age allows for significantly higher exposure to important aspects in literacy and grammar. If a child cannot read enlarged print for an extended period of time,  that child needs braille.

I used to be a very good runner. It wasn't uncommon for me to win my age group or whole races.  Then life happened,  I gained weight,  and I'm not as fast.  I'm also training for totally different races now.  Instead of training for a 5k, I now train for 13+ hour endurance events.  Even if I was still my fastest,  a 5k pace isn't what you want for a real long race.  Still.... when I'm out training and my feet are barely moving,  and I look down at my watch and see that I'm not even doing 10 minute miles when I used to be able to bust out 6 minute miles like it was my job,  I feel fat, slow, and inadequate.  I feel totally embarrassed for anyone witnessing the mess that is my shuffling down the street.  I can get into a really negative frame of mind.
I have to remind myself though that we all have different goals.  5k champion me would never be able to do the races I'm doing now.  It's not fair to compare the two because they aren't the same.  Just the same that an accomplishment for you might not be an accomplishment for someone else.

For mobile devices, I would recommend an iPhone.

VoiceOver on the iPhone and the desktop are fairly similar so that will get him used to that support. If he wants to communicate in real time over distance, he'll need to learn that. 

Anecdotally, once I gave my best friend (who was blind) my Samsung, and he was totally disgusted. He was in his late 20s, so providing an Android to your kid will likely be a point of bullying down the road. With all the frustrations I have with my best friend as an Autistic 40+ year old, bullying is the last thing I'd want to deal with. 

On the other hand, I recommend a Windows laptop for day to day tasks. Knowing how to use the built in Narrator (Microsoft's answer to VoiceOver) may get him a job there down the road (��), but both NVDA &amp; JAWS are used on Windows machines.

If you don't make a big deal out of being blind and show that you are independent and don't let it hinder you, they'll see you as strong and independent and therefore will think more highly of you in terms of attraction and what not than if you don't do those things. If you generally enjoy life, blind or not people will feel more intrigued by you as a person than if your a boring person who doesn't do anything but play on the computer, for example. Goes for anyone.
Also, in my experience at least, the blind thing, if you don't let it hinder you, actually makes people more interested in you and how you live your life. I mean personally I'm a bit more extroverted and don't mind talking about all that stuff maybe that's why. Confidence is a big thing here.

718,"I haven't played FATE Core or FATE accelerated, but I have played the Dresden Files RPG which is based on FATE Core. Just to give people a basic rundown ...

With a game like Dungeons and Dragons (and Pathfinder, which branched off of Dungeons and Dragons), you define your character by primarily choosing a character class. You can be a Fighter or a Wizard or a Thief, etc. Choosing your class gives you a set of pre-packaged abilities. You can customize and refine some things from there to still make the character your own. With Pathfinder, there's a lot of number crunching. Some people like that sort of gaming system, and some people don't.

With GURPS (Generic Universal Roleplaying System), everything is skill based. Instead of defining your character by picking a class, you have a number of points which you use to buy individual skills or advantages. It's a more free-form style of play, but there's still a lot of number crunching. Again, some people like that sort of thing and some people don't.

FATE is more based on narrative. You get a small number of points to assign to a short list of broadly-defined skills. For contrast, in GURPS, you might spend skill points on medicine or physics or history. In FATE, you spend skill points on Scholarship. The skills are intentionally broad for the sake of a less crunchy game.

In addition to choosing skills, you define a few phases and aspects, which inform your character's backstory. In the Dresden Files version, I think you define five phases and aspects. In FATE Core, I think it might be three.

For example one of the phases in the Dresden Files RPG is ""Background: Where did you come from?""

That phase for Harry Dresden, the title character is:

I grew up the son of a stage magician (Malcolm). My mother (Maggie) died in birth. I spent much time on the road with dad, then dad died (heart attack). I was adopted by Justin DuMorne, a wizard, to be trained in the arts of magic.

The aspect for that phase is ""My Mother's Silver Pentacle"".

In the novels, the silver pentacle has some minor magical abilities. It also serves as a focus item for some of his spells. And it leads to one other revelation which I won't say, because it's a major spoiler for anyone who might want to explore the novels. But the in-game mechanic is that aspects can be used to add bonuses to your rolls.

It's not a hard, well-defined mechanic, but it's not supposed to be. FATE is designed to looser mechanics to be more about how the characters interact with the story than about rolling the dice and crunching the numbers. Those aspects are still part of the game, but not with the same level or granularity as with the other games that have been mentioned.

There are more ways in which the game encourages narrative, but my purpose here wasn't to detail the full system. Just to give a small example.

And again, some people like that type of game, and some don't.

778,"I find every O&amp;M instructor is a bit different, but there are some general commonalities. The first session is often an assessment session, to see what we are working with. The questions can vary greatly, but they usually focus on your current skills, what issues you have and what your goals are. 

I personally usually follow up with some additional health questions (some vision related, some not). This may help me suggest some other things as well (certain types of sunglasses or hats to cut down on the glare, certain monoculars or other tools for seeing further away). It may also bring up related services (a client who takes a lot of medications has been mixing them up, so I may refer to a coworker regarding organization). It may also give me something else to keep an eye on (for example, someone with severe diabetes who mentions they have numb feet may have diabetic neuropathy, which may cause balance issues and other serious health issues).

If you have any questions, bring it up. I've heard all sorts of questions, so not much really surprises me anymore. Even questions that may seem silly, because there may be a solution that you didn't know about. Many times, my clients ask me ""how does someone know when the light is green when they can't see the traffic light?"", and I explain the methods we teach how to identify the traffic flow (listening for the surge, APS, etc). 

In terms of preparation, you may want to get your sunglasses and be ready to go outside.

The gist of it is you touch your pointer finger to your thumb and use your opposite hand pointer finger to press the muscle in between the fingers you are touching together. For Rare, the muscle will be very soft, touching pointer finger to thumb. For medium rare, touch your thumb to your middle finger and press the muscle. For medium, touch your thumb to your ring finger. You will notice this muscle getting tighter and it’s the same process the meat is undergoing in the pan. You can use this for beef, fish, and chicken.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah 3hrs/day is a bit rough, and if he can't do his homework on the bus, that's gonna put a real damper on his home life. I remember that when I was in middle school. I was in VI only classes K-5, and ended up repeating 5th grade and did a half and half year where I was mainstreamed out for part and in VI classes for part, then mainstreamed full term 6-12. It did me a world of good to be mainstreamed out, but it was hard at times. I mean it really sucked, because I didn't really know enough at that time to get things in audio formats and not to try to do everything visually, so I was on homework like 4 or so hours every night. You put dinner in the middle of that and I was exhausted by the time I was finished.

&amp;#x200B;

That would be one area that I would be trying to balance for him. making sure homework time isn't over the bounds of what it ought to be. Yes, it is going to take him longer to do things, at least at first. It does to all of us. Sometimes we find ways of even doing things faster, but not always. But, balance is key for feeling like an actual person instead of someone who essentially works all the time. 8hrs of school + 4hrs of homework + any household chores, that's over a full day's work and that's rough for a kid. It was for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that came out a bit too preachy, I just remember that time in my life sucking a lot because I had no me time through the week. My dad did go to bat for me and tell them look, this is ridiculous, my son's hitting the books from the time he comes home to the time he goes to bed, and that worked some things out.

855,"Braille is going out, that's why tech is so important right now. Not to diminish Braille in any way though, it still is important, and I claim that you are illiterate if you are blind and do not know Braille. My argument is that listening to something is generally a passive process, while reading is active. Braille helps you to learn spelling and grammar, which your son will need later in life. Speech is great, but homophones are an issue and when you don't know because it isn't telling you, you might tend to develop some very bad spelling habits that will be hard to unlearn. I've seen it from other blind people.

&amp;#x200B;

For tech, I guess it would depend. I don't know what an RBD is, but iPhone and iPad wouldn't go amiss. iOS versus Android is very subjective though. I can use either one. I have fun with android because I can hack it, customize it to the Nth degree and so forth, but I like the iOS experience for just getting things done. It's always going to work the same, and once you get used to it, the user experience tends to transfer across most apps.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can, maybe go for the iPad pro because it has the keyboard and so forth, but you can use any bluetooth keyboard though, and maybe you could rig up a stand. I know for me, I'd want one if I was trying to do homework on the thing. I prefer PC over mobile for things like that, but mobile is of course, a good backup.

&amp;#x200B;

As for learning them, I never really had trouble. I didn't have a phone for nearly 8 years because I couldn't afford one. The last phone I had was a slide phone and was just on the cusp of what you might call a smart phone. I went from that to an iPhone 7 without issue. It took me like 15 minutes to get the fundamentals. Then my proficiency just rose from there with my use of it. Before that, I had a few tablets and an iPod touch 4th gen.

I'm convinced that any impediment that might exist to someone learning technology is psychological unless they have a learning disability. What you need is a desire to explore the thing, but they lack that, not because they don't want to, but because they're scared of breaking it. I've seen this over and over with family and some other people I've helped with various tech related things. It's that fear that holds them back. But the fear is groundless because just turn on the automatic backup, then if you do somehow manage to mess it up, restore from that. It's very unlikely that'll even happen though. For PCs, people should back up their data anyway, the OS can easily be reinstalled, but that's an extreme measure and will not need to be taken in most cases.",,,,bscross32,,,1563638913,t5_2qpec,t3_cfn90t,t3_cfn90t,2,1572474741,0,0,eub3o0y,Blind,,,,"Braille is going out, that's why tech is so important right now. Not to diminish Braille in any way though, it still is important, and I claim that you are illiterate if you are blind and do not know Braille. My argument is that listening to something is generally a passive process, while reading is active. Braille helps you to learn spelling and grammar, which your son will need later in life. <PERSON> is great, but homophones are an issue and when you don't know because it isn't telling you, you might tend to develop some very bad spelling habits that will be hard to unlearn. I've seen it from other blind people.

For tech, I guess it would depend. I don't know what an RBD is, but iPhone and iPad wouldn't go amiss. iOS versus Android is very subjective though. I can use either one. I have fun with android because I can hack it, customize it to the Nth degree and so forth, but I like the iOS experience for just getting things done. It's always going to work the same, and once you get used to it, the user experience tends to transfer across most apps.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can, maybe go for the iPad pro because it has the keyboard and so forth, but you can use any bluetooth keyboard though, and maybe you could rig up a stand. I know for me, I'd want one if I was trying to do homework on the thing. I prefer PC over mobile for things like that, but mobile is of course, a good backup.

As for learning them, I never really had trouble. I didn't have a phone for nearly 8 years because I couldn't afford one. The last phone I had was a slide phone and was just on the cusp of what you might call a smart phone. I went from that to an iPhone 7 without issue. It took me like 15 minutes to get the fundamentals. Then my proficiency just rose from there with my use of it. Before that, I had a few tablets and an iPod touch 4th gen.

894,"I'm not sure what you mean exactly. When you need to interact is generally pretty logical, it's for something that contains other elements. So you'll want to interact when you see a table, a tool bar, a scroll area, web content or a group. There's also a small sound effect whenever you focus something that can be interacted with. Press VO+H and go through the sounds help menu and you'll find it. Whenever you hear that sound, you'll know you might want to interact with an item.

Lastly, in the navigation section of VoiceOver utility you have an option called grouping behavior that lets you turn off interacting for a lot of controls, with some exceptions like tables. The default option is standard, which requires interaction, but you can change it to one of the other options. That being said I'd personally get used to the concept as it actually speeds up navigation in the system quite a bit.

896,"In my opinion, the iPhone gives the best accessibility experience for someone who is fully blind with the VoiceOver feature, though I can see how the experience may be daunting to someone who hasn't used a phone in this way before. iOS also has some additional features in the accessibility settings under touch occomodations that may be helpful in making the phone work better with any motor issues. For voice commands, siri can be used to call, text, play music and quickly launch apps, and with iOS 13 which will come out in a few months Apple added a feature that lets you fully control the phone with just voice commands. If your aunt manages to get through the initial learning curve, having a smartphone when you're blind is even more helpful than for an average person, because there are apps like seeing AI that let you do things like take a picture of an object or a piece of paper and have the phone explain what it looks like/read it out. 

If using a smartphone turns out to be too hard, I know there are phones out there with traditional keypads that include text to speech for reading out menus that offer the basic phone features.

For voice commands, siri can be used to call, text, play music and quickly launch apps, and with iOS 13 which will come out in a few months Apple added a feature that lets you fully control the phone with just voice commands. If your aunt manages to get through the initial learning curve, having a smartphone when you're blind is even more helpful than for an average person, because there are apps like seeing AI that let you do things like take a picture of an object or a piece of paper and have the phone explain what it looks like/read it out. 

If using a smartphone turns out to be too hard, I know there are phones out there with traditional keypads that include text to speech for reading out menus that offer the basic phone features.

The spotify app has its own volume control which is independent of the rest of your system, you can adjust it by pressing CTRL+Down to decrease or CTRL+Up to increase it.

The other thing you can do is use the audio ducking feature of JAWS, which works like the audio ducking feature on iPhone or Android so it'll lower the volume of all other sounds while JAWS speaks.

938,"My opinion is that it is too hard to police websites for accessibility when they're being designed, especially for smaller businesses. But if a website is so inaccessible that a disabled person who would like to use it cannot do so, they should be able to appeal to the court to demand that the website be accessible.

Your suggestion that external companies like blindness organisations implement accessibility hasn't turned out to be very successful in the past. While web accessibility companies can provide audits of what needs work, it should be up to the company to make the necessary changes, because the business will have to ensure that future websites are accessible. Contracting a third-party company to do this work is expensive, and doing it in-house results in an accessibility mindset often being integrated into other aspects of the company.

I may have misunderstood your point about visual attractiveness—I thought you were saying that accessibility got in the way of web designers which you likened to artists. There are lots of accessible websites that look great. For example, just about all airlines are required to have accessible websites; check them out if you like so you can see that accessibility doesn't have to alter the website too much.

The only websites that I believe should be accessible from the moment they're launched (to WCAG level AA) are government websites, supermarkets with most of the national marketshare, tertiary education providers and companies that provide services for disabled people (like movie theatres with audio description or closed captions), plus of course the websites of services primarily or exclusively for disabled people.
So in short, my stance is that no company should be barred from having a website if it's inaccessible unless they're a fairly large business that a court has decreed that they should. i think that WCAG level A conformance is fine for some websites, but level AA for most of them.",,,,CloudyBeep,,,1564256543,t5_2qpec,t3_ci5enj,t1_ev5bp6l,2,1573085817,0,0,ev78ehi,Blind,,,,,

959,"Absolutely not—this is not what I believe at all.

I do not think that it is ever fair to take small businesses to court over their inaccessible website. For example, I go to a restaurant near my home whose website is not accessible, resulting in me not being able to read the menu. I would never take this restaurant to court because making their website accessible would only help a very small number of customers, maybe even only me. That kind of behaviour would be extremely entitled and would detract from the positive reasons to make one's website accessible. This is why I am completely opposed to the enormous number of ADA web accessibility lawsuits in the US, where small law firms which claim to be representing blind customers (who do not actually exist) threaten small businesses with lawsuits to make their websites WCAG-compliant.

However, I do think that it is fair to request accessibility for larger businesses, especially offering services that would be of interest to a large number of people. For example, a large supermarket chain in my country had an inaccessible website, but a few years ago, a blind customer took this company to court because she could not order groceries online. This is something that blind people should be able to do, because the in-store supermarket experience is quite difficult. After the court case where the supermarket was required to ensure that its website was WCAG-compliant, not only did it ensure that the website was a joy to use with assistive technology, but its main competitor, a similarly-large supermarket chain, also added accessibility to its website. Now, blind people have the freedom to choose which supermarket chain they would like to order groceries from.

Retrofitting websites to be accessible often does not cost a lot, and it doesn't cost any extra to implement accessibility on a new website. Contrary to a claim you made in an earlier comment, accessible websites can still be visually attractive (they just have different code that makes them compatible with assistive technology), and accessibility also helps with search engine optimisation.

2. Why are you rocking?
I’ve met people that feel comfort when rocking, and others that rock because they feel boredom and they want to be active.
Once you find out, pay attention to your body and when it starts rocking, stand against a wall. I have a friend who does this, because if he is waiting for someone in the middle of the hall he starts rocking back and forth. He informs me that having his back against the wall helps him steady himself. It took him a while to independently realize that he was rocking, but his family and friends helped him by tapping him on the shoulder to signal “Hey, you are rocking.” (They did not say anything, as they agreed that the shoulder tapping would be a discrete signal.)",,,,BlueRock956,,,1561941799,t5_2qpec,t3_c2kr1p,t3_c2kr1p,2,1571173438,0,0,esg31lx,Blind,,,,,

I have seen way too many people with RP that stop themselves from using the cane, because they can still see a bit. It kind of sucks, but the professionals are often pulling back and not explaining that if you have RP you could lose all of your vision sooner or later. As a result, I have met quite a few people with RP that went through training, that don't feel comfortable using the cane because they have less vision than what they had when they trained. My recommendation is to train under blind folds and use the cane to the best of it's advantages.

1043,"Thanks a ton for this information!  And your support as well, these last few days I've been just trying to mentally prepare myself.  It's like I keep trying to pretend i have the impaired vision to see what it would look like and try to already compensate.  I keep having to remind myself don't do that, you can still see so just take advantage of it as best as you can, stick to the diet regime of spinach/salads, exercise, and the AREDS 2 supplement and wait it out.  May be a long way, may be short, may be never, but I need to just not focus on all that stuff and just handle it as it comes and adapt as possible.

Absolutely appreciate all the extra information and thoughts to consider and more prepared questions to ask as well.  I'm getting a 2nd opinion today from a regular optomitrist with a full dialation this time and that place also has macular degeneration specialists they can send me to if it's confirmed.  I live in a small town away from the big city as for my work I just need to be by an airport to fly out to clients so I've taken advantage of that for a long time now.  

And thanks for the extra info sites to keep on top of research, that is super helpful, is there a list of medical doctors in the country that are leaders in the field?  I'd be open to travel to visit a specialist if helped possibly give me an edge with trying to slow this down or like you say be treated by someone on the cusp of the latest and greatest research and studies.  

Heck I wouldn't mind being part of a study for those of us well younger than the 60+ area it seems to start in for most.  

Like others in this thread, I also work in IT so I've spent my whole career looking at computer screens, always around a laptop at home or iPad or 4k TV etc.  So I haven't noticed anything amiss while working with those that I would bring front and center as a 'that's a sign' type of thing, but here's to hoping I can hopefully slow it down if I am confirmed with it to prolong my vision as much as possible to enjoy my family with.

It's very comforting to read how your life has been and how you have been able to live it and enjoy it and how you managed to get thru the really hard times.  My lady I've kept up on the situation as well, although at the moment she is going to undergo a big surgery so her mind has been a little taken by that; but she has been there to tell me she will support me if the worst comes in the future which is at least something. 

Also my 2 daughters will hopefully be old enough to help at the time if I do start to struggle.  The biggest hurdle has been the mind game and the whole self thought things and I've definitely caught myself bringing myself down with just worrying about the future.  

Moments of clarity in the grand scheme I do get those thoughts of what will happen will happen and just take it a day, week, month, year at a time.  Don't waste my time thinking tomorrow everything will be over.  It's just a little challenging now as my kinds are still young, oldest is 8, youngest is 19 months so ideally I would like to see them till the youngest is about 18 or older to know they get past the first hurdles in life.  But nothing is guaranteed, and I need to accept that and just live in the now and handle what comes as it comes. 

And luckily not a surgeon, work in IT so I do hope over the next years coming up that progress is made on addressing both types of AMD as best as possible.

This would be for people that work online or are online all the time and may need to notify someone of an emergency without alerting a possible attacker (think home intruder) or can be used at the workplace or in a school or by people that can't get to a phone.

It is not a replacement for 911 or a phone and is just another alert system that can get people help if they need it.

Email is not the best alert system but it is fast and many people stay in contact all the time by email and always have their email on so this would be a way to get help from friends, family, neighbors and possibly your local hospital emergency room or police or fire department.

&amp;#x200B;

I notice sighted people don't engage with the blind because they are not sure if the person would be disturbed or startled by the interaction and are not quite sure how to address the person because sighted people use eye contact and gestures a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I was driving around town for work and noticed a young man with his cane walking out in the street in traffic and he was new to using the cane apparently and got off the side walk.

&amp;#x200B;

There were people on the sidewalk that should have helped him get back on the sidewalk but most just walked by and ignored the situation or stood staring and doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped my truck and got out and directed him back to the sidewalk and had a quick conversation with him where he told me he was recently made blind in an accident and was still learning to use the cane.

1106,"Hi, I'm so glad you're not giving up; that's the first step in doing anything when you're losing a vital part of yourself, but it can be done and I'm so proud of you for not just quitting. I like that you're reaching out for help. Someone briefly mentioned this, but do you have a case open with your local vocational rehabilitation agency? If not, google can help you find them, and they have people there that teach blind and low-vision people how to navigate daily life, such as cooking, labeling, cleaning, etc. For some actual tips: smell is key. A chicken in the oven that smells wonderful while cooking doesn't necessarily mean that it's done if it smells good, but, other than using a timer, you can tell when a dish is getting done because the smell is very strong with flavor at first, but when it's closer to done, it smells just a little bit milder and not so in your face. I know that's kind of a weird tip, and you always want to double check meat and stuff like that with a talking thermometer like someone else said, which can be purchased by your local VR services agency. Also, if you're frying or baking something that sizzles, like burgers or chicken, etc., another way to tell it's getting close to done is that at first, the sizzling is loud and proud, with popping and crackling sounds, but then it'll calm down and get quieter whenever it's almost ready. I do this a ton with burgers, fries, chicken, bbq, and other sizzly things.
Another suggestion: organization is essential, and having a place for everything is vital so you don't have to scrounge around for stuff. Measuring tips: keep oils and other liquids in the fridge, so you can touch the edge of the cup with a clean finger and more easily feel when it's almost full and you can then slow the pouring. Also, you can put a cookie sheet with foil on it under your workspace and measure over the cookie sheet, that way all you have to do is maybe rinse the sheet and just 86 the foil. With smaller measurements, like baking soda, salt, etc., instead of pouring the liquid or powder into the spoon, which is very, very hard even for me as a life-long totally blind woman, just pour a fair amount into a short and somewhat narrow container, but not too narrow, because you want to be able to get your hand inside with the spoon, dip some out, and if it's liquid, you can touch gently the very edge of one of the sides of the spoon to check for fullness. Also, I only use metal measuring spoons, that way I can bend the handle 90 degrees, so that way I can just dip the spoon straight down into whatever liquid I have poured into my temporary holding container that I mentioned pouring things into for easier measuring, and then pull straight up and try to keep your spoon handle as vertical as you can, so as not to lose any before you get it over the bowl. Also, you can measure liquids over a clean sink so if you do spill some, you're good there. Let's see, more tips? Patterning is so important when cleaning stoves, counters or tables, to make sure you don't miss something. Of course, after you clear the area of any items no longer needed, get a dry cloth or paper towel and start from the back of the surface area, gently brushing the surface with the cloth, and your other hand at the front edge of the surface, ready to catch crumbs or excess flour, powder, or a missed piece of chopped veggie for instance, and do this from one edge of your surface to the other, in a back to front motion. Then, when there are no more larger particles there, with your usual cleaning rag/sponge  and cleaning product of choice, start at the back of the area and go slowly from side to side from edge to edge horizontally, not picking up your rag/cloth, then scooting down a couple inches toward you and going from one side to the other; do that until you reach the edge of the surface. If you choose to, you can pick up and fold your cloth or flip it over and use the other side halfway through, or you can do the whole surface and flip it over and do it a second time, which is what I sometimes do. This is sort of the same thing I do when vacuuming. For bigger areas, mentally section off the surface into quarters or 3rds or whatever you want, and do the same pattern with each section. I have tons more, and when I think of them I’ll come back here and post another comment or 5. lol Hope that helps.

That said, generally Apple products are widely considered to be more accessible than Microsoft or Android. Unfortunately MS and Android products are typically used at work and educational environments because they are cheaper up front. 

I’d figure out which one the school uses, get similar equipment at home, then just start digging in to YouTube videos on accessibility on that system. Hadley Institute for the Blind has great videos as well as The Blind Life and Live Accessible. Good luck, check back in if you have issues.

Right now, the issue needing understanding and rights  (at least one of them) is LBGT issue.  


Disability was an issue decades ago.  We've had laws on the books for discrimination, hiring, housing, etc, for a long time.  There are places on forms to indicated if you're disabled.  Hotels have rooms for those with disabilities, etc.

So this issue is not new.  


And while disability issues absolutely come up for individuals, there are laws and ways to seek justice, remediation, and help.

1229,"Hi /u/leakyBuffer, you have joined a very elite club with lots of friendly people. :-)  And we get it.

&amp;#x200B;

First, yes, absolutely get to a specialist.  And by specialist, I mean someone specializing in degenerative and genetic eye diseases, preferably associated with a teaching hospital and with cutting edge research.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why.  A LOT of retinal specialists have zero experience with the rarer diseases or odd presentations of  diseases... and they are incorrect with their information.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I went to a retinal specialist (best in the city) and after a long exam,  they couldn't really say if I had Retinitis Pigmentosa or not, but if I did I'd never go  blind, because I was older (in my 30's).  

&amp;#x200B;

Then I went to an RP specialist in another city, someone who in a leader in genetic research.  In 2 seconds, he looked at my eyes, verified it was RP, and of course, gave me the correct information. RP is a degenerative disease.  It gets worse.  I've been legally blind for 5 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

It's quite unusual to be diagnosed with MD... with no real symptoms of it.  Also, the test you took... if it was the perimeter machine with the lights that flash, and you click every time you see a light  (Visual field test), they are typically calibrated to check only the center 30 degrees of vision.   

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you have a deficiency, all they checked was the center (macular), and a  bit of peripheral, which is great if all you're looking for is MD.  ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Make sure to ask your second opinion specialist for the Goldmann perimeter, which measures 160 degrees horizontally and 120 degrees vertically.  (Or, ask for a Humphery Field Analyzer that's capable of measuring the full field like this.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, you're just in the process of gathering data and seeing if the doctor you went to was accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

If it turns out you do have MD, ask the MD specialist for information about the specific presentation you have, as well as insight into the most promising research being conducted right now for MD.  

&amp;#x200B;

MD is one of the most researched diseases on the planet.  There is good scientific reason to be confident of medical solutions appearing over the next 10 years.  It's pretty easy to stay abreast of the current trials and research on the internet,  if you happen to be a research junkie. :-D

I've worked on reasonably sized projects before, although to be fair most of these were my own self-created projects and none of them have been going for 10 years. Over the time I've used a screen reader, I've constantly upped the speech rate until its blazingly fast. Because I did this over a long while, I can still understand it, so this makes reading code much more efficient. I can't stand using a braille display when reading code (computer braille is too verbose and contracted is strange because brackets and other punctuation are one symbol in my brain, but sometimes multiple on the display, yet the arrow keys treat them as one symbol). I often read complex lines of code letter by letter, at a fast pace of course, so if I get confused or my brain falls behind I can just backtrack a few characters and move forward again.

In terms of editing, on windows VS code is unbeaten in its accessibility and general usefulness, with most of its features being accessible via the NVDA screen reader.

What this means for the user is better integration. All of the native apps on the mac are accessible, and crashes/freezes caused by the screen reader are far less frequent.

I find navigating GUIs much more intuitive as well. With Jaws, we typically have to iterate through all of the elements of a desktop app according to their tab order until we find the one we want, unless it's available either as part of a menu or includes a keyboard shortcut. With voiceover, things are presented according to a hierarchical tree structure, allowing us to quickly skip over entire logical groups of elements. To illustrate, let's imagine a fictional music player app with the following features:

1. A group of controls featuring play, stop, pause, rewind and fast forward;
2. Another group including previous, next, repeat and shuffle;
3. Another group including song title, artist, genre, playtime and remaining time of current track;
4. A playlist widget which contains a list of queued tracks, add and remove buttons and buttons to move the selected track up and down the list.

&amp;#x200B;

That's nineteen different UI items across four different collections.

If this were on windows (and assuming there weren't keyboard shortcuts or menu items to interact with each and everyone of these controls), to access say the track name field I might very well have to tab (or shift tab) through up to ten of these items to find the one I want.

If this were on the mac, given that these items are grouped together, I could simply press control option right arrow (VO+Right) to skip over entire groups until I reach the group I want, followed by VO+Down to enter that group, followed by VO+Right to navigate through the controls in the group until I reach the one I need to activate with VO+Space.

When you know a website or app well this becomes noticeably more efficient. I especially love when webpage ads are nicely locked away in a little frame and Voiceover lets me just jump cleanly over them.

You will also find that Voiceover is available almost 100 percent of the time. Even during system updates you can turn it on and find out what's going on. Even if an unlikely scenario occurs wherein you must reinstall the entire OS, Voiceover is available to guide you through the entire process.

In summary, I bought the mac because I was studying software development in college and needed it to make my skillset more well rounded. I thought I would only use Mac OS for mac programming. Since I started using it however I have felt as though I would never go back if given a choice.

1257,"Totally blind screen reader user here.

I do a lot of accessibility testing for my community college.

What a lot of web designers don't realize is that screen readers don't give a hoot in what order your elements appear on screen. You can use CSS to float them this way and that, it doesn't matter. They care about the order they appear in the document object model (the source code). That causes problems when web developers do dynamic element creation and just push a new element into the tree at the bottom. It might visually appear in the intended spot (as a popup menu or whatever) but to us it appears as if it were located at the very bottom of the page.

If you are going to have your page spawn new HTML elements in response to user interaction, make sure you place them somewhere in the DOM that is relevant to what they do. Don't just call $(""document"").append() or whatever because that creates a poor user experience.",,,,rpglb_caturria,,,1562175184,t5_2qpec,t3_c8pxma,t3_c8pxma,7,1571326668,0,0,esow9fa,Blind,,,,,

If you are a blind person who is not hearing impared, then you can hear the words spoken to you. If you can hear the words spoken to you, then there is almost never a need to know sign language. A blind person will likely have trouble seeing the sign language gestures. If a person is both visually and hearing impaired, various adaptations can be made to make it easier to see the signs. For example, a person can use tactile sign language and feel the sign language gestures or they could sign more slowly or use smaller body movements to make the signs easier to follow.

1310,"I have gone through a very deep and dark valley myself during the past three years. After having been born legally blind, my vision slowly decreased over the course of my youth. For a very long time I was able to fake it, pretend I'm sighted. People nowadays tell me it was crazy I even did that. I was so good at it though, you would have never guessed that I'm legally blind just from looking at me on the street. Whenever I accidentally bumped into something, people thought I was a clumsy person and laughed about it.

Then, at age 27, my vision suddenly began to decrease drastically. Within just three years I've now gone to practically complete blindness on both eyes. Believe me when I say I've thought about suicide more than once. And the scary thing, I also used to have the determination for it. The only reasons I didn't do it are that guns aren't available in my country and that I was scared any other method of committing suicide might induce horrible pain and suffering. So, that's why I'm still here. I'm not one of those rainbows-and-unicorns people in this subreddit who go around claiming blindness is peanuts and they're living perfect lives. I'm a realist. And as such, I can tell you that yes, your life will probably become significantly more difficult in some ways. However, and I really mean this too, it can and will still be worth living.

As an analogy, try to think of elderly people. Many of them suffer in various ways. They've got arthritis, heart problems, bad skin, bad hearing, they get tired more easily, they can't sleep well anymore, bad digestion and a thousand other problems. Yet, you will always see two kinds of elderly people: the happy ones and the bitter ones. Are the happy ones simply lucky? Nope. My late grandma had like 14 quadrillion health issues. Already at age 60 her body was pretty much crap and she further destroyed by not taking good care of it. Amazingly, she still made it to the ripe age of 84 and *the* major reason for her success in overcoming her physical ailments was her attitude. You see, my grandma was the most cheerful, sweet, outgoing and loving person I've ever met. Contrary to most old people she always had a lot of friends, even right before she died and couldn't live the house anymore. I'm sure she often struggled but whenever I saw her, she was genuinely in a good mood. Rather than fighting her health problems and being bitter about them, she sought acceptance in herself and found a positive attitude to deal with them.

Now, to come back to blindness, the same method can be applied here. Going blind is not something we can change or affect. It's happening and that's it. It's natural to fall into depression over this because it makes you feel like you're not in control of your own life anymore. However, there is something you can do to re-gain this control. Change your attitude. Find acceptance. And most importantly: always look on the bright side of life. Doing this won't be easy. In fact, there will be many moments when you want to give up. I know this because I've already been going through it for 3 years and technically for my entire life. You will swear and you will cry and you will scream ""why can I not just fucking die already?"". But with every moment of frustration that you manage to overcome, your overall situation will also become better. There will be a period of time where you feel utter desperation and it's important to embrace this desperation once it hits you. Don't try to run away, just accept it. Maybe take some months off from work if you can (you now have time to prepare for that), look after yourself, be angry, be sad, don't give a shit about anyone or anything else. Don't feel guilty for going through this process. However, at some point in time, you will feel a twitch inside of you. You will feel that you're ready to get out of bed again, open the curtains and give life another chance. And when you feel this, *go for it*. I've just recently come to this point. After 3 years of complete darkness and desperation, I suddenly feel a quantum of new passion. It's only a spark but maybe in another few years it will be a fire again.

Many things will get lost along the way and some of them forever, but there are also ways to adapt if you are willing to. I'll give you a concrete example: one of my favorite pastimes used to be cycling. I live in a mid-sized, bicycle friendly European city, so my bike and I were total BFFs. I did literally everything by bike, shopping, going to the train station, going to the movies, meeting friends etc. Nowadays I walk around with a white cane and cycling is definitely not an option anymore. Luckily we have outstanding public transportation but still... it took me a long time to get over this. I still have my bike and sometimes I walk past it and think of the good old days. Then, a few weeks ago, I came on this crazy idea. I've always wanted to do a big bicycle journey across Europe,several thousand miles. For a long time I assumed this would simply not be an option anymore, until I came on the idea of the tandem bike. I thought: hey, why not do this together with my wife? It might actually be a wonderful trip and a great way to spend quality time as a couple! Of course I've known about tandems for a long time but there's another problem. As a result of my condition, I need to take eyedrops multiple times a day. These eyedrops *must* be frozen and they must remain frozen under all circumstances. If they accidentally thaw before I'm ready to use them, I have to throw them all in the trash and they're super precious and expensive to make. This seemed like an impossible obstacle until recently. A few days ago, I found an Australian company online that sells portable freezers for camping. The freezers can be powered with gas, so that solves the issue of coming up with electricity sources during cycling. So, if I can now somehow figure out how to buy a good tandem for my wife and myself, as well as a bicycle trailer, then fix that freezer and the gas bottles on that trailer, I'm ready to embark on this long dreamed-of journey. It makes me so happy just to think about that. 

As part of my ""transition"", I'm also trying to focus on the new skills I'm learning rather than the old ones I'm losing. For example I'm now able to confidently walk with a long cane and I'm pretty damn proud of that. It took me about a year to master it but here I am. This is something my wife or my siblings or all the other sighted people out there can't do. Another example would be getting better at working with the computer, though I still have some training to do in this area.

I've also learned that some activities actually become more fun without sight, such as cooking and eating (both of which I love to do). Giving up reading was incredibly tough for me; I've studied literature in university, so I'm a big bookworm. But now that my wife gifted me a cool headset and introduced me to audiobooks and podcasts, I'm loving those. I can ""read"" Tolstoy's *War and Peace* while brushing my teeth or taking my eyedrops. How cool is that?

The thing that I was probably most scared of all was losing the ability to see my wife. I've always been a very visual person, both in terms of sexuality and in terms of aesthetics. Now I've learned it's not as horrible as I thought it was. When I talk to my wife, I can almost always guess with precision what mood she is in by listening to her voice. I've become much better at picking up subtle clues and paying close attention to non-visual details. During sex, touch has become even more important than before and my wife is absolutely loving it lol. I've always been into dirty talk and we didn't use to do a lot of that because my wife is the shy type but now she's gotten much better at it and I'm having a lot of fun with it in a completely non-visual way.

So, in summary, the two most important points are these: give yourself A LOT of time to mourn, accept and adapt. And once you're ready, embrace your new situation by approaching it with a positive spirit. Of course I'm also angry and sad sometimes but on some days I walk into stuff and I also just laugh about myself. This is not my nature, it's the result of having worked for it for a very long time.

Lastly, I want to strongly advise you to seek professional help if you can. I've been visiting a therapist for the past 2.5 years on a biweekly schedule and it's done wonders for me.

1311,"It's interesting that you say ""it's not an us versus them"" because that is exactly what you seem to advocate for. Like I said, I'm fine with the candidates mentioning the LGBT community as well as racial minorities. That's all good. I just wish they could also throw in disabled people too, every now and then. If you're going to name a list of minority groups anyway, why not include the disabled? Now, you seem to argue that the candidates should NOT talk about disabled people, which would in fact constitute an ""us versus them"". It would be disabled people getting told to shut their mouths and sacrifice their happiness so the other groups can get the stage all by themselves. I don't agree with that. I believe the disabled community deserves to be on that stage too. And it's not just about discriminations, it's also about social attitudes in general. I feel like a lot of able-bodied people still hold little empathy for disabled folks. Just remember when Trump made fun of that disabled journalist a few years ago... all the people in his crowd laughed and cheered. Maybe a public debate about the disabled community could raise awareness. You're saying that the candidates are speaking to their voters. That's true and a fair point. And yes, the disabled community hasn't been protesting. But I don't know... maybe it should? Maybe disabled people have been to apathetic?

1314,"I was born with a very rare (1:100,000 people) condition called aniridia. The disorder consists of an entire assemblage of pathologies and involves widespread abnormal development of many structures inside the eye, all of which can impair vision. Aniridia comes in different levels of severity but in my case the overall condition is particularly. Macular degeneration is one of the things that frequently comes along with aniridia and it's also been an issue for me.

I already had low vision when I was born, which is typical for my disorder. When I was a baby, I had about 30/100 vision. Nowadays this frankly sounds like superman vision to me. I can't believe I've ever seen that much. Over the course of my childhood/youth, my vision kept decreasing, which is also a typical development (aniridia is, as of now, incurable). When I was 14, I pretty much lost my left eye as it went completely blind. I don't even see light and shadow anymore there. My right eye went through a period of stagnation, which I was incredibly happy about. All the doctors originally thought I'd be completely blind around age 20. I'm now 30 and within the past three years I have gone through an incredibly tough time of losing pretty much all of the remaining vision. My vision now hovers somewhere around 2/100.

I wanna tell you two things. First of all, I'm very sorry this happens to you. Speaking from an entire lifetime of experience, there's hardly anyone who knows as much about how painful it is to lose your eyesight than I do. However, I strongly advise you to not play strong toward your family. Don't do this Walter White thing where you go around pretending everything's just fine. Your partner and your children have to know about this, even if it will worry them. Sooner or later it's going to happen anyway. You already have enough to carry on your own, don't worry so much about how everyone else will deal with this. What's most important is that you're not going to break as a result of this and for that you need people you can trust and talk to. I'm married and my wife knows about everything regarding my eyes. It would never work otherwise. Sometimes I feel like total crap and I need her to comfort me. She's been a my rock throughout the past years and I could have never made it without her. Moreover, it's important to tell your family about this so they can understand your situation. For example at one point you will need adjustments in your daily life and you will want people to know why these adjustments are necessary.

The other thing I wanted to tell you is a message of hope. Unless you are surgeon, which would indeed be very unfortunate, there's almost no job/career that you will have to give up. Blind and visually impaired folks work in many different careers. Thanks to modern technology, there are a ton of accessibility-related adjustments that can be made and new skills you can learn. Also, I can tell you that while losing vision is unspeakably tough, there's also a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm saying this as I'm slowly starting my overall psychological situation to go up again after 3 years of total darkness. I'm still a far way from being content and happy in life but I can feel that one day I will be. Losing your vision drastically changes your life but your life will still be worth living. I still cook, I still travel, I still write and read... and I'm currently thinking about new hobbies that I could take up... maybe pottery would be cool to try out.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1563291683,t5_2qpec,t3_cdp9bc,t3_cdp9bc,2,1572160383,0,0,etx5235,Blind,,,,"I was born with a very rare (1:100,000 people) condition called aniridia.

I already had low vision when I was born, which is typical for my disorder. When I was a baby, I had about 30/100 vision. Nowadays this frankly sounds like superman vision to me. I can't believe I've ever seen that much. Over the course of my childhood/youth, my vision kept decreasing, which is also a typical development (aniridia is, as of now, incurable). When I was 14, I pretty much lost my left eye as it went completely blind. I don't even see light and shadow anymore there. My right eye went through a period of stagnation, which I was incredibly happy about. All the doctors originally thought I'd be completely blind around age 20. I'm now 30 and within the past three years I have gone through an incredibly tough time of losing pretty much all of the remaining vision. My vision now hovers somewhere around 2/100.

I wanna tell you two things. First of all, I'm very sorry this happens to you. Speaking from an entire lifetime of experience, there's hardly anyone who knows as much about how painful it is to lose your eyesight than I do. However, I strongly advise you to not play strong toward your family. Don't do this <PERSON> thing where you go around pretending everything's just fine. Your partner and your children have to know about this, even if it will worry them. Sooner or later it's going to happen anyway. You already have enough to carry on your own, don't worry so much about how everyone else will deal with this. What's most important is that you're not going to break as a result of this and for that you need people you can trust and talk to. I'm married and my wife knows about everything regarding my eyes. It would never work otherwise. Sometimes I feel like total crap and I need her to comfort me. She's been a my rock throughout the past years and I could have never made it without her. Moreover, it's important to tell your family about this so they can understand your situation. For example at one point you will need adjustments in your daily life and you will want people to know why these adjustments are necessary.

The other thing I wanted to tell you is a message of hope. Unless you are surgeon, which would indeed be very unfortunate, there's almost no job/career that you will have to give up. Blind and visually impaired folks work in many different careers. Thanks to modern technology, there are a ton of accessibility-related adjustments that can be made and new skills you can learn. Also, I can tell you that while losing vision is unspeakably tough, there's also a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm saying this as I'm slowly starting my overall psychological situation to go up again after 3 years of total darkness. I'm still a far way from being content and happy in life but I can feel that one day I will be. Losing your vision drastically changes your life but your life will still be worth living. I still cook, I still travel, I still write and read... and I'm currently thinking about new hobbies that I could take up... maybe pottery would be cool to try out.","[{'start': 1606, 'end': 1614, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I originally wanted to get a PhD in History after my Master is complete but now I'm not so sure anymore. I've literally been an university student for an entire decade. I started in my early 20s, now I'm in my early 30s. There are different reasons why it took me so long but my blindness is obviously a huge factor. I'm currently supposed to work on my MA thesis but I'm struggling with a complete lack of passion or motivation for... anything in life. The past 3 years have been incredibly difficult for me because I went from legally blind to more or less fully blind. 3 years ago I was able to ride my bicycle, now I'm moving around with a white cane. Not only has this development further slowed me down in a practical  sense but it also threw me off track and into a very dark hole. With the help of therapy and my wonderful wife I'm now fighting to get out of that hole again but it's not easy. And once I'll finish up my Masters, I'll probably be 32. I love studying and academia because I'm actually a total nerd but at this age I seriously need to contemplate my life choices. If I go for a PhD, which I'd love to do, my wife and I probably won't be able to have children. It wouldn't be financially feasible. This sucks because I've always wanted to have kids. So it's a very tough decision.

Also, my original dream job was to become a teacher at a public high school. Contrary to the US, this is a very good job here in Switzerland. It's well-respected by society and the pay is excellent. The downside is that it's very popular and so I don't know if I even have a chance as a blind guy. More importantly though, I don't know if teaching at a public school as a blind individual is even possible. I used to have a very optimistic attitude towards this issue but literally everyone has been telling me for the past few years that blind people can't teach except at schools for the blind, so I have gotten rather insecure about this whole plan. If I can't become a teacher, I have absolutely no idea what else I should become. Especially if I can't go into research. There's nothing I have nearly as much passion for.

My exam accommodations were always a bit different. During high school I usually received 10-20 minutes more time. There was no clear rule and it was pretty much up to the individual teachers.

1323,"In my opinion, the most important thing about cooking blind is patience. As I'm losing my vision, I have noticed that cooking itself hasn't become much harder. Of course there are things like measuring or deboning a fish that become very challenging but most actions can also be done blind. What's drastically different in my cooking is that I need far more time for certain tasks. For example chopping veggies nicely takes me forever sometimes. Luckily I have my sighted wife who jumps in and helps me sometimes. If you have someone like that, don't be afraid to ask for assistance. Other than that, take your time and stay patient. The process of cooking can be exhausting but the end result is even more rewarding because of that.

Also, like someone else has already mentioned, practice mise-en-place. This is something helpful not just for blind people but for everyone. Especially when you're cooking a dish that can be a bit stressful, make sure to get everything ready. For example I love to cook risotto for my wife and myself. When I do so, I chop all the onions and garlic, put them in a small bowl, chop other veggies that I want to serve as a side, such as cherry tomatoes, put them in a bowl, measure all the rice, open the wine bottle, get the chicken broth boiling and clean up the work surface.

1325,"I strongly advise you to seek therapy. It is completely normal to struggle with depression when you're losing your vision. I have been visiting a wonderful therapist for the past 2 years and probably will continue to see her for at least one more year. Usually I go there every other week and the therapy has helped me tremendously. I don't know where I'd be today without it. The pain, sadness, frustration and all those other negative feelings haven't become milder but I have learned ways to deal with them. I have also learned to change certain aspects about my social behavior now that I'm nearing blindness. For example standing up for myself has always been extremely difficult for me but now that I have gone blind and I'm far more vulnerable and dependent on other people, I need to train this.

As for the light sensitivity, I probably feel you more on this than anyone else here. I was born with a condition called aniridia, which is characterized by the fact that I lack an iris in both eyes. The iris functions like an aperture in a photograph. Without it, you get blasted with the full amount of light the whole time. The light directly hits the retina because there's nothing to filter some of it out. In other words, I've been living with a constant bombardment of light for my whole entire life. The good news is that at one point you get somewhat used to it. There are still moments where I particularly struggle but on an average day I can handle it without feeling too irritated. I love cloudy and rainy days and I generally try not to go outside too much on very bright summer days. Having a quality pair of sunglasses is also very important, as others have already mentioned. And finally, I recommend a good amount of sleep every night. I struggle a lot with my sleep-wake cycle and it has become worse since I have gone nearly blind. This is why I'm sometimes up at very strange hours and end up sleeping only 2-3 hours in a night to get the rythm back in order again. However, what I have found is that my eyes work much better and with less pain if I make sure to sleep a lot every night. My body would probably be okay with 8 hours but my eyes need about 10-11 to feel really nice. Of course I can't always provide my eyes with so much sleep but when I have the time (weekends, holidays etc), I do. It's not the most adventurous way to spend my time but I can tell that after 2-3 nights of sleeping a lot, my eyes start to feel better and sometimes even my vision seems a tad improved. And that's definitely something worth too.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1562120720,t5_2qpec,t3_c89gwk,t3_c89gwk,3,1571295256,0,0,esn231p,Blind,,,,,

If you think that pretending not to have seen/heard anything is the best route to take, that's fine. Personally, I feel like just laughing about it together is a better solution. Maybe I have this attitude because I'm a guy myself. I recently walked in on my wife sitting on the toilet, which I know she feels incredibly uncomfortable about.
