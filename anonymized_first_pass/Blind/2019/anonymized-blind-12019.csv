0,"My vision loss is due to non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (say that five times fast!). Took years to diagnose right, by the time I had an actual diagnosis, most of my vision was gone--failed steroids after a few months, haven't been treated since due to other issues. The worst part was ruling out paraneoplastic diseases. I'm in a weird spot where I've since developed other autoimmune issues, but no one's really been able to tell me if it's all connected. I've found this to be fairly typical for people with complex immune disorders. At this point I have very little vision but I really have learned to adjust, and I am truly and honestly a happy person. I've adjusted to blindness and can now do just about everything independently. ",,,,annibear,,,1548306680,t5_2qpec,t3_aifpg1,t3_aifpg1,1,1551941488,0,0,eeto44u,Blind,,,,,

Sure thing. Get in touch with Mikko! He might however not be able to answer so much about accessibility for programming, but on audio engineering, since he has been working as a freelance on that field for already 20 years. So he knows about that a lot.

Programming, e.g. coding, I think is pretty accessible nowadays. Game implementation is bit different, since game engines might not be perfect yet.

8,"&gt; The big goal I think is to overcome your disability.

Incorrect. The big goal is to overcome people's perception of my disability. I don't suffer from blindness. I suffer from people's complete and utter inability to exercise common sense the second my blindness looks like it might pose an issue. I've been this way for 30+ years. I think I might know just a wee bit more about being a blind person than you do. Shut up and listen.

More related to the OP, what we have here is a failure to adult. His eyes not working has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he's a crybaby. That just gives him something more to cry about. Were it not that, it'd probably be something else. The fact he's doing that and he's in his 60's tells me no one has ever enlightened this man on precisely why that's inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

That use to install the latest Kodi, along with the screen reader.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, kodi does have its very own screen reader, no need to use jaws or NVDA, or which ever screen reader you use.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need a special setup file to install kodi with the screen reader if you follow these instructions.

I've installed Kodi countless times using this method and it has never failed.

Now, this will work with a completely clean install of kodi, in other words, I'm going to assume that kodi hasn't been installed on your system.

I'll be using windows terms to explain things, so you'll need to figure out what keys to press on a mac.

Now, on windows, all your kodi settings are installed in a folder you can get to by opening the run dialogue and typing %appdata%\\kodi.

I'm not going to explain each little detail because it's not really needed.

I'm just going to tell you what keys to press once you've launched kodi for the first time.

Go ahead and run kodi for the very first time, now, what you want to do is tap the control key a few times, because the key presses sometimes don't register, particularly when you alt tab to another application, no idea why, it just does.

Once kodi is running, hold down the shift key and press A, then hit enter.

Now, hold downd shift once again, but this time we're going to press the letter D, followed by the enter key.

Now, we're going to again hold down shift, only this time we're going to press the letter S, followed by the enter key.

Now, here's where you really have to pay attention.

Press the down arrow 9 times, you should hear the little click sound as you arrow down.

Once you've arrowed down 9 times, hit enter twice.

That's it, if you followed the instructions exactly, you should have kodi up and running with speech.

If you happen to make a mistake, which I have done countless times before I worked all this out, simply delete the kodi folder that is installed in %appdata% and try again.

Now the reason for the shift key is because those letters on their own do other things, I'm not sure of all of them, so you really do need to use that shift key.

One more thing, I find kodi screen reader works better with the classic Confluence skin, which you can find in the main kodi repository.

You might get some great recipes out of it and she might enjoy passing on her expertise--along with all the great sensory experiences that come from cooking. Another idea would be to help her go through papers or old letters she might have or other files of stuff that she may not be able to read now--photo albums (you could describe the pictures and spark memories for her) or greeting cards she might have saved. What about, if she likes animals, finding a dog park or visit a shelter where they're looking for people to socialize with animals?

57,"Torn but lean toward no. I went blind suddenly as a teenager. The experience was awful--going blind in high school is a horrible experience, no way around it. I also had questionable medical care. But being blind has forced me to become a more creative and I would argue passionate person. I would also argue that it's made me more empathetic and understanding. I'm sure there are other ways I could have learned all of this, but illness/disability provided a crash course. That and I've also learned how not to use my vision--I don't want to go through relearning everything again. Plus I've always been snipy and sarcastic and blindness provides a good vehicle for that. 

More practically, I'm assuming a procedure like this would come with significant medical risks. As someone who now has long-ranging health issues from how treatment for my blindness went, I'm very very very hesitant to do anything that would be risky. In a lot of ways the drugs I tried to help my vision only made my life worse (would never wish long-term prednisone on anyone). If it were just a pill I took with no chance of side effects, I may think twice, but anything more than that and it would be a toss up. 

I did have an experience recently that caused me to question this--I was at a Broadway musical and the audio description was excellent. I really felt like I got 95% of what was going on. But it was frustrating because not a lot of things are like that and it made me realize how much I miss out on, if that makes sense.

My state is one of only a few that require its citizens using Medicaid to report work hours. If anyone wants Medicaid, they are forced to report a certain number of worked hours every month. This is forcing many individuals who can’t work off the system and removing their access to healthcare.

In order to report their work hours, and thus get healthcare, people are forced to use an antiquated website that, to me, seems like it would be completely inaccessible to a blind user. The only access I have to accessibility tools is the default VoiceOver assistants in macOS and Windows.

There is a law on the books in my state that mandates all government services be accessible to blind people. I believe the Medicaid work hour reporting website breaks this law and I hope to sue for an injunction and stop people from losing their healthcare.

This all leads up to my question: What software would you say do most blind people use to access the web and do you encounter websites inaccessible enough to be completely unusable for you?

137,"Update:

I attempted to play around with the PCB from an old cable modem. Just touching the joints with the iron and trying to put more solder on them. I learned a few things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'm really OCD about the lead. I washed my hands like 5 times, put the circuit board in a plastic baggie like I was picking up after my dog when I was finished, and even trimmed my nails (I read the biggest issue is ingesting residue that gets under the nails).  I also wore a full face respirator. I bought it a while back for another project, but realized I bit off way more than I could chew and backed off, so using it here was more of a way to get my money's worth out of it. It does keep me from touching my face as I'm wont to do. It has an eye shield and it keeps out the fumes from the rosin, so it's not totally worthless.

2. the CCTV really helps me see the joint I'm working on, but I completely lose track of the big picture. It's hard to guide the solder down to the tip of the iron to melt onto the joint, and it's hard to keep the tip of the iron tinned. That stuff oxidizes really fast. Parts of it were blue when I was done. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. I clearly need personal instruction by someone who knows how to solder blind. There are tons of videos for sighted people to learn to solder, and a few blog posts and articles about blind soldering, but they aren't enough. I also think I'll need a better iron. A $17 kit from Amazon isn't going to cut it. I also noticed the hot iron doesn't radiate much like a stove or oven element. I was expecting to feel heat coming off of the iron given that it's \~700 degrees. On the bright side, it heats up and cools quickly. I did burn myself once, but on the meat of the hand rather than the finger.",,,,syn_syn_ack_ack,,,1546808284,t5_2qpec,t3_acykor,t3_acykor,1,1550976137,0,0,edey8r5,Blind,,,,,

155,"&gt;Microsoft has developed a product that introduces blind children to the world of coding. Called Code Jumper, this product is the result of Project Torino, a research project that was beta tested at New College Worcester in 2018. According to Microsoft, Code Jumper presents a physical programming language that increases coding accessibility.
&gt;
&gt;Following that testing, Microsoft has developed Code Jumper, the device that features knobs, buttons, and wires that connect together plastic pods. Thanks to these physical components, blind students are able to create their own programs for various functions that include playing music and telling stories. 
&gt;
&gt;The system is designed to teach children basic programming skills, including things like variables, sequence, selection, and iteration. As well, the product helps these students learn to “think computationally,” according to Microsoft, offering multiple ways to solve the same issues as one example.
&gt;
&gt;Microsoft plans to hand off Code Jumper, including the technology and research, to Kentucky-based American Printing House for the Blind. The nonprofit organization will make Code Jumper available to students globally over the next half-decade, primarily targeting children ages 7 to 11.

I knew going in that pregnancy was likely going to have a massive impact on my vision due to the increased pressure of...well, everything, and i was right. By my estimation i got 2 years of damage in those 10 months. We decided going in that he would be our only biological child, and will adopt the rest. I also elected to have a c section and not try at all for a vaginal birth due to the pressure and strain that comes with pushing. Ive been in touch with the provincial Childrens Aid and theyve assured me that people with physical disabilities can adopt, you mainly need to prove you are a competent parent (and probably wont get a child with severe needs, which is sort of a silver lining in an im-going-to-hell-for-this way). Obviously theres additional factors included in the adoption process, but that was my main worry regarding that. I also fear that he will inherit the gene, but unless i want to pay $$$ out of pocket my geneticist wont screen him until hes 18 and its not something that they check with 23&amp;Me (ive looked into it)

I also have accepted that i will eventually lose all my sight, but with science evolving so fast i fully believe that i will be able to teach him how to drive in 15 years. So i might miss ""seeing"" him and the other kids grow for a couple years, but it wont be permanent (a ""blindness cure"" is a hot button topic, i know, but its my choice and im not debating it.)

There are various groups online for blind parenting, im in one on facebook (currently taking a break from it though, even that group isnt safe from the sanctimommies)

252,"How old are you and why your mother is calling the shots here when it is **you** who is pondering about the cane. It is you, who is having vision problems, not your mother. 

I guess it might be a cultural thing and related to your background, but health and especially vision is something your mother (or anyone else for that matter) cannot and should not manage for you. She does not see the world with your eyes. Only you can do that.

The fact that the therapist recommended cane for you might be a reason enough to at least give the cane a try and see if it really helps you or not.

Also, IMHO the gender of the therapist should not be the reason to discredit an opinion of *a professional*. To me this sounds just absurd.

As for me, my situation is that I have basically lost my peripheral vision, but my forward vision is still quite good. This means that I can basically live like a normal sighted person, but I do have to be more careful in crowded areas. I do know and admit that the cane would be useful and benefical for me, because that would signal to other people that I am a visually impaired person.

268,"i don't think your questions are stupid at all. trust me, i hear a lot of strange ideas about this sort of thing in my line of work.


-

you will have to get an opinion from his doctor about what will slow down the degeneration. my best guess is that software wont slow the process but it will give him more stamina on the job. it tires a person out to be squinting at a screen all day.

-

a big part of my job right now is to try and make my workplace more accessible for people with various disabilities. its going to be really hard to find a way for him to read mechanical drawings once he is completely blind. if there is a way, i haven't found it yet and i have been doing *a lot* of research. maybe there is some sort of really expensive tactile interface that would allow him to feel the drawings but that technology is probably poorly developed and unpractical. it certainly wouldn't be a mainstream accessibility device.

-

while he still has some vision there is software called **zoomtext** that will make it easier for him to zoom in on his screen to see things better.

-

once he completely loses his vision he will be using **JAWS and NDVA** screen readers to use a computer. JAWS will cost you a decent sum to buy a license. NDVA is free but i would suggest donating a few hundred dollars since they are doing gods work. he will probably want to use both since each is good for different tasks. overall JAWS is supposed to be better.

-

these readers allow the user to use a computer without using the mouse or monitor. it takes a lot of getting used to so he should probably start learning as soon as he is emotionally ready for it. once you get the hang of it, there is a lot you can still do with a computer. but i am afraid he will never be able to use maps, diagrams, flowcharts, drawings.

The truth is, it gives people an extremely skewed perspective of how blind people do things. By going through with, and inevitably failing at, this challenge, people are going to come away from it thinking that blind people must be vulnerable and in need of care.  


In an era where blind parents are still having their children taken away from them, this challenge just perpetuates the worst myths about blindness.  


For instance, after watching other people failing to cross streets, ignorant sighted people might get the idea they have to guide the blind person across the street. However, in doing so, they may inadvertantly endanger the blind person they're trying to help by distracting them.

My wife cares about my weight as mostly a health issue not so much an attractiveness issue, but I think once you've been with someone long enough even sighted people feel that way.

She cares about her own weight because she cares a great deal about her appearance. She can't see what she looks like so she's extra careful to look good and dress well at all times.

302,"Hi there friend. I can’t speak from personal experience but my father lost his left eye 13 years ago and I can tell you some things about his experience.

My dad adapted extremely quickly. His accident involved a lot of head trauma so he was down for a couple weeks before he decided he should start driving again. He has to compensate for that side a lot. He’s accidentally hit people who come up on his left, but never while operating a vehicle. I’ve been bopped in the head a couple times myself.

He cannot see 3D movies anymore, but honestly it’s not a huge thing to give up. He did go on a team building exercise through work where they learned how to drive a race car and got to do a couple solo laps. He thought it was a cool experience.

As for depth perception, he adapted quickly to that too. He still played catch with my brother growing up and was able to throw and catch the ball without a lot of issue. He actually can judge distance better than I can, and I still have two eyeballs. The incident happened when I was 12, I am now 25. Throughout the majority of my life I have never seen the whole “no left eye” thing hold him back. 

I wish you well during your recovery and I hope that my dad’s experience brings you some comfort for your prognosis. ",,,,air_child99,,,1547518443,t5_2qpec,t3_afz7cd,t3_afz7cd,7,1551387051,0,0,ee3bgxc,Blind,,,,,

I used to type on my iPhone in the notepad app and in accessibility features you can have a button that will read it out loud when you select it. If she’s visually impaired, you can also turn on voiceover and it will help her navigate on her phone and read what she types out.

I kept a list of common things I wanted to say, like “May I have a lemonade, please?” and that helped with the impatient people or more hurried situations. Make sure she has something on her that states she has speech difficulties too, so people don’t think she’s having a current emergency and call an ambulance if she’s struggling to say something. There’s a great aphasia group on Facebook called Aphasia Recovery Connection I think that helped me feel less like a freak.

If I'm looking at something, for example, I'll ""see"" what I know is in my periphery. However, if something or someone moves in to that space, I won't actually register that it's there until I look in that direction. This can be surprising because things can suddenly just appear really close to me because I hadn't looked that way for a while.

People with normal vision experience this to a much lesser extent, I believe. Normal eyes have a blind spot where the optical nerve connects to the retina but nobody really knows about it because their brain just fills that space in.

Pressing enter will navigate to one and should automatically start it reading. If it doesn't which can happen sometimes, go back into browse mode, go to the bottom of the page with CTRL+End and then to the previous level 2 heading with Shift+2 and you can start reading. Once you're done looking at a post either go back in your web browser or press escape. If you'd rather not do the J and K thing, going by level 2 heading will jump you from post to post as well.

There's plenty of organisations and charities that will support you and will be able to help you adapt, teach you how to use your cane, introduce you to Braille, show you how to take care of your diabetes, etc.

Besides, you are still young and you will adapt a lot quicker. There is plenty of technology out there developed in order to help the visually-impaired in some pretty mind-blowing ways. You will also discover that plenty of things will be accessible to you, although, unfortunately, too many things are still not fully accessible for the blind.

I am not blind myself, but my best friend is. He started losing his sight when he was a kid and didn't completely lose it until around your age. We talk about him embracing blindness very often.

The first thing to go was color. Greens looked purple and her vision slowly started worsening. Some of her friends suggested she needed a psychiatrist. The vision doctors eventually acknowledged her vision was getting worse but couldn't come up with a reason. Eventually, a specialist found that it was a genetic condition called Progressive Cone Dystrophy.  I read your post to my wife and she says that's how it happened with her. No one believed her.

Even if you don't fall asleep right away stay in bbed. If you fall asleep and wake up at 3:00, still stay in bed. Get up at 7:00 the next morning and do it all again.

397,"Two thoughts. First, they sell solderless headers for the raspberry pi if you don’t feel up to the task, they’re affordable and a good alternative to soldering.

If you do choose to do it, the fumes should be minimal if you’re using solder made for electrical work, and an apron should not be necessary. You’ll want a work space that can take some heat and a wet sponge to dab the the iron tip on to clean it from time to time. Having just done this exact task the other night, I would recommend the sharpest, smallest tip that you can find for the iron for getting into all those tiny spaces - I wound up needing to pick up a new tip for this purpose, the chisel tips that came with my iron were not fine enough to get in there cleanly. 

One other tip that really helped was to take a piece of masking tap (plastic based tapes will melt if you get the iron too close) and tape the header block in place, then solder a pin in each corner. Then you can take the tape off and do the rest, but it really helps to not have to hold the header block tight while you’re soldering.",,,,fainting-goat,,,1546729106,t5_2qpec,t3_acykor,t3_acykor,1,1550927964,0,0,edc3hzl,Blind,,,,,

Window 10 has a boatload of built in things for the visually impaired. iPhones do as well, so I am assuming that Macs are similar. However, Zoomtext is the Cadillac of magnifiers with a built in reader. It's pricey, but worth every cent. Department of Rehab gave me my copy. 

What is super important is that he gets into programs that are going to teach him the life skills he will need to get by, It's not going to do you much good to work on his job skills if he doesn't have the life skills he needs. He needs to learn mobility and orienteering so he can find his way around the office.  People who see just don't get it sometimes, that things that they take for granted, like picking clothes or socks that match, are really tough and they get to you. 


Any teaching center for the blind is going to have group discussions and it sounds drippy, but they really help.

424,"Depending on your specific vision loss I would say the 80D is quite accessible. It has a big viewfinder but you can also shoot in Live View if that’s easier but if you do that on any camera there is a delay between shooting that isn’t present when you shoot with the viewfinder. I’d say you could learn where the majority of your settings are by touch, and as with most £1k+ cameras there’s a top screen that has a back light with all your settings on but the text size/colour can’t be changed.

You could always just shoot in auto to negate that (and the price) or if you know /exactly/ what you want you can learn the settings (aperture, shutter speed etc) in your head or make your own presets but honestly camera’s aren’t exactly built for VI accessibility (understandably) so there’s only so much you can get.

Lightroom isn’t compatible with VoiceOver, but its mostly sliding bars so with enough guidance and a little practice you can figure it out from there. Alternatively there are other editing softwares, I just prefer Lightroom.

I have the instant pot lux model and one tip I can give is that when you are hitting the plus and minus buttons to adjust cook time, the pot gives a double beep when the menu wraps around to the top or bottom number. For example, if you scroll backward till you get a double beep, it gives the longest possible cook time which I think is 240 minutes if I remember correctly. If you don't remember what you had it set on, you can scroll backward till you get the double beep, scroll back one more time, and go forward. When you get the double beep again, you are on 0 minutes cook time. I usually forget what I had it on last time, so I will go back and wrap it around so I am sure I got the correct cook time set.

That said some pieces i have seen as a side effect are a general understanding by the public if you do misstep or bump into one. As well people tend to be more willing to help.  Another example is construction sites. So many times I have had staff or a police officer see me and offer to help me navigate the odd and dangerous terrain. As well if using something like a handicapped seat on a bus it helps communicate why you need it same goes for sitting closer at an event etc.,,,,Drop9Reddit,,,1548041900,t5_2qpec,t3_ai238r,t3_ai238r,3,1551709962,0,0,eeleduh,Blind,,,,,

501,"Hi! I have a set of dice that is about four times lager than the standard ones. Every dice has a different color, which is super helpful when I can’t tell which one is which. Our DM, or another player can just say “it’s the purple one” instead of having to hand it to me. My friend uses braille dice, which do exist but aren’t exactly perfect. Some of his dice are unbalanced, so. Unusable, and he doesn’t have a full set. If he needs to roll a dice he doesn’t have, he’ll borrow one from another player or our DM. He rolls, and then someone will tell him what he rolled. As for character sheets, I take my iPad and have it on there as a google docs document. Just a very simple lay out that for me, is super readable. My friend uses the same system, but uses a braille reader with his iPad (A screen reader would be kind of annoying for the rest) my DM still uses a map, but makes sure me and my friend know what is going on.

They're *helping*. I don't feel like HR or any law is making them be supportive. When they say they'll do whatever they can to make my job easier I really believe them. I think that's the most important thing you can do.

They help me through my own reluctance. I don't like to ask for things. I was okay with the regular monitors like everybody else and it felt really weird when I was being pushed into getting larger screens. I got one screen and it did a ton to reduce the strain brought on by headaches, and they immediately had me order a second one.

They don't pry, but the listen if I need to vent about what's going on. This change is really hard and carries a lot of psychological weight. All of us want to feel like we can contribute. Losing your vision is a big hit against that. I can't drive anymore, I can't cook for my family, I can't tell which kid is mine when they play sports, I can't clean very well because I can't tell when things are clean (but let's be honest, this one is on the bottom of the list ;) ). At work - I feel a lot slower than I used to be. I send more typos in emails. I miss bugs in code review and I'm submitting more.

519,"There is a lady who is blind and the way she take pictures is through another person who can see. That person would describe the environment and the image in the screen to her while she aims with her phone and makes decision. For the low vision photographers who use a camera, they can perceive the environment and can roughly see what is in the picture, but the screen on a camera is a lot smaller than a smartphone which makes it difficult and the text on the camera controls are really small. So they have to take one picture then check it and change something and take another picture until they get the one they want. This is how they take photos and the photos are good. They have their work on some photography exhibition. They held exhibition themselves around the city and they make postcards with their photos. 

I do think that iphone has a pretty good camera among other smartphones. But if you are into photography, you will want better. Yet not everyone want to go professional. So I think it may be more reasonable to design for beginners or people who wants to try taking photos but are not sure whether they like it or not. And they don't have to invest too much into something they may not like after three days. I have met people who spent 1000 US dollar on a camera and never use it because it is too heavy to carry.

For me, as a VI person, the answer is absolutely yes.

Look, it's fine to say that the world just needs to become more accessible so that I can better function with my low vision, but there is only so far that can go. At best, my only hope of independent personal transport in the future is a self driving vehicle, and even that lacks part of the fundamental experience of being able to drive for pleasure or recreation.

And that's just one example. My cooking skills will always be lesser than an equally experienced regular sighted person because I don't have the same ability to see changes in food colour, food consistency, etc. I can't read people's facial expressions or body language, there are some jobs I literally cannot do (waiting tables, tending bar, stocking shelves in a supermarket) because my low vision makes me incredibly inefficient at these task and a borderline safety hazard. I would love to take over the family farm from my Dad, keep dairy cows, chickens, pigs, etc, but my low vision makes this an impossibility because you need to be able to visually recognise signs of health problems in animals and need to be able to quickly assess pasture.

As for scaling it up it won't work in a lot of cases. Like if i need to test a mix I wouldn't want to make something like 100ml of it because it might turn out like crap. When making a little sample bottle like 10ml it would all be measurements like .15g and so on. Bumpping it up to .2 or down to .1 would make a really big difference.

open containers. Cups, bottles, the fast food cups with lids. Keep them out of the way if you don't want ALL of your stuff to be sticky. 

&amp;#x200B;

watch a couple of youtube videos on human guide technique. If you guys are hanging out together it would be good to know. It's not hard at all, but there's more to it than just letting them hold onto your arm- like going through a narrow passage like a doorway, going up and down stairs, how to give good and useful audio cues. 

&amp;#x200B;

If she tells you about her health issues (since blindness is a symptom, usually not just an isolated condition), listen and remember the names. God forbid anything happens to her, you might be the one who is around to let EMTs know that she is blind due to such and such condition, and she's on such and such medication and is predisposed to have such and such reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

You seem like a genuinely nice person, so I don't think this will be an issue, but don't make her accommodations seem like a burden. You don't need to give in to everything she says all the time, but if she needs the light at a certain level (if she has some vision) to do her homework, don't make a big deal about it (unless it's interfering with your ability to do your work).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, follow her lead, but have a sense of humor about it. Some people are very sensitive, and than you should probably be on your best behavior. But if she is relaxed, as you get to know each other, you can be too. Don't break into apologies if you say ""see you later!""

A quick idea that comes to mind is maybe some kind of placemat that has cut-outs or ridges to separate areas for objects like: plate, cutlery, main beverage, water, bread plate, butter dish/knives, etc. And have it ""point out"" where those objects are in braille. I'm imagining a rubbery-plastic sort of material; silicone would probably work well. 

A technological step up from that could be one that automatically adjusts to the objects placed in it and updates braille in real time. Particularly if it were set up to scan bar codes a restaurant could use on their dishes. If we add voice AI, one could ask their tray what's on it to get the audio breakdown as well, and maybe also be informed about what's hot or sharp, to prevent injury.

The more you learn about a cameras specifications can help - like for example with a small digital camera you’re only going to get so much distance in focus because of the adjustable focal lengths of the built in lens, and how much zoom it has, that sort of thing.

A tripod or unipod would be a good idea so you have more stable shots. Lots of cameras have the little spin wheel for settings but I figure you could use bump ons so you know what buttons are what (the amount of times I’ve almost accidentally deleted a photo. Yikes).

572,"I had a similar experience a little over a year ago. I experienced sudden painless monocular vision loss in my right eye as a result of a central retinal arterial occlusion. I initially thought I would be able to regain some sight but within a week I learned it would be permanent (at least until they figure out the technology for those cool bionic eyes!). I also have some limited blurry peripheral vision. 

The first week is the worst and I sympathize with you tremendously. It makes absolutely no sense and there are a lot of “Why me?” moments. All I can offer is that you now have an opportunity that many people do not - to protect the shit out of your good eye! Your ophthalmologists should have some ideas about this.

As to living with one eye, check out r/monocular for some resources. I met with a grief counselor a few times and found that really helpful to process those “why me?” questions. I started driving immediately to get over the initial fear (it is completely legal and many people with monocular vision drive).  Tossing a ball helps with getting your depth perception back. 

I bought a couple eye patches because I thought that was what I was supposed to do but I stoped wearing them almost immediately. Your brain has this incredible ability to “turn off” your bad eye so within a few weeks you will start going hours (or even entire days) without noticing. 

This will get better. Life goes on. We’re here for you!",,,,Pacificem,,,1547618374,t5_2qpec,t3_aghysh,t3_aghysh,3,1551440286,0,0,ee6f6f6,Blind,,,,,

Interestingly, many of the comments in this particular thread reference things that cannot be done as a visually impaired person. I am completely blind, and have done many of these things.

The impossibilities listed seem to be more mental than physical. oh, and I studied mathematics as well, so high-level theoretical mathematics is entirely possible.


The reason I wouldn’t do it assuming that we have the current lifespan that we do, is because I was born blind and the level of rehabilitation necessary would take several valuable years out of my life. I’m not convinced that the blind often consider the ramifications of gaining sight, particularly if they’ve never had it before.

Things that were otherwise understood as solid tactile objects become shades of refracted light and colour. It’s highly unlnlikely that we would even be able to process the information for quite some time. Even once this has been accomplished and we can interpret our surroundings, we then have to go through the rigourous learning process of understanding new types of visual based communication that children learn. Unfortunately, adults aren’t as skilled at assimilating experiences as quickly as children, so we would take much longer to do this, and perhaps would never be as good as someone who did it from birth. We will also have to learn how to read print, learn how to read print on a computer screen, write, reinterpret depth perception and movement schematics in order to drive. The list goes on. You’re looking at at least two years of constant rehabilitation, time in which you can’t possibly work or do anything else meaningful or enjoyable.

A good percentage of the time it doesn't end up working anyway--you can choose to spend a lifetime on chemotherapy that may not work and will cause a whole host of side effects (including neuropathy, and the idea of having peripheral neuropathy AND being blind is unbearable to me since I love reading Braille) and still lose your vision anyway or accept it and learn to be blind. As it is, the treatment I tried and failed when I was younger gave me additional health issues--including, ironically enough, raising my intraocular pressure (no glaucoma yet I don't think though).

There is no way to get reviews unfortunately and sometimes you can’t even pik the counslor try to call around. The only way I got this guy was through a connection. This one was who I knew. You may be able to call around your local area when you first apply I guess people can initially ask others how their counselor is and try to find a good one. See if they will return your call if you call them about opening up a case for you etc.... I forgot how it goes not sure if you can change counselors midway. 

But most importantly there is a handbook, do you have your vr rights handbook? My friend who worked with them told me about it, and this counselor also made me aware and sent me a copy. 

Do you have this:

Consumer information handbook 

It’s kind of what’s your rights what’s the procedures how you follow the procedures to get your rights if you don’t think you’re getting it. If you’re not with DOR anymore did you have a copy. I started with them in 2011 so this handbook is from then and the governor was still schwarzenegger.

820,"Okay maybe I should share some of my thoughts here with you. With my current picture taking it’s not that I like or don’t like it. I don’t mind taking picture and if it’s at all easy to take a picture I’d probably take more of them. I already do sound scaping. I like pictures but find them difficult. I take pictures very seldomly but sometimes do and most times I hand my camera to someone else and tell them here. Take it for me. When I try for it myself, I don’t adjust anything, I don’t hardly know what they are. One or two of them. Turnning on the flash light, switching from the front to the rear camera. That’s the extent of it. I see the crop your picture but I don’t see the picture so can’t crop or edit. Zooming and stuff I don’t know if zooming is better or worse because I can’t see the image if that makes sense.

I answer touch screen if only you can build in an audio feedback in to it to tell me what I am touching on the touch screen, and could probably describe dynamic content on many screens better, especially adjusting to object focus and what object you want to take.

840,"There are a couple of useful tricks. These apply to the old Reddit interface, not sure about the new.

To skip over the pointless start, use d to navigate to the last landmark. That's where posts begin. From there, you can quickly move through posts by using b, for next button, as there's upvote and downvote button on each post. Pressing b twice takes you to the downvote button, then down arrow lets you read the post title.

Within a post, pressing d to the last landmark places you at the start of the post specific things. From there on you can press e to go to the edit field for the comment, or b to go to the save button. After that, for navigating comments you can also use the b trick, but there are other options. For example, there's an add-on for NVDA called TextNav that lets you go over all the links and crap by using shift-alt-down arrow or shift-alt-up arrow. It will move to the next block of text and it is very handy for navigating through forums where there can be a lot of extraneous crap you don't care about, and it works equally well on Reddit.

Hope these tricks help. I'd like to hear of any others people have come up with.

841,"Yes. I'm blind from birth, so for the purposes of this question I'm assuming that the ""cure"" would involve getting functional use of sight, like a normal sighted person has, not just sight itself.

There's so many things I can't do as a blind person. People say, oh it's an issue of accessibility, it's not an issue of blindness. This is at best wishful thinking and at worst denial of reality.

Things I'll never be able to do:

* Have an intuitive understanding of colour.
* Run an oscilloscope.
* Carry out independent historical research (no, you can't take a 15th century manuscript and put it on a scanner).
* Have an intuitive understanding of people's gestures, face expressions, etc.
* Visual aesthetics.
* Read any maths paper I like (no, they're not easily convertible to MathML).
* Work on my own on any number of things that require vision: physics, chemistry, medicine, machining...
* 3d design.
* More shit than I can think of...

I'm glad that lot more things become accessible with time, but we're never going to have parity and it's a pipedream to think that it's even possible. Vision is an extra modality with information that is very dense, perceived instantaneously and globally. It is inevitable that its lack will bar us from doing certain things which require it, and I would like to do some of those.

862,"How much vision do you have? Did you ""lose"" your sight, or were you born with this? I didn't see that in the original post but it makes a difference. I'm sure I have the non-24 problem here, for example, as even most sleep supplements don't work. But I've had good luck with Chinese medicine and small amounts of cannabis before bed, as well as tea. Physical activity may or may not help, as I do a lot of exercise and still don't notice fatigue. Sure, the body is physically sore or stiff, for example, but the notion of ""tired"" doesn't happen. So I'd start by taking an account of your symptoms and figuring out what helps and what doesn't. Also if you don't feel safe or supported, or loved, that will screw up sleep as well. So clearing the day out of your head will help a lot more than the other things listed, but it's a collection of tools. I was able to track some of the problem here to the fact that I'm constantly running in emergency mode, and can't get the brain to turn off. Also part of the problem here is that I don't seem to get the signal that I should start getting tired, so I just keep bouncing around, regardless of the time of day. Certainly this is something that needs more investigation. It's figuring out how your system works, and playing around until you get something consistently working. For me it seems that a regular schedule and vitamin d and cannabis works reliably, but if I skip one of those things I have trouble. But then I've never had any sort of vision at all, so I'm not sure that my circumstance matches yours. I just wrote this giant comment to possibly help you find things to look for, as I don't think weird sleep problems get the attention they deserve. Especially things like the non-24 effects are still being denied by most doctors and insurance companies, and having gone through years of improper sleep, I can say that's not useful.

How do you do it? Exactly as someone would guide you! More or less anyway.

First things first: you should be using your cane. Have your friend hold onto your arm or shoulder on your non-cane hand side (so if you're a right hander this means he'll have his right hand on your left shoulder or elbow). It's a good idea if he has his cane out in his left hand too, but you're more the active user. From there you get around just as you would normally, but remembering you've got someone in tow.

There's nothing strange about it at all, and if you're frequenting a place regularly the staff there will recognise you and know what they need to do to help.

Edit: I forgot to add, it also pays to add a bit of commentary about where you're leading your B1. If there is a pole coming up on their side, warn them. If you're approaching steps, give them the heads up. Or if you're having troubling telling what the lay of the land is ahead or where you should be going, let them know.

I've never heard of anyone 3d printing tactile graphics, so I must assume there's a reason, considering that it's probably cheapest. Next to that, there's capsule paper / swell paper, where anything drawn on it with a certain material (I forget precisely what, but it might just be a common carbon-based ink) triggers the expansion of capsules inside the paper when heat is applied. The images can be drawn or printed with not-so-special equipment, but the paper and the machine for activating the effect are more costly (last I checked, the paper went for around $115 / 100 sheets, and the machine was a few thousand).

1021,"I get to do this often. Blind people need information, like everyone else.

You get to read the labels so the shopper knows prices and fabric compositions.

You get to scan around the store and describe the general layout then maybe suggest a plan of action, The shopper may then ignore you and grab the nearest brightly coloured thing and inspect that. That is OK, be patient, you get to do this all the time without help.

You should speak up if the thing the shopper has missed something obvious e.g. ""Did you notice they are crotchless?"" If they did that's fine too, if they didn't then it is up to them how they react to the info. Also pointing out special offers and small print on the special offers is helpful.

When trawling through the bargain rails you can pick out the items in their size and offer them to the shopper to see if anything is of interest.

Shopping environments are constructed for sighted people, you can bridge the gap by converting the visual to spoken descriptions.

Take the shoppers lead as to how much and what kind of information they want,

Just be friend and chat about the motivation for the shopping trip. Someone to impress or just out to feel good in fine clothing.

2. When tuning through the station list the name of stations are announced.
3. Touching the handle one causes the current time to be announced
4. Touching the handle twice causes the alarm settings to be announced.
5. All the menus are spoken as well as shown on the small back-lit display.
6. Good tactile feedback from the dials and buttons.
7. Rotary dial to select the station, that clicks as you turn it, announces the stations as it goes through the list then is pushed to select the station just announced.
8. Rotary dial to adjust the volume.
9 Push button pre-sets to select favourite stations
10. A sleep timer push button
11. Usual DAB radio features such as scanning to find all services

This attitude is present even and optometrist and those who work with blind people.

As a kid (I’m gen z)’the first few people assigned to me by the school board were focused on getting me to just” try harder” to see using my residual vision. For most of primary school the only equipment I had was an easel so I wouldn’t hurt my neck and a magnifying glass. They also enlarged my worksheets but a lot of times they weren’t large enough or had poor contrast. I also wasn’t allowed to have a desk close enough to the board. I had one teacher who really hated me and would write in small cursive and far away from me. My vision itinerant would also come once every few weeks and make men do mazes and crosswords which are a nightmare for me because of my nystagmus. During that time I got lots of bad headaches due to eye strain and was exhausted after school from seeing (more so than usual). Eventually I ended up getting someone who was actually great and I got my first assistive tech outside of a magnifying glass. This whole deal.of getting blind people to just try harder is harmful psychologically and physically .

A few months ago, I went to an optometrist who specializes nystagmus(in hindsight I was probably referred because she was doing a study on congenital nystagmus)  and her first question to me was “Are you excited to get your drivers license?”. When she was testing my vision she told me to try harder and I couldn’t because it was causing me a bad headache but she still didn’t listen. My mom had it and asked her what she was trying to accomplish by getting me to strain my eyes as it doesn’t actually help me see better and the optometrist asked her if she wanted my vision to improve.

1090,"My vision is dependant on a variety of factors like lighting, if I’m hungry, tired,  if someone close to me is wear stripes and many other things. It’s a kid the spec Ed department did this thing where they brought in these goggles for my classmates to try but they weren’t really accurate. Heck sometimes I don’t know what I can and cannot see. The best reference I have is that is I can’t see sheet music if it’s farther away from my face than what it is when I’m sitting at a piano no matter how big it is, it’s past the distance I can read from rather than just recognizing symbols. Another thing is that I have no depth perception so i can only judge distances from (sometimes painful) experiences. Say if a ball whizzes past my face 2 feet away, it feels like it’s going to hit my face.  For near vision with my glasses, I probably see 20/80 but my distance vision is worse than 20/200. I literally sit like a meter away from the board in one of my classes and I cannot see the board so people who can take notes from the back of the class seem superhuman. Also, even reading the menu boards at cafes seems like a superhuman feat so I try to see if they have their prices online and get the cash together. I’ve had to rely on my memory and my residual vision a lot so I don’t think of my vision as being bad I just think of everything else being superhuman to the point where I’m bad at judging my limits. Sometimes when I just wake up I stair at my popcorn ceiling and depending on if my eyes are shaking a foot I can go from being able to see that it’s textured to it looking flat all while my brain tries to decide what eye to pay attention. 

Edit: I did some research on ONH and it turns out that it often presents with nystagmus and strabismus which I have due to albinism, Also chances are, your nephew’s sight will improve as he gets older. My parents went from being able to hide things in plain sight to actually having to hide stuff but jokes on them because I know all their hiding spots now so it doesn’t require as much vision to find stuff.

Another thing is that I have no depth perception so i can only judge distances from (sometimes painful) experiences. Say if a ball whizzes past my face 2 feet away, it feels like it’s going to hit my face.  For near vision with my glasses, I probably see 20/80 but my distance vision is worse than 20/200. I literally sit like a meter away from the board in one of my classes and I cannot see the board so people who can take notes from the back of the class seem superhuman. Also, even reading the menu boards at cafes seems like a superhuman feat so I try to see if they have their prices online and get the cash together. I’ve had to rely on my memory and my residual vision a lot so I don’t think of my vision as being bad I just think of everything else being superhuman to the point where I’m bad at judging my limits. Sometimes when I just wake up I stair at my popcorn ceiling and depending on if my eyes are shaking a foot I can go from being able to see that it’s textured to it looking flat all while my brain tries to decide what eye to pay attention. 

Edit: I did some research on ONH and it turns out that it often presents with nystagmus and strabismus which I have due to albinism, Also chances are, your nephew’s sight will improve as he gets older. My parents went from being able to hide things in plain sight to actually having to hide stuff but jokes on them because I know all their hiding spots now so it doesn’t require as much vision to find stuff. Another thing you can do is try setting the text size to watermelon as that’s just a bit too small for me to read without strain.","[{'start': 167, 'end': 175, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

There is no shortage of actually good ideas, however. There are plenty of existing projects that could use the time, money, skills, etc of someone who wants to help blind people. 

These student projects are almost invariably 100% theoretical projects by people who do not understand, and have not researched, the problems of blindness or what technology exists (and who will not care after a semester.) 

When they are not students, 99% of the time it will be someone working on their own who cannot be disuaded from the brilliance of their idea. Sometimes these people successfully seek funding from organizations or individuals who also have no idea that blind people don't need a toilet paper app or yet another sonic cane or whatever and just see ""innovative technology for blind people."" Never, not once, have I been able to or seen anyone else able to convince these solo inventors to put their skills and time towards an existing project that actually does something useful. 

There are so many ""smart canes for the blind"" projects that never make it past a bunch of positive, feel-good news headlines for the inventor. Adaptive tech is wonderful. The sheer amount of vaporware that exists primarily so that a student can slap their name on ""revolutionary product for the blind"" is not.

Absolutely use your cane as well. Otherwise you're risking personal injury as well as potentially your friend, and people will assume (because you're guiding your friend) that you are actually sighted. 

If you're hitting canes when walking together, can one of you switch to using your non-dominant hand (and switch sides) for the duration? The person being ""guided"" might want to choke up their cane, but not to the extent that they're not actually using the cane in the intended manner. If you haven't tried it, you might discover that it really isn't an issue between the two of you and that you don't have to make conscious modifications after a few tries. 

Alternately, are you able to get by without any physical contact by maintaining an active conversation with each other? ",,,,-shacklebolt-,,,1547673255,t5_2qpec,t3_agomjp,t3_agomjp,6,1551484164,0,0,ee81ghq,Blind,,,,,

Also, there's one with a series of circles making an outline of a circle and a dot going around it, and I think it's meant to not go to certain dots in the video, or something like that?

But, regardless, in those experiments, at the right range the lines were solid, the dots didn't exist, and the dot rotated correctly, in order.

Your brain tries to not have you freak out, so it just fills in things for you, even if they're wrong.

I have a condition called <PERSON> syndrome, where you have visual hallucinations of things that absolutely aren't there, because your brain just fills things in from guessing.

For me, since my vision loss is so severe, it'll sometimes add a firm line between light and dark things that I absolutely cannot see, or it'll assume that something dark is a person and add in details that don't exist, like turning a hanging towel into someone just squatting there, for some reason.","[{'start': 825, 'end': 833, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I'd also check with your doctor and have some bloodwork done. Vitamin deficiencies can definitely mess with your ability to get tired or sleep on a regular schedule.

My internal clock is slightly closer to 25 or 26 hours rather than 24, so I will, slowly, cycle through sleeping during the day and night, even with a firm meal schedule and plenty of exercise, etc.

1175,"A lot of people who slowly lose vision end up pushing off getting a cane too long.

Is your tripping from your amount of vision? If so, that should be more than enough reason for you to get a cane.

If not, then you might want to wait until you can get proper training, which will require you to be a bit more independent to be honest. Your mom shouldn't be even involved, never mind able to make decisions for you.

That said, I know so many people with slow progressing vision loss who chose to push off getting a cane because they didn't trip, then they didn't trip that much, then they didn't hurt themselves too much when they tripped, until they did and then, suddenly, their vision is bad and learning to use the cane is harder because they can't use vision as a secondary checker in situations where they're not sure what their cane's feeling.

I had a friend that twisted his ankle regularly, even breaking something, but he didn't want the stigma of being blind because he can see fine during the day and girls don't flock to guys with canes. It took him wearing a cast, then a boot, for him to stop being so against the cane.

Prior to my forced career switch, I looked into nursing school to become a nurse practitioner. They require: 1) a license, 2) car ownership with no remaining payments, nor a leased car, and 3) a monthly maintenance report signed by a certified/licensed mechanic.

Had you spoken to even a small group of blind people you'd have discovered that we have gps on our phones, specific gps devices if we wish and use things like smart watches. And secondly people have tried to create canes with other tech in them before and we, as a community have made the decision not to invest in them.

1261,"Another angle is your guy knows the stuff.   With a sighted assistant/intern, he can still do a goodly amount of interaction with diagrams or plans that aren't easily made accessible through tech.   He'd be a fantastic resource for less experienced people and a great team leader as well.    He's got many options and you have a valuable resource to explore especially since you're looking at the situation from a value maintained/added perspective.   This is still a rare phenomenon in the disability community.      

You may find that his changed vision opens new ways for all of you to look at how you work.  

As for sight conservation, there used to be a number of theories about how not using your sight saved it for later.   As someone who was put through some of those ideas, I can say they're bunk.   Eyes that are failing aren't going to stop because you use them less.   He will likely want to see All The Things while he can rather than rest them and hope for more days.   This is natural.    

Letting him know you want to help him maintain his place at your company and asking him how he wants to proceed will be a HUGE relief to him.   You can make contacts and tell him what you've learned about his options but don't he surprised if he's working on other angles, too.   You engineers are tenacious like that.     

Voc rehab is a mixed bag.   While you may come across a gem of a counselor with ideas aplenty, you are just as likely to meet someone with a less than supportive approach simply because scant resources or lack of knowledge of a field limit a counselor's perceptions on how a blind person can do a job.   Be prepared for either response.   Funding is a big consideration for them.  Be upfront about your determination to keep him and that you're providing financial resources for any accommodations he needs and ask for help in the areas where your expertise is lacking.     You may still find yourself experimenting to find what works.   Put some feelers out within your field, too.   You can't be the first with these questions.

It isn’t clear to me whether you are just a friend or a service provider as well, but I suspect the former, so I’m going to proceed with that assumption.  As a friend, you need to ask yourself what are your responsibilities.  Are you the type of friend that wants to try to correct the behavior that you perceive to be wrong, or are you the type of friend that seeks to support without enabling?  If the former, you must have patience with your friend, since your definition of correctness may be different from his, for a variety of reasons.  

Basically, decide what kind of friend you want to be, and don’t let his opinions and behaviors get to you.  Either be there with a positive attitude to try to support him, or take a step back, and focus on the things that you two have in common.

1335,"Of a weekday, I get out of bed around 6:00AM and grab a coffee. I grew up on instant, but ever since a friend introduced me to fresh ground, my morning jolt comes from a bean-to-cup machine. Breakfast is generally a one-handed affair: a banana, cereal bar, sometimes a smoothie or yoghurt drink. I get that down me whilst taking the dog for a walk, a short round-the-block job if it's wet or particularly cold, or a longer run around the park if it's dry.  If the latter, I take a crossword, sudoku, newspaper, magazine or novel to have something to focus on whilst the dog is running around the park.  These range from 10 to 45 minutes, depending on weather, how well I've slept, whether the dog will otherwise be having exercise, whatever else needs doing before work. Generally, this is not a time when I communicate with other people very much.

 

I aim to be home by 7:00AM. I put the kettle on for the wife's hot drink, make myself a second coffee and take both upstairs. Unless I've got a gripping chapter to finish, the coffee goes into the bathroom. I wake up my daughter and tell her to get ready for school.  I deposit the wife's instant coffee (don't ask) at the bedside. Casual clothes (generally shorts and a tank top, perhaps jeans in cooler weather) are hung or dumped for laundry.  Sometimes to music, I shower, shave if necessary, finish the coffee, clean my teeth, and free up the bathroom for the rest of the family while I get dressed in my bedroom.

 

By 8:00AM I am dressed for work. ""Smart"" trousers, a matching shirt, a tie if I am not going to be disassembling technology (I have previously been known to tighten up a computer casing with the end of my tie dangling inside). Very occasionally I will need a full 3 piece suit, such as for trips out of the office for special circumstances, but these are rare and often mean the whole day is changed around as I generally need to be on an early train for that sort of thing. So normally it's just the regular work clothes.  By this point, my daughter is generally dressed and doing her teeth, face and hair.

 

The wife will have usually made lunch, so I head to the kitchen.  I might unload or reload the dishwasher, pick up the dog mess from the garden, make my or my daughter's lunch if for whatever reason it hasn't been done.  This is usually done to music or radio news. If there's none of that needs doing and the kid is ready, we sometimes walk up to school early so she can attend breakfast club. If the wife's not up for the regular drop-off and we don't have time for a walk, I'll drop her in on my way to work. This rankles because breakfast club has to be paid for, and I leave for work at 8:30. This means she only attends for 10 minutes if we leave on time, costing me £0.15 per minute.

 

The journey to work can take between 12 and 20 minutes, traffic depending.  I get a taxi to work, part-funded by the government because of my disability: I contribute a sum calculated to be the equivalent of running a car, and they pay the rest. I look over my diary, catch up on social media, answer emails or read during the journey. 

 

15' minutes is about average for the trip, so I'm generally at my desk by about 08:50, as a rule. I see people for 30 minute sessions, for the most part, every morning.  Sometimes people have me for an hour, occasionally I see a couple of people for 15 minutes each.  This goes on with a 20 minute break at 11:00AM, at which I take the dog to relieve himself, refill my water bottle in the staffroom and have a snack brought from home, Often homemade by the good wife.

 

The second half of the ""morning"" follows the same pattern.  My lunch break starts at 1:00PM. If I have brought lunch, I tend to eat in my office whilst watching Netflix, reading, or enjoying whatever televised activities that may appeal (I'm a fan of Cheltenham horse racing, rugby, prime ministers questions and the rest of the UK political scene).  If I don't have lunch I will walk to a nearby supermarket with a cafe and either eat there or bring something back.

 

My afternoon work is in a different office with a colleague. We field queries from people phoning, emailing or turning up, get sent off to do various things around the site, or otherwise maintain the computing infrastructure of the buildings, buy in new stuff, set things up, reassign hardware, develop in-house software, diagnose problems and generally provide IT support.  Sometimes confusing stuff beyond the pair of us get sent up to a team of off-site consultants, or we'll book repairs and make sure the guys come in and do a decent job.

 

I finish at 4:00PM. Occasionally I will have to slip off 10 minutes early to collect my daughter from an after school activity, but for the most part the wife is on the ball. School finishes at 3:15, but luckily there's an after school thing 4 days a week, so it's even rarer I have to zoom off any sooner.

 

If I get home and there's nobody about, there may be instructions: “put the oven on when we leave dance class”, “ mash half a bag of potatoes”, “don't touch the slow cooker”, “drain the pasta”, “go and pick up some milk”, “hang the laundry”, “put the towels in the drier”, “tidy the kitchen”, “vacuum”. Sometimes there's nothing at all, and I can put my feet up with my final coffee of the day and watch something. If they're at a shorter thing, it's an episode of something, or maybe even a radio play. If a longer activity, a movie or double-episode.  I’m a big sci-fi and horror fan, so there’s always something to watch and, if there isn’t, I’ll read.

 

Weeknights are generally at home. We eat and clear up, do homework with the little one, run through this week’s spellings, she reads to us and one of us reads to her at bed time.  Sometimes we’ll play a game of something, but generally she’s so active outside of school that it’s home for food, reading and homework, bath and bed. 

 

When she’s asleep, I either catch up on work from the morning or prepare things for tomorrow’s morning people, do some work for the charity I work with (this includes online videoconferences once a month and a host of paperwork and other ephemera) or if there’s none of that, the wife and I will have some time.  We’ll usually watch something together or, if she’s particularly absorbed in something trashy, I’ll massage her back, shoulders or legs whilst listening to something in my own headphones. We’ve an ample supply of various creams, oils and lotions and I think we both find the wind-down time relaxing. If it’s early enough and I’m still awake, I take myself for a long bath.  On days when I have earmarked a new book, I will often sit myself down with said book, a pot of tea and a huge plate of snacks.  Book depending, I can be there until between 11:30Pm and 4:00AM.  The latter is obviously less likely, but I have been known to spend a whole night with a good book, which has energised me for the day ahead. 

 

So there you have it, that’s a typical weekday. How does that compare to anyone else? Am I really weird? I feel a bit self-conscious now.

I grew up on instant, but ever since a friend introduced me to fresh ground, my morning jolt comes from a bean-to-cup machine. Breakfast is generally a one-handed affair: a banana, cereal bar, sometimes a smoothie or yoghurt drink. I get that down me whilst taking the dog for a walk, a short round-the-block job if it's wet or particularly cold, or a longer run around the park if it's dry.  If the latter, I take a crossword, sudoku, newspaper, magazine or novel to have something to focus on whilst the dog is running around the park.  These range from 10 to 45 minutes, depending on weather, how well I've slept, whether the dog will otherwise be having exercise, whatever else needs doing before work. Generally, this is not a time when I communicate with other people very much.

 

I aim to be home by 7:00AM. I put the kettle on for the wife's hot drink, make myself a second coffee and take both upstairs. Unless I've got a gripping chapter to finish, the coffee goes into the bathroom. I wake up my daughter and tell her to get ready for school.  I deposit the wife's instant coffee (don't ask) at the bedside. Casual clothes (generally shorts and a tank top, perhaps jeans in cooler weather) are hung or dumped for laundry.  Sometimes to music, I shower, shave if necessary, finish the coffee, clean my teeth, and free up the bathroom for the rest of the family while I get dressed in my bedroom.

 

By 8:00AM I am dressed for work. ""Smart"" trousers, a matching shirt, a tie if I am not going to be disassembling technology (I have previously been known to tighten up a computer casing with the end of my tie dangling inside). Very occasionally I will need a full 3 piece suit, such as for trips out of the office for special circumstances, but these are rare and often mean the whole day is changed around as I generally need to be on an early train for that sort of thing. So normally it's just the regular work clothes.  By this point, my daughter is generally dressed and doing her teeth, face and hair.
