I also work in wireless and mobility and I’m heavily trained in mobile device accessibility and work with a lot of clients who are visually impaired. 

In my firsthand and secondhand experience, it’s kind of 6 in one, half a dozen in the other. Most mobile devices have similar accessibility features like talkback/voiceover and other navigation assistance. Android through the included device settings and third party apps can actually do a little bit more. But I still prefer iPhone and a lot of the people I work with do as well because for a layman the functions are a lot more intuitive. I actually find the accessibility functions on the iPad to be the easiest to use and this is common feedback to me as well. 

I will say if you want to go the android route it’s gotta be Samsung. Other androids do not have the same depth of functionality and don’t work as well with the third party apps.

85,"So, I read the post, and it's nice to see that employment for people with disabilities is something people are passionate about, but the article doesn't really go much into the *causes* of disabled folks not having jobs. For the majority of the article, it gives the impression that either the disabled folks need training and classes to do a job, or that jobs need to be made for them. I think that's kinda missing a lot of the big issues facing folks with disabilities trying to earn a living.

One issue that faces me the most frequently is transportation, since I can't drive. Unless I live in a town with public transport, or have the ability to carpool, my only option is to walk. That limits me to opportunities that:
1. Are within walking Distance
2. Don't involve crossing a highway or other non-pedestrian-accessible street to get to, and
3. don't mind if I'm a little out of breath or sweaty from the walk, or muddy/damp from inclement weather.

Sure, opportunities for working at home are great, but the fact is that the barriers to the employment opportunities are not on the side of the worker, like this article seems to feel. The obstacles are on the side of the employer.

Setting aside transportation issues, there's issues of hiring rates. People with disabilities just don't get *hired.* Whether  the person making the decision is conscious of it or not, people are more likely to hire folks who share more in common with themselves. Part of it's instinct, but of course I've heard anecdotes of people being hesitant to hire the disabled because they feel there is somehow more liability involved, or that it will take more resources to train us, or whatever. For the record, that's descrimination, but that's why an employer doesn't usually have to *tell* you why they hired Joe McWorking-peepers over you. They just choose and wash their hands of you, and that's if you're applying for a job you can handle as well as anyone else. If you ask for a reasonable accommodation. your chances of getting hired drop even lower, because they don't want the *hassle* of it.

Then, of course, if you *do* get hired, disabled folks are less likely to get promoted over other candidates, so the cycle continues even if you do have a job.

And, of course, there's the whole black-hole-of-poverty that is Supplimental Security Income. You can bust your ass at a minimum wage job full-time, and only make marginally more than your SSI would give you, in some states. Not only that, but then you have to report your earnings every month so they don't get mad for giving you too much. Sure, SSI is supposed to let you earn up to twice the value of SSI before you lose it, but with work comes work expenses. Uniforms, transportation costs if you're stuck with Uber or Lyft as your only options, and then of course your earned income is taxable. If you earn enough, you might not be elegable for low-rent housing anymore so you're stuck finding one of the other place that's overcharging for rent. After all of this, it's possible to be working and not much better off than you were on SSI.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's great for folks to be able to work and feel valuable, but there's more work to support people with disabilities that needs to be done other than just Workforce Development classes, mock interviews, and resume' help. I don't know what those solutions look like, since I'm no expert, but holy crap does it suck being stuck in the meantime.

We're really attempting to dive deep and pick the brains of screen reader users to really get a sense of day-to-day use and in depth thoughts. Again really appreciate your support and thoughts as well as your time. Anything this will only lead to better accessibility for all who you screen readers.

89,"My biggest problem is navigating public transport. There is no consistency when it comes to the colour of texts anywhere, whether it be lit up scrolling text or static print. One minute I'll have a nice bright white that I can read on one bus or train, the next there will be a dull green or red. If there was consistency I could at least adjust, but being partially sighted it's very hard when I don't know what I'm looking for half the time. It would be good if the scrolling text did so in either consistent colour across a city/town, or cycled the colours with each loop. Keeping the damn things in the same place on buses, trams, and trains would help a lot too.

Secondly, there's the PA systems. They can be a god send. But it's a roll of the dice. They can either be nice and loud and clear and easily heard over the crowd. Or they can simply not work, be muffled, or turned down so low that they might as well not be there.

Finally the transport app on Google has this nifty feature that, when it's night time, it switches to dark mode. It's so lovely and easy to see. But during the day it changes to an impossible to see colour scheme. For whatever reason they won't allow me to choose to have it permanently in dark mode, so I cannot use this app during the day. 

Good luck with your thesis! I am just starting mine also (psychology). I'd be happy to speak with you further if you need more qualitative data :) (see that? See how smart I sound? Hehe)

99,"Hello! I am not blind, but I am disabled and my spouse is an immigrant from Ukraine. We live in the United States (Washington State specifically), and I can try to answer your questions!

1. IT specialists are definitely doing better than other jobs. IT is a good, growing field in general.

2. Traveling is... Not the best. US public transportation is awful and most people drive everywhere. 

If you're in a city, you can expect there to be major bus lines, but some areas will be outside the bus route. Every bus I've rode had a deployable wheelchair ramp and priority disabled seating. 

Cities often have textured panels by road crossings, but the textured pathways (with the bars instead of dots) are more rare. Talking street crossing warning signals are more common, but not all announce the street names. (Kinda depends on how nice the area is.)

Most homes have at least a few steps up to the doors. Many apartments are up stairs and such, elevators are sometimes available but often not. 

Trains are horrid. Pretty much only Amtrak and it is so terrible, I really can't say enough warnings. Very pricey too. 

3. Ecology is a bit of a broad word, but Washington State is very eco-friendly compared to other states. Littering is hugely looked down on. Tons of plants everywhere, but also a lot of rain which isn't the best for accessibility. 

4. Honestly don't know about Australia, but Washington State is literally called the Evergreen State because it is covered in lush forests. Tons of hiking trails, rock climbing, various outdoorsy stuff. Outdoor hobbies are very common.

5. I don't have many alternatives to compare it to, but I asked my spouse about this. He says disability rights are considerably better in the US compared to Ukraine. He said social security payouts are better in the US, we have more social awareness of disability, we have laws that protect disabled rights better than Ukraine, such as ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and employment discrimination protection. 

We also have government programs made to help disabled people find and keep jobs, which didn't exist at least when he lived there (before 2000) or if they did they were so corrupt they might as well not.

6. I asked my spouse this again because I thought his opinion would be better having experienced both. He says the US is much less corrupt by comparison, though that is a very low bar. He says it's literally impossible to be more corrupt than Ukraine. 

He says you see much less corruption in day to day life but politician corruption isn't the best-- but still better than Ukraine. There's at least some degree of accountability. 

In terms of security and crime he says there's definitely less crime in most places. He didn't have too much to say, just it's much better here than Ukraine for disabled people and abled people, even though it's not perfect. 

7. Obtaining citizenship in the US is pretty difficult. My spouse said from Ukraine it's not as bad as some other countries. If you are white that definitely helps too. 

8. I guess marriage or claiming assylum are shortcuts. Having family here helps in general. Usually you get permanent residence first, then after a few years it's easier to take the citizenship test. The test is quite easy if you have a Ukrainian public school education. A small bit of memorizing basic US history. 

9. Christianity is the dominant religion in most of the US. There's a decent amount of Orthodox Christian churches around Washington and Oregon, even in Russian language. 

10. My spouse says the US has more advanced medicine, but it's significantly more expensive and less available. But Ukraine when he was there had excellent basic medicine, but less available advanced treatment. (For example, many over the counter medicines in Ukraine are prescription only here.)

If you're disabled and low-income, government health insurance is available that will cover basically all health needs. But it can take a long time to get approved, and I'm not sure how that all works with residency vs citizenship. 

11. My spouse says there is way more people in the US who care, for example about disabled folks, but also way more assholes. It's a mixed bag of garbage, lol. 

This will change a lot depending on where in the US you live, because the US is HUGE. There is a lot of cultural variance in different regions. In Washington, people are more distant, it's harder to make friends and acquaintances, but once you do it's pretty easy to maintain contact with them. 

12. My spouse says differences in women are similar to people in general. It's really varied because it's not just a single culture. The US is much bigger than Ukraine so there's a lot more diversity. 

13. Compared to Ukraine, there are fewer smokers and fewer alcoholics. Neither are as bad an epedemic as Ukraine used to be, when my spouse lived there, and probably still is he said. 

Alcohol culture and bonding over alcohol still is prevalent. Heavy drinking is mostly young college students and middle aged rich men. Smoking tobacco is a bit more stigmatized in Washington specifically. But weed is also legal here and very popular and common.

110,"I have had both great and not so great experiences using Uber. However, most of my not so great experiences where the result of new drivers not familiar with my area, and not anything disability related. I utilize the contact driver feature every time I request a ride and let them know that I am a blind person using a guide dog, and if the driver is going to have a problem they canceled the ride before showing up. Saves me the hassle of dealing with that kind of stuff in the moment.

I usually disclose it fairly early in the interview because it allows me to 1.) be upfront about what I can see and do and 2.) spin it or walk it back as appropriate during the interview.

Not disclosing until you’re hired is an option, but it can backfire and mess up interviews, especially if your disability is visible in some way.

Mind you there were at least 20 other empty parking spots but both times the people literally just waited halfway in the spot  ready to run us over.   I don’t get it.  Clearly they SEE a dog in a vest with the word blind on it and they want us to be the ones to move out of the way?  One guy said it was easier for him to park his giant SUV in the spot I was in than to have to angle his car into another spot.   But still, it was just so ridiculously rude.

148,"Hi! Vision Rehabilitation Therapist grad student here (VRT focuses on teaching non-visual skills for independent living and Recreation for individuals with vision loss). There are tons of adaptive/accessible recreation and sport options available. In my area there is a group of rock climbers with vision loss at our local rock gym who compete.  There are runners with vision loss who compete in marathons. You will have plenty of options for recreational activities over the course of your life. RP is progressive and although it's different for every person, largely begins with a loss of the ROD photoreceptors which are responsible for peripheral vision and night vision. You'll likely notice your peripheral vision declining before central vision (which is covered by Cone Photoreceptors which are responsible for detail vision and color contrast etc.). You may notice an increased sensitivity to glare and will likely experience more difficulty in settings with diminished illumination (aimable lamps with dimmers make good task lights that be helpful for workspaces).

149,"Thank you for your reply, we are aware of the readily available market of braille displays. Our project is more or less focused on making a portable as cheap as possible device that allows blind people to read any existing e-book on the go. 

Looking at current prices of braille displays, they are in the thousands and we don't see why that can't be within the range of less than 200 dollars for example. We have our own software developed to translate all text in e-books to actuated braille output and we will only take hardware costs in consideration, which aren't particularly expensive. So now that we have the technical details worked out, we still don't know much about the actual users themselves.

We would only like to know more about the target audience and their preferences/opinions to make sure that what we are doing will align with the interest of our users.",,,,MissAndRun,,,1553308665,t5_2qpec,t3_b4cg09,t1_ej5tyv3,1,1556508620,0,0,ej633wl,Blind,,,,,

I love surfing the Internet and her reading read it as I am now comfy in bed. Life goes on and you can adapt to it quite comfortably. I would say that more often people deal with mental health issues in the process of losing vision rather than dealing with The loss of the  vision itself.
It’s important that you learn how to use a white cane so you’re able to get around independently.
I can tell you this guaranteed, if you want to continue parenting and being an independent happy person you can definitely definitely do so, you will have to make some changes but if you try to adapt it is definitely possible
I have confidence in you, you will continue to be a great parent and an outgoing person.

There are some things I miss because of my vision. For example, I have a hard time distinguishing colors that have a low contrast ratio, so I’ll mistakenly think elements are the same color when they’re not.  I can usually inspect the colors in the mock-up, but sometimes I assume. 

A coworker looks over my work when I’m done, but the same applies for every other developer I work with. I sometimes find things that my colleagues miss. I guess I know what to look for from experience.

195,"As a sighted person with some experience (volunteering at blinds school) all I can say is you had a bad day that's it. You didn't get help as you expected initially and started getting frustrated is what you said, it's good that you're now aware of that. 
Then your friend also didn't help as good as you expected and it became a snowball effect. Then you lushed out to cashier who actually accepted their fault and promised better service next time. You could just say thank you at that point and that would be sorted. But it's still fair enough for me. I mean sometimes this happens, we take things somewhat personal or it is just not our day. In this case I think what helps the most is reminding yourself that you're a customer, you always have right to ask for help by law, and someone will absolutely help you asap. You can also always simply ask for manager, they would %100 help. So you had a bad day and that's fine, I wouldn't worry too much about that. If there will be a next time, (if that store ia convenient for you then there should be) just ask for help and then offer your appoligies for the last time.

205,"So I've been visually impaired due to LHON for 5ish years now and been using a cane since first losing vision and a guide dog for around 3ish years.
Yeah these kind of situations really do suck and you were totally justified to be irritated. It's unfortunate to be the target of someones sympathy on such a frequent basis. 
That said though, it never helps to get angry at a person for something like that. In my opinion, this is something I have to deal with for the rest of my life and it's going to happen just as long. I realize most people don't know anything about blind people and how the blind community feels about certain things, so they likely don't even think about how their comments may affect that person and likely has no malice behind it. I know that this didn't end in confrontation, but I think that leading by example and educating someone on why what they did/said might be hurtful or whatever is much more helpful than going off on someone or anything like that. The last thing I want to do if someone irritates me for having a negative perception of the blind community is to give them another negative view on the blind community. For example, if I'm ordering at a restaurant or something and the server asks whoever I'm with, ""What does he want to eat?"" or anything along those lines, I'll quickly and firmly interject and show that I can be talked to like a normal person. Same thing as when I am dealing with someone petting my guide dog, I try and take that opportunity (If I have the time) to explain that my guide dog is working right now so he can't be pet and explain furhter if need be. I realize this isn't always an option, but I've heard a number of stories about people encountering rude people with service animals and to me, that's the wrong way to handle that scenario.

273,"28 year old with RP here. I know this is scary and you have the right to feel that way. The worst case scenario of total blindness is definitely not a fun thing to think about. However, I think you can relax just a little bit. RP causes the most vision degradation in adolescence/young adulthood. If you’re 28 and you’re still playing sports and getting around ok you’re in very good shape. Also, RP is slow. I’m sure you’ve already noticed some changes (at least subtle ones) and as your vision continues to change you’ll gradually learn to make adjustments. It can be tough at times but just because you’ve been diagnosed doesn’t mean you’re gonna go blind overnight now. 

I was diagnosed 15 years ago. I still drive (only during the day) and still play some sports, hike, cook, and generally do all the same things I’ve always done. My peripheral vision sucks. I trip all the time and bump into people. I miss handshakes. I wouldn’t be able to go into most restaurants or crowded buildings without my partner. I can’t do much of anything at night without help. But overall other than those quirks I don’t let it bother me and try to just live my life like always while just being mindful of my limitations. 

I’m assuming your next appointment is with a specialist. When I was diagnosed I was scared as hell. I met with Dr Berson at Mass Eye &amp; Ear who was doing all kinds of research on RP treatment and at that point the best they really had was “take vitamin A it might help s bit.” These days, there’s SO MUCH to be optimistic about. In 5-10 years we could have readily available cures for RP that not only stop its progression but even reverse it! If you’re 28 and still dealing with minimal symptoms, it’s very possible (likely?) that you’ll never actually go blind. 

As someone else said, talk with the Drs. and get the kids checked if necessary. Take notes on everything the Drs tell you because there’s gonna be a lot of info that you’ll forget as soon as you leave your appointments. Other than that, just keep doing what you’re doing and try to keep your head up. You’re still the same as you were before the diagnosis and you still have a lot to be hopeful for.

The worst case scenario of total blindness is definitely not a fun thing to think about. However, I think you can relax just a little bit. RP causes the most vision degradation in adolescence/young adulthood. If you’re 28 and you’re still playing sports and getting around ok you’re in very good shape. Also, RP is slow. I’m sure you’ve already noticed some changes (at least subtle ones) and as your vision continues to change you’ll gradually learn to make adjustments. It can be tough at times but just because you’ve been diagnosed doesn’t mean you’re gonna go blind overnight now. 

I was diagnosed 15 years ago. I still drive (only during the day) and still play some sports, hike, cook, and generally do all the same things I’ve always done. My peripheral vision sucks. I trip all the time and bump into people. I miss handshakes. I wouldn’t be able to go into most restaurants or crowded buildings without my partner. I can’t do much of anything at night without help. But overall other than those quirks I don’t let it bother me and try to just live my life like always while just being mindful of my limitations. 

I’m assuming your next appointment is with a specialist. When I was diagnosed I was scared as hell. I met with <PERSON> at Mass Eye &amp; Ear who was doing all kinds of research on RP treatment and at that point the best they really had was “take vitamin A it might help s bit.” These days, there’s SO MUCH to be optimistic about. In 5-10 years we could have readily available cures for RP that not only stop its progression but even reverse it! If you’re 28 and still dealing with minimal symptoms, it’s very possible (likely?) that you’ll never actually go blind. 

As someone else said, talk with the Drs. and get the kids checked if necessary. Take notes on everything the <PERSON> tell you because there’s gonna be a lot of info that you’ll forget as soon as you leave your appointments. Other than that, just keep doing what you’re doing and try to keep your head up. You’re still the same as you were before the diagnosis and you still have a lot to be hopeful for. You’ll know when it’s time to make lifestyle changes and it sounds like you have a good support system to help when (if?) that time comes.

277,"I'm fairly bias towards blind cricket because I think it's the best blind sport, because relatively little modification is done to make the sport accessible. In South Australia's case, we play regular sighted clubs in our domestic competition. The only handicap they are given is that they designate three players that can catch, which can be changed at the full of a wicket. Very occassionally sighted teams will try out blackout glasses, but not usually. This scheduling has a couple of bonuses. First, it sharpens our fielding skills because sighted plays have greater ability to hit and place the ball. Secondly, it raises awareness of our game with the wider community and generates support - for example we're provided a ground to play on without cost, and we have received donations from clubs we've built relationships with.

It's a combination of things. The first barrier is the lack of knowledge. But then not everyone is interested in becoming involved with sport too, although the community aspect and the shared experience of disability is an aspect that regular clubs don't have. Finally, there's the sports available. Like I said, I'm biased. I like regular team sports, but I also want those team sports to be accessible without things like blindfolding etc. I'm not fond of athletics (don't get me wrong, I like running, but I don't see the appeal of competitive athletics), and I have no interest in made up games (I'm looking at you, goal ball).

They are definitely apprehensive about the possibility that they may have to dish out criticism.

They are just avoiding being upfront about this. The thing is, sighted people make mistakes too and have strengths/weaknesses all the same. 

Here's my advice going forward:

I tell my student all the time to be honest about their reality with people and to make it known what you can both do AND have trouble doing. ""Yes, I am visually impaired, but these are my strengths. I do however have issues with these things, so I do it this way instead."" Educate others.

You are going to be confronted by this throughout your life. Practice advocating for yourself. Being upfront and honest may break the tension and allow them to communicate more honestly with you.

I use Narrator on my PC and NVDA that was free. I don't have any other screen reader. I make things larger up to 25 font and use CTRL plus to make print larger per page.

I use Android because when I got my first Smart Phone my daughter trained me on her old Android to learn and then I got my own.

It is a slow go as I get older to remember all the things that I need to learn new, but I have help from my 4 technically superior adult kids, even the grandkids help.

323,"Hey, I’m from Australia! I’m multiply disabled, including legally blind, so I can definitely give a fair bit of input on the state of our disability stuff.

1. IT specialists are something a lot of employers need; I’m not sure how the demand is, but I doubt it’d be hard to find someone who needs your skills.

2. We have pretty decent public transport systems in Melbourne / Victoria, and I think in Sydney / New South Whales, but I’m not too sure about how good any in other states. Here in Melbourne, we have public transport supports specifically for disabled folx, particularly those of us who are blind / have low vision—including free travel!! You’ll just have to submit an application for the card with some stuff filled out by your doctor and then they’ll send you a card for free travel. There’s also tactile stuff pretty much everywhere on the transport network, except for some things like Myki machines (which you don’t need to use if you get the travel card), and a lot of bus buttons, which is frustrating.
I don’t travel by car all that often, but when I do (usually via Uber or taxi as I’m a wheelchair user), it’s generally pretty good and doesn’t take too long—the exception is when driving across town during certain times (peak hour, usually 7-9AM and 4-7PM) or days, which will land you in traffic for several hours.

3. I’m not sure what you mean by this, but if you mean our attitudes toward the environment, most of the people (particularly my generation and younger) are hell bent on getting pollution dealt with, and littering is very much frowned upon.
Cities here are often made up of your typical urban city, skyscrapers, heavy foot traffic, public transport, etc. in the centre, and then the further out you get, the less urban it gets, and there’s lots of greenery in most places, particularly suburban areas. It gets pretty hot in summer, and winter can get fairly cold (comparatively, at least), but overall it’s pretty manageable.

4. Contrary to popular belief, yes! There’s a lot of forests in Australia—we’re not all desert! I’ve been to a lot of the forests here and they’re all super diverse—great camping spots too!
A lot of them have heavy protections in place these days as well, so they’re pretty safe and nice to be around.

5. Conditions here are honestly pretty good; I have a lot more issues than most because I’m also a wheelchair user and also Deaf, so a lot of accessibility is just not designed for me. That being said, we have a lot of supports, and generally blind folx can be really independent, especially in the cities.
We also have this thing called the NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) for I think permanent residents and citizens, which once you’re on, you get funding for the supports you need. For life.

6. Crime isn’t great, but it isn’t the worst thing in the world either; we have it pretty good here. There is a lot of issues with people trying to “help” disabled folx, especially blind / VI people and wheelchair users, but it’s usually not coming from a place of malice.

7. If you have a job lined up already with an employer, it’s a lot easier to immigrate here. It’s not impossible otherwise, it can just be frustrating—there’s a lot of info on immigrating on our government websites, so it’s worth it to check it out.

8. There’s immigration through an employer (sponsorship), through marriage, and a couple of other ways; I don’t remember them anymore because they weren’t relevant to me, since my partner was going to be coming here on a marriage visa.

9. Christianity is the biggest religion here, but most people don’t particularly care anymore, except when they’re being bigots. Religious diversity is pretty common here, though antisemitism and Islamophobia are issues that’re pretty common, sadly—hence someone egged a senator last week.

10. Medicine is pretty good; things are usually pretty cheap, and we have initiatives in place to make things cheaper for some stuff. Hospitals are usually pretty good, as are most doctors provided you’re not young and chronically ill, then they can be a shitshow.

11. It’s pretty diverse, honestly; we have a lot of bigots, a lot of bible thumpers, and I’ve met quite a few eugenicists, but most of the people here are pretty good so long as you’re not LGBTQIA+, on government income, or “the bitter cripple” like I am. It mostly depends on your circles.
You’ll definitely get a lot of questions from strangers about how you do x, y, or z when blind though.

12. I’m not sure what exactly you want to know; women are cool, I guess? I’m gay, so I’d say I know a fair bit about girls haha
Misogyny is a prevalent thing here, but most non-men (including women) fight against it, and many men as well. Things are getting better with the treatment of women and giving them a voice.

13. Smoking and alcohol aren’t so much hugely promoted (except with sports) though alcohol is still advertised, but they’re certainly something that most people do; I’m personally an occasional smoker and a social drinker, which is pretty common. We have anti-smoking campaigns pretty much everywhere, including plain packaging on tobacco products, and safe alcohol consumption stuff most places.
I’m pretty sure smoking is being banned where I am in public areas soon, but I’m not 100% sure about that.

14. Non-white immigrants get a lot of shit; if you’re not white or you can’t pass as white, you’ll be looked down on a lot more. Australia is a pretty damn racist country—things are better than they could be, but they’re not great. We’re fighting for a better place though.

327,"So I’m not blind yet, I’m severely visually impaired but have been losing my sight for two years now and know that in a few months/years I will be blind, so I wanted to share some stuff I learned along the way:

- Become part of the community. I can’t stress this enough. Find other VI folk so your idea of blindness changes. My blind friends are the only thing that kept me sane through out this journey. I know that I will be okay because they are too. 
- Don’t just start using an aid when you strictly need to. Just because you CAN walk without a cane for example doesn’t mean it’s safe, and just because you CAN still read something without zooming in doesn’t mean you’re not making your life real hard. Aids are there to help, use them!
- get in contact with your local blind institution. They’ll be able to provide you with orientation and mobility training and all kind of help when needed.
- being blind is not a death sentence. Life will go on. 
- canes are great. Use them. 
- your fingers are your new best friends. So be careful not to cut or burn them, this will suck when you use braille. 
- be honest with yourself. If something you’re doing isn’t safe, stop doing it. 
- sometimes you’ll need a little tough love. Find people who will give it to you. 
- there is more technology available than you might think. Screen readers, braille displays, sensors for obstacle detection. All great stuff!
- find hobby’s that you don’t need your sight for. I started playing goal ball, and take braille lessons (which kind of counts as a hobby, right?)

My favorite games used to be competitive online shooters but I can't play those anymore because I don't have the vision for them however there are new games that I found that I can play. 

It all depends on the amount of vision your brother has but if he has similar to my vision, then I would recommend strategy games, turn based, offline single playerRPG's and if has really low vision or near blind, fighting games are absolutely the only game that blind people do not have a noticeable disadvantage to playing. I've played head to head online fighting games, I've played against totally blind people who've kicked my ass in them, and who have beaten sighted people easily. 

The struggle is real though and as trivial as it seems it can get to you not being able to play video games you used to enjoy or doing hobbies you used to do.

By the way, it might not be exactly what your interested in, but you should check out the SIBIAC NVDA add on.

That might seem like a very nitch need, but it can make a huge difference to the people who use it. I have gotten into it recently so that I can use Melodyne, which is the industry-standard pitch editing tool , used in most vocal music productions. It would be 100 percent inaccessible if not for SIBIAC  and the one guy who is responsible for it. It's really amazing to me that he has taken the time to single-handedly make such a powerful tool, just out of the coolness of his heart. It uses OCR to map out an interface and provide access to it. Over all, apps often provide much more accessibility issues for us then the web does. If a website follows basic guidelines it normally works well for us; and even if it does not we can often get by fine. However, there are countless apps out there that are 100 percent inaccessible to us, no matter what we do.

&gt;How does your low vision impact your reading? 

I can't see anything from my right eye, so my reading is really slow. If I read a couple minutes my eyes get strained.

&gt;What size text roughly do you need? 

I read the text font size of between 13 and up.

&gt;Do you need stuff like contrast enhancement as well? 

No, I only need larger text.

&gt;Do you read any audiobooks or listen to books with text to speech currently? 

I have couple books in my audible account that I often listen to, but I do not buy anymore of them because audible is expensive. Yes, I use voiceOver and JAWS, I am not familior with NVDA.

So before you even start you’ve got a big thing on your hands.
I have a decent range of vision but often get excluded because “health and safety” which is utter bull crap.
You need to have a chat with the visually impaired person (if it’s a case of getting them to try a sport- maybe give them an email or a phone number so they can let you know of any needs etc.)

Maybe this is a bad example, but let’s say you’re about getting something from the kitchen.

I used to work at Best Buy and assisted someone through the store who was using a cane. They were walking about half the speed that I normally do.  I was quite surprised. Now this was probably because they haven’t been to the store before or maybe they were just being extra cautious, or maybe they’re just naturally a slow walker. I’m not sure.

Blind people have - predictably - very poor depth perception, and holding one's hand or finger above a touchscreen prior to selection is welcoming errant selection.

To begin with, I am in Australia and things are a little different than in the US or Canada. That said, there are common elements that are applicable everywhere. I’ll split my comments between involvement as a participant and involvement as a spectator.

**Involvement as a Participant**

I’ve always loved cricket and knew about blind cricket from my grandfather being involved with my state’s blind cricket club before his retirement. I only became involve three years ago however because until about then the club trained and played out the north side of town when I lived in the south. It was also only a chance encounter that alerted me to the change in location.

From my experience there are two main barriers to participating in an accessible sport:

\* Location

\* Knowledge of the sport

Training and playing facilities need to be easily accessed by public transport, and ideally centrally located (unless your city can support multiple teams). Unlike able bodied players who will trek all over the city to play games, blind and vision impaired (VI) people don’t have the option – or the money – to move around so freely.

It’s also the case that a lot of blind and VI people don’t know the options that are available. This is particularly true for people who are VI and may have had little or no interaction with blindness services or wider blind community. There are several players that have become involved only because chance encounters (myself included). So its critically important that blind accessible sports promote themselves, both through blindness organisations but also in social media in general, spreading the word about their sport. Other activities involve fundraising BBQs (this might be an Australia specific thing), and building relations with sighted clubs.

**Involvement as Spectator**

When it comes to involvement as a spectator it all comes down to commentary. 

For example, cricket commentators on the tV more or less talk rubbish the whole time with a little bit of description of what’s going on. On the radio however, they provide great description of all aspects of the game as it unfolds – that includes field placement, ball bowled, shot and placement, action in the field, and regular score updates. My understanding is blind people who attend live sport will either have commentary on the radio with them, or have a sighted friend or partner that will commentate the game for them. So, in short: good verbal description of what is happening.

Other than that, to participate in live spectating venues should be accessible just as any other building needs to be.

556,"I have both Alexa and Google Home in both rooms of my apartment. I also use Windows, Mac and iOS every day with a screenreader that reads at several hundred words a minute, and consider myself to be pretty efficient on all three. I bought and use the voice assistants for the same reason sighted people use them, minus the smart lights. They're convenient when I'm not at the computer or want to do something specific like checking the weather, setting a timer or playing music. I find myself frustrated regularly because they're not good at looking up information, even on things like books and music which both Google and Amazon sell. However, I could avoid this frustration by googling it like any other person, and that's a usability problem that affects everyone. It It is nice to have popular devices that work out of the box without any adaptations; their interface is designed so you don't have to look at it, and that makes it work well for us. However, it's no better or worse for a blind person compared to a sighted person. That said, it is harder for blind people (especially older ones) to learn the interfaces of computers, as it requires an extra layer of interaction and is less intuitive compared to a sighted person's experience. I do contract technology training with blind people who need it, and I have found myself recommending these to a few people who have enjoyed using them instead of struggling with an iPhone or a computer for simple tasks.

In a perfect world, these voice assistants would let us navigate the web, compose long e-mails, and do other computing tasks with only our voice. I am certain amazon could do more to bring this to their Alexa assistant, and it would help blind people immensely—especially the ones who haven't been neck-deep in tech for their whole lives. There are things we should be able to do, like telling them to keep reading when they find a website with useful information. This is basic common sense, but it's still rarely possible. However, I honestly don't believe we have the AI to make a truly hands-free interface to the internet that is pleasant to use, much less one that is more efficient and reliable than using a computer with the current screen-readers like VoiceOver.  Google and Alexa both struggle to answer simple questions very often, and don't even get me started on Siri or I'll fill up the Reddit server with my unintelligible ranting.

I guess what I'm saying is that from where I'm standing, computers are going to be the best option for a while. AI is evolving scarily quickly and I'm sure neither Amazon nor Google have us in mind when they invent new features for their assistants, but the great part about these devices is the complete lack of need for them to keep us in mind. Almost everything a blind person could want is also something that would benefit sighted people just as much. I'm certain there are older and less technological sighted people who love their echos and their google homes for exactly the same reason my clients love theirs. If a voice-only interface continues to be the focus of both companies, it will continue to benefit everyone in almost exactly the same way. I have thought about how much nicer it might be to hear faster speech, but this is a feature I don't expect to see for two reasons. First, it's something sighted people are unlikely to care about beyond a small speed increase. Second, with these modern machine learning voices, speeding them up might affect their clarity and would take away from the personality aspect, which is something both Google and Amazon will want to push for business reasons. To be honest, I like the personality almost as much as the convenience. If I want a fast weather report, I'll pull out my phone or unlock my apple watch. Being able to lazily ask a question and hear a natural-sounding response is a big appeal.

Not everyone is going to have the same preferences or belief on how something should work. It's great that you're thinking about this; so many people don't.

I may get some disagreement, but I definitely think you should shift the focus to new content if that content is shown when the user clicks a button. Otherwise, it appears that nothing has happened and that's infinitely more confusing. If you have enough landmarks/headings and your page is well organized, the user will find their way back to where they need to be.

Edit: You could also pop up a dialog with information, if that seems appropriate. Usually focus gets shifted back to the original position after that closes.

Lastly, remember that there are lots of blind people who are not good at computers, just as there are lots of sighted people who are not good at them. THe difference is that computers were designed to kater to a demographic of billions of non-technical sighted people, so they have more of a chance of figuring out how to do something. It's not your job to make up for lack of screenreader knowledge any more than it is to build a small guide to computers into your site (unless that's what you're designing, of course). If someone can't accomplish something, it's not necessarily your fault. Web accessibility is a tricky business if you're making complex dynamic pages. I personally think NVDA is the best Windows screenreader that will work well if pages are coded according to standards, and will complain if they're not. JAWS tries too hard to make up for bad coding. I don't have enough information about Narrator yet; it would be nice if developers could just use it right out of the box.

I agree with most of what people have said, but would have to go with iOS still.

569,"There are so many facets to your post.  Let me do my best to address them one at a time.  
1. People are petting my dog without my permission: There are many ways to handle this.  You've only had your pup six weeks.  You have to experiment and find what works for you when telling people no. I'm a puppy raiser,  so it's different for me,  but I've found the most effective strategy for me is to either correct my dog for getting petted or to say,  'I'm sorry' as soon as the person tries to pet. That normally gives me enough time to explain why the dog can't be petted before they try to get petted again.  Some of my friends who are handlers have found that they have to literally yell at people.  I had a golden once where I had to start correcting her more harshly because she loved being petted so much and one pet would cause her to lunge for pets at the next ten people she saw.  I had to be more mean overall to people while I had her in order to protect her training.  
2. I don't like getting attention from people while out: Ut oh! This is an unfortunate result of working with a dog in public.  You are going to get some degree of attention regardless of what you do.  Once you find a message that works for you,  stick with it  and eventually word will get around town of how you want to be treated.  I view it as part of my job as puppy raiser to talk to people and educate them about working dogs,  so I listen to every story people tell me about how great their dogs are,  but that does not mean you have to.  When I don't have time to talk I've found a response of, ""I'm sorry.  I'd love to talk, but I'm really in a rush."" While turning away,  seems to help.  Make sure your body language matches the words coming out of your mouth.  If you don't want to talk, say you can't talk while walking away. 
3. How close to a guide dog school do you live? It sounds like there are a lot of puppy raisers in the area.  Remind them of the rules if they try to break them and be firm about the fact that your dog is YOUR dog and you get to make the decisions. 
4. People not giving you public access: Don't ask permission.  Don't show them your papers.  Stick to your guns.  If they ask you to leave and your dog is not misbehaving,  state that your dog is a guide dog and you have a right to have the dog in public.  Go about your business.  If they try to stop you,  invite them to call the police, but do not ask for permission or fight to have them agree with you.  If they have a problem  the cops can come and ask you to leave.  Go about your business otherwise.  Remember,  the harness transfers emotions both directions.  If you are stressed,  your dog will feel it. 
Your post sounds very much like growing pains. Remember, this is a new relationship.  Give yourself time.  You will find what works for you.  You don't owe the public a darn thing.  You live your best life and screw anyone who tries to make you do otherwise.

622,"Hi, some perspective on this. 
The visual cortex of your brain remains active despite not having visual input. Psychological studies show that the visual portions of the brain remain active in blind people. This probably has something to do with spacial awareness. Being blind myself, i can say that i navigate by making mental maps as i walk through places. I know where my coffee pot is in the kitchen without having to find it each time i go in there, for example. This is because of the visual portions of the brain remaining active, so it's not unusual that blind people without a brain injury that affects that portion of the brain dream vividly and in color. Even those who have been blind since birth make mental images based on what they feel. For example, imagine a dog or cat. Now in your mind circle around that cat and imagine it from the side. And the back. You can see the image of the cat from all angles even though its not in front of you. Similarly, anyone who has had a cat described to them or has touched one can do the same thing even not having seen it with eyes. The image you see in your mine may be different from the one in my mind, but it's still a cat. 

All of that to say that you don't need working eyes to see. 
I lost the last of my vision a couple of years ago, but i still see the world in vivid color and imagery. When people talk to me, i imagine them as cartoon characters and i can see their expressions. If i go outside and can't feel the sun on me, i know it's cloudy out and the sky is grey. I step on leaves in the fall and crunch through the yellow, red and brown leaves. I haven't lost anything. I just see it differently now. 
Dreams are the same, but with less of a cartoon aspect. 

You'll continue to dream that way as your sight diminishes. And you don't have to suffer, necessarily. It's all in how you see it. No pun intended. You're just adjusting to a new way of seeing. You will have a different perspective than most in your life and that can be very valuable. 

But that's just me looking through the rose colored glasses saying the view is pretty nice from this side of things. �� ",,,,Clavast,,,1553456331,t5_2qpec,t3_b4g6z8,t3_b4g6z8,1,1556580530,0,0,ejablwt,Blind,,,,,

631,"If you tell me the potential player count, I can narrow down my suggestions, but in any case here are things you can check out:

- **Pandemic** - For 2-4 players. Pandemic is a cooperative game where the players are playing against the game. You are scientist traveling the world trying to stop four deadly diseases from destroying the world's population. All of the information on the board is public (so no hidden hand of cards), so the sighted playeres can assist him whenever he needs a piece of information about something.

- **King of Tokyo** - For 2-6 players. This is a competitive, monster battling game. Each player chooses a monster and to win you either must eliminate all other monsters or gain 20 victory points. The game uses Yahtzee mechanics (you roll 6 dice up to three times) to choose your actions, which can be healing, attacking, etc. It also has cards that give power ups to your monsters. This game is also all public information, and the dice are quite large, but even if he can't see them, a sighted player can read the results to him.

- **High Society** - This is a small auction card game for 3-5 players. You are all rich aristocrats buying luxury items. The player with the most points wins, however there's a small catch. If you have the lowest amount of money when the game ends, you lose regardless of how many points you have. So, you need to try to get the items that give the most points, but also aim not to be the player with the least amount of money at the end. There is hidden information in this game. There are 11 different cards that represent your money, but they are easy to remember or you can easily add tactile markers like stickers to them. One technique I use is apply tape or stickers to the edges of the cards. For example, to mark the $1000 card,  you apply a sticker on the top left corner, for the $2000 card, sticker on the top right corner, for $3000, middle left, etc. 

- **Camel Up** - For 2-8 players. This is a betting game where the players bet on racing camels. It's a great family game and has very minimal hidden informationi (only 5 cards which can easily be memorized). I have blogged about this game on my site.

Almost everything.  I received training after going blind but never really adapted to living without vision due to insecurity.  I am one of those people who just thought the blind either had some kind of super powers or were totally helpless because the only contact I had with totally blind people before finding myself in that situation was with the father of one of my friends who is extremely independent and has almost unbelievable orientation skills.  One particular thing that bothers me is the discomfort that I feel about using computers beyond the basics.  I used to be a programmer with experience in 4 out of the 5 most widely used platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux, and iOS) but can't for the life of me find a way to continue to do it comfortably, and this is a huge source of unhappiness for me.

An iPhone, due to reasons completely unrelated to my vision.

&gt; Do you use Mac or PC?

I had a Mac when I went blind so I stuck with it for the first 3 years but ended up switching to a PC 2 years ago because I could no longer justify the price of a new Mac given my basic use of computers these days.

Almost everything.  I received training after going blind but never really adapted to living without vision due to insecurity.  I am one of those people who just thought the blind either had some kind of super powers or were totally helpless because the only contact I had with totally blind people before finding myself in that situation was with the father of one of my friends who is extremely independent and has almost unbelievable orientation skills.  One particular thing that bothers me is the discomfort that I feel about using computers beyond the basics.  I used to be a programmer with experience in 4 out of the 5 most widely used platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux, and iOS) but can't for the life of me find a way to continue to do it comfortably, and this is a huge source of unhappiness for me.

695,"&gt; Can I ask, if it's not because of your vision specifically, why do you use an Apple device? 

I already had an iPhone when I went blind, and I chose that platform specifically because of Apple's commitment to privacy, because as a programmer I preferred development in Objective-C over Java, because I was already into the Apple ecosystem so I would benefit from the integration, and because Android's animations were quite sluggish back then.

706,"I use braille for all these things that have been mentioned so far, but I never really enjoyed synthesized speech, and for a lot of the stuff that I read, audio book doesn't work out too well. Even for things where I could use audio, I find I wander off, but if I have the text it makes it a lot easier to read it quickly.

I learned to read when I was very small, and I like the freedom to read wherever I want without disturbing others. But I think the bigger win for braille is in writing. Sure reading is lovely and I'm an avid reader. I read braille quicker than I can get through speech, even for computers, because I've gotten good with my display, but I wouldn't think of programming, serious reading or writing, or mathematics, without braille.

 I think the push towards audio books and synthesized speech is really doing a lot of people a large disservice. Since I've returned to using the braille display, I have found a lot of things a lot less trouble. It's a lot fewer screen reading commands, as well as the other advantages. I wouldn't think of reading a 700 page logic book, or work of philosophy, or a thousand page novel with an audio book. However, the learning curve for reading and writing braille, like print, is steeper than for something passive like audio, but I think the ability to fully engage with the work you're reading or writing makes it well worth the trouble. Even when I do get a digital copy of something, I'll hook the braille display to the phone and read it. I am considering getting into some philosophy and writing, and probably back into programming as well, so I will insist on brailled things where I can get them. Hopefully things like epub 3 and MathML and MusicXML will help make more things readable on refreshable displays, and hopefully we can start to see larger and cheaper displays so that others can enjoy portable braille as well. As far as I'm concerned, anybody with any sort of difficulty reading visually would benefit from learning braille, and I'd encourage everyone to do it. Braille input is definitely easier than touch screens, but maybe that's just another artifact of me being a very touch sensitive person. I was born blind, so I have no knowledge of visual things, and maybe that has an impact as well. Like the other person, I have several card and board games here that are brailled, plus I live on the 12th floor of a 23 floor building, so I need the labels on the elevator panel, because all those buttons feel the same and make the same beep, so I'm screwed without the braille.

Martial arts communities have been some of the quickest to help out, which I found really surprising!

754,"I have Aira and the Horizon glasses. I actually have been using them as a safety net when going out and about, having them with me just in case I need help. Most of the time, I'm finding that I get the same help I generally need from people around me rather than futzing with the Aira system. Even so, when I use Aira it's always been helpful. I like the ability for the agents to switch between description and navigation, be fast on the draw with internet searches, menu reading, ordering, etc., and helping me find my Lyft if I have them order one for me on the go. I'm not a fan of having to carry around an additional phone and having the glasses wired to the phone for use, but that's out of the hands of the agents of course. I also find the interaction a little awkward when you are on a call but have to interact with people in front of you, such as being navigated to a shopping or food counter and going between the agent in the headset and talking with a cashier,  or disengaging from the agent and talking with a Lyft driver who is helping me to their car. That handoff is always a little awkward, so as long as the agents understand me suddenly dropping the call without thanking them for their help is part of the job, then it's all good. 

I'm also not a fan of how wide the view is for the agents with Horizon. This means that while they have a much wider view for navigation and obstacle avoidance, they have to take more pictures to read text when they help me shop, read a menu, mail, or signage. This slows down the interaction drastically and I'm always left to just seek out a customer service person to help shop since it's ultimately faster.  Good service overall, wish it wasn't so expensive, and I seem to have enough help around me for features others generally use it for so I don't have much a need for it until I'm in more unfamiliar places by myself.

755,"Generally, I make my way to the store and up to the Customer Service counter. I request shopping assistance, and have very mixed results with this.  A clerk gets a shopping cart and pulls it from the front while I hold on to the back bar, I tell them what I want, and we make our way around the store gathering items. They tell me the price, if things are on sale, ingredients and such, then help me through the cashier when done. Once everything is bagged, they help me out of the store and I make my way back home. 

The struggles come when the managers decide to pair me up with the lowliest worker on staff. They have given me clerks who can't understand basic English or didn't know their own store, so had to keep stranding me around each department while they ran to get a manager to help figure out what I was asking for. More than once I've walked out with a completely wrong item since they misunderstood and didn't not clearly communicate what they had put in the cart. I've brought this up multiple times with the store managers and even escalated to corporate. They've put some better processes in place, such as having a manager help me rather than a clerk to prevent mix-ups and problems. I had a guy bring me through the store and just leave me outright, totally forgetting what he was supposed to do and I had to figure my way back to the customer service center to complain and get more help. 

Technology like Aira has come out and I've tried using that also with mixed results. An agent looks through a video camera implanted on some glasses and you talk to them while they guide you around. When looking for a specific item, they have me stand back from the shelves and they snap a picture from the camera so they can look through it and zoom in to find what I'm looking for, then they guide and direct me to the correct item. It has sort of worked, but mostly it fails because my store has a parking lot above it, so cell reception for the device breaks down and fails more often than not when going deeper into the store. 

Ultimately, having helpers and store clerks that can clearly communicate with the blind shopper, not make mistakes and waste the blind shopper's time and money by grabbing incorrect items, know the store, and be familiarized with the ADA and how to assist people and have disability sensitivity training would all be perfectly ideal.

756,"VoiceOver is very well designed with a clean experience through its use and has features like auto-image description, braille screen input, and the functionality carries over to VoiceOver built into Macs. iPhones are hands-down the better option by far.

It will come down to personal preference, but ultimately the majority of blind users use iPhones and Apple products per the Webaim census. 

When building iPhone apps, all the elements that go into the interface are inherently accessible from the start and are constructed to work with VoiceOver. Adding this to custom controls is easy. The same cannot be said of Java and Android app development. Giving feedback to iOS Developers will generally get things fixed faster should they release an inaccessible app, whereas Android apps require a lot more work for the same kinds of fixes. Plus there are so many flavors of the Android operating system and the fact that Samsung has Voice Assistant as their own native Talkback variant that testing for new releases takes a lot longer, so any updates for accessibility take much longer to appear.

What if it rains? Someone bumps into me and my cane falls and shatters the electronics?  We are given a lot of in-depth training with Orientation and Mobility instructors who teach us to use all the rest of our senses to negotiate street crossings of every type. Feeling the building line opening up to emty space when approaching a corner; feeling for tactile mats and curb cuts; listening to parallel and cross-traffic; listening to beacons and fellow pedestrians; taking your time and being patient; self-advocating and asking for help. One more gadget to charge and break will generally be ignored by most of us. We won't be listening to the cane since we need our hearing for orientation and safety. Vibration on the cane can be misinterpreted as haptic feedback and could occur at just the wrong moment, making a user miss a critical elevation change since they are confused by the feedback, then rolling an ankle, toppling into the street, and getting hurt. Plus look into exactly how we already get around, using bone-induction headsets and navigation apps with walking directions when going to an unfamiliar location, using tactile maps, many more resources out there for more efficient navigation.

761,"A lot of your questions are horribly vague and would be better served by gleaning an overall understanding of WCAG standards. The overall web experience will be good when you surf sites that focus on accessibility, and horrible when you run into sites that have no idea about or outright ignore the standards. And personally, I'd rather the focus and research go into how to force all sites and devs to follow the standdars, since audio gui^guidance won't ultimately help at all if the sites we try to navigate are inherently inaccessible. If someone uses semantics all wrong that will ultimately hinder any hooks you are using and identifying to create your sounds, further confusing the experience. Try navigating a site using mobile Safari on an iPhone and then surf the same site using Samsung Voice Assistant. All the extra sounds from Samsung are super aggravating, so personally I wouldn't use additional earcons for navigation.

I have chronic pain, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, hormone issues and have depression to boot.  I can only walk for about a minute or less before being in too much pain to go any further.  I get tired very easily, can't cope in hot or noisy surroundings.  My brain doesn't process sensory input properly, which makes it hard to understand what people are saying sometimes.  Any small thing like a kid crying or someone even moving around can irritate me and I can get overwhelmed. Other things like tight clothes, particular textures like the stuffing you find in stuffed animals or anything slimy makes me recoil the source of the feeling. Look up Sensory Processing Disorder if you're curious. 
I've probably missed some things.  
in typical me fashion I posted this question the other day and then realised I wasn't in the right headspace to actually write anything down.

VoiceOver users seem to have to learn more *""words""* than standard UI users. The latter just swipe and tap, the former have one finger swiping, two finger swiping and tapping, three finger swiping , three finger double / triple and quadruple tapping, probably more I can't remember.

864,"Where I live, the drivers will often seriously lower the volume or even turn off the audio announcements because many riders find it annoying.

Partly this is because the GPS is overly verbose (announcing the street it's on as the bus turns rather than just upcoming stops) but it also runs on the same system as the PA so they have to talk over it, and it's just way too loud even for me when there are not many passengers and we're on quieter roads.

So an automated system that keeps the announcements at an audible level dependant on the current background sound, as long as it doesn't change levels so rapidly that it occurs during the speech, could be helpful to both blind and sighted passengers alike.

Also, it's often possible to make corrections to bad pronunciation by the computerized voice by spelling things a bit differently, so if the streets are said wrong and you can fix that, it'd be useful.

Along the same lines, making it so that updates and corrections can be pushed to the units remotely or at least easily flashed by physical means without having to partially uninstall them first would make updates more prompt, such as when street names change or stops come and go.

It's understandable if you feel self-conscious about doing so.

I feel like this is a good backup (or even a first go-to if you are one day in too much of a hurry to wait for the clerk), but you probably know better. Good luck!

And then came this popup I'd added and it frustrated me. It wasn't just a slight irritation either; like, NVDA initiated a complete context switch on me and went on reading at full speed from this popup. I lost interest in everything I was doing before -- and that's a problem.

1010,"I’m visually impaired, and I ride buses frequently. I’m in the San Francisco Bay area.
As others have mentioned, simply finding where the bus stop is this still a big problem for me when I go to places I haven’t been before. They can be surprisingly obscure such as only consisting of a sign which has a tree next to it, or in the case where Google maps tells me a street intersection, but the stop is actually down the block and closer to a different intersection.
And then there are the drivers. Many of them don’t stop at every stop, and will only stop if you wave your arms at them. But I can only read the number on the bus when the bus is about 15 feet away, so this is extremely tricky and requires an immense amount of concentration. The need to concentrate can go on for 15 minutes if the bus is late and I want to make sure not to miss it when it finally comes. The drivers often reprimand me for waving at them too late, which makes them have to brake harder. Then I tell them that I am visually impaired and can barely read the number, and they didn’t stop.
What am I supposed to do? Make myself easily identifiable as someone who can’t read the number by holding a cane? But I don’t need a cane for anything else.
 What also complicates the situation is that I sometimes have my bike with me, and nobody believes that a visually impaired person can both not be able to read and be able to safely ride a bike around, even though I’ve been doing this for several years.
Sometimes there is major street construction, and the bus stop has been temporarily moved down the street, but the Transit apps usually don’t say this, and there is no way for me to find the new stop other than wandering around the street until I somehow find it.
Once I’m on the bus, are usually listen to podcasts or use VoiceOver to read something. Most of the buses still use diesel engines, which are loud, so I try to sit as close to the front of the bus as possible so I can hear the sound in my headphones better. I can not wait for electric buses that don’t cause this problem. Some of the buses in San Francisco are electric with suspended cables over the streets, and they are great. 
Some buses will only stop at certain stops if you press a button or pull a cord somewhere on the bus. This varies from bus to bus, and some of the buses require you to press a small square button up on the ceiling, which is hard for me to find especially in the dark.

I’m in the <LOCATION> area.
As others have mentioned, simply finding where the bus stop is this still a big problem for me when I go to places I haven’t been before. They can be surprisingly obscure such as only consisting of a sign which has a tree next to it, or in the case where Google maps tells me a street intersection, but the stop is actually down the block and closer to a different intersection.
And then there are the drivers. Many of them don’t stop at every stop, and will only stop if you wave your arms at them. But I can only read the number on the bus when the bus is about 15 feet away, so this is extremely tricky and requires an immense amount of concentration. The need to concentrate can go on for 15 minutes if the bus is late and I want to make sure not to miss it when it finally comes. The drivers often reprimand me for waving at them too late, which makes them have to brake harder. Then I tell them that I am visually impaired and can barely read the number, and they didn’t stop.
What am I supposed to do? Make myself easily identifiable as someone who can’t read the number by holding a cane? But I don’t need a cane for anything else.
 What also complicates the situation is that I sometimes have my bike with me, and nobody believes that a visually impaired person can both not be able to read and be able to safely ride a bike around, even though I’ve been doing this for several years.
Sometimes there is major street construction, and the bus stop has been temporarily moved down the street, but the Transit apps usually don’t say this, and there is no way for me to find the new stop other than wandering around the street until I somehow find it.
Once I’m on the bus, are usually listen to podcasts or use VoiceOver to read something. Most of the buses still use diesel engines, which are loud, so I try to sit as close to the front of the bus as possible so I can hear the sound in my headphones better. I can not wait for electric buses that don’t cause this problem. Some of the buses in <LOCATION> are electric with suspended cables over the streets, and they are great. 
Some buses will only stop at certain stops if you press a button or pull a cord somewhere on the bus. This varies from bus to bus, and some of the buses require you to press a small square button up on the ceiling, which is hard for me to find especially in the dark.

A lot of reviews on the super cheap generic canes tend to mention issues with the sections shaking, the elastic being loose or not durable, the cane breaking down, as well as the tips either being non-replaceable or hard to find a correct replacement tip. The one you linked even says it uses a rubber tip, which sounds awful for a white cane! 

Also, the cane you linked is 125cm. Unless you are very short, or only planning to use it as an ID cane (not for any surface contact or curb and step finding) this might not be the right cane length for you. 

I would personally avoid them. If you can't afford a cane from a reputable company (such as ambutech, which is available for around £25-35 through RNIB's shop) try asking local organizations that work with blind people about funding sources for canes where you live. 

You can also sometimes find decent, barely-used canes secondhand through sources like ebay, local resale, blindness organizations and friends. ",,,,-shacklebolt-,,,1552933702,t5_2qpec,t3_b2lmeu,t3_b2lmeu,2,1556297007,0,0,eitipfm,Blind,,,,,

1075,"well I started out learning to ski first when I was about 9 and already considered legally blind. I would say learning to ski first is much easier than learning to snowboard first. on skis for the first time you at least feel like you have some control. the first time on a snowboard it feels like there is no way to control it. this is because in order to control your snowboard (carving and stopping) you need a little bit of speed. With snowboarding, your back foot is how you turn, distributing your weight to your front side or back side edge depending which way you are turning. also when i learned to ski I learned with a guide. someone following behind me yelling out ""right..... TURN!!!.... left..... TURN!!!! Luckily, I still have enough site to snowboard without  a guide, but if it’s a new run I am going down I first make sure I go nice and slowish to get to know the run before I pick up the speed. I really wish I had a girlfriend to go snowboarding with! Lol. I can’t drive myself to a resort or anywhere else either though. Hope this gave you at least a basic answer. Feel free to ask more if needed.

oh also if I could add. I don't know if your boyfriend has always been blind? or has any experience with skateboarding? but I was skateboarding before i was snowboarding so that could first give an idea of how it feels because your body positioning is going to be pretty much the same, and you don't need a lot of speed on a skateboard in order to feel that. just a thought.",,,,Scarecrow4980,,,1553048560,t5_2qpec,t3_b33gh9,t1_eixecyx,1,1556363645,0,0,eixhhmc,Blind,,,,,

I have enough vision to see other riders on the run as long as they are not wearing white!  you never know what skill level other riders may be at either. so they could lose control and fall at anytime. or sometimes there are even people just standing in the middle of the run not even moving. that drives me nuts. I broke my nose because of that. there were some woop dee doos on a hile and there was someone standing on the other side of one so he couldn't really be seen until I was over the top of the little hill and i Had a lot of speed. once i saw him it was too late and i nailed him.

1085,"Hey, hello there. 23 y/o with RP, severely disabled. 

RP is not a death sentence, so you do not need to quit your job and sports (although spending more time with the family is always a good thing). I'd actually recommend that you enjoy your life at the fullest from now on, making the most of your job and hobbies since you may be unable to do some of those in some time.

RP usually starts out finishing your night vision (ability to see in dark and dim-lighted places), then it goes for the peripheral vision (when it's done you can only see a small point in front of you, like seeing the world through a drinking straw), then it goes for your central vision (color vision, acuity, light perception).

RP progresses differently for each person. I was diagnosed at 7 (I had already lost all night vision and most of my peripheral vision) and it was stagnant for 15 years until it started to progress real fast last year. Some people keep their eyesight mostly untouched throughout their lives, some lose their vision within a few months, with only light perception remaining.

My advice is: begin adapting right now. Do not wait until you are unable to read or to move freely to begin cane training and learning to use screen readers. Adapt your house. Most important, enjoy your hobbies, you might not be able to enjoy them for much longer. If you don't really like your job it is the perfect time for changing. If you do, prepare to adapt your tasks to progressive sight loss.

It is not a death sentence, but you'll need to change yourself and your life. I wish you good luck.",,,,cookieinaloop,,,1552843135,t5_2qpec,t3_b06ojg,t3_b06ojg,3,1556169843,0,0,eiqqzk6,Blind,,,,,

I can't remember how it was to see things more normally, not even in my dreams. I wonder if I'll forget how I see today when my vision gets even worse, even in my dreams.

The non-visual aspects of my dreams are way more present and relevant than they are in other people's dreams. For instance, I've had a nightmare once in which I fell face down in a sewer, and I felt the greasy slime under my nails and the smell of it in my nostrils. I woke up nauseated. The nightmares with lots of tactile and olfactory and audible feelings are always the most disturbing, the fear and/or disgust of them lasts longer when I wake up.",,,,cookieinaloop,,,1553385283,t5_2qpec,t3_b4g6z8,t3_b4g6z8,1,1556547307,0,0,ej8devg,Blind,,,,,

The downside, was that you only had one store they served, and you couldn't compare for bargains plus you had to tip.  And a tip on a $200 grocery bill is substantial.

&amp;#x200B;

You're basically asking about how you can live a life that feels meaningful.  Where is the meaning?  Is it in ""enjoying time"" or working your farm business?  How should you spend your time and life?

&amp;#x200B;

And it's also a question of stress management, which I completely get.  Boy, do I get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are some questions for you to think about.  I think they'll help you find some answers.

&amp;#x200B;

1)  What could I be doing in the future that be exciting, meaningful, pay the bills, and also be done with limited or no vision?  And you need to assume that it's okay to need to re-skill for whatever you decide.  You have time to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge in this question is that you probably don't know what your options are, so this is an invitation to explore options, be curious, and also be relentless about finding something you'll enjoy doing.

&amp;#x200B;

It's an interesting thing that when you're ""All In,"" you automatically start finding solutions to something.  So, for example, if you were to decide that you love owning your farm business and no one was going to stop you from running it even with little/no vision, then you automatically start thinking of ways to make this possible... because you want to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you need to hire workers?  Do you need to scan invoices?  Whatever it is, it will be solvable.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need to hire workers and there's no money for that now, how can you build a revenue stream that will make that possible?  For example, could you rent pasture/barn space to people looking to board and exercise horses?

&amp;#x200B;

2) What would you love to see and do now?  How would you like to bring joy to your life?

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge with this question is that extreme stress can make it difficult to access ""imagined joy.""  I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

So keep coming back to this question when you feel moments of hope, okay?

&amp;#x200B;

3) What can you do to minimize the stress of losing your vision and make the journey and days manageable and even enjoyable?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I moved to a location that has bus access, and I can walk to a grocery store.  I'm re-skilling for a job I'll love.  I'm focused on making friends so I have some community.  And I'm resolving multiple health issues and ptsd, so that my body and stress can ramp down.

1108,"Hi, u/sunny_monday, I totally get your frustration, and you're in the right place.

&amp;#x200B;

Try finding a doctor/clinic that specializes in Low Vision.  In addition, you may need to consult both an ophthalmologist and an optometrist, as all all 3 (low vision, ophthalmologist, and optometrist) have things they're especially good at (some things overlap, some things don't).    


Helpful Hint: you want to find doctors/clinics that are using cutting edge technology. There are a lot of folks out there using really outdated equipment when there's new cool technology that's available, that makes getting your prescription right (for example) much easier.    


I don't know if your blurry vision is something that can be helped (for example through a prescription for macular edema,  through a reduction in glare or an increase in contrast or adding more light... there's a lot to consider) or not (at that point, you'll want to look into adaptive technology and aides, even color filter lenses).  


But what you can do is give yourself the best chance of improving your acuity, by seeing all three specialists, if possible.    


At one point my ophthalmologist couldn't get me back to 20/20 vision with a prescription.  I went to an RP specialist who had a lot of tricks, and he figured out how to do it.  (That was quite a few years back!)  I've also had times when optometrists gave me better prescriptions.  But if you're dealing with something in the eye causing the blurry vision (even allergies), an ophthalmologist is the way to go.  


Also, if you haven't already, make sure to talk to your pharmacist about any prescriptions you're taking.  Some can certainly mess with your vision.",,,,SpikeTheCookie,,,1554004850,t5_2qpec,t3_b7igo2,t3_b7igo2,2,1557167221,0,0,ejs92jh,Blind,,,,,

I can't help you with the braille reader, but I do have two ideas about coding.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Learn a language that has accessibility built in and is meant to be used by screen readers. [LINK](https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-are-some-examples-accessible-programming-languages)

&amp;#x200B;

2) Learn coding about the techniques and toold  other blind coders use to  make coding easier when using speech-to-test. [LINK](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-blind-people-code-fdb64e3bf5c) [LINK TO GREAT DISCUSSION WITH 25 IN-DEPTH POSTS BY BLIND CODERS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/118984/how-can-you-program-if-youre-blind).

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's likely that you're hitting up against a lot of tools and situations that just aren't accessible.  So you can use the experience of others to figure out what really works for things like unexpected problems.

Good luck to you!

I'm legally blind with diminishing vision and have previously done coding.  The challenge is the way sighted coders scan code and can see context as they code (or as they review code, hunting for the section they want to change).

Here is my take.

\#1 He has no one to talk about work with, people you both know, what's going on. This was a big part of his life, and he might actually enjoy catching up.  


\#2  He's going to be worried about how to provide for his family moving forward.  One thing you can do is offer to write a letter of recommendation for him, highlighting his skills, behaviors, and traits (like integrity).  Many of these will be valid across jobs, no matter what he decides to do in the future.

1126,"Hi there! Legally blind, from Canada. I will answer your questions in full sentences in the order you posed them. 

1. IT work is in moderate demand. With experience, an IT specialist should have no problem findong a job. 
2. Travelling from city to city is best done by plane, as we don't have a long-distance public transit system like a train or bus company. Most cities have good public bus systems within them though, Vancouver has a sky train. 
3. Canada is huge and diverse, from deserts to temperate rainforests. Our mountain ranges are huge and there's a wealth of animals. 
4. Forests are the most common terrain in my home, British Columbia. You won't encounter as many forests in prairie provinces like Saskatchewan. 
5. To be considered disabled by vision your acuity must be 20/200 with best correction or worse. Alternatively, your field of view could be twenty degrees or less. Disability often includes tax benfits and financial supplements. 
6. Canada is a fairly safe country. Compared to many countries, there's little corruption. It is safe to walk at night in most places.  
7. It is moderately difficult to become a Canadian citizen. 
8. I believe immigration to Canada is fairly easy, we offer both work and study permits. Citizenship can be obtained after a certain number of years of permanent residence. 
9. Christianity is common and seen as a positive thing, for the most part. Kindness and acceptance go both ways in Canada. 
10. Medicine is easy to find and obtain. Lots of over the counter varieties, many affordable brands. Antibiotics are seldomly prescribed here. 
11. The people here are an eclectic bunch. Canada is a mixing pot. Every race, religion, and culture exist here. You'll find kindness, but you'll also find bigotry in some places. There will always be someone willing to help you in the community. 
12. As a racial mixing pot, there are all types of girls from all types of cultures. Some girls are very sexually liberated, some are reserved. Some are well read, some really like horses, some really like drugs. Any girl you can imagine exists in Canada. 
13. Smoking and drinking are common and normal. Cigarette smoking is on the decline, but cannabis is legal and picking up popularity. 
14. Anyone can make a home in Canada. It is the land of moose and opportunity.

I'm not sure what the proper name for the type of vision he has. I'll have to ask mom the next time I see her but I know he lost it abruptly due to his TBI. He looks at things up close but only with one eye. I'm under the impression he has about a small triangle's worth of sight in that eye and the other he has none. He likes to look at things sideways and insists he can't see a tv screen no matter how big it is (movie theater) or how zoomed in it is. He'll even go stand right next to it sometimes and cuss about not being about to see it. I think he can see it but it's different and limited to what it was so he just gets mad and says he can't.  

It's not trivial to my brother so it's not trivial to me. I really feel for him. I don't want him to be bored and constantly wishing to do things but just giving up because it's not the same. That's why I was thinking maybe a new hobby so he can't think back to what it used to be but it's been hard finding him stuff that fits his age. Video games are just so ingrained in the culture!

1179,"That is not what happened. I am the person you are talking about. 

A woman asked a fairly innocuous question on another sub and you responded really meanly, calling her a gold-digger and worse, and kept going after this woman. None of which I got from OPs post or her comments, so I commented that It didn’t seem to be like that to me (it was a little more snarky but not much).  I then read your post history trying to see why you were so upset at this woman, and kept coming after her. I saw that you posted in a sub for blindness and it piqued my interest because it was relevant to my life and I didn’t know the sub existed. I discovered that your son has the same rare degenerative eye condition as my husband. And it kind of hit me— you could have been sitting next to me in one of the support groups, or lectures; you’re real person, not just a mean voice on the internet. 

Today, you responded to my comment somewhat rudely to me and still very rude to the OP. I wrote that I disagreed, but that funny things can humanize other people to you, told you that my husband has the same condition as your son and that I didn’t want to spar over something so inconsequential as this random OP’s attitude, because why am I fighting with a real person over some other person’s perceived attitude.  I ended it wishing you a heartfelt wonderful day and that I hoped that “they” perfected the combo of stem cell and gene therapy in time to help you son (because it likely won’t be in time to help my husband). Because we as two humans on the internet actually had a real connection in the real world. 

You wrote back quite quickly and meanly that your son didn’t need any “help.” and that I was an ableist, in really mean and snarky terms. And for some reason, this hit me hard.  I started crying. And I responded that my husband needed/liked help which you eschewed as ableist, and your response was crappy.  You wrote back, doubling down, and then adding a second comment mocking me for not loving my infant son enough to get genetic testing. My husband convinced me not to respond. 

You found my statement to the effect of “I hope that they succeed in researching a treatment that stops the thing making our family members go blind” ableist. I didn’t say “I’m so sorry he has this condition and that his life is going to suck because blind people can’t do anything” (nor do I think that).  Or “your poor son!” I did NOT call it a “cure”; I  said I hoped that the treatment that they are currently working on was done in time to matter to help your son. 

I don’t find supporting medically treating degenerative blindness ableist.  The organization is even called “foundation for fighting blindness.” My husband doesn’t think so, though he doesn’t spend a ton of time lamenting it, he knows it makes his life harder than if he didn’t have it.  It makes both of our lives harder.  That is a reality.  It is a reality I embrace with open arms; but it is a lie not to acknowledge that low vision adds additional challenges to an adult couple where one is sighted. I gave examples that affect adults in ways that can be different for children, like public transportation being the predominant criterion in choose a place to live; he has to choose employers based on the same; attending networking events alone is challenging; and of course the lack of driving.  All issues that your son doesn’t face now but my husband does, and it isn’t ableist to acknowledge that. But I didn’t jump in with that.

I reached out you with something we had in common, not out of pity for your son but out of a shared connection.  I didn’t want you to “thank me”; I wanted you to see me as a person in the real world, tethered to something actually real, and realize “hey, my crappy attitude towards random OP and random commenter isn’t being tempered by realizing other people have feelings.” It was to ground the conversation. 

The exchange really bothered me, and actually made me cry, legitimately cry to my husband and read him the exchange.  He said that he thinks it sucks that he has it and he wishes they could fix it. I asked if i was reacting this way because something you said was was true? Was I being ableist by wishing the treatment was perfected? Was I being ableist by trying to connect to this woman about the fact that our family members had this very rare condition? Did I pity him? He asked if I did pity him; I said sometimes, when he walks into things and sometimes when I think about how unfair it is how it hurts him and scares him he can’t do so many things he used to.  When he gets scared because his career is in computers and he’s worried about when he can’t see the screen.  He says he thinks the same thing; and that it’s because I’m kind that i feel bad when he hurts, not because I’m an ableist monster.  And that it’s different for a child and an adult who is slowly losing his independence (and is not especially open to mobility training, despite my suggestions and research), so we are coming from it from different places.  

I am not his mother; I am his partner; my job is to support him and love him, and comfort him; it would be crappy and dismissive of me to respond to his very real fears and legitimate concerns about his vision and abilities with only positivity and without acknowledging the actual limitations he faces. 

You can think what you want and feel what you want about the exchange, but please don’t misrepresent it to a community I actually want to connect with.  I looked for RP subs when I joined reddit but I didn’t do a good job of searching broader and finding here.

1180,"My husband has RP and will turn 40 this year.  We have an infant son. His vision degradation has slowed, which is good, but it is getting worse.

Honestly, the biggest practical thing I see affecting your family in the short run, besides the shock and emotional component of the diagnosis, is driving, because it doesn’t take a lot of vision loss to affect that.  I assume you and your wife both drive.  That will unfortunately change.  

My husband still feels comfortable driving during the day in non-crowded areas, but we made a decision that he can never drive the children (or child, as of now) regardless of conditions.  (He just repassed the DMV vision test too). This is because, if he were to get into an accident, we are not confident that CPS wouldn’t become involved, and that is something we are not willing to risk. Your vision may be good enough now that you can still drive, but you may want to discuss this aspect with your wife, and do a little research on it.  It isn’t necessarily the most obvious thing you think of 

The driving aspect is the one that has the biggest impact the soonest. Once you feel/are unable to drive, it may affect your commute and where you can work.  We based our house location on proximity to public transportation and walkability to supermarket, a drugstore and the elementary school.  You may need to evaluate how walkable your home is, and to make sure you empower yourself that you will not feel isolated and dependent when you can no longer drive. 

The good news: you will be able to see your children and wife for a long while! RP will kill your night vision and your peripheral vision, but well lit things in the center of your field of vision should stay clear for a while (or can generally be helped by regular vision aids like glasses, contacts or lasik). Our wedding had lights pointing directly at us during the ceremony— my husband could see every smile, every tear.  Same with my son’s birth. You will (likely) be able to see your wife when she asks you how she looks in that dress (or pants) by looking directly at her, and you will (likely) be able to see the artwork your children present to you (and you will still have to lie about how beautiful it is). It should take a decent amount of time for those type of things to be completely affected. You don’t need to stop your normal activities as if you are operating on borrowed time of seeing your family— you really aren’t. If anything, go be sporty and enjoy the activities you might not be able to do in 10 years (you’ll also be tired then!)

Your wife will be affected by this as well, and it will require reevaluating how you split up tasks.  My husband can’t go in to the baby at night (or more accurately, doesn’t feel comfortable) because you have to keep the lights off, so I do night duty.  But he wakes up at 6 and then takes the baby and lets me sleep until 8 (9 on weekends!) I do both pick up and drop off to daycare, but he makes dinner while I go get the baby. I do all the driving and errands but he does the laundry. Things like that.  Eventually, it will likely be helpful to get your “village” (grandparents, siblings) involved to help and carpools will become helpful (or so I’ve been told, we aren’t there yet).

The box is fairly small (~ 8 x 8 x 8 inches) and fits wonderfully into any backpack. Inside the box is lined with a special isolation material. I have three liquid ice packs that perfectly fit into the box. Because I need to carry around my eye drops every day, I always make sure to put the ice packs into the freezer when I come home in the afternoon. It's the first thing I do, so I won't forget. In the morning I take them out, wrap the eyedrops bottle into the ice packs and put them into the box. The eye drop usually freezes and stays that way for at least half a way. When I need to take it, I just thaw it up in my hand. After half a way, the liquid is not frozen anymore but the ice packs still keep it cold. The box can keep the eye drops cold for about 15-20 hours, which is more than I need.

1200,"This is fascinating and I think I know what you are talking about. I can definitely imagine how it must feel very frustrating in the dream.

On a different note that isn't related to my question, I must ask you: so when you say ""total blindness"" I assume no light at all. Like, everything's ""black"" as sighted people would say. I'm sorry if this question sounds really dumb but how does that feel like and how did it feel like in the beginning? Was it very scary for you?

I ask this question for two reasons. First, because I'm going blind myself. In my case, I will probably retain some light-perception but the prospect is still incredibly scary.

Secondly I ask the question because of a very specific experience I had about 3 weeks ago. Due to me being legally blind, I struggle with super weird sleep-wake cycles that constantly change. The fact that I'm a uni student makes this even worse (I have less of a structured everyday life). Naturally, this messes up my eating pattern too. Now, usually I try to adjust my eating schedule and bedtimes to that of my wife to keep some routine. However, in that particular week, my wife was away on a trip and I was home alone. Since I did not have to go anywhere except a few classes, I ended up staying up for a very long time without eating anything. Then I slept for a very long time because I was so tired. When I got up, I decided to take a shower and get my rhythm back in order. At this point, I had not eaten in almost 3 days and I was also quite dehydrated. I know I was being an idiot but sometimes this stuff just happens I suppose. I took a hot shower, which in hindsight was a bad decision. While I poured water on my head, I closed my eyes. When I opened them again, everything was completely black. I mean... completely black. In a matter of seconds, my sight had totally vanished. I panicked and jumped out of the tub. First I thought it might be a power cut but everything was gone, I couldn't even see shapes or shadows. I ran through the apartment naked and crying, trying to find my cell phone. Then, suddenly, light started to come back and eventually all the shapes and colors too. I did not understand at the time why this had happened to me but in hindsight I assume it was because my body felt so weak and the hot shower made the blood circulation even worse. Running through the apartment probably got the blood circulation going again. I must admit this was the most terrifying experiences I've ever had. Of course the suddenness was part of why it felt so scary but not seeing anything at all also felt very... imprisoning. People who were born blind probably wouldn't agree but as someone who went through this process, I wonder how it was for you.

Cool that you also think some things can be improved with ML. I have some proof of concepts already made for these things:

\* Icon classifier, it can correctly say if the item you're on is a share button, like, bookmark, log in e.t.c.

\* Main content finder, automatically identifies which part of the page is the main content and provides you a skip link to it.

\* Header estimator, for pages that use headers incorrectly the add-on looks at the page visually and converts these header / paragraph tags to the correct level and heading.

\* Label identifier, fixes forms where the label for input fields isn't given by looking at where the labels are located visually.

\* CAPTCHA solver, when you encounter a captcha the add-on solves it for you, no need to register anywhere to an anti-captcha service.
