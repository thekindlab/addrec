24,"I have to agree with another poster. Braille isn't too hard! Now, with less sensitivity in your fingers it will probably be harder, but if you can manage to make out the differences between each letters over time the rest is quite easy.

Some people might think, ""How can it be easy when there's so many rules?"" And yes, it is hard to learn in one way but easy in another. If all you want to do is read then it's not that bad. It's more if you want to become a transcriber that it's hard, because then you have to memorize things like when to put blank lines and how to format everything and how to make a title page etc etc.

You don't need to worry about that part if you're just reading. It does take more time than print. However, after doing this for a bit over a year now, I can read it pretty smoothly. I have tried with my fingers as well and can make things out successfully sometimes - to me that will be the hardest part. As soon as you can tell apart the letters, the rest is not that hard at all, it'll just take a little time to memorize. Grade 1 is an absolute cinch as far as memorizing it. Grade 2 is a good deal more - it has to cover everything that's possible in print, after all. But it's still not bad, and for unusual things there will be special symbols pages included that explain what unusual symbols you'll run into in that book.

I will say I learned it with sight. I don't know how long it would take to learn to decipher by hand. I can do it a little bit, but I really do think the deciphering part will be the hardest bit. When I successfully read anything by hand I always feel like it's a big accomplishment.

Honestly, if you love reading, I think you will fall in love with braille eventually. It sounds like it's not braille itself that is a problem for you, but it feels more like admitting defeat in your mind. I don't think anyone can blame you for how difficult it is mentally. I do think you'll have a lot of fun once you start picking it up, though, you're just in an understandably frustrating part of the experience.

39,"This. I had an MRI and an angiogram. It showed I have leaking out of the back of my right eye. It also shows that optic nerve cells are dying in both my right and left eyes. I have seen many doctors over the last year and a half. I am 32 years old. I was in a plane crash when I was 24 that was very traumatic as well as an explosion when I was in the military a couple weeks prior to that. The doctor is unsure if such a long time could pass from my TBI events and this happening as still so little is known about TBI and its lasting effects. My trip to USC next week is to remove vitriol fluid from my eye and test it for some kind of unknown unseen cancer or infection. But I am certain and I know because I know my body that what is happening to me is either happening because of my brain or because of my TBI.

I love your outlook on dancing in the aisles. I was already a pretty goofy person and I feel like I lost that a part of me and that part of me died sometime during my last doctors appointment. I do laugh because I can't really see children and this is going to sound horrible but sometimes I'll turn around and the kids will be like right there and I'll run in to the kid and they're like hey and I just die laughing. I don't know why it's so funny to me but it's the funniest thing to me that they're invisible. The other day I kicked this kids cupcake and she started crying but I didn't even see her or the cupcake until she started crying and I searched for her.  her mom was laughing and I was laughing but her mom does it know that I'm losing my eyesight so she was laughing for a completely different reason than I was laughing.",,,,idlikearefund,,,1576774119,t5_2qpec,t3_ecjd24,t1_fbd8r9c,2,1585634281,0,0,fbdyej3,Blind,,,,,

As a college student with low vision, some of the accommodations that have helped me most include:

- Having access to a large computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard when completing tests (these are all hooked up to a testing center laptop)
- Using apps like Microsoft Immersive Reader for textbooks to make text easier to read for long periods of time. Many of my professors wrote their own textbooks and work with me to ensure that I can read them with whatever apps I need.
- Using high-contrast pens to write assignments
- Reduced lighting in the classroom if needed. I am very photosensitive and benefit from having dimmed lights in class, and my professors are happy to do this.

I had to leave my chosen career (public safety) because I can no longer drive and I lack the visual acuity to perform the job.

I recommend that he seeks out mental health servicesand peer support, because it is a process of grieving not unlike losing a loved one.  I had to work through the grief and anger before I could accept my vision loss and begin moving forward in a new direction.  

I‘m not sure what services he has accessed previously,  but he should seek out a low vision specialist.  His ophthalmologist can refer him.  They can help him obtain orientation and mobility training, recommended aids and assistive devices, and refer him to local resources.  He should also consult with your state’s vocational rehab services.  He might qualify for assistance obtaining necessary accommodations or even retraining in a different field.  If you are in the US, legal blindness meets a disability listing for Social Security benefits.  This allows access to the Ticket to Work Program that can help with retraining, etc.  There are also state and federal tax allowances for the legally blind.  He may even qualify for forgiveness of federal student loans due to disability.

I wish you both the very best.  My wife provides so much support to me since my vision loss.  It’s a fine line between helping fill his deficits and needs without being overbearing.  And it honestly takes time to find the new normal after something like this occurs.

I had to work through the grief and anger before I could accept my vision loss and begin moving forward in a new direction.  

I‘m not sure what services he has accessed previously,  but he should seek out a low vision specialist.  His ophthalmologist can refer him.  They can help him obtain orientation and mobility training, recommended aids and assistive devices, and refer him to local resources.  He should also consult with your state’s vocational rehab services.  He might qualify for assistance obtaining necessary accommodations or even retraining in a different field.  If you are in the <LOCATION>, legal blindness meets a disability listing for Social Security benefits.  This allows access to the Ticket to Work Program that can help with retraining, etc.  There are also state and federal tax allowances for the legally blind.  He may even qualify for forgiveness of federal student loans due to disability.

I wish you both the very best.  My wife provides so much support to me since my vision loss.  It’s a fine line between helping fill his deficits and needs without being overbearing.  And it honestly takes time to find the new normal after something like this occurs.  He’s going to need you, but he might push you away sometimes because he’ll be frustrated he can’t do something he used to do (or hasn’t figured out a new alternative way of doing it yet).","[{'start': 1314, 'end': 1324, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

There are a couple things that could have made you feel like your vision was better...

1)  When you're under stress, your eyes dilate, letting in more light.  For many vision disorders the amount of light greatly affects ""how good you can see.""

2) Since you usually look down at your feet (me, too), you're already limiting the light that enters your eyes due to head tilt and light source.  

If you think about it, light doesn't come from the ground, usually. LOL  But it does some from the sky and light fixtures, which are higher up.

Use Word styles, add alt text to any images, and be prepared to be extremely patient. You should be ok, because chances are your client will need to be extremely patient with dealing with a sighted person.

Cons:  You need to make sure to have more than just one person to rely on for rides.   (If you SO cant take you to work one day, you will need a backup.  You can Uber, but it does get expensive).  Might have to be early to appointments or work due to the ride situation,   might have to wait for your ride to get to your job (I have had to wait on my rides for a few hours before).

200,"Hey. Mostly blind too, I don't have any usable vision. I went skating with my friend for the first time. I went around the rink, honestly just holding onto the side. I fell twice, but it was fun. I've gone skating reasonably often since then. The 2 most memorable times were with a friend who asked someone to help her out and helped me get away from the wall for the first time ever... That was absolutely terrifying. I couldn't get the rhythm of it at all and just felt like a burden. The second time was with a very good, very cute friend of mine... He held my one hand the entire time and caught me every time I slipped. His thinking was that, if I could get to a point where I could balance evenly, even if I did have the wall on one side and him on the other, it was the first step to balancing properly on the ice, and thus the first step to skating without the wall.
Basically, it comes down to this:
1. If your friend gets uncomfortable, let her get off, recollect, and then go back on.
2. If you want to go on the ice alone for a while, just to skate away from her for a lap or two, just ask. I'm sure she'll be fine with that.
3. If she's uncomfortable trying to step away from the wall, please don't force it. It is her first time, and I'm almost sure you won't, but it's super damaging to be that afraid in a crowd and in a place that is way beyond normal...

Obviously those who had their sight and lost it have memories that their brain utilizes in creating imagery when dreaming. Maybe the question is better worded as, what are your dream experiences like? Feelings and words? Sounds? 

I have this cool app on my phone where a visually impaired person can call and ask for assistance. I get a lot of calls from the grocery store. Making sure that they get the specific brand of ___ they like. Or expiration dates on milk, eggs. Whether the bananas are ripe enough or not. I get calls from older individuals asking if the light is on in the room their in, or to help them find something important that they’ve misplaced. Helping discern different denominations of money is also a popular call. Sizes of clothes. I did get a call one time from an old woman asking me if her new hairstyle looked good. Me, a 29 year old male with zero experience in women’s hairstyles &amp; under qualified in making an opinion told her it looked great. The app is 100% free and easy to sign up.

255,"Hey, over the years I’ve built many PCs by myself as a blind person.  The first thing you need to do is to get over the fear of messing things up.  I also tell folks that if they can put together a 10 piece puzzle, then they can pretty much build a PC.  The one thing I’d seriously consider is to purchase the motherboard and case from the same place.  In that way you can avoid the hassle of mounting the motherboard and messing with jumpers and stuff like that.  Once the motherboard is mounted, it’s pretty easy after that.  Like someone mentioned in an earlier post, try familiarizing  yourself with the peripherals, eg: hard drives feel like a slice of pound cake; memory feels like a large stick of gum; data cables usually are flat wide and ribbon-like, while power cables are usually small and rectangular in shape.  Anyway, pardon the long post, but hope this helps.  Peace.",,,,Blinky_X,,,1577491125,t5_2qpec,t3_edl7p7,t3_edl7p7,2,1586137952,0,0,fc6w9mb,Blind,,,,,

346,"Hi. It sounds like you haven’t had much training on using assistive technology. You might benefit from speaking to a counselor from a vocational rehabilitation agency on potential technology solutions.  Maybe ask your disability support office for any recommendations on potential organizations to seak out for additional services. From my own personal experience, you might need to do more research on your own because some university disability support programs are better equipped to help students with learning disabilities over students with visual impairments. What is your vision like now? What tools do you currently use? Where do you and your doctors see your vision progressing to in the future. Are you able to navigate independently and complete independent living skills on your own? All of these things can impact your ability to be successful in work and school long term. A vocational rehabilitation counselor will likely be better equipped to assist you holistically. There are programs that can provide you with the education to do things like use assistive technology and more. I hope that this helps.",,,,TheBlindBookLover,,,1575950847,t5_2qpec,t3_e8hpaz,t3_e8hpaz,2,1584910052,0,0,faczeah,Blind,,,,,

Second, and I’m going to sound like an ass here, but if you aren’t getting your dog from a reputable school, you are not setting yourself up for success.  Training a guide dog is only part of the process, these dogs are literally bread for the job.  A good guide dog school has a breeding program that examines how a litter performs during standardized evaluations, typically starting at seven weeks old.  Depending on how a dog scores on a very wide variety of tests, they will be considered for the breeding program.  Only the very best of the best are selected to create the next generation of guide dogs.  The careful selection and genetic knowledge of a good guide dog is not something that the average person or organization cannot hope to emulate.

Dogs are typically paired with a handler between 20 and 24 months old.  They are typically eliminated from a program much earlier than that.  If the dog is still in training at 30 months of age, that does not bode well for their success.  That’s not even considering that being a guide dog is incredibly stressful for a dog that does not actively love and want to perform that job.

That all being said, I know from personal experience that guide dogs are extremely useful for individuals who are completely blind.  I regularly travel with my guide dog to other countries, and find him invaluable especially since I typically travel solo.  This is anecdotal though, and I encourage you to do your own research.

The last thing I’ll rant about is that going through a state or other local program is not the way to get a guide dog from a top school in the US (assuming that you are in the US).  All of the reputable schools are non-profit organization with no state or government associations.  If you need pointers, take a look at the web sites of Guide Dogs for the Blind, Guiding Eyes for the blind, or the Seeing Eye for accurate information.  I’m not saying that they are the only reputable schools in the US, but they have the most advanced breeding and R&amp;D programs of any schools.

383,"Firstly, this is awesome that you’re thinking about this. I teach students with visual impairments and it’s amazing how differently they are treated because of their blindness. You are probably right that she is lonely and I think she would love hanging out! 

What kind of things do you like to do? Start by just inviting her to do your normal social stuff. Going for coffee, out to eat, to a bar, game night with friends, etc. Going to a movie probably wouldn’t be the best idea, but they do make movies with image descriptions, if you wanted to watch one at home at a later date. Do you have a group of friends where you can bring her along? If so, it would be good to give her a heads up on everyone who will be there, and a small gathering would be better. 

I love going to concerts with my friend who is blind. Maybe going to see some local music would be fun. I have a student who really likes shopping with his friends. My friend really likes to cook, so a cooking class or just eating out would be fun. Y’all could even go shopping for ingredients before cooking. She may have a meal she can teach you, or has something she’s been wanting to make. 

Check into your city’s resources for the blind. The Lighthouse for the Blind in my city has lots of activities. One of my students does tandem bike rides and loves it! They offer yoga classes, cooking classes and other recreational activities.

The fact that you're over 25 is completely irrelevant to the rental company. They have their reasons but the price will be based on the driver's age regardless.

But anyway to your question, no, as far as I know there is no alternative. 

I also cannot drive, I just have my wife rent the car if needed. Same thing when we were dating, I just paid her back.

When I need to rent a car for a work trip, and my wife happens to be coming along for vacation, I just justify her name being on the rental because I cannot drive. Work has never raised an issue. If she cannot come with me on the trip, I just don't rent a car and find alternate transportation.

Now if it's a surprise trip, I tell my wife we will be flying to some place and will need to rent a car. Other trip details like dinner plans, specific locations, tours etc can be left secret if you're looking to surprise her.

395,"I have an 18 month old with ONH, he has limited light perception but no other sight. Here’s some of the things I’ve learned/have been the most important to remember: 

1. Like another commenter said, take advantage of every service you can. In my state we have a program that provides support for disabled kids or kids who are behind in development. Through this program we get weekly home visits from a teacher for the visually impaired, a physical therapist, and an occupational therapist, all of whom specialize in working with visually impaired children. When he’s of preschool age he will go to specialized school for the blind with no tuition payments through this same program. There are tons of other programs that give you access to free resources like Braille books or tactile development toys at no or low cost. Your child may also be eligible for ssi for the blind, blind pension, and/or Medicare. Even if you don’t think you qualify, apply anyway. 

2. My son’s teacher told us something interesting and important in one of our first sessions: 90% of what an able-bodied baby learns in their first year is from sight. This means you’ll need to make things adaptable and find other ways to teach your child outside of visual learning. This has been an exceptionally challenging thing for me because I am an almost completely visual learner. In the first year of his life I would walk around with my son in the room or in a baby wear and describe what I was doing as I was doing it. 

3. Keeping in mind the 90% thing: it’s unlikely that a child who is blind at birth will meet all developmental markers at the recommended pace. This does NOT mean they have a learning impairment outside of the impact of being visually impaired (though it is possible). And they have these universal tests to evaluate development. I hate these tests because the way they’re written, it’s nearly impossible for a child with limited to no sight to pass. Some questions from the 18 mo one, for example: “if you smile at your child do they smile back?” “If your child watches you draw a straight line, can they draw a straight line?” 

4. Do NOT blame yourself or treat yourself like a failure if your child isn’t meeting milestones as fast as other children. Stay off Facebook/social media. One of the hardest things for me was seeing friends, former classmates, and coworkers posting about all the things their babies are doing ahead of schedule. It’s so easy to feel like a failure when someone posts pictures of their 1 year old walking while your 18 month old still refuses to pull up on things and stand. Even more so when you’re doing daily physical therapy exercises and practicing with baby. Your child will learn at their own pace. That 12 month old baby has seen people walking around them for a full year. A baby with no functional vision has no idea that walking even exists. They’re having to start the race a lot further back. Be patient with them, but be patient with yourself too.",,,,BATMANS_MOM,,,1576813916,t5_2qpec,t3_ecqwyx,t3_ecqwyx,2,1585662706,0,0,fbflzxr,Blind,,,,,

She may love to do that but not have wanted to that day, so then you'll know to suggest it another time, or she might say ""I don't really know the menu"" (and you can offer to read her her options). Or she might say ""I don't really enjoy being in coffee shops"" or whatever. But my point is, you are, to your credit, very concerned about not making her uncomfortable, but give HER the credit of being able to speak up for herself. If you suggest something she would rather not do, she can say no thank you and suggest something different. 

I think it's even okay to say ""I haven't been around visually disabled people much so please tell me whatever I should know about you/if I can help you at any time. I don't want to do anything that might be inconsiderate."" Then if you're walking somewhere, ask her if she would like any help (she might want to take your arm). (Ask, don't grab her arm, of course.) If she takes your arm, ask her if she wants you to tell her when the curb is coming or whatever. If she has told you what she wants (or doesn't want) you'll know you won't offend her or make her uncomfortable. If you go into a cafe or restaurant, ask if she would like you to read the menu. Don't ask her as if she's a child, but just in a straightforward way.

I think sometimes people think that in order to treat someone with a disability fairly and kindly, they should ignore the disability and pretend it's not there. But (depending on the disability) that doesn't always make sense. You shouldn't ignore someone being blind if, because you are sighted, you can help them safely cross a street or (if they wish) read them the program at the theater.

446,"Blind people who work out in commercial gyms independently need to be extra vigilant and cautious about safety. They also need to pay extra attention to their form, particularly when working with barbells and other free weights.

Most people have headphones on and aren’t paying attention to their surroundings in the gym. So, a dropped barbell or collision can instantly result in injury for the blind person or someone else. I shouldn’t think about the number of times I’ve almost walked into someone while doing lunges or carrying dumbbells or almost gotten a hand or finger smashed while unwracking or rewracking weights. I’m not saying don’t go. Just be careful.

Hire a trainer to show you how to perform free weight exercises, adjust settings on squat wracks, and change levers and safety pins. Ask a friend or staff member to show you the layout so you can get around on your own. Expect that some people will balk at the idea of a blind person moving around independently in the gym--They’re probably being overprotective, but you should respond in a way that makes it clear that you understand and can handle legitimate safety concerns.

My mom has been going blind my whole life. It wasn't so much difficult as different. It's all I've known. As an adult now, I look back and notice some things. Like my ability to read fast is because of reading off road signs before she surrendered her license. I am more aware of where I put things, making sure I remember incase she asks. I count buttons on technology...

It really gives you perspective, and some little habits that seem weird to sighted people. I touch people's backs as I walk behind, just a gentle poke or tap if I know them. If I don't, I verbalize. Movies are fun. Picking out the nuances in the background that could be plot devices that she can't see.

I can't imagine a life without my mom and her diminishing sight. I felt proud to get sighted guide training when I was 12, and now it is second nature. I'm going to learn braille soon so that when she finally becomes less stubborn I can help her.

505,"This guy and I matched online because we went to the same undergrad. I had no idea about his RP. We went on a few dates but nothing ever happened until we ran into each other at a party. It’s funny in retrospect, as I thought we were noticing each other in the dark room and so I went over to say hi so it wouldn’t be awkward. (Later found out— nope, couldn’t see me). He wound up following up and we went on a second first date. On this date, we went to a slightly dark bowling alley, and he went to put his drink on a ledge, and was kind of bobbing around with his drink/hand for the ledge, and I made a joke about him being drunk. He told me about having RP and I felt like an asshole for making fun of him, but he made me feel better about that. So we went out again. 


I was attracted to him because he’s handsome, smart and funny. I married him because he’s kind, loving and a wonderful partner. I had a child with him because he is an amazing, giving person and an excellent father.  I’m spending my life with him because I want to and I’m lucky enough that he wants to too.

His vision issues do wind up affecting a lot of our decisions in life, such as where to live (both in terms of geography and actual house selection), daily schedules (considering he doesn’t drive), childcare, social events, etc. Some of the other commenters seem younger and maybe it makes less of an impact then, but when you’re a family running a household, it it isn’t nothing. Our weekends are spent doing things together that other people do separately and in half the time. But that’s the cost of doing business, as I’m sure every VI/blind person here knows. And I love my life with him. Everyone has their junk, and this is his. I have my own junk that he has to manage.

577,"I don't see why this situation has to involve your wife that much. You need a clear path and for your kids to stop leaving stuff in the way, so you need to enforce that with them. If they're refusing to accommodate your needs, then you need to discipline them - not give your wife the responsibility of clearing up the kids' messes. And if you're incapable of parenting your own children so they meet the required standard of behaviour, then you shouldn't be looking to your wife to make up for that shortcoming. Which isn't to say that parenting isn't a team effort, it is, and your wife should support you in enforcing the rules about not leaving junk everywhere, but as you're the one with the ""problem"" in this situation you need to be the one proposing and implementing a solution rather than just expecting your wife to sort everything out.

Though obviously it depends a bit on how old your children are. If they're 3 or over then that's typically old enough to learn/understand that they should put things away. If they're still babies/toddlers then it's more difficult and I can see why the job of keeping the walkways clear would be down to your wife. Perhaps in that case you would be willing to use your cane temporarily until the kids are old enough to pick up after themselves?

&gt; Dont use PDFs or other picture-graphs. Screen readers work best with word documents. [...] His screen reader may struggle with docusign

Check on the picture-graphs. The currency of getting a mortgage is paperwork. Depending on the bank we use, etc, it will typically not even be docusign, but a one-off digital e-signature platform that is otherwise similar. I just put a few calls in to some of the banks I regularly use. Early in the process (once the home is in escrow) the bank will be sending client a ~100 page PDF document to digitally sign, but I'm sure this isn't the first blind person in the history of the world to buy a home, so I'll see what those banks come back with. I'm guessing a bigger one would be more likely to have a go-to person who knows all the questions and the solutions/answers, ""click here to sign, don't worry about reading any of it"" isn't viable obviously.

I know CNIB (Canadian National Institute for the Blind) has started a huge campaign to push for more brail adaoption, as they say it's quicker to read than screen readers, but I don't get that.

It was only about a 24 hour lapse from being admitted to the hospital to walking out as a new blind guy, so wasn't much in the way of preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

My family reacted like absolute shit, and basically misplaced their love with worry, fear, degredation, and disdain.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, it wasn't ONLY because I went blind, but also because I'm just not a conventional 9 - 5 type of guy, never have been, never will be.  Long story, but been a software entrepreneur all my life since I was 16, have been both rich and poor multiple times, lived all over the world, last time I had a real job I was 19 and working for $7.50/hour landscaing, etc.  At times I've made $40k/month though, so it's not all bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I had been living in NE Thailand for 8 years when I went blind, and due to that plus always making my own money instead of having a boss and conventional job, and going blind, my family went off the rails on me.  Telling me I'm delusional, detached from reality, sick in the head, need professional help, and blah, blah...

&amp;#x200B;

They demanded I come back to Canada, and I politely told them to fuck off.  I had been living there 8 years, that was my home, I had my BF who I loved very much (I'm gay), my dogs of 7 years who I loved like my own children, and get fucked if you think I'm leaving them behind in life, etc.  Plus it was my home, I knew everyone in the area, everyone knew new, and without question in my mind I made the right decision by staying in Thailand.  Upon first going blind, I literally couldn't even walk 300m down to the local store anymore, and had to teach myself everything again, including just walking the streets.  Thanks to the support from my neighbors and locals in my community though, I became a confident blind man in about 4 months.  I know full well that would have taken at least two years in Canada, due to how isolating of a society Canada is.

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up getting forced back to Canada anyway after trying to move to Vientaiene (I overstayed my VISA in Thailand, nothing criminal -- I loved my dogs, and wasn't willing to leave them).  Upon getting back here, family still just ran with the misconception that I'm fucked in the head and don't understand reality, so that was fun!

Since it's a new friendship, only real advice I can give is try to think of things that are just as enjoyable regardless if you're blind or sighted, and with minimal additional struggle added due to being blind.

&amp;#x200B;

Can only speak for myself, but many times I will just refuse to go out for coffee or dinner, because it's just a pain, plus I don't want to burden who I'm with.  Even just a simple coffee -- manage to find the outside door, but don't know where to pay or pickup the coffee, can't read the menu, don't know where the bathroom is and even after you find it, can't quite remember exactly what table you're stting at is, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Whereas at home if I want a coffee, I just make myself one, because I know where everything is.  Due to all that, many times I just won't bother coming along with whoever.

&amp;#x200B;

Would suggest taking that into mind while the friendship is forming, and give it a bit of time for her to realize you don't care about her disability, and she's not a burden on you.

Sorry to hear it.  Have you by chance had an MRI done yet?  I'm nowhere close to a doctor, but that's how they diagnosed me at least, and the same happened to me -- right eye went first, and a little while later my left eye went.  Turned out I had lesions in my right optic nerve caused by a fall that the MRI picked up on, and the blood slowly leaked from behind my eyes up through the lesions.

Although I'm sure this is probably the last thing you want to hear right now, once piece of advice I can give is try to have some fun with it.  For example, when you're out grocery shopping and waiting for whoever you're with to grab some things, go ahead and break out into a dance jig in the middle of the aisle.

I use it for spices myself, but there's all sorts of uses such as make up if they're female, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they have a microwave?  If so, what kind?  Are they going to be able to use it blind?  One I had was just a simple dial for the timer, so that was enough enough.  The one now I can use well enough but not totally -- I use know there's 3 buttons that stick out at the top.  Middle is reheat, right-most is cook (press multiple times to increase time).

&amp;#x200B;

Coffee maker?  No idea what the one we have is called, but it's helpful, as I don't have to pour.  It's one of those single serving ones, so you just put this little circular pack in the top, put your mug under, press the button, and that's it.  It'll spit out the coffee into the cup for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Do they use a computer?  If yes, and if it's a laptop, an external large keyboard as typing on a laptop just doesn't work for a blind person -- we need to feel the keys of a large keyboard.  Then get a screen reader installed, and begin learning how to navigate the computer with it.  I know from experience, learning how to navigate a computer via screen reader after you've went blind is an absolute pain in the ass.

&amp;#x200B;

I love cooking, so I continue to cook normally.  However, heard many blind people really like the George Foreman Grill, as it will cook things on both sides, hence they have to flip anything in a pan with oil.  Sandwich maker and things like that may be helpful as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Is online grocery shopping and delivery available where you are?  For me at least, shopping is probably the single largest issue with being blind (well, aside from work and making money, haha).  If it is available, get all setup with accounts, favorite lists if possible, learn how to navigate their online system via screen reader, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If they're ok with it (ie. not too old), grab an iPhone, and begin learning how to use it via voice commands with Siri.  Would highly recommend installing WhatsApp for them, and that goes for anyone who wishes to remain in contact with them.  WhatsApp is simply superior for blind people compared to other IM apps, as I can just tell my phone, ""send WhatsApp message to John hey, are you still coming for dinner tonight?"", and it will send fine whereas the other apps don't allow sending text messages via voice.

If they're ok with it (ie. not too old), grab an iPhone, and begin learning how to use it via voice commands with Siri.  Would highly recommend installing WhatsApp for them, and that goes for anyone who wishes to remain in contact with them.  WhatsApp is simply superior for blind people compared to other IM apps, as I can just tell my phone, ""send WhatsApp message to John hey, are you still coming for dinner tonight?"", and it will send fine whereas the other apps don't allow sending text messages via voice.

Folks in this thread have mentioned that a degree will help with your earning potential, but you should be extremely choosey when it comes to the field you decide to get a degree in.

Being able to speak and write well will give you a serious advantage when it comes to employment. Fortunately, this is absolutely something you can improve with some hard work and time.

If you do know braille, challenge yourself to read more than you currently do, and to read books which will force you to stretch a little. Figure out which words you are often spelling incorrectly, and make yourself some flashcards to practice them.

As for coding, a great way to learn to write good code is to read good code. Go find some projects on Github, and read their code.

There is no better predictor of the success of blind adults than there ability to use braille. Get a cane in his hand as soon as he can walk. He might fight it, he might not.

666,"First thing: you and he need to recognize that he is not in for an easy road. That's out of his and your control. This transition is going to suck big time. The only real choice you both get to make is whether it's going to suck forever, or just for a while.

The second thing to recognize is that most of what you think a blind person can do, and be successful at, is totally wrong. This is probably the hardest part. Everyone has been so conditioned to believe that sight is so vital to everything we do, and this life-long conditioning does not magically go away when you become blind. As a result, if he doesn't find himself constantly pushing himself to question and surpass his own limitations on what he thinks he can do as a blind person, he's probably doing it wrong.

Third, blindness organizations... They are super contravercial. However, one thing they have going for them is that hopefully they can expose him to other people who are living a life in a way he could be happy with. You will absolutely meet folks of all sorts at such meetings. Some of these folks are doing very well for themselves, and others are struggling. Even if these meetings aren't something for you in the long run, it's at least nice to be exposed to some good role-models early on, so you can at least get a sense for what is possible.

Fourth, depending on what sort of tech support he is doing, he may not need to quit. If he still has some vision, he can certainly use magnification. Otherwise, there are plenty of folks doing tech support who are totally blind. Video editing could be tricky if he loses all his vision, but a lot of blind folks successfully edit audio. I happen to be a software engineer, but I know other blind folks who are lawyers, mathematicians, biologists,  school teachers, an embedded software engineer, substance abuse counselors, a small-town newspaper owner/editor, and a bunch more that I'm probably forgetting. Most important, none of these folks are extraordinary. They're just regular folks who learned what they needed to learn, were willing to creatively problem solve, and just did what they had to in order to survive and support their families.

765,"Thank you so much for your advice!! To answer a few of those questions :
1) even tho there are a lot of blind people, their stories are often not known bc media doesnt cover them. So even tho its not the first time its happenned, he is not aware of it. Its definitely not the first time, but I wanted to show in a world like this, that this is how blind people struggle almost. 
2) auto pilot is very common in cars, but its kinda like tesla autopilot. Indepently self-driving cars are reaaallly expensive and his family cant afford it
3) hes been babied by his mother, (which kinda covers my own ass tbh). Bc of this hes kinda like, lost almost. His ability to do things hasnt been taught nor helped by his mom. And his mom is kinda like an ‘ill do everything for you bc i feel bad’ kind of person. Bc she does this, he kinda wallows in self-despair of how dependent he is due to his blindness. At first he is cynical about the seeing world, he doesnt really develop a lot of self-hate over his blindness specifically until he has experienced what sight is like through his soulmates eyes. His soulmate travels a lot, so he gets to see a lot of amazing scenery which at first hes like ‘thats really cool’ but after each switch, hes again, blind and hes all like ‘i dont like this, this sucks’ if that makes sense. 
4) the soulmate thing is purely biological, and researchers havent really found a reason why. Buts its with ALL humans (barring a few, whom if you dont have a soulmate youre shunned from society)
5) his soulmate will experience blindness, which makes it really hard to find them. There hasnt been technology to read the visuals biologically, so even if his soulmate were to show their contact, he wont know what it is(as he cant read) and even if he were to take out his info, his soulmate wouldnt be able to read it bc they are experiencing his blindness
6) the soulmate bond has become very important, as they register ppl who are soulmates (kinda like how for taxes you list whether youre married or not) and the importance is similar to religion. Like how back during the christian crusades, if you werent christian you died (if that makes sense?). Im debating as to include soul-mate as a variable in credit score, as to make it more important. But I am unsure
7) for those who are asexual/poly, it isnt common to have multiple soulmates at once, but changing of soulmates have never happenned. Soulmates arent required to have sex, but to have sex w someone who isnt your soulmate (as well as married) is illegal
8) the average person starts the Switch at 14, in the story he is 17, and is frustrated that he doesnt have one as all of his classmates do. He also deals with a lot of bullying at school due to his lack of soulmate and vision
9) He has a phone where everything is done via voice command, and can read things to him. So txts and calls arent a concern. Regular day-day navigation isnt an issue for him (other then traveling via car)

Hopefully that clears things up!! I will be reading (and watching) the info youve sent me!! If it still isnt clear shoot me a DM if youre willing to help me a little more haha. Bc i personally feel that this is enough to justify his dilemma, if it isnt realistic however, I would gladly accept help for it.",,,,aristapop,,,1575611443,t5_2qpec,t3_e696jy,t1_f9t0t0a,1,1584557848,0,0,f9t7ic8,Blind,,,,,
766,"Thank you for your interest! He has never seen before. The narrative of the story has little to no visual context, as he spends most of his time thinking. I try to keep the narrative with no visuals, anything that contains anything visual is either when the soulmate thing happens or he's kinda like 'well it's supposed to be like this, it's what I'm told it's like', but even then I am uncertain whether how accurate my writing has been in the character's perspective.

The soulmate thing has become very strange and scientific. In the future, humans have evolved to where they have a designated soulmate. Once you come within 25 meters of them in any point of your life, something called the Switch starts. Where vision, and only the vision switches temporarily for an indefinite amount of time, and it constantly happens randomly until they find each other, and when they've been separated for more then a week it starts again. It's because of this reason he is so angry that he cannot see, and will never see. Of course he gets a soulmate, but because this is the only way for him to see, he has a lot of resentment and anger towards himself.

Usually, in this world, people keeps a piece of paper in their pocket with their name, number, and address, but of course that doesn't work for him because he has never seen before, therefore he doesn't know how to read, let alone be able to understand what he sees when he does switch.

The media eventually gets involved to help him find his soulmate, and a bunch of other things happen that I won't spill the secrets to.

I'm having him have a guide dog, as to provide also some emotional support, as I know a little bit more about navigating with guide dogs then a cane. But if it's more likely for him to have a cane, then I will need to know a little bit more, so that I can write it correctly and effectively.

I would like for him to have echolocation, but even with personal research, I myself don't understand the experience, so it is difficult for me to write about it. If there's anything that would help me understand it better so that I can write it effectively, that would be amazing.

As this world is set several centuries in the future, although his phone is mainly through voice command, I am not sure whether transportation would be self-driving and independent (So I'm doing some tech research on that). Even though public transportation is available, my character is too emotionally unstable to realize that he can use public transportation. But at the same time, I am not sure whether that is realistic of a character like that. Please help",,,,aristapop,,,1575519057,t5_2qpec,t3_e696jy,t1_f9ox4mr,2,1584480434,0,0,f9p1jpd,Blind,,,,,

829,"Ugh, so I do think the term has some merit, but it's being misused more and more. It's how the far left throw around the term racist. It strips the word of most of its meaning, and when someone or a group is being racist, calling them out as such will carry far less weight because people have become desensitized to it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is much the same. I might have cause to call someone ableist if they drag me around, completely inconsiderate of my feelings and preferences regarding that once I inform them of such; just as a wheelchair bound person could feel justified if someone just came out of the blue and started pushing them away or something.

&amp;#x200B;

You might have cause to say its ableist that a business doesn't have wide enough isles for wheelchairs to pass, or that their employees refuse to help blind people, simply pointing at signage or something.

&amp;#x200B;

What pisses me off to no end are people who want to be language police and call people ableist where you could substitute the word, 'ignorant' or the phrase, 'uneducated regarding disabilities'. But what if the person is interested in learning, you just haven't given them the chance, because you're more concerned with chucking people in buckets and labelling said buckets than you are about educating people.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, there are, and always will be the blissfully or willfully ignorant, and if you want to throw a little shade their way, whatever; however, it does us much harm when people are out there devaluing the word ableist, and using it where there is no cause.

&amp;#x200B;

To further my point, what is likely to happen when you start throwing insults at someone who really doesn't care in the first place. Not much. It's just going to make you look the fool. So, when the word fits, I would say it's OK to use and it's not harming anything, and could be used to help in some situations.

The majority of blind Android users are in developing countries with limited access to braille displays, so improving it would not have a large return on investment.

The reason that they have improved braille access to things like GSuite and Chrome OS is because they know that if they don't, they will suffer financially because of the obligation of some businesses, schools and government departments to procure accessible technology; by contrast, very few businesses mandate that their employees must use Android, so they have no legal or financial pressure to improve Android accessibility.",,,,CloudyBeep,,,1575430133,t5_2qpec,t3_e5pmj3,t3_e5pmj3,3,1584419143,0,0,f9lrhft,Blind,,,,,

989,"Whew, here's a huge wall of text! XD You don't need to answer any of these here, most of these questions are just things you might want to think about as you work on the story. I'm happy to go into more detail or explain other things if you want, just ask. :)

It sounds like in this society he really doesn't have much reason to be angry over being blind. Frustrated, sure, but self loathing and hating his sight loss over one thing, I'm not sure that's very realistic. Also, what prevents his soul mate from being able to find him easily? And why is this the first time in history where it's being noted that there's a problem with finding a soul mate when you're disabled? If this is an evovlved trait, wouldn't this have happened to hundreds of other people who are blind? What about people with perfectly functioning eyes but brain or optic nerve damage that effects how they see? As of now, there are about 500,000 blind people in the United States alone and several million of us worldwide, so I am very curious why your main character is the first one in history to have this issue. At the heart of the story, what is the purpose of the soul mate bond in this society? Is it worldwide/do all humans have this? Is the bond technology or biology or both? Why are certain people paired together (is it for breeding purposes? For social ones? Something else?)? What about asexual people, or polyamorous ones? Does the soul mate thing ever lead to someone being life bonded to an abusive partner?

As far as reading/writing goes, is there some reason he doesn't use braille or a screen reader or a print scanner on his phone? We have technology now that can read and translate human hand writing. It's not always the most accurate, but if this story is in the future, there's no reason it wouldn't be very accurate. I have the same questions about people carrying paper, too; why not have an ID chip or implant with that information so it doesn't get lost? 

More blind people use canes than dogs, but if you want him to have a dog, write in that dog! :) Just be aware that using a guide dog IS as complicated as using a white cane and the relationship between dog and handler is a very deep one that is a lot more than just a dog and its master. I've had three guide dogs and I put my life in their care every time we go outside together; my dogs have saved me from being run over more times than I can count and I trust them to do things I would never trust another person to. I highly recommend reading Thunderdog, First Lady of the Seeing Eye, and Before Tuesday (not a guide dog but the relationship between Tuesday and her soldier is very similar) for good perspective on guide dogs and just because they're three really great, true stories. (Keep some tissues handy though. XD)

Personally, I would leave out echolocation for now. It's not very widely used among the blind and when it is the user is still using a white cane or guide dog with it. Right now it's kind of still in development and research and there's a lot of controversy surrounding it within the blind community. It might just make your story a bit too complicated and you don't necessarily want to distract from everything you have to explain with the soul mate stuff by having to explain this, too.

Blindness alone would not be enough to make your character so emotionally unstable that he can't travel. In fact, a big part of what all of us learn as blind people from a very young age is how to navigate and travel safely. We're humans first and foremost and we like to go out, to socialize, to watch movies by ourselves, etc. Depending on the state of the world in this future, I would imagine that transportation is something everyone has access to and it's definitely something your character would, realistically, have been trained to use (possibly better than most people; I know I get asked to be the ""GPS"" for my friends/family any time they visit my town because I know where I'm going here). If your character lives alone, he absolutely has to be able to get himself food and do all the things able bodied people do to function (pay bills, have friends, have hobbies, etc). What does this guy do for fun? What was his home life like before the story? Who are his friends? Is he still in touch with people he met at the guide dog school or where he went to school growing up? Etc.

Regarding phone technology, even today most of us use smart phones with text to speech screen readers that translate the words into a computer voice. Some people use Siri and voice commands, but just as many of us only use the screen reader. Here's a really quick and dirty video about using a screen reader I made just now.

1006,"Ooo a story that acknowledges some pitfalls of a soul mate process! I like the idea already! I like that you've done some research too; most people who write blind characters don't usually look up the medical side of things. 
I suppose in this setting, what about being blind would make him try to deny reality so hard? Is it just because he can't find his soul mate? Is he able to travel independently (many of us can do so more or less now with public transit, but if self driving cars are a thing that would help him get around)? Is he unable to use accessible technology to find his soul mate (I am assuming yes since it tends to be something that is only experienced by the individual)? Did he ever have sight at any time in his life before the story (that's usually a source of conflict)? If he's never had sight you'll want to use less or no visual descriptions if he's the viewpoint character since that won't be how he understands the world. There's a post from yesterday where we were describing Christmas memories and that might give you some ideas for writing with fewer vision terms. The main thing is to treat your character as a person first and foremost. What about being blind would upset him in the context of the world he lives in; not what you think would upset you about being blind today where you live. This sounds like a really interesting story already! 
Also, he probably would use a white cane. Even with echolocation, we still need them. They haven't changed much over the centuries and I think they'll still be around in the future.",,,,razzretina,ROP / RLF,,1575515798,t5_2qpec,t3_e696jy,t3_e696jy,1,1584477092,0,0,f9ox4mr,Blind,,,blue1,,

Go in a grid pattern when you clean the box, scoop up any obstructions you find and gently shake the scoop from side so the litter falls out of the slots but the clumps stay in. It takes a little bit longer but it's not that bad. Alternately, get some dog poo bags or disposable gloves and just use your hands to find clumps in the litter, using the same grid pattern.

A set of braille measuring cups for food is always good to have around, or a single cup that's the amount you want to feed your cat. I leave a cup in my dog's food bag so it's easy to measure how much she needs.

Trimming cat claws is a two person job even when sighted. If you want to do it yourself, have a friend come to help. You will need to be the one who holds the cat. I would recommend having a vet or groomer do this honestly. It will help if you have a good scratching post for your cat, something with rope or carpet on a wooden pole, not the cheap cardboard kinds.

1127,"You should really ask them for a training course. I can throw out random little tidbits here but the fact is that screen readers on Windows handle completely differently to voiceover. Jaws, as well as nvda, are both modal screen readers with multiple cursors for various uses. You don't have high level elements like in voiceover for Mac OS and instead you're going to rely hard on keystroke commands. Most of them are built into windows and the various apps you use but screen readers still add a lot of controls that are tricky to get a hang of on your own. Web navigation isn't too difficult to learn since it's similar to voice over, just with different key mappings. Actually loading a website though is a somewhat different story. with voice over I would stop interacting with the web content, move over to the toolbar, interact with it, find the address bar, and type in the new address. I use nvda and Firefox on Windows. There, there's no such thing as stopping your interaction with the web content. Instead I would hit alt+d to move the focus of the cursor to the address bar and punch in my new address. Usually once I hit enter the cursor will be moved back to the webview but if it doesn't I would hit f6 to move between the task panes until I returned to the web content.

besides the fact that it's a different screen reader it's also a completely different operating system. Ribbon controls from Microsoft word are present throughout large portions and can come in extremely handy, but again it's totally different. you now only have one static taskbar instead of the menu bar and the dock. That means launching apps involves a completely different process. It's a bit too much to give a quick start on Reddit.

What kind of computer do you have? if it's a laptop then you might want to consider getting an external Number pad. Jaws is not fun at all with a 10 keyless keyboard. If you have a desktop then it would also be best for you to get a keyboard with a numpad. Oh and don't bother trying to get a decent laptop with a numpad.

There are tons of remote jobs that can be done online, which can make both getting the job and accommodating your needs easier; sales, marketing, research, customer support, programming, writing, teaching, audio engineering, voiceover work, medical coding, etc.

I'm a software engineer. One of my blind friends is a writer and does pieces for various tech/geek lifestyle blogs. I have another who does tech support. I did some writing for Mashable and some audio editing for a podcast in my spare time to earn some extra cash for a while.

I switched jobs about two months ago and my eyesight didn't even come up until earlier this week when they were talking about planning an in-person dev retreat and I mentioned that I'd need a large monitor to plug my laptop into.

Mainly, don't be too hard on yourself. Finding your first job is hard, eyesight or not and it's probably even harder now than it used to be. All the ""starter"" jobs get snatched up super fast, especially if you happen to live near a university. Anything more advanced than that, companies want to hire people with experience.

I don't blame you for not wanting to/not using the cane inside your house, but if the kids are too young to grasp that they need to clean stuff up, it's not really fair to your wife to make sure that the path is always clear 100% of the time.

In that case, I'd probably use the cane, but work on establishing some routines and habits with the kids about cleaning up before switching activities or bring out more toys.

If they are old enough and simply aren't being responsible, then I'd address it as a discipline issue.

Your best bet is just to call the rental agency, explain the situation, and be prepared to pay a bit more for a younger driver and/or their insurance, since you don't have an auto insurance policy of your own that would cover the vehicle.

I had a friend who did this years ago when she was moving - rented a moving van in her name, but listed my husband as the only driver, since we were helping her move, he was over 25 (she wasn't), and she didn't feel comfortable driving something that big, anyway. It took a bit of explaining for them to understand what we wanted to do, but in the end, it was fine.

Please note that the law actually asks way less than what I will describe, but this is what is being taught in most secondary schools. (Most meaning there are exceptions!)

&amp;#x200B;

In my school, sex ed was part of the biology program in our second year of secondary school (age 13-14). Our class was (as in all subjects) a group of mixed sexes and both sexes had to learn the exact same thing. Everything was tested at the end of the chapter, basically the same way as all other tests in biology were.

We had to learn about the reproductive systems, both male and female. Basically anatomy and physiology of how that stuff works. The same detailed level as we would spend on how the heart and circulation works. We had to learn about contraceptives, how effective they are and what makes them less reliable. We also learned about things like coïtus interruptus and not having sex around the most fertile period. We also learned that the only surefire way to prevent STD's and pregnancy is to not have sex at all. We also learned about oral sex and how to protect yourself/the other when doing that. We also talked a bit about homosexuality, but it was considered not useful to speak about it because everyone knows (I disagree, personally). There might have been some mentioning of being transgender, but it wasn't really discussed (I disagree on that as well). We didn't learn a lot about how to actually enjoy sex, or even what areas are sensitive or not (I disagree on that, too).

First of all: you do you. Don't let anyone make your choices for you. Remember that I'm just sharing my experiences and in no way want to tell you what you should do.

For me, merging lanes is not a problem. Even in rush hour I just wait until I see the car in my rearview mirror (the one inside the car, not one outside). If it's there, I know there's enough space and I can merge (providing none in my blind spot). I cannot drive when that inside mirror is blocked.

I'm horrible at parking as well. Luckily, my car has parking sensors (you know the thing that beeps when you get too close to something) and I really rely on them (aka I would be doomed without them). If I ever have to park my boyfriend's car which is without sensors, I prefer to let him do it or he is outside directing me where to go. Also, I have quite a small car, so it fits in basically every spot that could fit a car. It also helps that the front of my car (between the window and the license plate you know) is quite small.

I like driving. I really do. Even though I need these few things to keep it safe.

From what I'm reading you don't like driving at all. If people around you are on board (SO, family, workplace, etc) or at least won't pose a problem, why would you keep doing something you don't like? To people who don't matter you can always bring up the environmental aspect as an excuse. And you don't have to hand in your license. You can also not use the car for a couple of weeks and see how that works (or if you have 2, sell one and share the other, or you think up some solution that fits you).

I hope this helps in your decision. Feel free to ask questions if needed :)",,,,ElfjeTinkerBell,blind in 1 eye,,1575575262,t5_2qpec,t3_e6hhgp,t3_e6hhgp,4,1584523085,0,0,f9renlw,Blind,,,blue1,,

I was so freaked out my first 2 weeks there, being someone who could see some, but had to wear the sleepshade, that I couldn't eat anything but apples and oranges for the first 2 weeks.  Being immersed in total blindness was terrifying.  But then, slowly, it got easier and pretty soon, I felt like I had some kind of super powers going on.

The one thing I can tell you is about the Colorado or Louisiana Center for the blind.  There is one other center, I forget which city it's in, but I believe in the north east.  They offer a 6 month program for anyone who has light perception to total blindness, an amazing life changing course on how to deal with it.  How to be independent.  What to expect.  They teach you how to do everything in your daily life, but without sight.  I participated in the program several years ago, (I've been legally blind since birth), and it was the BEST experience of my life!!  It changed me for the better.  Yes, it was scary at times, because anyone who has even a tiny bit of eyesight will be immersed in total darkness/blindness by wearing a 'sleep shade' every day, all day, and that is very scary at times, but also, it was amazing!  It was really the best decision I ever made in my life.  If your husband applies for and receives aid from the government via disability, SSI, or both, the program will be totally paid for.  He has to go there and LIVE there as a student for the entirety of the program, but they take care of everything.  You live in one of the apartments, free.  The only thing you pay for is the food you eat on a daily basis.  Whether it's McDonalds, groceries you buy, or eating out.  

I highly recommend you look into their programs.  They are National Federation of the Blind affiliated.  A lot of the instructors are visually impaired or blind themselves.

I really don't ever look people in the eye, because I have a strange combination of exotropia.  My left eye looks to the left.  My right eye is in a normal position.  But if I close my right eye and look at an object only with my left eye, it shifts into the correct position.  Can't explain it well, but my eye doctors have said my eyes are unique, eccentric, nowhere near normal, and complicated.... LOL  I should get that tattooed on my body!

&amp;#x200B;

So nope, I don't look at people, really.  And most of the times in life when I have, like if I'm looking at a cashier, for instance, they bob their head and look behind them, as if to look and see what I'M looking at, and it is SO embarrassing!!!  I can't tell you how terrible it makes me feel.  But as I've gotten older, I've learned NTGAF.  

&amp;#x200B;

And also, what I've learned as I've gotten older, because wisdom really does come with age, older adults UNDERSTAND and not make a big deal out of a disability.  With age comes respect and understanding.  It's the young ones, the teenagers, and young adults who don't know any better yet, that will still snicker and laugh behind your back, or right in front of you.  You have to learn to let it roll off of your back, or get a backbone and tell them to quit acting like a 5 year old, to GROW TF up!

People that know me know my eyes are strange.  No one seems to care if I look at them or not.  My husband, he is used to it, like my mom, and tells me over and over again that they don't notice anything wrong with my eyes.  Maybe they really don't see it....  I don't know.  But hey, it's ok.  Don't worry so much about this situation--  Just be you.  And BE HAPPY.  That's all you can really want in life--to be happy, because there really is no point to it.  Just life.

I'm <PERSON>.  I'm 51, and I've been legally blind since birth.  My acuity is 20/200 and 20/400 at its best.  I really don't ever look people in the eye, because I have a strange combination of exotropia.  My left eye looks to the left.  My right eye is in a normal position.  But if I close my right eye and look at an object only with my left eye, it shifts into the correct position.  Can't explain it well, but my eye doctors have said my eyes are unique, eccentric, nowhere near normal, and complicated.... LOL  I should get that tattooed on my body!

&amp;#x200B;

So nope, I don't look at people, really.  And most of the times in life when I have, like if I'm looking at a cashier, for instance, they bob their head and look behind them, as if to look and see what I'M looking at, and it is SO embarrassing!!!  I can't tell you how terrible it makes me feel.  But as I've gotten older, I've learned NTGAF.  

&amp;#x200B;

And also, what I've learned as I've gotten older, because wisdom really does come with age, older adults UNDERSTAND and not make a big deal out of a disability.  With age comes respect and understanding.  It's the young ones, the teenagers, and young adults who don't know any better yet, that will still snicker and laugh behind your back, or right in front of you.  You have to learn to let it roll off of your back, or get a backbone and tell them to quit acting like a 5 year old, to GROW TF up!

&amp;#x200B;

People that know me know my eyes are strange.  No one seems to care if I look at them or not.  My husband, he is used to it, like my mom, and tells me over and over again that they don't notice anything wrong with my eyes.  Maybe they really don't see it....  I don't know.  But hey, it's ok.  Don't worry so much about this situation--  Just be you.  And BE HAPPY.  That's all you can really want in life--to be happy, because there really is no point to it.  Just life.  Make it yours, grab it by the horns, and do whatever it takes to make YOU happy.

1311,"This will be a wonderful learning experience for you!  And for him, perhaps he'll learn more about mortgages!  

Now, just RELAX.  When he gets there, shake his hand.  Do you know if he will be bringing along a guide dog for the blind, or a white cane?  Doesn't matter!  Just tell him where the chair is.  ""The chair is right in front of you, a little to the left...""  He will find it!   You won't have to take him by the elbow and guide him.  Blind people generally HATE that kind of handling, UNLESS they specifically ASK you for help.  And most will not.  Because we hate that.  Our white cane can tell us so much information about a room.  We will find our way!  

IF you must go up stairs or use an elevator, or escalator, please be sure to mention that.  And maybe mention again, something like, ""The escalator is ahead a few paces, a little to your right.""  The white cane, and/or guide dog, will work its magic.    


Tell him that you have never met a person who is totally blind, (or visually impaired?  Not sure if you ever have), and so you are not too sure what you can do to make this process easier.  Ask him what you CAN do to help out.  He may bring along a sighted friend who will be able to assist.  

All you have to do is treat him like a normal person, because that is what he is.  He's just like you and me.  He just cannot see.  And trust me, blind people have super powers.  Trust me, I know!  I've been legally blind since birth.  We. Can. HEAR. Things!  LOL!  So don't try to slip out the door and talk smack about him to your co-worker.  Don't sit there and flip them off with the finger just to see IF they are TRULY blind, because a lot of people, like myself, who have some vision, are categorically considered ""Blind,"" and we might give you the impression we can't see squat, when we CAN.  LOL  I'm just kidding about the smack talk and flipping the bird.  I know you would never EVER do either of those, riiiight?    But truly, we CAN hear better than you think.  And we might just see something.  You'll never know.  ;-P  


So just take it easy.  Ask about his screen reading software.  You truly WILL marvel at it.  It is very cool indeed.   Ask about his guide dog, if he brings one.  This is your chance to ask the questions about being blind that you've always wondered about!  Take the plunge!!    


Relax and don't be nervous at all.  This is just another human being you are meeting with--- so do as you do with any other client.  Offer coffee.  :-)  And ask if there is anything you can do to make going over all of that paperwork easier.  Your client might request more time, at home with the paperwork, to review all of it.  Maybe, maybe not.  I have no idea what you are dealing with, but I do know from experience that mortgages and real estate come with a LOT of paperwork.  So you might need to ask if he needs more time to review that stuff, more time than a sighted client would need.  Offer to provide extra time to go over any questions he might have after reading the copious amount of paperwork and documents.

1350,"I have done it a lot and usually found it way better than a hotel because you have one on one interaction with the owner, unlike a hotel where they're usually trying to sort you out then run off to another task. However, with airbnb there are a couple of things to be aware of.

First, airbnb is now a full time business for a lot of people and sometimes it isn't just about renting out a spare room. You need to develop your understanding of which listings are homeowners renting a spare room, and which are landlords who own a lot of different properties and put them all on airbnb. Obviously you want to rent your room from a homeowner who will be there when you arrive as opposed to someone who will try to give you a code for a code lock and never meet you during your entire stay.

Second, this is one situation where I'm really clear about the disability from the first interaction and I make sure that they can absolutely be there when I am likely to arrive. Even homeowners have work and other life stuff going on and aren't always at home, so you need to make sure they understand you can't just turn up and pull the key out from under the doormat. If you are delayed for some reason, then you need to start problem solving, and I have ended up hanging out at airports, where there are usually sensible helpers, drinking coffee until my airbnb host gets home.

I have only had one really negative issue with airbnb where I arrived to discover that it was in fact a rented apartment in a big complex. Apartment complexes usually do not allow people to sub rent the units like that, so when I turned up, nobody was there, I called the guy who put the listing up, and in the end he had to call the building manager and explain what was going on. The building manager immediately got very upset about how the guy shouldn't have been doing what he was doing and I basically had to calm the manager down. The upside was that airbnb found me another listing very nearby and paid the difference in price themselves. You can't guarantee never to have a problem, but you can have good problem solving skills and in my experience they do.

You are taking a risk on the host being someone who can behave reasonably around you. It is important to establish that before you make the booking. Otherwise, with these notes in mind, go for it.",,,,DrillInstructorJan,,,1575286178,t5_2qpec,t3_e4eo2m,t3_e4eo2m,1,1584307865,0,0,f9fupfg,Blind,,,,,

I guess we have something in common but I am always kind of torn between wanting to say things I hope will help, and not wanting to go stomping in there not knowing anyone involved personally, so this advice may not be worth much.

The identity thing is huge and it is sometimes not helped by people who went blind very young, or were born to it, who tend to not really understand what it's like. Even now, twenty years later, there are absolutely times when it really chafes that I can't be the person who's running around like a nutcase doing everything at once, at least not as much as I want. Lots of people will give you advice as to how to get used to that and in my experience you won't, not completely. But here's what I think is important. You don't have to find a way to like it. You do have to find a way to be okay with not liking it, in the same way you might not like climate change or chinese food and other things you can't do anything about, and it doesn't cause you total depression every single day.

Probably there isn't any way to stop it affecting your outlook. We are all just a sum of our experiences. There's no trick, though achievement helps. I have a career, I (sort of) employ other people, I contribute an equal share to paying the mortgage, I have a great partner and friends who don't even think of me as disabled. I personally found that a lot of people and organisations who want to help are very well meaning but have really low expectations because they are run by people who were born to this situation.

1383,"This year I got a waterproof loudspeaker from my wife. I absolutely love it and I'm super excited about it.

The story behind it is that a few months ago our apartment got renovated. Our bathroom looks/feels really nice and new now but unfortunately we had to get rid of a small closet which we used to store shampoos, soap and other stuff like that. I love to listen to music in the shower and sing along. I suffer from depression but this is something that always cheers me up and brightens my day. Back when we had that closet, I used to put my laptop computer on top to play the music. Now this is not possible anymore. For a while I considered buying a new closet but my wife made me realize it's not an option. As part of the renovation, the builders constructed a little wall behind the sink that makes our already small bathroom even smaller. This means that if I bought a new closet, we couldn't properly sit on the toilet anymore.

For the past few months I have been very sad about this. I tried to get used to silent showers but it's simply not the same. It's so boring. I tried to sing without music but it wasn't as much fun as before.

Now that I have this loudspeaker, I can connect it to my computer via bluetooth and then I can put it anywhere in the bathroom I want. I could even take it into the shower with me since it's waterproof. So now I can finally listen to music again and this makes me very happy :). In fact, it's even better than before because the loudspeaker volume can be turned up more than that of my laptop computer. This means I can now even listen to podcasts or audiobooks in the shower and I can make it loud enough that I will still understand everything over the noise of the water.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1577238172,t5_2qpec,t3_ef8pq7,t3_ef8pq7,5,1586004382,0,0,fbz8973,Blind,,,,,
1384,"Personally, I don't like duolingo because it teaches foreign languages in an extremely unstructured way. You basically learn a bunch of words but you never properly learn how to put them all together or how they fit into the bigger system of the language itself. I see duolingo mostly as a helpful tool for people who want to learn a few expressions before they go on vacation.

Some people (including you) may feel different and that's of course fine. There are also various styles of learning foreign languages. Myself, I need a highly systematic and organized approach. I want to understand the basic grammatical structure before I go crazy on random vocab. Basically, I want to feel as though I was sitting in a classroom without actually sitting in a classroom. This is particularly important to me because the language I'm intending to learn is one that is A) extremely different from my native tongue and B) one that I want to get fluent at (because it's my wife's native tongue).

For this purpose I've decided to subscribe to Rosetta Stone online. Granted, it's pretty expensive and unfortunately it's not very accessible at all. It works quite a lot with pictures.

1387,"Mostly sound. Maybe aura a little bit for people who are extremely close to me, such as my wife and my parents.

That being said, recognizing family members inside the house isn't hard. For a blind person like me, that's the easiest thing in the world. Not only is the circle of possible individuals very limited but you also won't be surprised if you meet any of them. For example if you go to the bathroom and you see your dad or your sister in the hallway, it's probably something that can be expected.

What is extremely challenging is recognizing A) people you barely know B) in public places C) where you least expect it.

I'll give you an example. I once met a guy from uni in another country. We happened to visit the same tourist spot at the same time and so he saw me and called out my name. Now, this would already be super tough if it was your best friend but I hardly even knew this dude. We attended one seminar together. That's 14 weeks of class. The seminar had ended just 2 months earlier and so he was probably still able to remember my face. I, on the other hand, really struggled to remember his voice. I knew that I knew him from somewhere but... oh God... where???

These moments can sometimes be incredibly awkward. I remember walking through my city and seemingly random strangers excitedly shouting my name and walking to me.

1388,"Navigating around the house is actually quite easy. I do, however, bump into quite a lot of stuff and hurt myself. It's a bit hard to avoid this because I live in a relatively small European apartment. Although my wife and I don't have too much stuff, the apartment feels quite full. Also, the apartment has recently been fully renovated but it was actually built in the early 1970s. In those days, people in my country were really into things like narrow hallways. I often miscalculate my exact direction and miss the door opening, crashing into the door frame. This happens especialy when I move quickly because I'm in a hurry. In the beginning I used to get very angry and swear a lot because sometimes it can hurt like shit but I've grown used to it. I guess it's just part of being blind. I could be more careful but sometimes I'm simply too impatient for that.

What's far more challenging than navigation around the house/apartment is re-locating items. This is especially true if the item isn't something you use regularly. Most blind people have a very clear system and every item has its special spot. For example a lot of sighted people misplace their keys, their wallet or their glasses. None of this could happen to me because when I'm done using something, I make absolutely sure it goes back to where it belongs. If I didn't do that, I'd go crazy from constantly searching stuff. My wife and I employ a cleaning lady that comes once a week to clean our apartment and sometimes she takes certain items away from their spot and doesn't put them back. It's particularly tricky because she puts those items somewhere different every time she comes. For example she might take my computer hard drive off the coffee table to clean it but then she puts it on the big living room table. Or next to the TV. Or on the book shelf. Or the couch. Basically, it could be anywhere. I've tried to explain to her that she shouldn't do that but I think she finds it hard to avoid. I completely understand it - after all, it's not an issue for sighted people. If the hard drive lies on the couch next to coffee table, you immediately see it. But if you're blind, it might as well be on the dark side of the moon.

1389,"I feel very torn about these kind of people. On the one hand, they are certainly inspiring. On the other hand, though, blind people are constantly forced and expected to over-perform in life in order to overcome various hurdles, whether it be in their career or private life. This puts an immense pressure on the blind community as a whole and the fact that some folks ""make it big"" only increases this pressure. For example if someone tells me about a famous musician or a successful businessman who is blind, my mind immediately goes to: ""Oh thanks. If I didn't feel shitty about my accomplishments in life already, now I definitely do."" Admittedly, this way of think may be a bit destructive but I can't help it. As someone who's gone blind as an adult, I feel the pressure very strongly. I used to excel at school, in an all-sighted environment, planning big things for my future. Now I sit here and everything feels so exhausting. There's a line in Breaking Bad where Walter says to his wife: ""My former colleagues have surpassed me in every way imaginable."" I often feel that way when I look at my sighted friends. However, at least with them I can tell myself that they're sighted... so it's different. Obviously they have it much easier in life. But then someone tells me there's this blind music or science genius and it makes me feel like crap because they are also blind and got much further in life than I have.

I imagine that some women may also feel this way to a lesser extend. Since it's very tough to have this outstanding career as a woman, most of the ones who make it are very strong-minded individuals. However, there are also women who aren't so strong-minded and I'm sure some of them feel guilty because someone else did it and they didn't, so it seems like they are losers because clearly it's not an unachievable task. For blind people, this feeling is even much stronger because the disability is a greater hurdle and when you overcome it, it's particularly awesome.

Another reason why I don't like these stories so much is because they give sighted people the misconception that every blind person is a wunderkind. I remember a TV ad from 2018 where you first see a bunch of blind individuals (who are clearly all regular folks) singing songs by Andrea Bocelli. Then the screen cuts to black and a voice from the off says: ""Not every blind person is a world-famous singer. Please donate.""

As someone who's gone blind as an adult, I feel the pressure very strongly. I used to excel at school, in an all-sighted environment, planning big things for my future. Now I sit here and everything feels so exhausting. There's a line in Breaking Bad where <PERSON> says to his wife: ""My former colleagues have surpassed me in every way imaginable."" I often feel that way when I look at my sighted friends. However, at least with them I can tell myself that they're sighted... so it's different. Obviously they have it much easier in life. But then someone tells me there's this blind music or science genius and it makes me feel like crap because they are also blind and got much further in life than I have.

I imagine that some women may also feel this way to a lesser extend. Since it's very tough to have this outstanding career as a woman, most of the ones who make it are very strong-minded individuals. However, there are also women who aren't so strong-minded and I'm sure some of them feel guilty because someone else did it and they didn't, so it seems like they are losers because clearly it's not an unachievable task. For blind people, this feeling is even much stronger because the disability is a greater hurdle and when you overcome it, it's particularly awesome.

Another reason why I don't like these stories so much is because they give sighted people the misconception that every blind person is a wunderkind. I remember a TV ad from 2018 where you first see a bunch of blind individuals (who are clearly all regular folks) singing songs by <PERSON>. Then the screen cuts to black and a voice from the off says: ""Not every blind person is a world-famous singer. Please donate."" I thought that was a really great ad.","[{'start': 2278, 'end': 2286, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 973, 'end': 981, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
1390,"It's interesting you say this because I actually feel very different. As someone who is going through the horribly unique process of losing my vision slowly but steadily, I am currently all sadness and sorrow about my disability. I'm now almost fully blind and I suffer from really bad depression from this whole thing. Contrary to your experience, however, I don't feel like I can talk about any of this to anyone aside from my therapist and maybe my wife. I most certainly can't expect people to make sweet comments. I have tried many times to talk about it in public situations (e.g. among friends) and the reaction is always the same: people get suuuper awkward. They're like: ""yeah uhhh, that sounds really sad... so, who wants some more cake??"" Even people who are relatively close to me have no idea how to handle this whole thing. So, from your comment it sounds like people around you try a little too hard to be compassionate but I actually wish people around me cared more about my vision problems and how it makes me feel. I remember last year I showed up for a family dinner with my white cane for the first time and literally the only thing my older brother said was: ""Huh. That's kinda crazy."" He never brought up the topic again, neither to ask me questions about it nor to make statements about the situation.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1575574550,t5_2qpec,t3_e5u5jh,t1_f9myi96,5,1584522246,0,0,f9rcvlf,Blind,,,,,
1391,"I'm from Switzerland. A good amount of my early sex education came from my parents. I was fortunate enough to be raised by very progressive-thinking and easy-going parents. Especially my dad is cool in this regard. His goofy comments and jokes can sometimes be a bit cringy but in a charming way. When I was 12 he had a really wonderful father-son convo with me that I still remember today. We talked about girls and masturbation. He asked me about my experiences and told me very personal memories from his own puberty. I still really cherish this memory. Long before that, around age 3-4, my mom began to read picture books to me. They had illustrations of naked people and explained things like pregnancy.

Later, in school, I had sex ed twice. The first time was in Elementary School, around age 11. Our teacher made all of us write questions onto paper slips and put them into a cotton bag. The girls would ask questions that address male sexuality and vice versa. We then spent several lessons going through all of the questions. The teacher would always first read the question and then ask one of the addressed group girls/guys to answer it. For example a boy might ask ""what does it feel like to be on your period?"" and one of the girls would answer it for everyone. If nobody raised their hand, the teacher would simply pick someone. Afterwards, the teacher would add a few points, maybe correct something, explain it with easy science etc. I remember it was fun but of course we were all super embarrassed and giggling constantly. ""She said penis!! Hihihihi!!!""

Later, in high school, I had sex ed one more time (around age 17) but by now we were all pretty grown-up and also the material was much drier. It heavily focused on biology, anatomy, physiology and at the end there was an exam. We knew the exam would be difficult because all of our biology exas were, and so there wasn't much to laugh about anymore.

During my time in high school I spent one year in America as a foreign exchange student. From this experience I would say the biggest difference between Switzerland's and America's sex ed is that Swiss schools operate without any fear or intimidation. Also, our teachers didn't have an obsession with STDs. I felt like my American teachers had a weird obsession where they couldn't talk about anything else. I don't remember any of them ever saying: ""you know guys, sex is a really awesome and fun activity."" All I ever heard was ""BEWARE THE STDS!!!!"" In my school in Switzerland it wasn't like that. We did learn about HIV and other diseases but it was just one issue among many. I think in the end our teachers tried to give us a pleasurable take on sex rather than a scary one.

In terms of accessibility, it wasn't a huge problem me back then because my vision was considerably better. As a child I had about 30/100 vision on both eyes. In high school this figure had already dropped dramatically; my left eye was now completely blind and my right eye was down to 20/100. However, this was still enough to study all the school material as long as my teachers made enlarged photocopies for me (which they did).

Unfortunately, life itself hasn't given me many chances to explore my sexuality and I very much blame that on my blindness/disability. I see other people in this thread talking about their ""sexual partners"" (plural) and I'm both amazed and envious. I was always very much rejected as a potential boyfriend (let alone a hookup) by the female world. I know this is because of my disability because I've been complimented on my looks and I'm a pretty smooth talker. Also, the indifference from the female world has increasingly gotten worse the worse my vision became. Now that I walk around with a white cane I don't think women my age even view me as a ""guy"" and therefore as a potential sexual partner. I think there is this weird idea that sighted people unconsciously carry around with themselves that blind individuals are like a neutered, asexual species. It's particularly difficult for blind guys - at least in my country. Most women here still really like the traditional gender ideas, even among the young generation. So, a man has to be a strong protector and all that. If you're blind however, you tend to come across as insecure and many times I have gotten this vibe from girls my age of ""oooh, yeah uhhh... this stumbling around and accidentally walking into stuff... big, big turn-off.""

This is just an idea but as a nerdy/studious guy, I would suggest going into academia. I have myself thought about it many times. I'm currently at the end of my Masters and I do have an urge to pursue a PhD and go into research. Unfortunately in my case this would be difficult because I'm already in my early 30s (my studies took forever due to my disability).

If it wasn't for this issue though, I would totally do it. I'm a very inquisitive person and I love learning new things. Also, when you work in academia you do technically work in an office but it's obviously very different from normal office jobs. The atmosphere is much calmer and peaceful.
