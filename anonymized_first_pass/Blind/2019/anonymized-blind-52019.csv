0,I don’t know what I have. The doctors are unsure. Which is very reassuring.. they haven’t even checked for that even though I’ve asked if that is what it is (that’s what it sounds like but it could be many others I don’t know). When I asked they just said that it was a slim possibility but I could get an appointment in with a specialist in October if I wanted to know. So I made the appointment knowing full and well I’ll probably be in much worse condition by then.,,,,AhaArt64,,,1558312941,t5_2qpec,t3_bqmpkf,t1_eo62vdn,3,1562910106,0,0,eo66y3s,Blind,,,,,

13,"Really sceptical that it's wise to navigate without a cane. I could see how this could be helpful as a supplement to a cane, but not a substitute. Specifically how well would it do at detecting variations on the ground, like steps, holes, etc? How good would it be at detecting obstacles at a low height, such as bollards? Considering one would wear them on one's face, the angle of view for such things might not be very good.

Even if detection is good and accurate, it also needs to be conveyed to the user in a timely fashion, and in a comprehensible way that allows them to act on the information. How do you explain someone, fast enough, that there's a hole on the ground 10cm ahead of their right foot?

That said, that one would need a cane to navigate doesn't necessarily make this useless. But I'd try not to oversell, because a lot of blind people are justly sceptical of those kinds of incredible claims.

Also how's the situation with positioning accuracy? Are you using topographies and GPS?

&amp;#x200B;

My efforts are moving along and I have about 23 pages of another comic book of mine converted into 3D to use as a showcase for the concept.

I realized I could (more quickly than otherwise) create a proof of concept that people can relate to in the convention circuit (plan attending at least ArtBubble in Copenhagen fall 2019) and hopefully a couple in 2020 and in connection with funding this and the continued efforts with Reckoning I've been mulling over how I can better garner financial support for the efforts as I need to pay off modelers to put the finishing touches to the 23 pages I've converted on my own as well as for more models in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love it if you would read through the following and let me know what you think.  

&amp;#x200B;

Below here I have cut and pasted a description I made that can be used to present potential paid fundraising collaborators.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a collaboration partner interested in helping me fundraise this venture that can be of interest to blind people all over the world as the techniques developed can be implemented by other creators helping to start a thriving comic book scene catering for the blind

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Einar Petersen and I am in the process of developing a comic book series that can be read by blind. This might sound counter intuitive but hang on a moment!

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing 3D print technology it is possible for me to get the panels on each page to rise up from the flat surface and that means that the comic book can be read with the fingertips but it does not stop there. 

&amp;#x200B;

All texts are naturally in braille and it is thus possible to read the dialog but on top of that a so called action description page is created that explains in more detail what each image is about and what is happening in the panel.

&amp;#x200B;

5 albums are ready in a so called draft mode, this means each panel i drawn and production is now underway of models for each panel, models that can also be printed individually adding a spacial dimension to the reading process. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Reckoning is about a comic-book apocalypse, it is about breaking free of the mold and lift comic books into the future and hence it is the intent to make Reckoning readable online using haptic technology and there it is possible to take things even further and allow the reader to in full size or at scale to truly feel every nut and bolt, every dent and bend of the models on each panel in full detail.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently the work is progressing aided by primarily private people supporting the project on Patreon where they support with an amount going from a dollar and up on a monthly basis. This is done on  [https://patreon.com/einarpetersen](https://patreon.com/einarpetersen)

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts on collaboration fundraising wise is that a sales person could recruit patrons to the project - These can support on patreon or they can support the project directly.

&amp;#x200B;

For recruited patrons signing up on Patreon and who stay Patrons longer than 0,5 USD given the recruit stays a Patron for more than 62 days.

&amp;#x200B;

in addition I would be willing to for 12 months to pay out an additional bonus of 10% percent of the amount a particulate Patron has signed up for given the Patron stays a Patron for a full 13 months and that the Patron does not ask for a refund as per the money back guarantee I am offering to Patrons.

&amp;#x200B;

It may not sound like a lot however nobody says you need to limit yourself to private individuals, companies would be welcome sponsors all they need is a company credit card or ability for making a direct bank transfer and only the ceiling on their card /bank account decides what you could earn in return commission.

&amp;#x200B;

For such a corporate sponsor naturally the payout for someone signing up as a sponsor on Patreon this would follow the same pattern as above.

&amp;#x200B;

However for a company willing to support directly I would be able to post about their sponsor support and to issue an invoice for sponsor support that they could then deduct according to their local tax code.

&amp;#x200B;

The sponsorship would be an annual purchase and non refundable once signed. A sales representative gettig a deal in house would be able to get a 10% royalty on the value of a sponsorship

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to hear your and everyone elses thoughts on this model.

&amp;#x200B;

I would prefer the salesperson being someone who understands what it means to be blind and what it would mean to open up accessibility to a media not know for being accessible.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what you think 

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards

Make sure you keep getting him out to do things. Don't let him withdraw in  a depressive state. Even if he gets depressed, try and keep him in engaged.

52,"No offense dude, but you are kind of over-teching this.

The rate of smartphone ownership is about the same in blind people as in sighted people. There are many guides and resources about smartphone accessibility software, such as Voiceover and Talkback. Same with computers. There are tons of apps that help with landmarks and navigation such as a Google maps, blindsquare, nearby explorer, and moovit.

&gt;What are the biggest/most common challenges blind people face when trying to navigate outdoors?  
&gt;  
&gt;Do blind people ever use google maps/alternative navigation software to navigate?  
&gt;  
&gt;Do blind people prefer to travel independently or with a partner?  
&gt;  
&gt;When using electronic devices, what accessibility feature often make buttons/switches/feedback more useful and intuitively understood?  
&gt;  
&gt;Do blind people need help plugging in devices to charge? For totally visually impaired people, what chargers are the easiest to use?

These questions are really homogenizing and don't take into consideration the differences between individuals, their O&amp;M training, their urban (or suburban) landscapes, their experience with cane or guide dog usage, level of vision, types of vision, level of hearing or lack thereof, or the potential for other disabilities to be present, which would profoundly intersect with experiences of being blind.

You appear to be approaching this from an idea that there is ""the blind experience."" This is not correct. There are as many blind experiences out there as there are people out there.

I highly suggest a thorough review of literature by blind people, including blogs and YouTube channels. And I encourage you to think about your end goal. Why did you choose this type of system specifically? How do you envision this being used? What are some tangible benefits that you're aiming for?

100,"The best we can do at this point is call the assholes out! The last thing completely blind people like myself need is another stupid piece of plastic in a wallet that we don't know what it is, that we'd have to constantly pull out because of idiots. Most of the financial system is inaccessible, and several other systems as well, because of stupid idiots trying to defraud everyone. We can't be paranoid as a society, because that's not going to help. Security should be getting less, instead of more! Every single law, particularly when it involves accessibility, is designed to protect the criminals. An ID is easier to fake than a service dog, so this solves nothing. The general trend toward trading freedoms for fear and fake, and useless surveillance is not helping anyone. I have to fill in a form to get my bank to fill in a form, to fill in a form to fill in my taxes, because none of it is brailled, and I did not learn handwriting, because I don't read print, so I'm constantly running into trouble with several things in society. Touch screens are also fairly evil. And then there is artificial intelligence that is designed for someone other than me, so all service dog ID is doing is just adding more paranoia to an already paranoid society! Stop it! I had used an expired government ID in at least 6 places or more over a period of a year, and nobody told me it was expired! So would they even check a dog ID at all?

104,"This firm doesn't sound like it might be any better than the litigious drive-by lawyers. It is preying on fear of litigation rather than actually suing. The law may be ambiguous but that is a function of making somewhat timeless and evolving but the standards based on existing case law are pretty clear; W3C WCAG 2.0 AA is internationally accepted as a baseline appropriate standard for public web sites. This deferral to standards is no different than the ADA relying on building codes for determination of acceptable physical disability standards.

Where is the evidence that anyone has actually been put out of business by web accessibility demands? There have been many urban legend-grade stories about the one time that some bad lawyers did it to this one restaurant or company which seem to be mostly based on stories about physical accommodations being repurposed for a new boogeyman. It sounds like a more useful sales tool or political pitch than reality.

Basic web accessibility is not super hard or expensive. Done up front it adds a small percentage to the cost of developing the website and a modest amount for basic testing. If you have followed HTML best practices than you are probably pretty accessible already. Remediation of an existing site can be more expensive but it certainly isn't 10x expensive or even 2x expensive than the cost of developing the site in the first place.

One thing to avoid is the specialized mitigation tools; ""Pay us a fee and we'll install a magic plugin that makes your site accessible without any work. Guaranteed, we'll even give you a seal"" These are uniformly a waste of money and provide very limited benefit if any. They can also hinder the accessibility in some cases.

It's not that my hearing is great or anything like that, rather, it's from years of practice of dropping coins and having to quickly decide if it's worth grovelling on the floor to find the dropped coin. I'm not grovelling for 5 cents but I might for 20 cents.

133,"&gt; I want you to also accept that it’s OK to ask help. you did it when you were a child and nobody thought less of you. Doing it as an adult means you’re mature enough to know your limits.

I do ask for help, but only for essential things, because otherwise I feel like I'm abusing people's goodwill.

&gt; There’s shit tons of stuff you can do. You can be an international sports star, work in govt or business (at any level), you can be a killer book author or musician.

I'm aware of that, but I imagine that the people who do that sort of thing must have a very high tolerance for discomfort.  I used to be a programmer before going blind, something that I could, at least in theory, continue to do, but I've tried it with text-to-speech and it took me a day and a half to do something that normally would take me half an hour to accomplish, and that experience left me feeling like I am no longer in control.  I could also try Braille, but I'm not sure I will ever adapt to it since currently I struggle a lot with it, and a Braille display is too expensive to be left collecting dust if I fail to adapt.

154,"I couldn't agree more. You've put it perfectly. This is exactly where my bitterness comes from as well. Obviously I'm not angry at the author or anything like that. I acknowledge that our experiences are all different and unique. I wasn't offended by the satire. I just... felt bitter for the reasons you've stated. I'm still sort of in this adjustment phase and I frequently feel like I'm not allowed to ever complain or cry. For example I have practically no friends, so the three people I've tried to go to for emotional support in this incredibly difficult stage of my life are my wife and my parents. My parents, though they love me very much, find it really tough to accept my going blind. They've never openly said it but I can feel it. They don't like talking about it and always approach my complaints in a very functional way. If I say that I'm depressed or frustrated because I can't do certain things anymore, they usually pivot to: ""you should call your local office for the blind and ask them about training and accessibility tools for this."" And then my mom would nag me for the next 2-3 weeks with daily text messages whether I have already contacted those people and when I'll be doing it. They don't seem to understand that sometimes people just want to vent. Or cry. Or maybe they do understand it but don't want to hear it because it's painful to make yourself emotionally conscious of the fact that your son is going blind and there's nothing you can do. 

My wife, meanwhile, tells me these things even more openly. If I complain a bit too much, she usually says: ""I'm very sorry but why don't you discuss these things with your therapist"". She has told me quite explicitly that she doesn't want to hear too much about my struggles because it pulls her down too, emotionally. She says ""that's what you've got a therapist for."" And somehow I totally get her. It's exhausting to have a partner who is sad often; especially considering that I used to be a very cheerful person in the past.

But at the same time, these reactions also put me under lots of pressure. They make me feel as though my therapist is the only person I'm allowed to vent to and other than that I'm supposed to just... bottle it all up. I'm a bit sick of having to walk around with a fake smile and pretend that I'm great when in reality I'm not. I know that people with depression often feel this way but in my case it is directly related to my going blind. I've never suffered from depression before and there's no family history of depression. So it would be strange to claim that my current problems are not related to my eyes.

Anyway, I didn't want to make this so long. Sorry for that. In essence, this is why I've come here. I appreciate the fact that people in this forum can be open about their feelings and they get taken seriously on an emotional level, not just a practical one. Because I think that's super important for people like myself who are trying to eventually get to a place of acceptance.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1557864452,t5_2qpec,t3_bobdlp,t1_enep6r0,1,1562156330,0,0,enidkl9,Blind,,,,,

173,"What I personally don't like about this satire is that it emphasizes the fact that many people in this forum try extremely hard to pretend as though being blind is a piece of cake and really not much different from being sighted. In my opinion, this is a lie that lots of blind individuals tell themselves in order to feel better about their own fate or maybe in order to gain acceptance. ""Hey look, I'm exactly the same as you, please like me!"" and ""I'm tough, I can take this, my life is not more difficult than that of a sighted person!""

In my opinion, this is a misguided positivity that does injustice to the enormous efforts most of us truly make. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that people would wallow in self-pity. However, I believe the other extreme is just as unhealthy. Personally, I have the self-security to admit that no, my life is not the same as that of a sighted person. I'd be lying if I said that. Yes, certain aspects of body hygiene can be tricky. Yes, traveling on my own has indeed become very challenging since I became blind. Yes, I have gone through extensive O&amp;M training and I still sometimes walk into stuff or have my cane accidentally impale me which can be very painful. Yes, cooking and eating has become more difficult. It doesn't mean that I can't do those things as a blind person but I certainly can't do them as well as I used to. My chopsticks skills used to be great for example, now I often struggle to pick things up. Yes, school has become much harder with practically no sight. I've now been studying at my university for a grand total of 10 years and I still don't have my Master's. Much of this has to do with my blindness. I was always a very good student and I'm convinced that if I were sighted, I could have finished my studies far, far quicker. Yes, I do sometimes feel very dependent on people and yes, in some ways I **am**. 

To acknowledge these things is not to be whiny. It simply means that I have the ability to be realistic. In some ways, being blind really fucking sucks and I believe we may and should admit that. I don't think this forced positivity of ""my life is perfect, blindness gives me absolutely zero problems, I've got everything figured out"" is helpful.

193,"The best explanation I have come up with so far is that it feels as though you don't even have a visual organ.

Let me explain.

I'm currently blind on my left eye and I'm going blind on my right eye. When I close my eyes, I see darkness. And that's the point: I ***see*** darkness. My right eye, which still has a bit of remaining vision, sees darkness. The same is true when I enter a completely dark room. I can't actually see chairs or the table etc. but I can see the color black.

Now, for comparison, my left eye feels as though it wasn't even there. Of course I feel it in a purely tactile sense, I can feel how it's lying in my skull and sometimes it hurts etc. But visually, my brain is under the illusion that I'm a cyclop. Visually, it feels exactly the same as it would feel like if I had been born with only one time.

If you want to imagine what it's like to be blind, try to see with your forehead or your naval (as someone else said). Imagine that you have three arms and try to feel your third arm. There's just... nothing.

If that sounds too weird, think of extraterrestrials visiting you and telling you that they can experience the world in 5 dimensions (compared to our 4). Rationally, you might totally understand this and you can even prove mathematically that a 5th dimension exists but what does it actually FEEL like to experience 5 dimensions? It's something none of us can even grasp because we are stuck in our 4-dimensional world. This is what I imagine the world to be like for people who have never seen in their life. If you tell them the ocean is blue and pastures are green, they will understand this on a rational level but what *are* colors actually?? What does seeing actually feel like?? What does light feel like? For people who have been born blind, this is about as abstract as a 5th dimensions sounds to us humans.",,,,KingWithoutClothes,,,1558481685,t5_2qpec,t3_bq8v96,t3_bq8v96,1,1563064414,0,0,eodv21i,Blind,,,,,

215,"I'm a sighted person. Something as mundane as the flag would definitely go unnoticed because it has no bearing on what I'm doing. I go by the mailbox one hundred times and it means nothing to me unless it's my intended target. We  get so much visual input our brains have to focus on what is needed. For example, if I'm driving my vehicle I really don't care about the mailbox flag because I'm looking for the neighbor kid who likes to zoom his bike out into the street without looking. It's the same thing for hearing. My VIP boyfriend can easily tell whether I'm sitting or standing and which room of the house I'm in when I'm on the phone with him. When I ask him how he knows he'll just say ""because I use my ears!""

I'm a second-grade teacher and have had multiple students who were deaf. One little guy I taught had just received his hearing aids as a seven year old. He hadn't heard a lot of sounds and so every single little extra sound he would turn to because he couldn't filter it out and was curious about it. He absolutely loved the sound of running water. He stood by the sink and turned the water on constantly. Water fountains were even cooler, according to him.

ZoomText is a great piece of software, but if you solely use magnification, in my opinion it's much better to get comfortable with and master using the standard Windows Magnifier.

I have my gripes with the standard Magnifier (namely that Microsoft STILL hasn't fixed broken shortcut keys relating to colour inversion even though they were reported back in 2016, but thankfully there's a workaround using colour filters), but being able to use the standard software is hugely advantageous in that you can then use any machine in your workplace quickly and easily. If you're only using ZoomText, you're limited to one main machine or having to move a physical USB key around or getting it installed on every machine by your IT department.

ZoomText was very resource heavy when I last used it (version 9.1), whereas the standard Magnifier is very light and responsive, with no bloating features that you'll probably never use if you just want to use zoom.

232,"Sighted person here.  I am definitely guilty of similar things and its interesting to think of how being sighted or not could impact this.  For me personally, I think these things generally happen when I'm in a hurry or have a lot on my mind.  Also my eyes can be wrong, sometimes when i'm tired or overwhelmed, or extremely stressed my eyes don't act totally normal.  It''s kind of like optical illusions where your eye sees your environment correctly but your brain gets tricked and confused.   I don't know what it would be like to have impaired sight but I would guess that I would need to be more attentive to senses or things that I'd depend on daily and because of that making stupid mistakes like these would be less likely. As someone with sight I really don't use my sense of texture to make conscious decisions.  Also if you are feeling what you are doing, these optical illusions wouldn't really be an issue.  That said, I imagine for someone without sight that when they are fatigued, or stressed their brain can still mess up understanding sensory inputs.  But in general I imagine you take a lot more care than I do, or than other sighted people do, at understanding the environment around you.

Also people are different.  Some people, even incredibly smart people, are space cadets and by that I just mean that they kinda live in their own world and have a difficult time getting even some really simple tasks right because of that.

249,"That’s pretty similar to my step-dad’s experience.

The only solution I’ve been able to come up with is:

1. Make it illegal to sell any kind of fake service animal accessories.  Have the guide dog foundations be the sole source of any kind of vests, badges, etc.  Better to put money in their pockets than some shady website.  

2. Have a National service animal registry, and make it illegal to claim a dog is a service animal when it is not.  This would not be so that handlers can prove their dog’s legitimacy to business operators, rather so that law enforcement could verify a dog suspected of being passed off as a service animal.  

Now, I don’t mean for the police to stop blind people every time they see one walking with a guide dog and do a check, that would be even worse.

I am working on a project to improve access to visual programming tools for users with visual impairments. My current study, involves the study of experiences and challenges in tool use, specifically in the use of scripts to increase accessibility in programming tasks.  If you are visually impaired, over 18,  and program in any language then I would appreciate 10 minutes of your time to fill out an online survey.

&gt;Hi,  
   
I am working on a project to improve access to visual programming tools for users with visual impairments. My current study, involves the study of experiences and challenges in tool use, specifically in the use of scripts to increase accessibility in programming tasks.  If you are visually impaired, over 18,  and program in any language then I would appreciate 10 minutes of your time to fill out an online survey.   
   
If you are interested, you can fill out the survey at LINK.  Participants will be entered into a raffle for one of two $50 Amazon gift cards.  The survey is at:  [<URL>(<URL>)

However, a samsung phone actually has it's own accessiblility program as well as google's program that you can download if you want. They both work well, depending on the programmers attention to detail. This is where they differ. Iphone programs are simpler and the programmers usually add all the coding to make it work well with accessibility. Android apps have more options, and since they are not regulated as strictly, the programmers don't consider the accessiblity option as carefully, and many times, don't care if you email them about things that need fixing.

You don't need to create any additional page or content, just create one page that is structured with the essential elements for access. The WCAG 2.0 details everything you need ([https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)) in detail, but in a nutshell:

* Make sure all your text content is semantically styled with headings and appropriate markup for valid HTML.
* Images and other non-textual content needs to have a textual description - images get alt text, videos get captions, charts get explanations, etc.
* Interactive elements and controls need to be keyboard controllable- anything that only works with a mouse is probably not accessible.
* Form fields need to have labels.
* If you use dynamic content or modals, ensure there are no keyboard traps where a user gets stuck in a menu or content piece that can not be exited or bypassed via the keyboard.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is you only create one webpage, and you follow the basic rules for accessibility so you only have to maintain one page- and the users all get the same content. No second class citizens, no ""extra"" work for accessibility- just properly structured content, and the technology does the heavy lifting for you.

&amp;#x200B;

It might be a little overwhelming at first, but the payoff is similar to using CSS instead of manually styling every element. Let the technology do what it was designed to do- you just need to coordinate the info into the proper (accessible) format.

A very helpful site for web accessibility is WebAIM- they are a non-profit dedicated to making the web accessible, and they provide a lot of free tutorials and a great community: [webaim.org](https://webaim.org).

323,"First, let me clarify that I am not blind.  However, I am a service dog handler (for other disabilities).  I’m personally fairly torn on the issue.  On one hand, an ID system would be useful for dealing with the fakes.  On the other, are the points that you made (wheelchair users don’t need an ID to prove that they need a wheelchair, nor should they).  In the end, I think it comes down to the practicality of it all.

An ID system really wouldn’t work.  Not and still allow owner training, which they pretty much have to because of not enough program dogs/trainers.  I mean what are you going to do?  Flash lights at an epileptic and see if their dog alerts before they have a seizure?  That would never fly.  At best they could verify a disability and do a public access test.  The rest they’d still have to take the handlers word on (and that’s exactly what some countries do for their “IDs”, such as Canada, not that it’s actually required there anyway).

People can and do lie to get those IDs even.  Any system where you are effectively taking the word of the handler to get the ID is going to have people lying sometimes.  There isn’t much difference between someone lying to a business or lying to an ID board.

The only positive I could see coming out of an ID system is that at least you would know the dog was trained well enough to pass a public access test.  However, if business were to enforce what they are legally allowed to (exclude dogs that are misbehaving), the much of that problem would solve itself. 

So, in the end, I’m still fairly torn on the idea, but I’m certainly not in the “ID will fix everything” camp because it won’t.

324,"Hello! I am sighted and know braille because I am a teacher of the visually impaired (TVI). People who are sighted generally read braille by sight, rather than by touch - a huge misconception is that those of us with sight read tactually, but by and large we do not. And that actually goes into another one of your questions. Adults who lose their vision have a harder time reading braille because finger sensitivity is kind of a learned thing. Our brains are plastic, but they are the most plastic when we’re little- so our capacity to do something like play an instrument, learn a language, or discriminate braille is going to be the best when we’re young. An adult who is learning braille can do it...eventually. Someone sighted? Virtually impossible. So if we look at the causes of blindness, a lot of that is acquired blindness- diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, age-related glaucoma, etc- and that explains why many adults don’t know braille. 


As far as why many kids aren’t learning braille, it’s a couple of reasons. Braille isn’t the right communication medium for a lot of visually impaired kids. Some do well with large print or magnified print and some have severe disabilities. The biggest thing is that we have had a huge increase over the last 20 years or so of kids being born with cortical visual impairment. It has become the leading cause of visual impairment in children. Kids with CVI tend to have complex impairments and generally are pre-literate or non-verbal. So braille is not a good fit for them. We definitely teach it whenever we can, don’t get me wrong. But there are a lot of factors at play. I think it is so important for our students to leave school with at least a basic knowledge of braille whenever it is appropriate, because it will help them so much in traveling and doing lots of basic everyday tasks, especially if there is a question about the stability of their vision moving forward.",,,,BrailleNomad,Sighted- TVI/O&amp;M,,1558066929,t5_2qpec,t3_bojm8c,t3_bojm8c,1,1562720806,0,0,env1tvw,Blind,,,blue2,,

But as the article mentions there are so many difficult things to consider the most important being - you can have a website that is 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliant and completely have an utterly terrible user experience for screen reader users. What then?  


We all know these 'form letter' lawsuits are self-serving and not well-intentioned but at least in my experience it at least gets me the budget I need to run my audits, pay my testers and get my work done in a large company that should be doing it. The latest trend is to go after nursing home websites, whose management doesn't have the technical knowledge or budget to fix issues and that definitely feels grosser.  


In this thread a few people have the sentiment that web accessibility is 'easy' and in theory that's true, good color scheme, semantic HTML and some alt tags will get you pretty far. However, due to [the great divide in web development](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/), you have backend developers writing really poor div soup JSX (or really, importing someone else's componentized really poor div soup JSX) instead of a someone who actually knows HTML and knows that you can't just add an alt tag to a div (true story) and call it a day.   


It's not just bad code though, there's also increased complexity in how we build things and how the screen reader technology keeps up. For example, when something on the page changes we as developers are supposed to inform screen reader users of that change, cool we've got aria-live='polite' we'll just put that attribute on things that change and it will be read to the screen reader user when it updates. Except that every screen reader supports aria-live differently and they don't chain aria-live messages, so good luck trying to get your quantity selector to let the user know why they don't qualify for that promotion anymore.

351,"There are lots of different ways you can be legally blind, and it's more of a title that gives you a medical diagnosis than something that changes your life - unless, of course, it happens suddenly.

I have two legally blind children.  One has been legally blind since shortly after birth.  He has one eye that works and one that doesn't.  He has no peripheral vision, and the 'good' eye is something that is really bad.  He wears a -18.0 contact lens and you would never know he was legally blind unless he told you. He doesn't use a cane, he plays video games, he went to a regular school and other than getting preferential seating and enlarged print, that's pretty much the extent of his issues.  He does not drive, and can't.

My other child was VI since birth, but didn't become legally blind until she was 18.  Her vision was 20/195 corrected for a long time, then one day it was 20/200, and the next year it was 20/205.  All of a sudden she was legally blind.  It didn't change anything for her at all - she has used a cane for 5+ years (it helps her navigate curbs and stairs), she never got any special treatment at school, but she was more obviously ""blind"" than her brother - who was more blind than she was, but didn't show it as much.

Once she became officially legally blind, she had access to certain programs and scholarships that she didn't before.  There was no big discussion with her doctor, other than her paperwork now said 20/205 instead of 20/195.  It wasn't a life-changing event in any way. 

Now if this is a life-changing event for you, I can see why you'd want the doctor to acknowledge it with a discussion.  But having it on paper wasn't really telling you something you didn't know - it's not like you went thinking your vision was fine, only to be told ""hey, you're actually blind.""

381,"I'm about the same age as your brother and in a pretty similar situation - my left eye was legally blind for a while and we were banking on my right eye doing the heavy lifting. Now the cysts in my right eye are starting to spread. XLRS is supposed to be a juvenile condition that shouldn't be getting worse in my 30's, but here we are. 

The biggest thing that people can do to help me is not let it be a big deal if they're helping me. I get that independence, and it really sucks that I'm going to lose my license or that I can't read menu boards. My wife does all of the driving, she reads subtitles to me when we watch movies, and she tells me what she thinks I'd like from those stupid hanging menus that are all handwritten in really bad cursive.

I hate those things btw. Bad handwriting isn't artsy, it's just bad handwriting. 

Let your brother know that you want to help, but that in order to do that he needs to tell you what actually helps. Knowing I have people who care and want to help, and more importantly that I'm not a burden on them when they do help, has been huge. The other side to independence isn't just that we don't want to depend on people, but that we don't want to be a burden on them. 

Sometimes we just need people who understand. I have my worries and fears. Degenerative conditions suck. You're literally watching the world you're used to slip away. It's hard to have to give up on some things because it's a lot less safe to ride a bike down a hill at 40 mph, or you can't make out the details to know where the bumps are when you're snowboarding. Accepting the adjustments tends to lead into the harder days, where I have to acknowledge that my life is changing on me.

383,"Yes, I had a somewhat similar experience. 

My vision had been declining for a while. I went to the doctor and she said that something looked odd, that it could be macular degeneration but that was highly unlikely because I was way too young. She then said that the only way I could have it at my age was if it was genetic. She then told me the story of someone who had it at a  younger age because of genetics and basically said what a tragedy it was... and how hard it was for them... and how rapidly their sight declined... but I didn't need to worry about that because it was almost certainly not what I had. Still, she wanted to do a few tests.

Five hours later in a phone call to my cell she told me... well... you do have macular degeneration and it is likely genetic. I should take some vitamins and she would see me in a few months. The call lasted all of three minutes. No discussion of prognosis. No discussion of things I might ought to be doing besides the vitamins... nothing. 

Later, I wrote her an email asking for a followup appointment to get this information. She said I could see now... so I shouldn't worry about it. She would talk to me at my next appointment.

I am an adopted child, and the director of the orphanage created a fake record for me less than a year before the adoption. It is strange, I know many blind children who were adopted from China at an older age. For me, it comes with a different sort of... pressure to withhold my complaints. My mother told me that the director of the orphanage questioned her for a long time, asking why she really wanted a blind child. They knew exactly what they were getting into. I know, I was wanted. A strange thing for which to harbor any other emotions save gratitude and happiness. They knew that adjustments would have to be made; they were aware of the logistic challenges. But as I grapple with watching my sighted sister spread her wings and fly, while I remain grounded by limitations that I cannot change, and a splintering mental health, I always wonder, did they really know what they were getting into? I wonder how many blind people are unhappy, but refuse to recognize or attribute it to being blind for some reason or another. We are given canes and taught to cross streets.

First, the on board diagnostics thing is probably not gonna happen. People don’t want to be tracked. Also, if it’s optional, no one is gonna do it unless they’re altruistic. Also, a warning that vehicles are approaching would be maddeningly redundant in a city scape. 

Second, the haptic feedback belt would have to be tied to something like a mapping program to be fully functional. If a person is supposed to turn left, it has to have coordinates to tell you when to turn. 

Third, the app itself may pose more of an issue than you believe. It is going to be super reliant on visual processing. Any delay in this could result in a consumer fatality. Your hardware and software stack have to be flawless before it goes public. Then, there’s the assumption that all users have the coordination to point a smart phone camera and pan it across the intersection.

I am a Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist. I teach blind people how to travel, including street crossings. The way we teach is that the person has to listen to the movement of vehicles to determine when it is safest to cross. That would be with the traffic surge on your parallel, and when there are no vehicles turning. It’s an interesting skill to master.

425,"Your kid is a visually impaired person, i.e. colloquially a blind four-year-old. Nothing bad about it, nothing good about it. It's how it is. You should get used to the idea, and more importantly, she should too. It is beyond reasonable to expect the average person to know the nuances between and including perfect sight and total and utter blindness and in a casual interaction the stick or the cane, whatever, will be something the average person is going to draw their attention to. Thus, accept it as a part of how things are and learn yourself and teach her how to react to it in a casual way. In that particular case a simple thank you, I think, would work. Should anyone approach her with arrogance or disrespect, depending on the situation, let them know that it is not okay and to be respectful or if someone is demeaning enough, just tell them to fuck off.

""You don't see too well?"", ""are you blind?"", ""can you see anything?"", ""what's that   
\[cane\] for?"" and similar questions are asked when people just don't know, and that's fine. People are that way, they don't know everything, and when in need of information, it is okay to ask. However laughing, helping WITHOUT ASKING, behaving as the visually impaired person is mentally challenged or any other demeaning thing to do is very much not ok and anyone doing that should be made aware of that VIGOROUSLY.

Getting offended too easily for something that really doesn't warrant getting offended for is the worst thing one can do as a visually impaired person. Surrogately getting offended FOR a visually impaired person is much, much worse. It deprives human dignity from them.

1) using microscope - connect microscope to laptop and view images on laptop screen (if this is still too small you could link it up to a projector). If you can’t see enough to do this have someone draw out what they can see on a sheet of German film which creates a raised diagram 
2) large print/tactile/talking rulers, thermometers, scales, voltmeters etc 
3) colour probe to identify the colour of a substance 
4) light probe to identify changes in light intensity elg for finding the end Point in a titration if you can’t see the miniscus 
5) talking/large print stopwatch 
6) I don’t know what they’re called but there’s these pipettes that you can get that have little notches on so you can tell when you have the right volume of liquid 
7) use a surface with good colour contrast e.g while tile when carrying out an experiment 
8) plot results on a graph with bold/larger squares or if you can’t see this use a pin board and tactile graph paper and ask your teacher to transfer where you’ve placed the pins onto a paper copy so you’ve got a record you can put in your folder or for marking

Yes you will. You will need your CVI.

https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/registering-your-sight-loss

This should connect you up with the local social services, though the quality and value of support does vary between councils. 

There may be a local sight support charity you would want to get in touch with, at least for social events where you can talk to people who will get what your problems are. No reason not to contact them before you move.

I can't give you any advice on finance and benefits but hopefully social services / local charity will. 

As to moving to a new place there could be a few things to think about:

1. As it is rented, think ahead about moving out, any adjustments you make like sticking bumpons or high contrast markers around light switches will need to be cleaned up and any damage to the decoration repaired. Just budget time and money for this for when you eventually move out. Make sure you know what is in the contract regarding changing things in the property.

2. You might need to train your partner in a few house rules if you haven't lived together before: e.g. don't leave cupboard doors open, don't leave trip hazards, don't move things from their regular places. Expect the layout of the cutlery draw to become an issue initially until things settle down.

3. Label your moving boxes by the room the contents belong in.

4. Make sure any important gadgets / aids are packed so they don't get lost in the move and can be accessed as soon as you need them when you arrive. e.g. magnifiers, cup liquid level beep. phone charger.

5. Make sure you can make a cup of tea as soon as you walk in your new place. Carry milk, teabags, sugar, cups, teaspoons also kitchen towel &amp; toilet tissue, all in an easy to find package. Also any other essentials you need to settle in on your first night should be easily accessible. If your partner needs to go out to work, get the food shopping in, or do other errands / chores you can't do then you should be able to make the bed, maybe cook a meal, lay the table, handle the basic comforts. So you will need to be able to find all the things you'll need for your share of the tasks, plan ahead.

6. Plan budget for a small moving in celebration. It might just be a nice cake with candle or something to serve at the end of a meal.

7. Are you going to need internet access in you new place?

8. Get a street map of the area so you and your partner can go for walks for relaxation and exploration. Learn the routes to your local library, pharmacist, shops, etc. You might get to meet your new neighbours this way.

9. Best of British luck!",,,,vwlsmssng,friend / family / other,,1558704542,t5_2qpec,t3_bsfes0,t3_bsfes0,3,1563223609,0,0,eon50kh,Blind,,,blue2,"&gt; if I will need to re-register my sight loss because I'll be moving to an area which is run by a different council

There may be a local sight support charity you would want to get in touch with, at least for social events where you can talk to people who will get what your problems are. No reason not to contact them before you move.

I can't give you any advice on finance and benefits but hopefully social services / local charity will. 

As to moving to a new place there could be a few things to think about:

1. As it is rented, think ahead about moving out, any adjustments you make like sticking bumpons or high contrast markers around light switches will need to be cleaned up and any damage to the decoration repaired. Just budget time and money for this for when you eventually move out. Make sure you know what is in the contract regarding changing things in the property.

2. You might need to train your partner in a few house rules if you haven't lived together before: e.g. don't leave cupboard doors open, don't leave trip hazards, don't move things from their regular places. Expect the layout of the cutlery draw to become an issue initially until things settle down.

3. Label your moving boxes by the room the contents belong in.

4. Make sure any important gadgets / aids are packed so they don't get lost in the move and can be accessed as soon as you need them when you arrive. e.g. magnifiers, cup liquid level beep. phone charger.

5. Make sure you can make a cup of tea as soon as you walk in your new place. Carry milk, teabags, sugar, cups, teaspoons also kitchen towel &amp; toilet tissue, all in an easy to find package. Also any other essentials you need to settle in on your first night should be easily accessible. If your partner needs to go out to work, get the food shopping in, or do other errands / chores you can't do then you should be able to make the bed, maybe cook a meal, lay the table, handle the basic comforts. So you will need to be able to find all the things you'll need for your share of the tasks, plan ahead.

6. Plan budget for a small moving in celebration. It might just be a nice cake with candle or something to serve at the end of a meal.

7. Are you going to need internet access in you new place?

8. Get a street map of the area so you and your partner can go for walks for relaxation and exploration. Learn the routes to your local library, pharmacist, shops, etc. You might get to meet your new neighbours this way.

9. Best of British luck!","[{'start': 159, 'end': 164, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I think there's a big difference between that and something that uses the word blind in a weird way... an example is how we used to call shipping using a customer's return address ""blind shipping"" [this is still the industry term] but we decided that was weird and now we call it ""stealth shipping,"" which actually makes more sense and doesn't equate blindness to ignorance",,,,rollwithhoney,,,1557352296,t5_2qpec,t3_bm20sz,t3_bm20sz,1,1561764562,0,0,emvakwe,Blind,,,,,

495,"Sure, I learned Braille because I work on assistive technology. There's no comparison in difficulty - ASL and other sign language variants are completely unique languages with their own vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. Braille is just a way to write letters.

Learn 26 letters and 5 symbols and you can write ""grade 1"" Braille messages. Learn a few dozen ""grade 2"" contractions and you can read 99% of Braille signs.

Of course, learning to feel Braille with your fingers takes more time, but it's just practice. As a sighted person you can read by seeing the dots if you want to.

The final episode of this Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada based series just went live this morning. It's available on most listening platforms including Spotify, Google Podcasts, and Apple Podcasts!

Link: [https://soundcloud.com/whathappenedtoholly](https://soundcloud.com/whathappenedtoholly)

Here's the synopsis...

The What Happened to Holly Bartlett podcast is a 6-episode audio series that investigates the death of Holly Bartlett, a blind woman who was found clinging to life under Halifax’s MacKay Bridge in the early hours of March 27th, 2010. Police deemed her death an accident, but her family and friends have never accepted their theory.

527,"Thank you again for your thoughts. I got to speak at the WordCamp in Atlanta, GA on May 4th. My goal was to share which accessibilities matter most to vision impaired web users. The attendees were very interested and had many questions. I used video clips from YouTube that demonstrated what ""drove you crazy"" and that seemed to be really helpful.

I heard from about 40 people. 

What follows is a complete list of all the responses shared. They are ordered from most frequently mentioned to least frequently mentioned. First the general responses, then the low vision specific responses, and finally a wish list of things for websites and developers.

# What drives you crazy about websites: General

1. Missing or misused headings

2. Missing Alt text for graphics

3. Unlabeled edit fields

4. Unlabeled buttons

5. Unfriendly Captchas (security codes) particularly for the deaf/blind

6. Popups, hover cards, nested menu links that need to be clicked 

7. Advertisements (in general, placement, complexity)

8. Unlabeled links

9. Quick refresh rates

10. Carousel or slide show of moving pictures

11. Sites that are constantly updated

12. Videos that play automatically and are louder than the screen reader

13. Anything that *requires* a mouse click

14. Flashing information that makes the screen reader repeat itself over and over

15. Using regular text for an item that is clickable

# What Drives You Crazy: Low Vision Specific

1. Low contrast between text and background

2. Edit fields not clearly defined by outlines or strong color contrast

3. Websites that don't allow the user to zoom

4. Light backgrounds

# Wishlist

1. Easy to find contact information

2. A ""Skip to Content"" link

3. Simpler web pages

4. Dynamic text – can zoom and still fit the screen

5. Web designers who learn to use a screen reader and test their sites with it

6. Designers who design a site primarily for use and secondarily for visual impact

7. WCAG 2.1 guidelines followed

8. Audio sound when a form is successfully submitted

9. Play buttons that play and don't link to somewhere else

10. Fully functional pages that work on all electronic devices

11. A screen reader that reads only the main content

529,"Thanks so much for all the feedback! I'm one of OP's teammates on the project. To address each of the points:

First, the team agrees that the OBD is unlikely to gain much public traction, but since we were already building out a suite of assistive tech, we thought it might be a nice addition. If anything, we thought it might be good to have an understanding of how something like that *might* work, and flesh out privacy concerns certainly before going to market but not as part of a minimum viable product. I appreciate the point about the redundancy in a city, though. We're in a very rural area and are mainly addressing the problem as far as it's testable around us.

Second, for clarification, the belt is linked to a mobile app. It keeps track of which direction the user should be heading and responds with haptic feedback accordingly.

Third, we're working hard to use state-of-the-art computer vision that's as fast as possible so latency doesn't cause issues. But we absolutely will never release without extensive testing to make sure it's safe. As far as coordination goes, we're giving some thought to using the compass on the phone (in a similar way to how it's used with the haptic belt) to determine whether the direction the phone is facing is parallel to the direction they need to travel. In this case, the camera is pointed at the lights on the other side of the street that needs to be crossed. The model isn't looking for cars in our current implementation, but rather for walk/don't walk signals (it's of course limited to intersections with these signals, but it was necessary to cut down on complexity due to time constraints). 

Any other responses to these or different points of feedback are welcome and appreciated! This has already been very helpful.",,,,adam-beta,,,1557271777,t5_2qpec,t3_bli6du,t1_emow8ch,2,1561712627,0,0,ems88n7,Blind,,,,,

There is some naturalistic nudity, nothing really graphic, in the introduction.

556,"Hmm. What is it like dating a sighted girl as a blind person?
Probably a lot different than it would be if I were on the other side of the equation. But that's because I'm in a little different situation than most of the blind people I know. I was raised in a sighted society for the most part. All of my friends are sighted with the rare exception of about ten people I know throughout the United States who are blind. However, I have no physical contact with these blind friends. I attended public school from fifth grade onward and ... to say that dating was a challenge at first would be to make a huge understatement. I failed over and over again. I had some serious self-esteem issues that impacted my life for many years. The saddest part of all of this is that, for over 20 years I was a professional musician with a rock group called Gypsy Haven. I was the drummer. So you would think probably ... that I had girls galore. You would be wrong in that thinking. I was miserably lonely because I did not understand the fundamental differences between men and women until I realized that if I didn't do something to change things, things would never change.
So I started listening to dating and relationship podcasts and not only listening but ... taking the advice to heart. 
Today ... my dating life is much more rewarding although I do still tend to spend more time than I should on people I'm truly interested in when things become a struggle. 
But that's who I am. 
I don't give up on people because I don't want people giving up on me. 
So to answer your question: what is it like dating a sighted girl. 
More precisely, what do I see as problems needing quick resolution early in the dating relationship? 1. Do not assume. If I need something I will ask for it. I am not too prideful to ask for help. I don't need the girl to fix my drinks, fix my meals, clean my house, lead me around like a little lamb or be my caretaker or babysitter.  I do prefer to travel with my girlfriends by linking arms or holding hands so that makes things easier. 
2. I cannot see your eyes so when you use them to communicate with me, it's ineffective. So what I try to do is come up with alternative concepts to eye contact; specific and special touches to simulate a particular type of contact. 
Usually I will ask the girl to come up with her own ideas and the interested ones ... the truly interested ones, have never ceased to surprise me with their ingenuity. 
3. I need you to pay attention to what I am saying when I am saying it. If you are texting a friend when I'm talking to you and I do not know this, I am saying things you may not at all be receiving. I will not get pissed if you tell me to hold up a second so you can reply to someone. I will, however get extremely put out if I find that you've been absorbed in your phone or some other activity while I've been talking. 4. I don't need everything described to me. It takes a special kind of skill to be really good at describing tv or film to a blind person, leaving out the extraneous and including the important things and it takes practice. I've only had a handful of girlfriends who were really good at this. 
. .  5. I like to cook and do a lot of it so I like to make special meals. If you would like to help that would be great and appreciated but it is not necessary.
6. I will take an interest in the things that interest you so take an interest in the things that interest me. Am I saying go out and learn Braille? Absolutely not. But learn what things catch my attention, what things are important to me. Because this is what I will be doing. I believe in studying over my girlfriends, getting to know their likes, dislikes, interests, hobbies and cares. I will remember special dates so don't be surprised at that. I don't expect that back in return but it is nice when it happens. 
6. If I text you and continually have to wait a day or two or 3 for you to reply sometimes, I'm going to take steps to break that relationship because it's unhealthy. 
Communication is very important to most blind people. I'd say it is the single most important issue to most of us. 
Have respect for that and be compassionate and cooperative because it helps a lot and the alternative is ... well ... a relationship killer. 

Finally, as for me, I like intimacy, romance, sexual expression and learning new techniques. If you're not up for that then ... you and I probably won't work. 

I have written this as if I'm talking to you girls specifically but that's not the case. I'm writing in this fashion for the benefit of any girls who may come across this comment while searching for information about dating a blind guy.

569,"So I'm not gonna rough you up as much as some others in this thread, but I think the problem they might be having is that your curiosity was phrased in a way that came from skepticism rather than a curiosity about the specifics of a pretty much universal human experience. We get asked a lot, of stuff like ""Do blind people use the internet?"" or ""Do blind people date?"" to which there is the implicit expectation the answer might be ""No, they don't."" It frames the questions in a way that just assumes these helpless blind people can't do all these other things everybody else does to fulfill their life, and since those lowered expectations are actually more challenging obstacles than the mechanics of operating without vision, some of us are quick to bristle at them. You'd have gotten far better responses with, ""How do sexual fantasies work/manifest for someone who is blind?"" Because you at least give us the benefit of the doubt that we DO have them. Like, yaknow, pretty much everybody. For my part, yes, when I'm rolling solo to get off I do have fantasies, they are more oriented to tactile and aural sensations though. Instead of seeing someone in my mind's eye, I feel them with my mind's hands or other parts of the body or hear them with my mind's ear.

Admittedly, as my disabilities are progredient as well, I've become less social IRL than I used to myself. I don't really mind though. It's easier to stay in touch with people on my terms, rather than having to adjust to all the unexpeced situations a club or the like can throw at you. ""On my terms"" means with an assistant as translator into lormen, tactile sign language or written text, usually, but that's specific to my deafblindness and your dad would probably just need assistance for orientation. I'm also using technology more extensively than most people do -- hobby coder and generally preferring to not rely on other people too heavily.

First of all, smartphones are **awesome**! There are applications like Seeing AI, TextGrabber or KNFB Reader which you can use to scan documents. That's good because that way you won't have to always rely on sighted people for deciphering your mail. Plus Seeing AI has some neat other features, like rcognizing products or money. In general, smartphones embody a whole set of mobile assistive technologies.

One thing I couldn't go without are books. I always rely on my braille display so I can't really say anything about how good an app works with reading out loud, but the books app, Kindle and Skoobe are my go-to books apps. Used to enjoy Audible before my hearing decided to piss off and hang out in Thailand (or whatever it decided to do after divorcing me). There are quite some movies with audio description out there, too, and apps which can add audio description to cinema movies, so there's the opportunity to meet up with a friend and go to the cinema ;-) (Signal, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook's Messenger... are all accessible, although only Signal is good in terms of privacy). If your dad dislikes using apps, many mobile web pages are easier to comprehend than the desktop counterparts due to their reduced appearance. 

Things like ordering on Amazon are well possible just using a laptop -- provided you're good enough at using your screen reader. I like JAWS for its ability to custom make inaccessible programs accessible, but I use NVDA too, because sometimes it's better at, for example, picking up on dialogs in web browsers. If your dad can get a course at how to use his screen reader, he should. In my opinion, there's nothing worse than having potential at your finger tips and not using it.

Talking about courses, there are people offering courses in cooking, cleaning the house, folding laundry etc. -- at least that's the case in Germany. Sadly I'm not sure what Tennessee looks like.

Admittedly, as my disabilities are progredient as well, I've become less social IRL than I used to myself. I don't really mind though. It's easier to stay in touch with people on my terms, rather than having to adjust to all the unexpeced situations a club or the like can throw at you. ""On my terms"" means with an assistant as translator into lormen, tactile sign language or written text, usually, but that's specific to my deafblindness and your dad would probably just need assistance for orientation.

614,"TLDR: Thanks for your post, I hate how horrible people can be, and I have much respect for how you handled the situation- and much appreciation for everyone who endures these daily abuses from our ignorant society.

I really appreciate your post, I've worked for years training people who are working with individuals with disabilities, and I have found that most people are simply and completely ignorant about this. All they have ever learned about interacting with people who are disabled is to not stare at them.

It sometimes bothers me that people react to disability like it is some other-worldly experience, forgetting there is a person in front of them instead of just an unknown ""condition"". So I really appreciate it when somebody can take the time to respond to a teachable moment and raise awareness- even when being manhandled and physically harmed in the process.

I see how it can be an interesting social dynamic for all involved. Sometimes reaching out to help someone might be more social interaction with a stranger than the helpful person is used to. Interacting with a stranger can even be an anxiety inducing moment for a good-hearted but extremely shy or introverted individual. Sometimes the act of helping another person is simply an automatic reflex that bypasses an individual's conscious thought processes, so offering a helpful pointer to these people can break them out of their ""autopilot"" mentality and into a more thoughtful way of behaving.

Of course, I recognize you don't want to seem ungrateful or hostile, and when you've just been manhandled or hurt I see how easily one might lose their patience and temper. Unfortunately I think these moments are where the situation can so easily break down into one where the helpful person feels unappreciated and the injured blind individual just seems ungrateful and rude. So thank you for maintaining your cool as well as you did. I'm not sure I could have done so. 

Sometimes, in my better moments when I am able to be a bit more thoughtful, I've found that beginning with a ""Thank you"" can soften the blow of corrective information that follows. In those moments what I would like to say is ""Thank you for helping me, but it is better if you announce your intention before you grab me, and if I accept your help, the best place for you to guide me is by holding my elbow right here..."". I don't always hit the mark, but I'm still trying... &lt;grin&gt;

I know it can be exhausting to constantly be so polite and understanding, but your efforts are inspiring to me. I believe we make the world better for everyone by helping people learn basic etiquette and how to be better at being helpful.

617,"I’m a software developer working on a Major Open Source learning system.

I can’t comment on the litigious nature of the US as I am based elsewhere, but I have often found the WCAG guidelines to be a bit useless.

Often you’ll find that following the required colours for contrast makes things extremely limiting in terms of the overall look and feel, and that the required focus and keyboard navigation makes the site less intuitive to use for sighted users rather than being complementary.

My biggest frustration, however, is the discrepancy between screen readers’s browser compatibility. You can follow every WCAG and ARIA guideline, but when you break out the screen reader you find that it does not behave as expected. You also find huge discrepancies between each of the screen readers and how they behave. For example JAWS, NVDA, and Chromevox all behave differently when encountering an image with an alt tag in a link with a title.

It does seem like that is getting better and they are gradually improving, but the follow up issue is that it’s pretty difficult to teach yourself how to use the screen reader when you are full stack and not designing and using a screen reader all the time. The JAWS guides are not very clear and you have to actually dig to find out what the JAWS key is because all of the documentation just refers to it as the JAWS key. They also don’t say which browsers they support best and you have to do a lot of hunting.  I realise that isn’t an issue for most people but for developers whose job is not solely focused around accessibility it can be a huge hurdle.

As I say, it is improving, but it can be challenging.

Most developers coming to work with us have never heard of screen readers, and do not know what ARIA or WCAG are. They’ve heard of alt tags and titles, but they provide limited or mixed benefits.

So in terms of the over-litigious nature, whilst I think it’s good to highlight poor websites and work to improve them it is far from easy at this time, and the standards themselves are not clear or not well implemented and therefore that it’s unreasonable to expect companies to meet standards of that nature.",,,,meoverhere,,,1558389875,t5_2qpec,t3_bqxqoy,t3_bqxqoy,6,1562965069,0,0,eo9f2wb,Blind,,,,"I’m a software developer working on a Major Open Source learning system.

618,"Hi [questiontime12374](https://www.reddit.com/user/questiontime12374),

I'm sorry for the way you have been treated in this thread. This behaviour is unique to reddit, not the blind community of the world. I hope you are not discouraged from making friends with a blind person because of this. I feel the description for this sub should be modified to remove ""those who are just curious"" if this group is going to be so vicious to someone who is just truly curious. I think it's incredibly disingenuous to pretend like human sexuality is not a very visual human experience.  I find it ironic that in this same sub there is a question from someone who wants to know ""How to make friends at school."" They write ""At school I'm ignored and I only have one friend..."" This is easy to understand isn't it. If you try to make friends with a blind person and you violate the ""blind"" code of conduct by asking a bad question or trying to be helpful, you are MONSTER! There are probably a lot of people who are just plain afraid to interact with the blind for fear of committing some unpardonable sin against them.

I'm sorry for the way you have been treated in this thread. This behaviour is unique to reddit, not the blind community of the world. I hope you are not discouraged from making friends with a blind person because of this. I feel the description for this sub should be modified to remove ""those who are just curious"" if this group is going to be so vicious to someone who is just truly curious. I think it's incredibly disingenuous to pretend like human sexuality is not a very visual human experience.  I find it ironic that in this same sub there is a question from someone who wants to know ""How to make friends at school."" They write ""At school I'm ignored and I only have one friend..."" This is easy to understand isn't it. If you try to make friends with a blind person and you violate the ""blind"" code of conduct by asking a bad question or trying to be helpful, you are MONSTER! There are probably a lot of people who are just plain afraid to interact with the blind for fear of committing some unpardonable sin against them. For example, I can hold the door for an able bodied man who has his hands full, and he nods in appreciation. I can hold the door for a pregnant woman, or a man in a wheelchair and they say thank-you. But OH MY GOD if I do something in any way to assist the blind person without their express written permission, I have just committed a terrible hate crime against all blind people everywhere.

639,"There is a lot that goes into these questions.  There is certainly gray area when it comes to definitions where people could use help,  but get left behind because of how the definition of legal blindness is written. 
We typically say 20/200 in the better eye after correction because if one eye was 20/20 and the other eye was 20/1000, your brain learns to use the good eye and your binocular vision is most likely to be 20/20. That doesn't mean you won't have problems with depth perception and visual fields,  but it does mean you would be able to do things like read small print. 
Both eyes need to be affected for legal blindness because we have found that many people function just fine with one good eye.  Again,  that doesn't mean you don't experience problems, but many people can get by very well with no vision in one eye and perfect corrected vision in the other. 
You can't really get into comparing people regarding whose vision is better and whose is worse.  The legal definitions are only there to decide who gets money,  who can't drive,  and who gets certain services.  People with vision better than 20/70 can still get driver's licenses in restricted capacities. They can still read print with some accommodations.  They may not need canes to travel.  People with vision worse than 20/200 are much more all over the board.  They may or may not use a cane,  braille, or other unique systems that a person with 'better' vision might not need.

709,"I should start by saying that I never actually ask anyone to move out of their seat. I hope that they will notice me and be polite enough to help, but I also know that I actually can't tell if they have any right to be in priority seating or not, and I'd rather not create a fuss anyway.

I should also say that in most cases priority seating isn't needed. Pregnant women can stand just as well as the elderly, blind and most people with disabilities. It's there to make life a bit easier for people who might find public transport harder than your average bear.

For example, I can only see one row of seats at a time. So for me to find an unoccupied seat means starting at the front of the bus/tram/train and slowly walking down the isle until I find one. There are plenty of bus drivers who, seeing the cane, won't actually go until I'm safely seated.

I navigate by using distinct landmarks, so if it's a tram/bus I need to be on the left side in order for me to identify when my stop is approaching. I live in Aus so we drive on the left side of the road.

Most buses have different configurations of handles/bars, which can make it tricky to find a good place to hang on, and not being able to see traffic means stopping and starting are unexpected events that can throw you off your balance quite easily. If the bus is quite full and there need to be people standing, a sighted person can see others boarding the bus and can actively move to make extra room/let people pass them. Most VI/blind people can't do that, or if they can, it adds an extra layer of complexity to the experience that can be quite stressful.

Also, if you're carrying anything else, like shopping bags for instance, standing is simply not possible, as I've got to have one hand on the cane and one carrying the other stuff.

Those are just things from my experience. Other VI/blind people may be able to chip in with different perspectives. As I said, in most cases priority seating is there to make it easier, but it's not strictly a necessity.

Also, it's important to remember that these situations are awkward at best and sometimes even terrifying and embarassing. The only time I'm okay being grabbed by a stranger is to save me from serious harm.

Everyone does it differently but his dog and some careful feeling around should have told him the door wasn't fully open. Either he was rushing or too embarassed or proud to be cautious. Someone making a big deal of trying to help doesn't make those feelings better, it may make them worse.

715,"Your greatest weapon is good situational awareness. Don't let yourself be an easy target. Make a show of assessing your environment, and avoid isolated areas when possible. Talk to people, try to generate attention. I like to keep my hands free, so I carry my essentials in a messenger bag or backpack. It allows me to interact more with the environment, not show off my purchases, and it can be used as weapon if I'm truly desperate. Don't be a willing victim. Alot of the old clichés ring true, if you have to get physical, get dirty, and fast, there are no points for gallantry. Bite, scratch, use your keys, and if you're big use your weight. I'm a decent sized guy, so the few times I've had to defend myself, I dash in,  grab something and hold on while I punch, kick, or grapple. You might get hurt too, but any damage you can cause can be used to identify your attacker later if necessary. I got attacked a couple of years ago by an opportunistic teen, after the flurry was over, I had him grounded and twisting his arm. When policed arrived on scene, we were both bleeding.

I had a low vision appointment set up for the next day as she had a cancelation. So yeah it just through me off and was expecting a sit down conversation from one of them. Not expecting to find out from a paper that’s for sure.,,,,faerylin,stargardt/legally blind,,1557613146,t5_2qpec,t3_bn3kqh,t1_en274fb,1,1561941286,0,0,en5pxdy,Blind,,,blue2,,
755,Your story sounds a lot like mine. I told by several docs that I was faking my symptoms (did field of vision twice a month apart and both look identical can’t fake that) it wasn’t until they took the retinal photos that they knew I wasn’t faking it was just rare and unexpected so they never thought for it to be stargardts at 30. I hope you find out more info about yours.,,,,faerylin,stargardt/legally blind,,1557613286,t5_2qpec,t3_bn3kqh,t1_en268ol,2,1561941383,0,0,en5q4vm,Blind,,,blue2,,
756,"It’s my low vision specialist. I thought my retina specialist said my vision was 120/20 but it’s 150/20. Which I didn’t think was legally blind either but this was the letter I got or part of it. My low vision specialist doesn’t agree with the diagnosis of stargardts. So that’s why she phrases it like she does. At this point I’m just confused but have moved on from it. I’m using it to get the services I need for school. And see department of the blind and services in the next month. I can still get around pretty good reading is the worst thing that I have to deal with so I just deal with it one day at a time.

758,Right that’s how it was when I was told I had stargardts. Before then it was oh everything’s blurry it’s your migraines; oh it’s constant then your lying. Haha. My field of vision test the doc was like your either not taking the test right or it’s one of 5 things and I think your just not taking it right. Redid it a month later for the same results. The retina doc did the photos came in and said good news your not lying you have stargardts. Then explained what it meant and showed me the pics. Said nothing we can do but monitor the progression every 6 months. I have never drove so that was never a problem.

 retina appointment today was a mess; she said my retinas have changed' but not sure what that means. she emailed her colleague about it. but shes never had a stargardts patient before so she really doesn't know what to look for or anything. She told me I'm ""a puzzle piece that she just cant figure out"" my vision is now 20/120 from 20/40 in november which is very scary. i didnt realize it had gotten that bad. she called and got me scheduled tomorrow with low vision. insurance only pays for the retina photos every 6 months so will get more photos in august to see how much more damage is done to the retinas but by the loss of vision and what she can see with the naked eye we know there is more. oh and the erg was inconclusive, so that sucks. so what a day. :(",,,,faerylin,stargardt/legally blind,,1556836756,t5_2qpec,t3_bjnvur,t3_bjnvur,2,1559500622,0,0,emcxnkg,Blind,,,blue2,,

For example, I always review basic knowledge when I start to teach traffic light street crossings (what a red light means, what happens on green lights, parallel vs perpendicular) to make sure the client understands the terminology. 

I came across a client who did not know what an advance green light was. What was surprising (and a little scary) was that this client worked for 30 years as a truck driver before he lost his vision in his 50s.",,,,KillerLag,"Sighted, O&amp;M Instructor",,1557188833,t5_2qpec,t3_bl7v2q,t3_bl7v2q,3,1561656108,0,0,emp0le3,Blind,,,blue2,,

847,"There is a quote I like about that.... ""Growth occurs at the edge of the comfort zone"". You stagnate inside your comfort zone, since you aren't doing anything new. Too far outside of your comfort zone produces anxiety, since there can be too many things to cope.

When I am teaching people to travel skills, some of them haven't been outside on their own in years. So I usually start small, and have them practice going up and down the driveway. As they feel better, I increase the distance... maybe down the sidewalk to a neighbours place. We focus on locating landmarks to help them recognize where they are, and sometimes problem solving to figure out if they get lost. I often suggest that once they are comfortable going a certain distance, try going just a little further. Far enough that if they start to get nervous, they can turn around and easily get back, but far enough they can encounter new things.

The same basic techniques work for other things as well. Let's say someone has no idea how to do anything in their kitchen anymore. Well, we can start with pouring water (over the sink, to keep the mess contained). As they get comfortable, we start to push that comfort zone (different amounts, different cups, maybe cold or hot water, milk into a cereal bowl). 

One big thing is getting a teacher to help teach you new skills. They are assisting you at first, but it is so you can learn the skills to do things yourself.",,,,KillerLag,"Sighted, O&amp;M Instructor",,1556854585,t5_2qpec,t3_bk3ool,t3_bk3ool,2,1559513920,0,0,emdonbi,Blind,,,blue2,,

Few weeks after my ex employee forged documents, signitures, blocked company, stole money, tried to steal one of patents, made false claims and as result i went 3 months to prisson inocent. That is actually how my first year of merridge started. When it was proved that i was inocent i didnt get any apology from anyone and didnt get my money back. It was 275 000 euro. I had 3 euro in my pocket. I didnt give up and i focused on my side project. That is this one.

It took a while to get used to the devices and the concept, but it's the only way I can enjoy films in the theatre anymore so I adapted and accepted it. I never go by myself, I'm always with my sighted partner or with a friend. I tend to call ahead to ask guest services if the audio descriptive devices have been tested for the movie I'm coming to see. When I'm there, we just go to guest services to pick up the device.

I make sure the worker giving me the device has it set to the right auditorium, set to the correct channel since they'll confuse Hard of Hearing mode with Audio Description mode every so often, double check that it's charged, and ask if they'll come by to see if the device is working when the show starts.

We've had mixed results. My partner has missed the first 15-20 minutes of a few movies when things go wrong and they haven't shown up to check on us since she has to take the device and run to get it sorted out, sometimes a few times because they still mess the device up.

Other than that, if you don't hear description as soon as the production titles start for the film, something is wrong.

863,"Just get a cane, it really sounds like it will ultimately help you and make your life easier from the bevy of your other posts. Going down stairs, I hold the handrail with one hand and have my cane angled down in front of me with the other hand. The cane taps the step below each step I descend. Sometimes I'll adjust to tapping the edge of the stair if the cane keeps catching on grip tape or anti-slip elements added to the stairs. 

Going up, you hold your cane vertically in front of you and let the tip tap against the riser in front of you. Hold the handrail, guage the height and depth of the first step with the cane, then move upwards, tapping as you go. If you are new, don't take going up or down too fast. Always lean a little backwards when going down and a little forwards going up, that way if you trip, your center of gravity will carry you towards the landing with the least amount of pain/injury.

When it did come back, it was like looking through dark, shattered glass. Huge swaths of missing vision, jagged dark shrouds angled through my visual field. It disappeared entirely a few days later as the rest of my retina died. Here is a copy paste from an older comment I made when people asked about what I can actually see now:

Visualize a rlly blurry letterboxed movie, with dark bands on the upper and lower areas, but the main overall viewing area is a dark, noisy grey. Like TV static but much less pronounced. I'll see some flickering here and there, some nerve cells will fire when I'm in dramatically different light, like going from a dark area into sunlight, but ultimately I have no functional vision whatsoever. I can see very faint movement with the lowest part of my visual field, like can see my hands moving a bit when I'm clapping, or something super high contrast like a white plate on a black table, but can see less than 1 percent of whatever is there.

879,"I can't deal with foam rubber keyboards either, because I feel like I have to beat the hell out of the keys to get a decent rhythm. The best compact keyboard I ever used was the Typematrix ones. I'm not sure if they still make them as I got a prototype a few years ago. I don't have your injuries, so I can't test that, and they didn't have them in bluetooth, but if it's just for a laptop, maybe that doesn't matter as much. They use scissor switches, which are a bit clicky, but nowhere near as good as IBM Model M or DAS keyboard. Older Apple keyboards were good too, but probably hard to find. I'm glad I don't have to use a compact keyboard because I really don't like the laptop layouts for screen readers, and I find that for large hands the smaller keys give me a bit of trouble. But by far the biggest annoyance with the compact keyboards is missing keys. The right control often gets left out which makes cut-and-paste awkward  if you're trying to touch type qwerty. And often the FN key is where the left control should be and so I'm forever hitting that by mistake. I think the newer logitech ones are also decent, but I'd have to check the layout. The girlfriend has one that's pretty small, and it seemed to have large keycaps. It was a bit squishy, but not as squishy as the low profile ones. I believe it has both control and shift and alt keys as well. Whatever you do, buy one from Amazon or some place with a decent return policy, so you can beat the hell out of it for a few days and take it back if you don't like it. I think anything advertised as a gaming keyboard would also be a good option, as often those have better key switches. I hope you find a good one though, as I haven't seen a good keyboard in a while, so I'm glad I have this one.",,,,[deleted],,,1559169824,t5_2qpec,t3_bujwo5,t3_bujwo5,1,1563724538,0,0,epdnfth,Blind,,,,,

That, combined with their wanting me to be independent has always served me well. Because, since the age of 12, I had been cooking, cleaning up after myself, and doing my own laundry plus other household chores. I am now 33, and I look back and can appreciate what that did for me. I see it as a slippery slope, because parents tend towards overprotecting blind children, and while I cannot claim this for myself, or claim experience in this, stories told to me through others have seemed like borderline abuse to me, just based on how sheltered they made their child.

OK, so my grandmother still will call it a walking stick, which it is technically not.

its all about presentation. when people ask about your monitor if you get all awkward and go into a deep medical description of why you are blind you are going to teach them that this is a subject that they should feel strongly about. they will also learn that its something that should make them mildly uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think it would be great if your son became a youtuber (I'm a mom of a 10yo who loves to watch youtube!) because it would help others relate and connect to someone with similar vision loss.   You sound like awesome and supportive parents that are doing exactly the right things to help your son ""grow up to be confident and independent!""  I just published a blog post on our website of an interview I did with a low vision patient in his early 30s and he talks about the pivotal role his parents played in helping him grow to be independent, successful and confident that he could do anything he had a passion for - he plays volleyball and golfs and has a fitness blog, so, YAY to supportive parents like yourselves!!!","[{'start': 512, 'end': 522, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 42, 'end': 52, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

In your last post (I could be wrong, I have not double checked), you said your vision went rapidly (from Stargardt's over past 6 months) from 20/40 to 20/120? 

Please, someone, correct me if I am wrong, but defining someone as legally blind in the US is based on the Snellen Visual Acuity Measurement System.  As long as your vision in your *better* eye is less than 20/200, you are NOT considered legally blind.  However, this might change depending on your Field of View, I am not sure all the details.

I work for a low vision specialist and we have patients all the time that think they are ineligible to drive, but are actually perfect candidates for bioptic driving.

1161,"No, but I think a lot of us have experienced the dropped ball by eye doctors when your vision is no longer enough to get by doing everything visually. 

It's extremely shitty and I'm sorry you're going through it. You're right, that's a conversation you should have had in person and you should have been offered much more support and resources. 

Some general practical stuff that may be of use to you: 

You can usually submit your own request to start working with your state's department of rehab or commission for the blind. They'll want documentation from your doctor, but the request doesn't have to come from them. Services the state might provide you are orientation and mobility training, learning to use adaptive technology and help buying devices, or assistance paying for college. You can also chose to attend a comprehensive training program (such as the colorado center for the blind) where you live there for some time and are taught orientation and mobility, assistive technology, job skills, home skills, and so on all at once. 

As far as school goes, you can work with your school and request from your doctor a letter detailing additional specific accommodations that might benefit you. Extra time on tests, the use of a human scribe if needed, access to accessible electronic or audio textbooks and materials for your classes and so on.

You can also access free or low-cost services like the NLS (national library for blind people,) Bookshare, Learning Ally, NFB Newsline, archive.org's print disability section, and more with proof of vision loss. A lot of organizations accept your registration with the NLS as documentation so there isn't a need to have your doctor fill out 30 different forms. This gives you immediate access to hundreds of thousands of accessible books and newspapers. 

Your local NFB or ACB chapter or another local blindness organization can be a good contact for information about what services are locally available, who are the right people to call, and generally how to get what you need where you live.

On a personal level, working with a therapist who is familiar with disability issues has been critical for a lot of people adapting to sight loss. Sometimes local organizations that serve blind people offer these services.

1174,"I usually see a movie with someone else. If you don't, ask a worker to show you to your seat. If you book a seat in the isle that has wheelchair spots, it's usually a much wider isle and easier to walk in and out of without tripping on people's legs (or just book a seat right at the end of the isle if that works for you visually.) 

I usually go to AMC theaters, because I basically know what to expect as far as their description goes and know what hardware they use. Some other theaters have no audio description equipment, or horrendously outdated equipment. Take your own headphones, if the theater uses fidelio receivers you can plug your own in and not use gross theater ones. 

I'd say the audio description works as advertised about 75% of the time in my experience. It actually used to be a lot worse. Some AMC-specific tips:

- Always emphasize that you want them to be sure it's set to descriptive narration for blind people, and ask if they're sure it's the right channel for blind people. This sounds stupid, but you probably would believe how many times they've tried to offer me the amplified track or even the closed captioning device. If they don't sound like they have any idea what they're doing, ask if there's someone more familiar with the system who can set it up. 

- On the fidelio device (if you can see it) the lights that indicate what channel is being used are between the power button and the headphone port. The channel one light is next to the power button, and the channel two light is next to the headphone port. The correct channel's light (which they should know) should either be flashing slowly (searching for channel) or solid green (connected.) If it's flashing quickly, it's not working right and won't work. If it doesn't turn solid green when you enter the auditorium, it's probably not working. In that case give it back to them and ask them to fix it. 

- You can ask for an extra receiver in case the first one isn't working, and you can also ask for them to come in with you and make sure everything's live when the movie starts.

Importantly:

- An ipad (or iphone depending on how much magnification you need) works fine for a lot of people, especially if you aren't trying to use the CCTV to read especially long texts. If he (or you) already have one, it's worth trying out. 

- Your state probably has an ""assistive technology exchange"" or ""reutilization"" program.

- Local organizations that work with blind people might be able to recommend state, county, or city specific resources, devices no longer needed by someone, or non-profits that may help. 

- ebay always has many used CCTV systems available.

- Less reflective wrapping, helps people who can't see well as well as fully blind people who use devices to read the item. I've had a hell of a time with shiny plastic.

- Braille. It's done in a few countries, it can be done large scale.

- Packaging that makes it obvious how to open it. I got tea recently that required I find the edge of a tear strip and then open the box, but even after I mutilated the tear strip, it had a lot of resistance and felt like I was breaking the box. Turns out that it has little paper points to keep the box closed. Don't do that.

- Stop using tape on everything. I hate cutting 4 strips of tape just to not be able to open it due to a hidden fifth strip. Use a single large sticker, or design your box so that you can use just one strip.

- Those plastic shell packages that have the edges crimped together so you have to get scissors and then you end up cutting your finger on the razor sharp plastic should be illegal. The plastic things that have tabs that set into each other, like bakery boxes? Those are great.

- Contrast is good. Dark packaging, light colored words, bold and obvious, are good.

- Have plain text information online. I've had several products or food items that I've googled to find that the only information is in a series of images.

- For products that aren't just food, visual descriptions and standard words are great. I might know what a cardigan is, but if you call it a cascade because it's a lightweight one, I will have no idea what you're talking about. Ran into that online earlier.

- Have a fit guide for clothes online. I've seen 4x as a size that was a medium in american sizes, and that was fun.

The items she will need depend very much on what kind of activity she does. In general I would advise that she learns to use accessibility resources on her devices, that your house have light colors from roof to floor, many strong lights especially in the kitchen, personal use objects made of materials that are not slippery nor translucent and colored with a single primary color.

Depending on the case she might be benefited by magnifying lenses. Make sure your TV settings are on maximum brightness. Keep things in the same place as much as possible (furniture, small items). Make sure the doors are either fully open or closed. Free the house of things that are easy to trip on. Make sure to tell her where everything is and avoid letting things out of their places. Do not keep things that are too similar to the touch together if one of them is dangerous (bottles of food and cleaning material, for example). Protect the inlets of energy that are next to light switches since she's likely to feel the walls for them and could end up with her fingers on the inlets. Keep glass utensils in a drawer and not somewhere over your heads or hanging. Work on a route of escape for her just in case. Make sure to have the handle of pans always pointed inward the stove (you know what I mean?) and not outwards so she won't hit them accidentally and spill the contents or hurt herself. Do not keep things with sharp edges or points mixed with small items she may just feel a surface for. Do not let cables where she can trip on them. Be careful with hanging decorations. Be careful with glass doors (paint a large stripe on it so she knows when it's open and when it's not).

I enjoy tactile, olfactory and hearing art more, even though they are rarer and sometimes not even considered as arts. I love some textures and how they interact with harmony. I particularly love the feeling of water moving and it's even better when it moves to a rhythm.

I love perfumes and the art involved in making them. I wish I could learn more about it in a practical way, but alas, everything related to it is so expensive and far away.

First of all, I think it's a great idea getting her used to a cane. It will give her independence when moving around and she won't grow up thinking there has to be someone with her all the time for her to walk around. 

However, the white cane is used by completely blind people. Your daughter has some functional residual vision so I would reccomend a green cane. People using green canes are recognized worldwide as people with low vision and reduced ability to navigate. I have a green cane myself.

About you thinking that the nurse didn't treat her as a kid but as a blind kid. Well,your child is blind, indeed, and sometimes people will notice it and do something about it, and that's not always bad. People may notice she's in need of some help and be more prone to help her due to she's being blind. She also uses a cane, which is not something everyone uses, and she'll get noticed by it. In this case someone just acknowledged she uses a cane and was nice by telling her that they like it.

Make no mistake, your daughter knows she's blind, and she knows other people know she's blind. Trying to make people act like they do not know it will do her no good and it may even harm her because she'll think being blind and using a cane is something to be ashamed about it, since you don't like someone nicely acknowledging it.

Finally, I guess she said ""stick"" because most 4 y/o know what a stick is, but not many know what a ""cane"" is.

Blind people don't retrieve and gather information in the same way sighted people do. Sighted people see everyone's faces, a lot of faces all the time, so it makes sense for them to have pictures of the most important ones, personally and historically. Blind people don't see faces.

1225,"I'm 24 and have RP too. I only started using my cane last year, but I am sure now I should have started to use it long ag, especially at night.

You got me thinking about something, though. I use the green cane. Green canes are recognized for being used by people with serious visual impairment but that are not completely blind. I think it is more adequate since I still have some very tubular vision, even though it is a very low quality one. Anyways, I now wonder if I should use a black cane when out at night, since I'm completely blind at night or in dark/dim lighted places.

I won't lie to you. The transition from ""kind of bad vision"" to ""visibly blind - look at my cane"" is not easy. People will stare. Some people will treat you differently. Depending on ""how blind"" you look some people may be unfair and even cruel, and treat you differently from your peers. But going through this transition is the best thing you can do for yourself. You'll gain independence with your cane, something very hard to get when you have RP. You will be seen by people as blind (or somehow blind) and most people will accept you and you won't feel like you have to pretend all the time and that everything is about to fall apart at each mistake or fall.

Just do it. Have orientation and mobility classes, if possible, to acquire good practices from the beginning, but don't refrain from using your cane if you don't want the classes just yet. I've been using my cane for almost a year now and have just begun my O&amp;M classes. Get yourself a cane that stands the same height as your chest and go about with it, learn what is your grip, learn how to measure dimensions, lengths and obstacles with it. Just get it and go. To hell with ignorant and prejudicial people.

PS: you'll notice that people will offer help FAR more than they did when you were not using a cane. Try to always be kind even when people get annoying by doing that; if you are rude to them they may not offer help to some other blind person (or yourself) when help is really needed.",,,,cookieinaloop,,,1558560108,t5_2qpec,t3_brqwf8,t3_brqwf8,2,1563111804,0,0,eogl0ob,Blind,,,,,

What I'm describing (pride vs. embarrassment) is actually a learned trait.  You learn what society sees as normal, and that being not normal means you can be picked on.

This is the best advice for most situations, including this, because how you are and act greatly influences how people see you.

&amp;#x200B;

But getting back to feeling insecure... I can't tell if it's because you're having safety issues come up (ex: women being blind, as a woman, makes you more vulnerable in a society where you have to really watch out for your safety) or because this will change how other people see you and think of you.

&amp;#x200B;

These are both legit issues, and you have our support and understanding. 

&amp;#x200B;

 One way to start overcoming it is to decide that you can handle this and nothing and no one can stop you.  This is a psychological trick that puts you leading the situation (I'm me and can handling anything... including this latest thing) rather than the situation leading you (I'm having this situation and it's bigger than I am, harder than anything I've done). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a LOT of mental ups and downs.  And I notice that when I own the ""Nothing can stop me"" attitude, I'm genius at coming up with solutions and I can handle anything that comes up.  But today (being honest) I'm having the ""I hate my life"" experience, suddenly everything is hard and miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

1321,"Have you had a field of vision assessment?    This would tell you how much you actually see.  Many lifetime monoculars have a greater FOV than what they think of as the usual area one eye in a pair covers.   It's a correction we develop over time and it will increase the area you can cover without you realizing it's happening.    That would alleviate some of your anxiety about not seeing everything a binocular driver does.   It would also clearly spell out your specific limits and help you explore whether you can work around them.  You DO need access to 360 degrees of coverage.   

You can also look into driver safety classes that would help you improve your coverage.   Smith is an excellent training program for CDL drivers.  Don't know if they train others but any new driver training would be helpful for you. 
 
The hard parts are these...

You are a new driver.  Anxiety is to be expected.   Practice will reality check which parts are inexperience and which are genuine concerns.  Vision limits aren't the only reason people don't drive so it's not a big deal unless you make it one.   A bus pass is way cheaper than a wrongful death settlement.     

Sort the inexperience from the physical/psychological limits and work on them from the perspective that some will get better with time and others either need to be fixed or will mean you can't drive.    

As for whipping your head around.  If it's causing pain or damage but it's the only way you can see what you need to, you have another limit to driving safely.   If you're worried about how others interpret your movements and you let that effect how you drive, you have bigger issues than vision limits.    Your steadfast rule SHOULD be personal/public safety.  Any action/motion/behavior you need to take to achieve that isn't a compromise point. (Think of it in the same way as seat belts, turn signals or sun glasses.)

My spouse is a city bus driver.  He's dealt with every condition you can imagine.   He whips his head around like it's a periscope.   He's also one of the best drivers I've ever known.    He does what he needs to do to keep himself and his vehicles/passengers safe.   

I've never driven.  I know my limits.  My cousin is monocular.  He's driven his whole life.   His head is turned in such a way that it scares the bejesis out of anyone who sees him because he looks like he's not remotely looking at the road.    He has a perfect driving record. 

You could be like my cousin or you could be like a friend who lost his eye later in life and cut up his license because he hugged a telephone pole.

Any VI person choosing to live where services aren't available isn't in touch with reality or can't move for reasons outside their control but I'll be frank there, too.

There are waiting lists with students or people with jobs or careers or families who NEED the assistance on them.    They're extremely careful about compatibility and handler suitability, too.  Sounds like your dad would have a hard time passing that part.   These dogs can cost up to 70k for their training/etc.   No snap decisions happen in that process. 

He's gonna have to really step it up before he gets to guide dog level functionality.     All his choice.  All his doing.  Let go of any thought you have anything to do in this situation unless he's using you to keep from making any crucial decisions for himself.

1374,"Hi. I have been crocheting since middle school. There are some adaptations that I have found to work for me, but every crocheter is different. There is a great tutorial on how to crochet without sight by Sister Margaret Mary on YouTube. I personally don’t use the technique that she described, but it is a good place to start. The way that you hold the yarn might be different than what is traditionally done. I personally wrap the yarn around my ring finger and above my remaining fingers of my non-dominant hand and grasp the crochet hook with my ring and pinky fingers of my dominant hand. This allows me to have my other fingers to more easily manipulate and feel the stitches.  When you first start learning, I would recomend starting with a size J crochet hook with either 4 or 5 ply acrylic yarn. It would also help to know which resources are the most accessible. YouTube can ve hit or miss since some videos are not well described. My favorite crochet channels are Jayda In Stitches, Melanie Ham, Yay for Yarn, and several others. I expect that following these videos will be much easier if you have enough residual vision or a sighted person who is willing to provide additional descriptions.

1423,"Yes, we have been getting a generally positive response but trying to overcome the people who just don't seem to be able to wrap their brain around it, mostly people who have no interacting with the visually impaired or blind and have a preset lot of assumptions about them. I have been reading a lot of papers on STEM education for the visually impaired and blind. It seems as though it has only really been an area of research for the since around 2010 to make STEM accessible hopefully with 3D printing it will become more commonplace to at least make tactile models and things to allow classrooms tools to teach. But there seems to be an attitude of they can't do that.. which I have seen is not true I just want to gather other people experience so I can approach it with not just what limited experience I have working in with the team but from a variety of people so I am not just spouting bullshit.

If I am going to be talking to lectures and people in the science field about why inclusive STEM is important for the visually impaired and blind I want to do it accurately not just my limited interaction from the team at work and the couple of people I know cause I kinda feel like another asshole with a soapbox if I'm also working on my own assumptions and I want to put forward what is actually important.",,,,communicationsmonkey,,,1556973913,t5_2qpec,t3_bkeqza,t1_emgwtut,1,1561511206,0,0,emhc7av,Blind,,,,,
