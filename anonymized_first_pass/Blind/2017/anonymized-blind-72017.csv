3,"25 year old female here. I don't have macular degeneration but I have a very rare condition caused by an anomaly of the optic disc - that is often treated the same as macular degeneration. I have a feeling I will be legally blind by the time I'm 30-35. My right eye is already useless due to blurred central vision. My left eye has been having problems again. 

I also feel that my eye condition has strained my relationships. It sucks, I feel you. Thats why I haven't been pursuing men lately. I hate the idea of being a burden, but I hate even more to think I'm unworthy of someone's love because of my disability.

I don't really have much advice other than theres no point in living our lives like we are already blind, right? 

Hell. I'm a web design / art major. A lot good that is going to do me once by vision finally goes to shit. But at the end of the day, it feels better working for something and staying optimistic. I've always loved drawing and it's been a real struggle coping with the idea that I may be incapable of creating anything other than shitty abstract art.

If you ever want to talk about it, hmu. I'm sure we share a lot of simialar struggles

5,"I drove for several months with sight only in my right eye before I begin losing that vision too.  I don't know which side is your good eye, but you will obviously need to turn your head more when pulling out into traffic or turning.  Definitely take your time when turning left.  I had difficulties managing situations where traffic merged from both directions, like at certain interstate exchanges because you basically have to keep your head looking both directions and in front as well.  You may have limited depth perception.  And driving with one eye becomes more physically demanding because instead of glancing, you have to turn your head a lot, so you'll tire more quickly than before.

Take it slow at first and do not be ashamed to do so.  So what if the people behind you get a little impatient because you take a little extra time?  And be honest with yourself.  If driving seems to be too much, you may need to decide yourself to stop driving.  I've driven hundreds of thousands of miles and live in the middle of nowhere, so I completely understand what you mean by losing your independence.  There is no public transportation here, so my wife or friends take me everywhere.  I haven't driven since March 28 and barring a breakthrough in optic nerve repair, probably never will again.

7,"In Canada, low vision is usually define as being between 20/70 and 20/200 (with 20/00 as legally blind). However, there is a lot of wiggle room there. Someone could have significant field loss as well as accuity loss, and not be legally blind.

Generally speaking, I think most people can agree that enough vision loss to make doing regular, day to day tasks difficult would be low vision.

It isn't, unfortunately.  If you read that privacy policy...if you wouldn't feel comfortable livestreaming it on youtube, don't put it in front of Seeing AI.

So I can't use it to OCR my mail (even though it can read documents) because I wouldn't know if it's my bank statement, junk mail, or a credit card bill, until it's too late!  Instead, I need to use KNFB Reader for that.  Plus, Seeing AI can't identify colours.  I have to use AIPoly instead.  So I have to flip regularly between three different apps.

First world problems, I know!  :-)  At least all three apps exist and are all being improved.  It's an exciting time to be blind.

That would be really cool!  It seems to work for [NVDA](<URL>), and has allowed NVDA to become the best screen reader anywhere, on any platform.  Though I wonder how many people can really contribute to code involving cutting edge AI like this?  I'd be surprised if there were more than a hundred programmers currently living who can do this kind of work.  

&gt; if you do try it out.

I will!  I did a post a few months ago giving a comparison between the OCR quality of Eye of Providence and KNFB Reader.

He thinks it is counter-productive and can be dangerous for a sighted person to simulate blindness. It can also give people the wrong impression of what it is like to be blind, therefore scaring them into thinking blind people are as helpless as they felt while blindfolded. The thing is, living an independent life as a blind person takes practice. There are schools you can live at for months at a time to learn how to cook, travel, and live as a blind person. At his training program, they had a wood shop class where they made grandfather clocks and cooking class where they had to prepare a meal for 30 people. It took training and practice to get there. If a sighted person puts on a blindfold for 15 minutes and tries to cook a meal, they might think, wow this is dangerous! And now, they have the idea that it is dangerous for blind people to cook. That is where is gets offensive. When a sighted person thinks a blind person isn't capable of something just because they couldn't do it without any training and practice.

33,"I fear you’re trivialising what is a very complex issue. You’ve also conflated two issues together: firearms control; and incidents of mass shootings (specifically school shootings). 

You could completely outlaw firearms in the US and I doubt it would impact the rate of firearms related violent crime or death. Even over the medium term, the impact of a total ban would be extremely limited at best. The reason is that firearms are already in distribution and you've mainly got to rely on people voluntarily turning them in when such a ban is implemented. Sure you can send police around to confiscate the things, but the man power required is just too overwhelming. Firearms might also not be completely traceable, or people can lie to conceal and maintain their possession.

The other issue is that it pushes firearms underground. The result is that you create an uncontrollable element. Regulation really is a much more effective tool to deal with the situation.

In my opinion. the two big things that can key this that can help mitigate crime involving firearms and mass shootings in the United States are requirements to properly secure firearms, and attitudinal changes. The thing that always gets me is the number of toddlers that die or who kill their parents with firearms. This situation comes about because loaded firearms are kept within easy reach in the United States. The most successful aspect of Australian legislation is requiring firearms to be secured when not in use in a double locked safe affixed to the building. In addition, firearms cannot be stored loaded, and ammunition must be kept in a separate safe to your firearms (again double locked). On top of these requirements, only the owner of the firearms is legally allowed to access them.

Obviously the US context is different and I’m certain supporters would point to their right to self defence. This element dovetails nicely into my second point regarding attitudal change. Simply put, an attitude that condems harming fellow citizens, or turning to firearms as a first resort in self defence scenarios needs to be encouraged. Such a change is likely to benefit American law enforcement too, both in terms of keeping them safer, and making law enforcement officers seek other means to resolve conflict rather than turning to firearms. Achieving such a change would require a mix of legislation (placing more stringent tests around self defence and use of reasonable force) and education. Again, speaking from the Australian context, self-defence is not an accepted reason for the possession of a firearm. The law also requires flight be preferenced over fight, but in the instance one is pressed to defend themselves with force, that force must be proportionate to the threat and should someone cause injury, or worse death, in the course of defending themselves, the incident will be examined very closely and seriously and it is very likely to progress to the courts to determine whether the person defending themselves was reasonable in their use of force. The key thing here is that you only have the right to harm another in the most exceptional of circumstances.              

Regarding the other issue you’ve raised of incidents of mass shooting, particularly in school contexts, while removing easy access to firearms is likely to reduce if not eliminate them (experiences in Australia and New Zealand support this hypothesis), such responses are reactive, not preventative. Again you also have the issue that you could achieve your desired ends (constraining access to firearms to those that commit mass shootings) in a far easier manner than outright bans, namely more stringent regulations enforcing secure storage. 

What I mean by reactive is that you aren’t actually addressing the root cause of mass shootings, simply the means by which they are perpetrated. Without easy access to firearms what would replace these incidents? Quite likely what you see in the UK: mass stabbings and vehicular attacks. I’d also expect the suicide element of mass shootings to remain unchanged. I’d encourage you to have a listen to Anatomy of a Highschool Shooting by Ill Bill (incidently a song that a French student, who went on to commit a mass shooting in France earlier this year, or late last, was obsessed with). It’s a very confronting song, but his core thesis is that sustained harassment and disrespect, combined with the apathy and absence of concern from authority figures (the teachers), led to the Columbine shooting. His question to us, the listener, is given Eric Harris’ and Dylan Klebold’s perspectives on their experiences and treatment, is it really surprising the event took place? 

So you can constrain access to firearms, but that isn’t going to do anything to address the issues that lead to mass shootings. Rather, what is actually required to prevent such incidents is greater investment in mental health, peer support in schools and workplaces, and greater steps to prevent citizens becoming isolated or ostrasised and connect people with their community. That’s not to say I’m not of the opinion that improved firearms legislation and regulation isn’t part of the response, it is, but it isn’t a panacea to these issues and needs to form part of a wider policy response.  

At the end of the day it needs to be accepted that violent crime will occur. Public policy should mitigate its prevelance to the greatest extent possible while mainting the liberty of its citizens, also to the greatest extent possible. It’s a difficult balancing act to be sure, but it can be achieved short of completely banning firearms – and for a lot less money than this would cost to boot. Whatever controls that might be implemented however, the fact is that America has a very strong firearms culture and a constitution that endorses the possession of firearms. That isn’t something that can be surmounted overnight. Change will need to be incremental and take place within that context.

Edit: Two things I thought of afterwards that I wanted to add:

I’m not here to preach that Australian legislation is superior. It’s far from perfect. It’s merely what I know (I’ve read the Firearms Act and regulations for my state more than once) and I’m providing it as an example of how the issue is managed in other countries (specifically here). The idea being to provide food for thought on possible options for the United States, and a case study that US policy makers can take learnings from. 

Another issue with total bans on firearms that I did not touch on is primary production. Firearms are a very important tool for primary producers to protect both stock and crops from wildlife. This aspect is probably even more important here in Australia than the United States because of the impact of introduced species. Firearms form part of a comprenhensive program, which includes baiting, trapping, and biological controls, to manage feral specifics such as rabbits, foxes, deer, goats, boar, buffalo, wild dogs, feral cats, and cane toads. In addition to their threat to agricultural production, feral animals cause an immeasurable amount of damage to Australia’s unique ecosystems. Any controls need to recognise this importance and support primary producers and conservationists alike.

regarding feeling ""dependent"" where are you in terms of receiving O&amp;M training, learning blindness skills, etc? Having those tools is critical to being able to regain independence. 

As far as the sunglasses go, check out specialty suppliers such as noir medical. They make *really* dark sunglasses, much darker than you can find in shops. Plus they offer color options for various eye conditions, and frames that seal around your eyes. Having good indoor and outdoor sunglasses may help as far as feeling comfortable being outside for a long time, visiting people, or even just keeping the lights normal at your house when other people are around. There are also some specialist sources that can make tinted contact lenses for you as well. 

On friends, some will come around. It will help that over time you can gain more confidence about your blindness and associated tools (like sunglasses) as well as being able to discuss it, and that helps. The awkwardness eases with time and exposure. Honestly though, some people won't really get it, and that's maybe when you want to start to consider their value in your life. 

You're not a problem or a burden. You're trying to figure out how to live under a very different set of circumstances than you're used to. It's totally reasonable to expect that you (and those you care about) are going to get it totally wrong a lot of times as you learn.

I completely understand what you are going through. While I have always had pretty awful vision growing up, I was able to learn to drive as a teenager. During my second year of college, I began losing my vision randomly throughout the day. This began six years ago. Now, I have completely lost vision in one eye and see only light and color in my other. I have learned to walk with a cane and even got a guide dogs couple years ago. While it is an incredibly difficult transition, it's doable. Sure, I have my moments of being depressed that K can't see anymore. I used to be a photographer and even won awards for my work. It sucks, having to relearn skills you've already had. 

As far as people being uncomfortable by you losing you sight. I have found that the people who you really matter to couldn't give a shit if you can see or not. At first they seemed uncomfortable because they didn't know how to react or if they should help me, or if they are helping me too much.

One challenge that you didn't address, that I struggle with, is how to tell the difference between a corporation that really does care, and a look-at-me corporation.  Because all corporations need to market themselves, and they all need to advertise, because the shareholders require it!  So it can be really, really hard to tell the difference between a corporation that talks access but doesn't care, and one that talks access and does care.  Especially because in many look-at-me type corporations, a lot of the individual employees do care.  So it can be really hard to call out the company as a whole, when I know some caring, helpful people who work there.

56,"Hey! I have ROP as well and am legally blind on one eye (with no lenses) and in the other I have somewhat good eyesight, but it is corrected with glasses. I think I might have worse eyesight than you, because I am borderline low-vision/legally blind. 

Like you, I also had to get specially tested to drive. I BARLEY passed it. Although I have not started to drive yet (nervous, and I'm &lt;20 years old) I am NOT going to attempt to drive in the dark. Although I passed that part of the test, my doctor told me not to. So I would suggest not driving in the dark, especially when you said you think it's getting harder. 

I also have floaters in my eye that has a dragged retina. At one point it got so bad that I went to a doctor to see if my retina had detached, but it did not. 

Did you receive O&amp;M in the past? It may be harder to get those services as an adult if you didn't have it when you were younger, partially because of knowing who to contact and all of that. 

About the cane, I haven't gotten O&amp;M instruction yet for it. I don't think I'll need the cane during the day, but I am VERY much considering learning how to use one at night. 

YES, go get help NOW! If you feel like you need it, you should contact the right people. 

Also, another thing to consider is that you are having eye strain. When needed, get large print, and in bold, if that helps you. Also try to do more things (like reading) with audio. Don't be nervous to ask for things like this, it's all about learning how to cope with your disability. 

I hope this helps! P.S. Maybe I could use you for a contact? I'm younger than you but this may help us both out in the long run, I've never met anyone else with ROP.

Since you are defending your thesis, it sounds like you are at the end of your program.  If you have any more classes or decide to pursue a Ph.D., definitely obtain the proper documentation from your opthomologist so you can get accommodations if you are not already.  Your opthomologist may offer low vision services, which will introduce you to adaptive technologies and other resources.  Your state should have a commission for the blind, and perhaps even regional organizations for the blind.  They can provide you resources and offering mentoring or just an understanding ear to hear you out.  And to be frank, where you live does make a big difference if you are blind or are low vision, as urban areas offer more public transportation options or services like Uber.

As for the young men (Ok, now I sound old...lol).  I don't know why your disability would make a difference to a decent guy.   That's not to say that it won't come up at first or even as you get farther into a relationship, but if you feel like he's one foot out the door when the subject of your vision comes up, let him go.  There are good guys out there looking for a well educated women, and they (probably) won't even mind squashing bugs for you.  Hang in there!

Mark Mastaglio, an expert on firearms who worked for the Forensic Science Service for 20 years, said there was no evidence that the ban on handguns after Dunblane had done anything to cut the criminal use of firearms. “It was very rare that there was ever leakage from the licensed gun owners to the criminal fraternity. Most guns used by criminal are either illegally imported or converted weapons. And that remains the case today,” said Mastaglio.

80,"I'm an O&amp;M instructor, so I teach how to use a white cane. I've tried out the ultracane before, and it does what it is suppose to do. There are two main drawbacks to it... the cost is rather high (I believe the website has the price currently listed at 635 pounds), although it used to be significantly higher. The other issue is, the range of the sensor. The lower sensor can sense further, but it is easy to miss small things like a thin pole. The high sensor has a shorter range, but depending on how you hold the cane, it may not have the full range (many people often hold a cane lower than expected). 

That has generally been the problem with this sensing technology. They tried canes with laser sensors before, and the current technology is ultrasound. The costs have been high, and many people find it difficult to justify buying something that expensive when a regular white cane is good enough. I can think of situations where such a system may be worth it (the area they live in has a lot of long-hanging obstacles, or there are lots of obstacles in his regular path that the further range of the sensor would be useful), but most people don't find it necessary.

122,"Hi, you should try asking an ultracane user whether they are as good as they say they are!  O&amp;M Instructors teach people how to use a long cane and of course orientation skills, they have no idea how to use an ultracane and they certainly dont teach its use to people. With the ultracane, you dont walk into objects as you do with a standard long cane because it warns you about them as you are approaching them.  The top sensor detects overhanging branches and things at the side of you that are shoulder/head height such as overgrown hedges.  The vibration is very noticeable even when you are walking over rough ground, because as with any cane you will still get vibrations coming up the cane if its rough, but the intensity of the vibration is very noticeable.  Its also has a very quick response and I am a fast walker!  The reason the handle is big is because the sensors are quite large and I was told that the reason is because the bigger the sensor, the more accurate the detection.  Small sensors similar to the ones used in the glasses you mention are very small and so you dont get as accurate a detection of the obstacle.  The glasses will tell you that there is something ahead but by the time you have moved your head backwards and forwards to try to find it, the ultracane could have got you straight passed it and you are on your way again.  The company has been servicing my ultracane for free for the past five years.  I would not be without it that is for sure.

142,"Just go for an iPhone. Talkback is very inferior and buggy compared to the capabilities of VoiceOver. Personally, I have an iPhone SE, as I dislike the form factor of the 6, 6s, and the 7. It fits my hand perfectly, has a great amount of storage, and is quite fast.

When I was visually impaired, I always had the invert colors function set to a triple-tap of the Home button, also known as the accessibility shortcut. Zoom was accomplished with a three-finger triple-tap on the screen, plus if you held your fingers down on the third tap and slid them up and down, you can control the amount of zoom in and out. Even using an iPhone 4 back then worked very fast with these features,  especially as you got faster and faster at using them. 

Ultimately, most apps built for the iPhone, unless they have quite a bit of custom controls and when the devs don't know any better, most apps are natively accessible from the get-go. There is only one version of VoiceOver and it only changes with most iOS updates and point releases. Talkback changes on every device depending on how the hardware manufacturers decide to incorporate it into their specific build of Android, making the experience inconsistent across all Android devices. 

All in all, VoiceOver is consistent across all iPhones, works faster and more natively than Talkback, plus more and more developers are beginning to hire accessibility specialists like myself to make their apps more accessible overall. The process to do this is much smoother for iOS and takes forever with Talkback apps due to all the hardware differences from all the Android manufacturers and the slow speed of new update adoption from Android users. Give the iPhone another shot, it will ultimately be more worth it in the long run.

These magnifiers are expensive because they're usually purchsaed by the state/through grants rather than individuals.  Depending on his career (anything that would probably be a desk job), you/he can work with the state DVR office to have their help acquiring one of his own, which he can then use for schoolwork and taking to his workplace.

Your idea of using a computer/etc. is very similar and would probably work.  The magnification generally isn't as good on most computer cameras (8x, 12x, etc. vs 50x or higher with the CCTVs, but I don't know how much difference it will make- my magnifier doesn't specify the zoom level.  I usuall use it at less than halfway zoomed in so a webcam would probably work.

Most laptops have HDMI out, which can connect to a majority of newer TVs and allow the TV screen to work as a larger monitor.  Coupled with the built-in magnifiers for Windows/Mac, this will often do the trick.  (If you have set-top boxes like a Chromecast, Apple TV, or Roku, you can even cast wirelessly with same result.)

So, you could go with a larger laptop for school and connect it to the TV for magnifying; you could also go with a smaller and cheaper one (like a Chromebook) and a webcam for about $250 total, though it probably wouldn't be as useful unless connected to the TV.",,,,tymme,"legally blind, cyclops (Rb)",,1500784178,t5_2qpec,t3_6ouysu,t3_6ouysu,1,1501486455,0,0,dklftoi,Blind,,,blue1,,

I eventually ended up at another place that did phone support, where travel wasn't necessary.  Working a later shift meant a lot of calls were maintenance-type issues where they'd call, get me connected, and then let me go to do what I needed.

It's not so much of a matter of ""If he did it, others will too."" I'm npot sure how to convey this clearly. Others' treatment of you has nothing to do with your ex's treatment of you. If you see others as ""potentially like my ex,"" you'll end up making others guilty until proven innocent, whether or not that's your intent. And honestly, though this is definitely *not* a popular opinion, I'd say the answer to any question of the form ""When do I bring up X?"" is ""Immediately."" This seems odd to many, but sometimes our fear of people can actually hurt them. I myself have had experiences where someone waited to bring something up because they were caught up in ""when to say, when to say,"" and I felt hurt, not because of the issue someone was hesitating about, but because they just assumed they knew I'd run off, though I'd made quite an effort to show I wouldn't.

What we don't really need is a weekend hack and a press release that says someone created a miracle app for the blind. There's been too much of that already.

Here's some ideas for (hard) things to do:

- Contribute to open source projects to make them more accessible
- Contribute to NVDA or other open source screen reader projects
- Hack a VR platform to help people with low vision
- Make fun games that aren't Yahtzee. We have Yahtzee. Audiogames are good but IMO text-based games that anyone (sighted or blind) can play are better
- Make accessible IDEs for popular programming languages. There's a need for an accessible Python IDE on OSX, for example. Many blind people are trying to learn to code.
- Apply machine learning to graphical user interfaces to make them accessible. Would be a nice fallback when things aren't screen reader accessible and could make some AAA games accessible
- Hack on a sensory substitution project. The one that's furthest along (I think) is the vOICe, which renders soundsscapes of images. There's a lot of potential there for the CS-inclined and applications for robotics if you, say, figure out some ecolocation tech.

213,"Being scared is a normal reaction to a major medical concern, especially if your prognosis is unknown. Obviously keep pursuing the medical angle aggressively and make any catchall health changes that need to be made (stop smoking if you're smoking, exercise if you're pre-diabetic, etc).

In the short term, there are a couple of failure states for you to watch out for. Paralysis or denial can prevent you from getting medical attention, but you seem to be moving quickly on that front. It can also prevent you from learning new ways of doing things if your vision doesn't recover or worsens. Depression about your  valid medical concerns can mess up other areas of your life, so watch out for that and keep in touch with friends, family, exercise, and do all the things that will help to maintain your mental health as you work through this.

Two concrete pieces of advice for you right now--that's all I can offer since your situation hasn't stabilized and I have no medical advice for you. First, investigate learning screen reader technology. You mention that reading is difficult for you, and screen readers can be very liberating, allowing you to read (I use that term more generally) more fluidly again. THe easiest to get started with is VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, but TextAloud on Windows, which is primarily aimed at dyslexic users, is a good entry point for people with substantial vision left, which if you're driving is the case with you. Learning something new will make you feel like you're taking charge of the situation and will hopefully start to show you that the worse case scenario is survivable.

My other piece of advice is to realize early on if you're unable to continue to safely drive. Many have learned the hard way after being in an accident or worse that they should have given up driving earlier. I'm not saying to stop driving right away, but monitor your ability to drive and only drive if you're certain you can. Continuing to drive after you're unable can be a source of lifetime regret in the worse case.

Even less so if the way they are trying to relate  to me is so far removed from what I am experiencing that I cannot even remotely relate to whatever they are describing.

224,"That really depends on the context in which blindness is being ""simulated,"" I think.

I assume there are also sighted actors who portray blind or visually impaired people, and that's not a problem for me as long as it's done in a spirit of honesty.

225,"As others have said, context matters.  Acting in a movie or play, fine.  To raise awareness is not offensive in and of itself.  However, offense can come when you simulate blindness, and draw the wrong conclusions.  

As an example, let's take someone who has never warn ice skates, ever.  They want to experience what it's like to play hockey.  So, without any training, or even any advice from anyone who has ever played hockey before, they strap on some skates, and head out onto the ice.  Of course, they fall down within the first thirty seconds!  Then, they decide, ""Oh my goodness! Skating is impossible!  Anyone who can skate for more than 30 seconds without falling over is a superhuman hero! Nobody who isn't a hero could ever learn to skate, let alone play hockey!""  Anyone who regularly plays hockey, of course, would disagree.  They probably find skating without falling over to, in fact, be the easiest part of the game.  

Similarly, a lot of people who simulate blindness, to ""see what it's like"", do exactly the same thing as our example above, putting on a blindfold for the first time, instead of skates.  They do it without any training, any plan, or any good advice.  They do it for a few minutes, and decide because they can't manage at all, it must be the hardest thing ever.  They think that they ""know what it's like"", now.  But people who live with blindness, like the professional hockey player lives with skates, are used to it.  The things someone simulating blindness found impossible are probably the things we find pretty easy.  They probably didn't even get far enough to experience what actual blind people think of as the real challenges.

240,"I had a mini stroke last year that left me pretty much blind in my left eye because of optic nerve atrophy.  I went to the ER and my family doctor twice and it was never diagnosed until I saw an opthomologist.  My cholesterol and triglycerides were good, so I didn't fit the profile because I'm 38.  This year I had another event that damaged my right optic nerve, leaving me legally blind.  I found out later than I have a genetic condition called Protein S Deficiency which causes abnormal blood clotting.  You may want to see a hemotologist to check for clotting disorders.

My suggestion is to find a good opthomologist who specializes in advanced care and start seeing them regularly, to document the damage to your left eye and to closely check your right eye.  If you have any related conditions like hypertension, sleep apnea, cholesterol issues, etc., start addressing them to reduce the risk to your right eye.  

Your case sounds nearly identical to mine.  I did all the things above except find out about the clotting disorder before my right optic nerve got damaged.  Had I been on blood thinners (I was taking Aspirin), my right eye might not be so messed up.  Find a doctor who will help you get down to the underlying problem.  Maybe it was a twisted artery, but maybe it's something undiagnosed.  

KillerLag offers great advice.  And if you drive, please be careful!  I drove for almost a year with one eye and you don't realize how often you glance at your sideview mirror with your left eye until you can't do it any longer.  It's particularly hard when you have traffic merging from the left and right, like  certain interstate exchanges.  It's hard, but you'll retrain yourself in time.

241,"First of all, don't panic! Seriously, all the energy going into fear could just as easily go into finding folks with which you can relate.

Secondly, there is something I recommend your never ever forgetting, no matter what. I say this as someone who has had 20/200 vision in my left eye and 20/600 (zillion?) in my right eye for nearly fifty years. Never, ever fporget that you are a person. Yeah, I know, that sounds like a no-brainer, but it's not. It's *very* easy to forget, when getting caught up in worrying about your sight, what others think of you, etc, People who forget they're individual persons often don't truly realize they've forgotten it, because they've internalized so much of society's superficial bullshit. I say again: You are a person. There is more to you than a visual acuity. There is more to you than a ""disability."" There is an actual, real human being there, with your own preferences, habits, interests, needs, etc.

I'm very sorry that someone dumped you because of your vision, but honestly, anyone who would do that wasn't truly with you from the start. You're better off without someone who would even consider such a rash and uncaring action. You do *not* need to settle or be settled for. You need people who accept you, and this is very important--If it's either because of or in spite of your eyes, it's not real acceptance.

Last but not least, I actually do *not* recommend ""coping"" with going blind. To merely cope with something is simply to adapt to it and decide nothing is to be done. I would very strongly recommend *thriving* over coping, and yes, there is a freaking *huge* difference.

The simple version is pretty much just this: Live your life and thrive, instead of merely ""coping.""

1. I have been blind since birth. 
2. I definitely fall on the kinky spectrum, though a lot of what I like depends broadly on what my partner(s) also enjoy. One oddity about me which I haven't seen too much in either the vi or sighted community is that I distinguish between kink and sex. I.E. I can and have enjoyed rope or impact play with friends with whom I did not have a sexual or romantic relationship. Since the specific list of what I enjoy can be fairly variable, the most consistent thing I've found is that my mind has to be engaged in some capacity as well. 
3. I tend to be attracted to people based on personality and common interests/intelligence moreso than gender. I pretty frequently find myself attracted to people of all genders who meet my other requirements regardless of gender. All of my longterm relationships have been with cisgender male people, but I'm open for that to change given the right situation and people. 
4. I am very firmly poly. I believe this is much more because of how I grew up than my blindness, but I've tried to be in monogamous relationships in the past and found they very much don't work for me.

275,"Hello there! I went legally blind at 15. I also work with blind children from tine to time. Here are some bits of advice-

1. Monitor her vision as it changes and make sure to keep in contact with her school district. Do you live in the US? If so, she's entitled to an indivisualized education plan (an IEP). This will ensure that when her vision changes, schooling will remain accessible. Keep an open mind as far as accessibility goes. When she's older, have her try out different learning tools such as braille, large print, tactile paper, traditional magnifiers, and digital magnifiers

2. Look into getting her orientation and mobility training. O&amp;M can include safely crossing streets, navigating stores and buildings, and cane usage. Independance is important, and safe travel is a big part of that! Even if she becomes a ""high partial,"" (meaning that she would still have a significant portion of her vision left) encourage her to try to use a cane. Btw, if you want to make cane-usage more fun (once she gets to that point), maybe encourage her to personalize it. Ambutech sells colorful canes (i have one with a oink handle)

3. Introduce her to the idea of visual impairment at an early age. You don't have to tell her what is going to happen to her right away.  It would be helpful if she knew that some people have to do things differently because they see things differently, and that that's okay! Before i knew that i was going to lose my vision, i just assumed that blindness was this awful scary thing. I wish i could've told younger me that it's just a different way of living. When she starts to understand that her vision is going to change, treat it as a change rather than a tragedy. Also, introduce assistive devices (like canes) to her in a positive way, by focusing on the fact that they help people.

3. When she's older, teach her communication and self advocacy. Even as a teen, i used to get so frustrated when people didn't understand what i could see and what i needed help with. I can only imagine that the experience would be far worse for a small child. Help her learn how and when to ask for help

4. Good organizational habits around the house will help her out a lot! 

5. Perhaps look into local youth organizations for the blind. I joined one after i started losing my vision, and that helped normalize my whole situation. Plus, you'll probably feel more at ease when you come across other parents of blind children. 

6. Keep teaching her to dream big! As someone with a visual impairment, i can honestly say that i lead a happy and fulfilling life. I'm currently going to college and i'm working at a job that i love. When your daughter goes blind, she still will be able to live a wonderful, independant life. 

Hope this helps! Btw, you seem like a good parent since you're already looking toward the future

285,"&gt; I'm worried that I'm just not the type of person who is positive enough and brave enough to handle going blind.

The first year that I started dealing with my condition (vitelliform macular dystrophy), I was suicidal. It was very difficult for me. I can still remember the day I picked up a book and could no longer read it and I went to bed and sobbed for hours. 

I know exactly how you feel. I am not going to lie to you, it's hella scary. The bigger problem that you have right now, is you are likely dealing with medical staff at your appointments and pardon me but they don't know SHIT about what to tell you. 

You need to get into a support system. Most blind centers have group support meetings where others talk about their fears *and* their victories. In larger cities there is likely a Braille Institute, but look in your local area. I found one right on the bus route and I go over there all the time. They have group outings, where you will meet other blind people and it's going to help you! 
 

&gt;But I'm so, so scared of not being able to get a job (I'm in Applied Social Psychology and just defending my Masters in August) I'm afraid I won't be able to do my job tasks or that no one will hire me.

Are you teaching as part of your Master's training? Or working? The Department of Rehab is what you need to slide into. They will help with any extra adaptive training referrals that you need. As well as training you in how to use public transport, orient yourself, get around and do it keeping yourself safe. 

I am not insinuating that you need it yet, what I am saying is mastering those skills is going to give you a much better outlook and more confidence. 

My Department of Rehab counselor is mostly blind because of a brain tumor. When she went blind, and there was no ""time to adjust to it"" period, she went to college and started from scratch, got her MA in Rehab Social Work and started counseling others going through the same thing. The state has provided her with an assistant to help her do the things she has trouble doing. 

She has been an inspiration to me. She takes the train and the bus to work every day, she is very independent. 

It's not a matter or you being positive, or strong, or whatever. It's a matter of slowly acquiring the skills that you might end up needing and that can be a buffer for you. 

I was groped by some random asshat on my birthday a few years ago wandering through a parking lot, and it terrified me. I was scared to get the cane, because I thought it would put a target on my back. One of the technology teachers at the center that I go to said, ""My cane is not a target, my cane is a weapon."" 

I started out not going anywhere after dark, or unless someone was taking me, and I go all over the place now. Public transport is not scary anymore. I have apps to assist me. I can walk around downtown completely blindfolded. It took a while to learn, but I kept at it. I travel, there is always someone willing to point you in the right direction. 

Being positive about it is not something you can do on your own. It will come when you meet others who are profoundly blind and do just fine. They will motivate and inspire you to keep moving forward. ",,,,Sommiel,,,1500518794,t5_2qpec,t3_6o8zq5,t3_6o8zq5,5,1501400215,0,0,dkgjjl5,Blind,,,,"&gt; I'm worried that I'm just not the type of person who is positive enough and brave enough to handle going blind.

The first year that I started dealing with my condition (vitelliform macular dystrophy), I was suicidal. It was very difficult for me. I can still remember the day I picked up a book and could no longer read it and I went to bed and sobbed for hours. 

I know exactly how you feel. I am not going to lie to you, it's hella scary. The bigger problem that you have right now, is you are likely dealing with medical staff at your appointments and pardon me but they don't know SHIT about what to tell you. 

You need to get into a support system. Most blind centers have group support meetings where others talk about their fears *and* their victories. In larger cities there is likely a Braille Institute, but look in your local area. I found one right on the bus route and I go over there all the time. They have group outings, where you will meet other blind people and it's going to help you! 
 

&gt;But I'm so, so scared of not being able to get a job (I'm in Applied Social Psychology and just defending my Masters in August) I'm afraid I won't be able to do my job tasks or that no one will hire me.

Are you teaching as part of your Master's training? Or working? The Department of Rehab is what you need to slide into. They will help with any extra adaptive training referrals that you need. As well as training you in how to use public transport, orient yourself, get around and do it keeping yourself safe. 

I am not insinuating that you need it yet, what I am saying is mastering those skills is going to give you a much better outlook and more confidence. 

My Department of Rehab counselor is mostly blind because of a brain tumor. When she went blind, and there was no ""time to adjust to it"" period, she went to college and started from scratch, got her <PERSON> in Rehab Social Work and started counseling others going through the same thing. The state has provided her with an assistant to help her do the things she has trouble doing. 

She has been an inspiration to me. She takes the train and the bus to work every day, she is very independent. 

It's not a matter or you being positive, or strong, or whatever. It's a matter of slowly acquiring the skills that you might end up needing and that can be a buffer for you. 

I was groped by some random asshat on my birthday a few years ago wandering through a parking lot, and it terrified me. I was scared to get the cane, because I thought it would put a target on my back. One of the technology teachers at the center that I go to said, ""My cane is not a target, my cane is a weapon."" 

I started out not going anywhere after dark, or unless someone was taking me, and I go all over the place now. Public transport is not scary anymore. I have apps to assist me. I can walk around downtown completely blindfolded. It took a while to learn, but I kept at it. I travel, there is always someone willing to point you in the right direction. 

Being positive about it is not something you can do on your own. It will come when you meet others who are profoundly blind and do just fine. They will motivate and inspire you to keep moving forward. ","[{'start': 1886, 'end': 1894, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

307,"Because it happened only recently, the conditions may change (as you mentioned, 1/3 chance of getting better, 1/3 worse, etc). Your primary goal should be to find out if anything can be done to reduce the chances of it happening to the other eye or getting worse (treatments such as blood thinners, etc). 

It also depends on whether you have lost peripheral (side) vision or accuity (fine central vision). If you have lost peripheral vision, you will need to turn your head a bit more to see the lost area. For lost accuity, the other eye will often compensate and pick up most of the slack. You may find some issues with depth perceptions (especially low contrast situations, such as outdoor stairs or dim stairwells), so you may want to consider an ID cane if you find that is an issue. Depending on how much your left eye can see, you may actually still be able to see 3D movies, but there will be lots of factors.

I've also always wanted to say to people who offer me seats on the train ""It's me eyes that're shot, not me legs"", but I've abstained thus far.

354,"I get asked this occassionally, as I am an O&amp;M instructor. One major factor is how much residual vision you have. If you have no functional vision, then it is much harder to use a baby carriage. Because the baby carriage is in front of you, you can't detect things like drop off or other obstacles before it encounters them. The cane can't realistically reach far enough or wide enough.

Some of my coworkers has suggested pulling the baby carriage behind, but that has it's own set of problems, including it's very awkward. The easiest method for very small children is using a baby carrier that straps on to your front (the brands I've used personally have been Ergobaby (when smaller) and Tula (when not as small)). That isn't exactly a long-term solution, though, as eventually the child will reach a point where they are too large to be carried, but may still need a ride (not to mention the gear you will have to carry for the child as well). 

I have heard of, but not seen in action, parents who basically pull a wagon with the child and gear in it. The child has to be old enough to sit up by themselves and usually strapped in to the seat.

360,"I did see a counselor at my university for a little bit. I feel like I already know what scares me (this might change if I actually do go blind). And she was very sympathetic and helpful. It felt good to be able to unload all my worries on her (like I'm doing to you guys) cause I don't always feel able to do that with friends and family (I do talk about it a bit, but I don't lose my shit and sob and admit to all the things that scare me, usually I tell them I'm worried but I know I'll be okay). I just don't want them to worry to much, seeing me upset hurts them and they can't really change anything for me. And my panicking comes and goes so quickly. I'll have a few hours or a night where I just can't imagine handling this. And then my panic runs its course and I feel a little over dramatic for my freak out. 

Normally I see my doctor at least once a year and whenever something ""weird"" happens in my eyes. Just this time he's away on holidays until next week and I'm visiting family out of town anyway. I just get kind of scared cause he tells me I'm at a higher risk of retinal detachment and that that would be an emergency and I need to see someone right away. But I don't really know what that would look like (beyond floaters and flashes and I get those all the time anyway and their NOT a detachment) so I'm always worried it'll be something serious and I will brush it off as nothing and it'll be ""my fault"" if something goes wrong.

370,"I think the question could have been posed more reasonably by asking what people do for work. Your wording implies that you expect that blind people do not work, which may or may not have been your intention.

It's true that blind people are unemployed at a higher rate than sighted people. With that said, there are a number of complicating factors, one of them being the expectation (unfortunately upheld by your question) that blind people are unfit for work. This low expectation can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as has been shown with other groups once deemed to be unfit for paid work, such as women. There are some demographic trends at work that influence employment statistics as well--blind people are more likely to be older and/or in poor health, though of course many or most VI people don't fit that profile.

Anecdotally, I've noticed that blind people tend to gravitate most toward professions like programmer, teacher, lawyer, and entrepreneur. These professions allow a higher degree of control over how work gets done. Blue collar work can be harder and can require special training, but companies like FedEx employ many blind people. VI are more likely to be their own bosses and to start their own business as well, since that gives more control and since discrimination is less of a factor. Driving is a major barrier, and blind people often do better in cities with public transportation for that reason.

This question could have been answered with a little research on Google, so you perhaps deserve a little chiding. But once asked I think questions like these need a full answer, since there are many misconceptions about what blind people are and are not able to do.

387,"The deterioration of my eyesight began last year with a mini-stroke affecting my left eye, continuing with a blood clot in my brain, and  I now find myself legally blind due to bilateral optic nerve atrophy. It's uncorrectible and untreatable.   The sight in my left eye is pretty bad, but I have some usable sight in my right eye, just not in the center of my field of view.  I can mostly navigate by sight, but I'vebeen hit by shopping carts in the grocery store (my fault) and bumped into people and things, so I'm going to start using a white cane.  I'm 38, married, father of 2, and had a job I loved where I was getting toward the middle of my career in local government.

I no longer drive, but I still have my license at least until time to renew in 2020. I would like to keep my license just in case a treatment option is developed that can restore my sight.  My state doesn't require eye exams with renewals until a certain age, but I wouldn't lie to keep my license.   I had to resign from my job because no accommodations could be made (I worked in public safety, so driving and 24/7 response availability were required).  I've applied for my Social Security Disability benefits.

A lot of your questions depend on what you want to do and where you want to live.  If you live in an urban area, you will have a lot more options for transportation should you no longer be able to drive.  You can (and probably already are) getting accommodations for school.  Your state's vocational rehabilitation services will provide services to you to help you remain employed. Also, there are a lot of tax benefits for legal blindness, so talk to a tax professional.  It can make a big difference in dealing with the added costs of blindness.

I think you are incredibly brave and being proactive.  There should be a local commission for the blind in your state, as well as regional, and even some local organizations.  They will understand your problem, help connect you to resources, and perhaps even provide mentoring.  With the right resources, you can remain employed and/or pursue graduate or professional education.  At least one of our fellow r/blind redditors is an attorney and several are employed.  I'd say government is a great career option.

This is a really crazy universe we live in, and there's so much of it that is unknown to this day. That includes vision, and consciousness, and thoughts, and dreams...

So what I have to say is, don't forget those things okay? Don't forget that you had vision, don't forget you were lucky enough to experience nature's beauty. Many do not. Whether that be from lack of sight or from living a poor life style. 

Consciousness is something that is broadly discussed but never pinpointed. Who are we and why are we here? Well... I believe that nature brought us here, that nature brought us here to live, and breathe, and to enjoy and feel and hurt and struggle, to experience all that it has to offer, through all of its creations. Be that you or me or a tree or a mushroom or a cat or dog. We experience metabolism, as energy moves through our morphogenetic fields that vast our human image. 

There is so much to us beyond just what we can see. Maybe you should look into meditation, and try to find peace in the art of nature? This is something that many people fall out of, and is something that I think can really help anyone in a time of distress. Remember, nature created you, and nature created the plants. Plants don't worry, nor do they cower in fear. Animals might worry, but do they let that control them or do they continue through the natural course of life that nature progresses them through?  


While I also do not advise you seek out meta-physical experiences through the use of psychedelics to broaden your conscious perception of the insanely beautiful universe we live in, I can honestly tell you that they have changed my life and opened my eyes to not worry about what my future will hold. Because I am nature. I am a part of this organism, here for a reason. And that is to live, and experience. 

Terence McKenna is an extremely brilliant philosopher of the 1900's that was way beyond his time. Such an inspirational and intelligent man, I really believe he would be a great introductory philosopher for you to listen to, as well as that of Allan Watts.

These men have really given me the guidance and courage to continue through this universe, and to continue fighting despite my own diminishing health.

I'm sorry for talking your ear off (figuratively of course, but if you think about it, this itself is a form of synesthesia, or a mingling of the senses.

Psychedelics can have extraordinary effects on health and have been known to have, at least off the record, healing prep petite beyond our comprehension. 

So do not think all hope is lost, as the world still has time, and so do you. There may very well be a cure for your blindness shortly after it occurs, if anything! Think of how fast technology is advancing, there is definitely hope for our human selves yet. We are still young.  Or fuck it and the world ends.

In recent years though I've changed to a more heavy duty ball cane. The only thing that annoys me about it is the bulk to store when I'm out. Other than that, I prefer using it.

409,"Both things seem like issues. 

Obviously disabled actors face barriers in advancing their careers and being treated like realistic prospects for roles. This leads to situations where an actual disabled person is not cast either because of assumptions about what they can and cannot do, or where claims of ""not being able to find a good actor with x disability"" are made long after systemic barriers forced most of the actors with that disability to do something else. 

I don't think it's an issue that able-bodied actors play disabled people. I think it's an issue when people assume that disabled people can't be qualified for the same roles, and disabled actors seem excluded from real opportunities.

Contacting the state representative and senator was going to be my next step as I have asked for written documentation of their policies, which they’ve refused to give me. The more I try to get things in writing, the more they dodge my questions or flat out ignore me. 

The interesting thing is that they partially funded my MS degree, which I got through with flying colors; however, they’re throwing a fit over me pursuing a doctorate degree. The counselor that questioned my intelligence was an incredibly narcissistic and rude woman that claimed she was providing psychotherapy to me, demanded that I disclose my mental health history, and told me that, and I quote, “your choice to not use psychotropics shows me that you know nothing about psychology and would make a horrible doctor. If you’re so smart, go to medical school and become a psychiatrist.” She also cited my “piss poor” undergraduate grades (A’s and B’s). There was also commentary about my area of specialization (anxiety, PTSD, and transgender/LGBT issues) being “worthless.” She has since been fired. 

Like I said, they partially funded my MS degree, so I’m not sure what the issue is here. I have a meeting with the counselor in a couple of weeks to try to make my case once more.

Part of my MS program involved taking multiple “psychological law” classes, which covered things like contracts, torts, and the laws of involuntary confinement, among other things.

463,"&gt;  Are you able to find braille fictions books to read? I Googled it and the websites I found they all cost around a hundred dollars!

You can get braille and audio books for free through a national service (celalibrary.ca) and through a paid service that provides electronic braille and audio, bookshare.org 

You can also purchase a refreshable braille display, for example one [like this,]
(http://atmac.org/contents/uploads/braille-display-ipad-featured-672x372.jpg) which uses physical pins to display braille text using a screenreader on your computer or cell phone, connected by usb or bluetooth. Often you can get funding for this expensive purchase, but there is also a more affordable display coming on the market soon hopefully for [$499 through the CNIB.]
(https://shop.cnib.ca/ProductDetail/tec9999999999_deposit-for-orbit-braille-reader-20) This can be used to read books from many different sources (although sadly not all ebook providers are accessible) as well as all sorts of content (such as web pages) on your devices.

464,"Thanks for sharing. There's so much going on in this article. Regarding the American legislation issue, I'm an Australian, so I'm an outsider. I do have opinions. If you'd like me to flesh out my thoughts on the situation, let me know.

Regarding firearms use by people who are blind or vision impaired, what I like to tell people is that people with disability do things differently. Just because they are done differently does not mean they are unsafe. 

I also very much like the point the article makes about the assumption people arguing against blind/vision impaired firearms ownership that blind/vision paired people are intrinsically incapable of exercising care and good judgement. It's as absurd as it is disrespectful and insulting. Like any other person owning or utilising a firearm, blind/vision impaired people don't want to bring harm to anyone else or themselves. Just like a sighted individual, of course they are going to take due care and exercise good judgement when handling firearms. Any person who is unwilling to do that shouldn't be handling a firearm, which applies equally to anyone.",,,,Terry_Pie,RP - Legally Blind,,1501416130,t5_2qpec,t3_6qfsri,t3_6qfsri,5,1501971306,0,0,dkx6jbk,Blind,,,blue1,,

467,"I use a unit called a Revolution. Its basically a samsung tablet modified with some specialty app (magnification, OCR, and of course zoom features).

The tablet also comes with its own stand that'll hold it up so i can magnify paper underneath it in real-time.

If you just want like a handheld thing, there's some pretty cool digital magnifiers. I use the Candy 5, but i know quite a few people who use the ruby. Great for reading small chunks of text, but not all that practical for long passages.
