In all the excitement of looking at new laptops, and figuring out a way to keep my current laptop running without overheating until the new one arrives (I have one of those cheap USB powered laptop cooler pads under it for the time being, and the CPU temp is holding at 65...so I figure I've got a few weeks until it just up and dies of heat stroke) I completely forgot about you!

&gt; the language isn't anything like 

I'm slightly fussy about language, so that's a good thing. I think it's so much harder, and more rewarding, to tell complex and engaging stories using simple, straightforward language.  I find too many authors use artistic prose and flowery descriptions to cover up a slow plot or uninteresting story.  I have no patience for that; characters, events, and settings are what matters to how good a story is, not how fancy the author tells it.  If I stop and think, ""Wow! What a nice description! What a clever turn of phrase!"" I'm thrown right out of any involvement with the story, and am just thinking about the writing. On the other hand, of course, writing with spelling or grammar errors is just as bad, for exactly the same reasons.  Anyway, rant over!  

&gt; instead of being spoon fed, 

World building and exposition is the hardest balance to strike, especially in science fiction.  In his early pulp days, Robert Heinlein was a master of it, though he lost the skill as he got older.  Telling the reader what he needs to know, while staying in character and not just info-dumping, is realy hard.  One thing modern science fiction does, that I hate, is assume the reader is going to read the book multiple times.  It expects that the second time the reader reads a scene, he'll say ""Oh! Knowing what I know now, I understand what's happening!""  In my mind, that's cheating.  The reader needs to have, if he's been paying attention, all the info he needs to appreciate a scene going in, or the scene needs to give him the missing info.  In my opinion, anyway. I know some people love puzzle style books, where the plot makes no sense until the second or third time you read it, but I'm not one of them.  Wow, I really am grumpy this morning.  Sorry!  I'll try and stop raving.  :-)

&gt; Am I even close haha?

Yeah, that's exactly it.  Not only does that feedback make me type more accurately, it also makes me feel productive.  The keys are clicking loudly, and springing up and down, so I must really be getting lots of important work done!  I think that illusion of productivity makes me feel good, and actually helps me be more productive in reality.  That sounds strange when I write it out, though.  

&gt; touch as a trigger for imagination? 

Well, it's never been tried. So I don't want to dismiss the idea out of hand.  However, I have a hunch that it won't work.  I don't think touch is closely connected enough to our memories and emotions.  I'm sure you can remember a time you were listening to the radio, and a song that you like came on, and it just took you right back to the first time you heard that song.  The memories triggered by sound can be really, really powerful.  So can smell; think about the smell of rain, or turkey at thanks giving, or the smell of a hospital.  All of those things bring up powerful memories for me when I just think about them, without even smelling them in real life!  The taste of some foods is similarly powerful.  However, I can't think of a single touch sensation that's strongly connected to a memory or emotion.  Sure, I can remember what things feel like (the feel of wood, sandpaper, metal, etc), but none of those feelings bring up strong memories or emotions in me.  However, maybe that's just me.  Or maybe if I was feeling art that tried to trigger my imagination, it would work for me anyway.  This is just a hypothesis that it wouldn't work, not a conclusion.

48,"The thing about command line is that there are just so many commands to remember!  Even if you're blind, a visual interface can still be helpful.  If you forget how to perform a particular function, you can just go hunting through the menus and dialogues of the application until you find it. On the command line, there's no similar way to discover (or rediscover) functionality.  Also, most web apps these days (Reddit, Facebook, etc, etc) are designed visually. So they're really clunky to use in a command line browser.  Plus, they require blind people to understand the visual paradigm anyway.  So if we have to use GUIs no matter what, we might as well just use them all the time.

I do use Linux as a server OS, of course. But I don't find I'm any faster on the command line than I am in a gui.  And when I used Windows Server 2003, I found the GUI made all my problems easier to solve, because it was just easier to find everything.  

One thing I personally want, though I doubt any other blind person wants this, is an accessible bitcoin wallet. Right now I'm forced to use web wallets because everything that runs locally has almost no screen reader support.  This could probably be fixed without starting from scratch, though.  The problem is that the population of blind people is so small, it seems likely that I might be the only blind person using Bitcoin. So the odds of fixes happening are vanishingly small.  Similarly, I don't expect we'll get an accessible hardware wallet for at least 10 years.

53,"Before Pre-Calculus, I used what I call ""calculator notation."" Basically writing everything as it would appear on a scientific calculator. So + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication and / for division. ^ for exponentiation, sqrt(x) for the square root of x, nrt(x) for the nth root of x. Fractions were written (numerator)/(denominator). Vectors were written vec(x,y). Absolute value abs(x) or |x|. The measure of angle ABC was written mangle ABC. Angle, ray, line, line segment, congruent, parallel and perpendicular written as words. I sometimes still use that system for scratchwork but 99% of the time I just write everything out in LaTeX (too much potential for ambiguity in calculator notation). Sometimes I use a halfway system between TeX and calculator notation. Unfortunately some long expressions can be really verbose (I've considered learning a Braille math code for personal use, but when I tried Braille math in elementary/primary school it was nothing but disaster).

Edit: more on my workflow: here's how I'd work out a simple linear equation:
Let's do the equation 2x+3=4x
I start by copying the equation to my clipboard and pasting it on another line. I then ""move the 3 to the other side"" by subtracting 3 from both sides of the = side on the second line:

2x+3-3=4x-3

Copy-paste once again, and on the new line delete +3-3 (it equals zero):

2x=4x-3

We've isolated x, but we need to divide a 2 through. Copy-paste again, and perform the division on the new line:

2x\div 2=4x\div 2-3\div 2

Copy-paste again, delete 2/2 (it equals 1):

x=4x\div 2-3\div 2

4/2=2, so copy-paste and simplify:

x=2x-3\div 2

Copy-paste and move 2x:

x-2x=2x-2x-3\div 2

2x-2x=0, copy-paste again:

x-2x=-3\div 2

x-2x=-x so once again we simplify:

-x=-3\div 2

Basically writing everything as it would appear on a scientific calculator. So + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication and / for division. ^ for exponentiation, sqrt(x) for the square root of x, nrt(x) for the nth root of x. Fractions were written (numerator)/(denominator). Vectors were written vec(x,y). Absolute value abs(x) or |x|. The measure of angle ABC was written mangle ABC. Angle, ray, line, line segment, congruent, parallel and perpendicular written as words. I sometimes still use that system for scratchwork but 99% of the time I just write everything out in LaTeX (too much potential for ambiguity in calculator notation). Sometimes I use a halfway system between TeX and calculator notation. Unfortunately some long expressions can be really verbose (I've considered learning a Braille math code for personal use, but when I tried Braille math in elementary/primary school it was nothing but disaster).

Edit: more on my workflow: here's how I'd work out a simple linear equation:
Let's do the equation 2x+3=4x
I start by copying the equation to my clipboard and pasting it on another line. I then ""move the 3 to the other side"" by subtracting 3 from both sides of the = side on the second line:

2x+3-3=4x-3

Copy-paste once again, and on the new line delete +3-3 (it equals zero):

2x=4x-3

We've isolated x, but we need to divide a 2 through. Copy-paste again, and perform the division on the new line:

2x\div 2=4x\div 2-3\div 2

Copy-paste again, delete 2/2 (it equals 1):

x=4x\div 2-3\div 2

4/2=2, so copy-paste and simplify:

x=2x-3\div 2

Copy-paste and move 2x:

x-2x=2x-2x-3\div 2

2x-2x=0, copy-paste again:

x-2x=-3\div 2

x-2x=-x so once again we simplify:

-x=-3\div 2

Copy-paste, delete negative signs, and make 3/2 look better:

x=\frac{3}{2}

One major issue I find isn't to do with blindness itself, but with comorbidity (two or more conditions at once). For example, I was working with a person with enough vision loss they couldn't see a street drop-off... except they were also partially paralyzed (right side) and in a wheelchair. With only one usable hand, they couldn't use a cane and drive their wheelchair.

70,"There is a very large difference between games that a blind person might enjoy and games that are completely accessible.  Since my eyesight fluctuates a bit I can tell you what I am able to play without actually seeing.  But, I already know the layout of the menus, and for games where you need to choose characters I already know how to navigate to my favourites without being able to see.  If you are completely blind, you will need a guide that can teach you the layout of the menus so that you can memorize them.

Also, with fighting games you will need to look up command lists on google since you will not be able to use the in-game ones.  If you are willing to commit and spend some time educating yourself you can try the following:

1) Mortal Kombat X and Injustice (PS4) - Both these games have excellent sound design and the campaign mode has fully voiced cinematics, so you will always be able to follow the story.  However, the menus are a bit difficult to navigate.  The fighting is quick and action packed, but with some practice you will be able to play this fairly well.

2) Ultimate Marvel VS Capcom 3 - Even though I have not played this much myself, I have watched other people play it a bit.  This is also a VS fighting game in which marvel superheroes face off against characters from various games produced by the capcom company.  This game is loaded with audio cues.  It reads out the name of the character you select, it tells you when super moves are available.  With some practice you will also be able to get a decent hang of this game.  The the previous two games, this one's menus will need some research before you can navigate through them.  It might also be worth mentioning that this game does not have any sort of story mode, so unless you constantly play through arcade style fights or against other people, there will not be much for you to do.

3) You can also try Sou Calbur as another poster mentioned.  This game has installments on the Dreamcast, ps2 and X360.  However, this game does have a ring-out component.  So if your opponent pushes you to the edge of the ring they can throw you out which is an instant loss, and there is no way of knowing how far away from the edge you are.  Admittedly, I could never see the edge of the ring, I was able to play this just fine.  The same bit about the menus and command lists apply here as well.

4) Naruto Shippuuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (PS4) - There are older renditions of this game on X360.  This is also a fighting game.  It is based on an anime.  This places you in an arena type area fighting against a various different ninjas, each with different skills and abilities.  If you can lay your hands on Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations on the X360 I would recommend that one since you do not have to run around during the story mode.  The controls for this game is simple and getting a decent command of the commands will not take long at all.  Audio cues let you know when you need to power up.  It also does not take long to learn the sounds that tell you when you are about to get hit with an attack letting you know when you should dodge or block.  Even though you play in a 3D arena it is not hard to get close to the opposing player.  Pressing triangle and then cross will let you dash right up to the other player without any directional input from your end.  The only challenges facing you in this game is the labyrinth of menus, the sheer amount of playable characters(this makes it difficult, because you will have to learn their voices to associate the ranges of their various attacks with the character themselves, not to mention the difficulty one might have finding the right character on the character select screen), and finally, learning which character's fighting style and ability range suits you best can take some time, especially if you are not familiar with the television series and the characters and their abilities beforehand.

I can list quite a few more fighting games, but I think I have listed enough of those.  Unfortunately other games on console are not very accessible due to exploration and navigational issues.  If you play multiplayer with someone, you can try playing something in the Tales of series.  These games have excellent stories and very nice battle systems.  If you play this with local multiplayer with a sited person you can assist them in fights, follow the story and you would not have to worry about the navigational aspect.  It is not difficult to fight in these games due to the excellent audio cues.  If you have someone to play with you can try Tales of Zesteria or Tales of Berseria on the PS4.  There were previous renditions in the series released on some of the other consoles you mentioned, but I would not recommend them since I have not played them myself and I am not sure how easy the battle systems are.  I am currently playing Tales of Berseria.  I can hardly see the map and the fights are so fast and chaotic I can't see a thing.  Despite this I cranked up the difficulty.  If you have someone to play with you this game is a really fun experience.  Although, I might just warn you that this is a Japanese role playing game.  It has a very long play time.  From start to finish one can easily play this for more than 100 hours to complete the game.  Do not consider this unless you have someone with a decent amount of eyesight to play with though.

All the games I mentioned are very different in their own respects.  I do recommend you watch a review or some gameplay footage on youtube before making your choice.  Just listening to someone play the game would give you a very good idea if it is for you or not.  

Unfortunately most of the accessible games for blind folk are on PC though. I am sure there are also videos on youtube of blind people playing some of these games.  I am sure I saw someone posting a video of them playing Injustice on PC a short while ago.  Even though it is on PC it is essentially the same game.  You should check it out.  I hope this helped.

78,"&gt; Are you Male or female?

Male, but I'm not sure that it matters.

&gt; Did you know how to use Braille?

Yes.

&gt; Is that very hard to know what kind of spice are you using?

Not really. The bottles can be labeled in Braille, and even if it's wrong, spices are the easiest thing to identify by smell.  Cans are harder though. You can tell a spice right away by sniffing, but you couldn't tell two canned soups apart by smell.  And anyway, you wouldn't want to open the wrong can. If you open the wrong spice, you can just close it again.

&gt; What kind of help did you need from others while you are cooking?

Labeling some things after I buy them, that I couldn't tell apart by smell.  Otherwise, now that I've learned how, I can do it myself.  

&gt; What is your ways to define the food is done or not?

Time, mostly.  Doesn't work for cakes, but I never make cakes, so that's OK.

&gt; Have you ever experience a knife cut in your cooking experience?

Nope. I use large, sharp knives. That means I never have to struggle with the knife, or push it hard, because the knife is so heavy and sharp.  That way I've never had a knife slip when I was trying to cut, and I always know where the knife blade is going to go because of the feel of it in my hand.  

&gt; What kind of pots or pans or other cooking product did you usually use? 

I love my Instant Pot Smart.  It's a slow cooker, pressure cooker, it can sauté, and more. And I can control it from my IPhone with voiceover, so I don't have to memorize any controls or buttons.  It's my favourite kitchen device, and the one I use most.  I also have a Hamilton Beach grill that I use when I don't want pressure cooked or slow cooked food.  I can't use my stove at all, because it has a totally flat top. So I can't tell where the burners are.  I use the oven sometimes, but not nearly as much as my grill and pressure cooker.

Male, but I'm not sure that it matters.

&gt; Did you know how to use Braille?

Yes.

&gt; Is that very hard to know what kind of spice are you using?

Not really. The bottles can be labeled in Braille, and even if it's wrong, spices are the easiest thing to identify by smell.  Cans are harder though. You can tell a spice right away by sniffing, but you couldn't tell two canned soups apart by smell.  And anyway, you wouldn't want to open the wrong can. If you open the wrong spice, you can just close it again.

&gt; What kind of help did you need from others while you are cooking?

Labeling some things after I buy them, that I couldn't tell apart by smell.  Otherwise, now that I've learned how, I can do it myself.  

&gt; What is your ways to define the food is done or not?

Time, mostly.  Doesn't work for cakes, but I never make cakes, so that's OK.

&gt; Have you ever experience a knife cut in your cooking experience?

Nope. I use large, sharp knives. That means I never have to struggle with the knife, or push it hard, because the knife is so heavy and sharp.

My vision's not really any worse now than it was when I was younger, but the older I get, the more falling down and running into things _hurts_, so I find myself less willing to risk my health and safety than I once was.

&gt; The theatre is called 4DX 

That sounds really interesting!  I'll go bother the two or three Scottish blind folks I know to see if they've been and what they thought of it.  If I lived there, I'd have definitely made time to go.

By the way, are you at all familiar with the work of [Dr. Michael James Heron](http://michael.imaginary-realities.com)? He works at Robert Gordon University, and has done a lot of really interesting research into accessibility of computer games, board games, open-source software, etc.  

&gt; I'm pretty interested in your baseball radio. Do you like the device itself at all? What is it like? 

Sure, I like it for listening to baseball games!  LOL.  It's a hand-sized radio, shaped sort of like a cylinder, with a speaker and extremely short antenna on the top, and a place to put the batteries in at the bottom.  It has two dials on the side, the larger one near the top for changing the frequency, and the smaller one near the bottom for turning the radio on and changing the volume.  It also has a toggle switch that slides between being up for AM, and down for FM.  If I line the bottom of the radio up with the heel of my palm, the top of the antenna sticks up just a few mm above my longest finger. As for width, I can comfortably make a circle around the radio with my thumb and longest finger. I have no idea what colour it is.  And that's the most detailed description I can give without actually measuring anything.  

I got it when I was about 6 years old, and took it with me to the ball park the first time I ever went. It's been my baseball radio ever since.  It's far from the only portable radio I have, though.  My friends joke that whenever I find a portable radio on sale, I can't resist buying it.  Not actually true, but I do own a few more radios than I need.  A canadian manufacturer of shortwave sets was closing down, so I just had to get one of the last ones they made!  And a few years ago a local electronics store was going out of business, and everything was 50% or more off, so I wound up getting a couple radios there, because they had interesting features (AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio/marine radio on one, another with 3 extra shortwave bands we don't actually use in Canada and the ability to do upper and lower sideband). And I found a tabletop radio made in the late 60's or early 70's that doesn't even have FM or the AM expanded band at a garage sale for $5, so I had to buy it. It's actually covered in fake leather!  ROFL!  Etc, etc, etc.

&gt; So you have never seen baseball, but enjoy listening to it. 

Actually, I played tee-ball as a young child.  And I've played a few games of beep baseball whenever we could get enough blind people together for a one-off game. Though I never played either game seriously.  I've also been to events in the past where I got to walk around the field, run the bases, and meet some of the players.  I even have a baseball autographed by the Toronto Blue Jays world series winning team!  So I've been listening to baseball games on the radio for as long as I can remember, and going to games for almost that long.  

&gt; What do you especially like about it?

It's a slow paste game, leaving plenty of time for descriptions of the action, and making it easy to follow, even when listening socially with friends and family.  If I had been born in the UK, I expect I'd feel the same way about cricket.  But as it is, nobody in Canada cares about that sport, and it's never on the radio here. So I'll stick to baseball.  Also, I'll never get to visit a cricket pitch, so even if I started listening online, my mental imagining of the plays would never be as strong.  So I guess it's fair to say my love of baseball is as much an accident of birth as anything. 

&gt; Are the braille cards an easy way to play together?

Fairly.  But whenever someone else plays a card, they need to announce the card they played (assuming we're playing a game where cards are played face up, or tricks are taken, or whatever), so I'll know what's happening, and who's turn it is.  So that can sometimes be a barrier to having relaxed conversation while playing cards, because it keeps getting interrupted so someone can announce there play.  

&gt; How is braille for you in general? 

Blind children who don't learn Braille don't learn how to spell, how to use punctuation and capital letters, or how to format paragraphs.  So it's something that's just gotta be learned!  However, once I became an adult, the only things I use Braille for are games, and labeling objects. I would never read a Braille book today. It's too bulky, too slow, and too expensive.  But never-the-less, I'm glad I learned Braille as a child. If I hadn't, I couldn't write as clearly on the computer as I do today.

&gt; Do you wish there were more things available in braille 

More Braille books? No.  And I don't really want letters, bills, or other documents in Braille; those are fine online. But signs, door numbers, button labels, ATM instructions, or any other text that's built into the physical world, and wouldn't make sense electronically, yes please!

&gt; What is it about accessible game versions that make it harder to get together with people you don’t know that well to game?

First off, the modifications can make the game look unusual or different.  Second, they may have to change how they play slightly, for example by announcing there move or play.  Generally people seem to say that if you take your hands off the board, or lay the card down on the table, or pick up a peace and move it, your play is done and you can't take it back. I always house rule that your play isn't done until you've announced it, with some exceptions depending on the game. For example, in some games where you have to decide if you're going to draw from the deck or the discard pile, you can't change your mind once you've seen the card you drew.  But in general if you move a peace or put down a card or whatever, you can still change your mind if you haven't announced your move outloud.  This also helps to prevent the next player from starting to take his turn before the previous player has finished telling me what she did.  Third, accessible games are a lot more expensive than the regular variety!  A single pack of Braille cards can be as much as $20. And some people are just so rough on cards when they shuffle or deal.  Bending a regular pack of cards over the course of a game night is no big deal, because an entirely new pack is only a dollar.  But I'd like my Braille cards to last months, if possible.

&gt; are there any other formats you can use?

Sure. Electronic formats, like epub or html or pdf, assuming the publisher isn't using any DRM.  Similarly, Kindle books, unless the publisher has disabled text to speech.  Unfortunately, some publishers sell a Kindle book for $9.99, and disable text to speech, to make sure people are forced to purchase the audio book they also sell, for $30.

&gt; What would a shared experience be?

I consider music, food, and books shared experiences, even if they're not something we're all doing together.  Because it's still possible to discuss them after the fact. I've spent many an evening engaged in discussions of the smallest details of Harry Potter, for example.

I don't consider movies and TV shows shared experiences, because even with audio description, blind people are missing a lot of the information conveyed only by visuals.  However, I used to think the information we were missing was a lot more important and involved than it perhaps is. In the past, I've publicly stated in online discussions that 75% of the information in a TV show or movie is conveyed exclusively through visuals, and vigorously defended that totally unsupported opinion, to the frustration of everyone else in the discussion.   That only started to change a few years ago, when I got involved in the fringes of the _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic_ fan community.  A gentleman writes some [extremely, extremely detailed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_9kufM2yZeHcRZ_bw7j1SYPxhnaCMKvHLI9zNCX52Q/edit) transcripts for the episodes of that show.  Comparing those shot-by-shot scripts with the episodes that are available with audio description really reinforces just how little the things the audio describer fails to mention matter to the plot...or...well, anything really.  But when I know I'm missing information, I tend to way over-estimate just how important the things I'm missing are, perhaps because I have no visual memories of TV, so know way of imagining what actually happens on screen.

&gt; goal ball

I've played that a bunch over the years, though again, never for anything more than fun.  I think that's a good example of a shared real time experience.  And I would agree with you that shared real time experiences are few and far between.  However, I don't agree that an experience has to take place in real time to be shared. Hense music, podcasts, books, food, cooking, etc, can all be shared experiences.

92,"I've heard that theory too, but as I'm fully blind and heard them, that's not convincing to me.  A more convincing theory I've heard is that the sound comes from the strong/sudden magnetic impulses creating interference in the nerves that carry sound/sense impulses to your brain.  Your brain processes that interference as sound.  It might also explain why you can't hear them if you look away. If you point your head downward, or go inside, or are making lots of noise as you move around and do things, the interference is either blocked by the back of your skull if you're looking down, or drowned out by all of the other nerve impulses your body generates as you do things.  So you can only hear this ""sound"" if you stand still with your face pointing upwards, the position most people take when they're looking at the northern lights.",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1490633992,t5_2qpec,t3_61qgxs,t1_dfh2ufb,1,1491827705,0,0,dfh3a4u,Blind,,,blue1,,

110,"Alright, this reply might get a bit long, but I'm hoping to cover everything you've touched on in your thread and its replies.

Regarding the interaction between disability and Feminism, I've actually had that conversation a couple of times with a mate of mine who has cerebral palsy. Our conclusions are that there are versions of Feminist thought which indirectly devalue people (males particularly) with disability. Basically it comes about through a line of argument that considers men (or women) who are not independent as inferior and men who are reliant on women as immoral/detestable (ditto the women that choose or allow themselves to be ""exploited"" - I'm being deliberately provocative here). The indirect implication of course is that people with disability who may need some support (the rolling of dice in a game of Monopoly, to continue the example) are detestable/immoral (and again, ditto women who support them/assist their independence etc).

Now, this is really important, first up: Feminists are not one faceless group of individuals. Feminism is a nuanced school of thought and it is important to ascribing actions and positions of someone who proclaims themselves a Feminist to all who proclaim themselves Feminists. Secondly, I suspect if you pushed the Feminist who did appear to hold the views I've outlined above, they would either strengthen their argument to remove the indirect consequence or concede the point that it is a logical weakness. That's my take on it all at least, I'm not up with Feminist thought and have never taken to theories born out of Marxism (the idea we can interpret the world through class struggle). That's not to say I haven't read them, I'm just a blend of classical liberal and realist in the school of political economy. (For the record, I've a Bach. International Studies, Honours (First Class) in International Relations).

As for my take on the wider topic. I've never had a girl turn me down because I'm blind. Nor have any of the girlfriends I've had, love interests or friends in general write me off or stay away because I'm blind. In fact none of them have even thought much about it and often people forget I'm blind. The reason for this is largely because I'm legally blind and can still do a lot with the vision I still have (central in my left eye). But I do ask people to read menus for me (and have done for a while now) and sometimes other things (e.g. letters), help telling colours apart, guidance at night or in low light, and of course transportation. 

I am currently single though, and have been for a while now (~9mths). Finding girlfriends is Hard and I really regret neglecting social interaction with the majority of those I went to uni with in favour of alcohol and World of Warcraft (and later Company of Heroes. Can't play either of them now, so woops, poor life choices). Now I'm working and I don't have those opportunities to meet people that schooling or casual/non-career work provides. Does that make me a sad panda? Yep. Do I let that stop me? Nope. Because if you don't try, you won't ever achieve. 

To me the secret is really ignoring your sight. You just do what you do to get done what you need to get done. If you start fixating on your sight being rubbish, then you'll come undone because suddenly you'll start taking the view of ""woe is me"" and no one wants to be around that. That's not to say I'm a very dark, sarcastic, self-deprecating cynic, I am. But I know if I go ""well, I -could- go to such and such, but it is dark and I'm unfamiliar with the locality"" I'm never going to get anywhere.

Most of the museums are pretty good about being accessible, though I personally found I enjoyed the Canada Aviation and Space Museum the most, as I could get close to the largest number of exhibits. The Canadian War Museum, for example, really does try, but nearly everything is behind thick glass for obvious reasons.  The Canadian Museum of History is similar in that respect.  I never got to the CSTM before it closed, so I can't say anything about that.  

Visiting parliament was worth doing for me, though probably mostly to get close to The Peace Tower.  I've never traveled to any other location with a bell tower, so getting right near the bells as they rang out was worth it to me.

Never been to The Royal Canadian Mint, though it's on my list of things to do at some point.

If you do, I'd appreciate knowing how it went! :-)

Never been to The National Gallery of Canada, and don't intend to go, for obvious reasons.  But maybe if the people in your group have some remaining vision, it might be worth it.

&gt; ""I honestly don’t think I will ever fully accept becoming legally blind.""

While there is obviously an adjustment process and training that you need when you suddenly lose your sight (and which may make family members do things for you that they didn't before for a short while) generalizing this to ""the child who has a blind parent"" is extremely wrong. 

It is not normal or acceptable to expect your child to count steps, announce curbs, pick up broken glass for, or otherwise ""protect"" you as an able blind adult. If someone is doing this, they need to get themselves more blindness training ASAP and figure out how to repair an appropriate relationship with their child. 

While I understand that the author's perspective comes through the lens of having lost her sight in the past few years (long enough, I think, that any of this behavior should be in the very distant past!) and not having fully adapted to it, it is potentially incredibly damaging to paint this as a normal experience for the children of blind parents.

In terms of touch as an amplifier or enhancer: Perhaps the tactile experience of the D-BOX just overwhelmed the story of the movie? Especially if it was a forgettable action flick. Maybe the plot would’ve stuck in your mind better if it had been executed more subtly?

In terms of touch as an amplifier or enhancer: Perhaps the tactile experience of the D-BOX just overwhelmed the story of the movie? Especially if it was a forgettable action flick. Maybe the plot would’ve stuck in your mind better if it had been executed more subtly?

171,"&gt; This is super interesting! 

The ability to recognize voices is interesting to me because it's something nobody does, or can, really talk about. Like, we have hundreds of English words to describe tastes. I could describe in detail how and why onions taste different from chocolate.  But I would struggle for words to describe how and why [India Fisher](http://www.sueterryvoices.com/artist/india-fisher) does not sound like Emma Watson.  I linked to her voice acting profile, because it's super interesting to me that even professionals who are in charge of finding work for voice actors have so much trouble describing voices.  They're just reduced to using tags that refer to the things she does (""comedy"", ""narration"") and what accent she has, not what she actually sounds like.  If I went to a website advertising, say, beer, they could use tens or hundreds of words to exactly describe the taste of the beer they're trying to sell me.  But the only words we have to describe the sound of voices are just musical words, that are also used to describe the range of instruments (soprano, alto, etc).  And it's a lot more than just the range and accent that makes one person sound different from another. But I feel like the English language has no words to describe those other factors, making it hard for me to even identify what they are.  

Oh, or an even better example. Why doesn't [Andrea Libman](http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Andrea-Libman) sound like [Kristin Chenoweth](http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Kristin-Chenoweth)?  They both are female, actors, middle aged, have Midwestern American accents, high voices (and probably similar vocal ranges), and play characters with active personalities.  Yet they sound so different nobody would ever confuse the two.  

Also, I just discovered this behind the voice actors website right this second, while looking for vocal samples. This damn thing is going to kill my entire afternoon, now. Sigh.

&gt; I saw him acting in something else later

This happens so often in Canadian movies. The population of Canada is quite small, so we don't have that many actors in total. But to be considered Canadian content for the purposes of getting arts funding and satisfying broadcast quotas, a movie has to use a majority Canadian actors.  So every famous show or movie has actors from at least two other famous shows or movies. It can be quite distracting.  

&gt; area specifics and where to go to look for accessible copies

I'm sure it could, yeah. Not sure it would be that helpful, though. I think all blind Canadians know where to go in Canada to look for accessible copies. I guess it might be useful for blind people who move countries.  

&gt; Has it been difficult for you?

Yup. After university, I spent four years doing job interviews, with absolutely nothing to show for it.  Even now, I still think I might rather work a 9 to 5; I'm not the start-up type of person, I do it because I have no choice, rather than because I have a burning desire to be involved at the ground floor.  

&gt; How did you become a part of it?

Because I know everyone involved, so they're all familiar with my skills.  Plus, in a tiny start-up, I can just pick the software and hardware we use myself, so I'm not stuck with inaccessible software or systems that a larger company might have already purchased previously.  It does mean that If we ever get big enough to hire (unlikely, but who knows), we could hire more blind people without any trouble.

&gt; visually impaired friends gotten around this?

A lot of them do government funded work for other blind people. So, training, accessibility testing, etc.  Some of them get hired by other blind people who started companies.  Some of them start a business themselves.  But most of them just don't work at all.  Out of about 50 people I know personally, I'd say I know three who work a regular nine to five for an established company.  A bunch of them run ""businesses"" as a reseller for one MLM scheme or another. Two or Three run businesses that I'd judge (just based on what they do and my personal feelings) to be successful.  And five or ten work for the government.  The rest just live on government benefits and enjoy life the best they can. And I want to make it clear I don't judge these people.  We can't all get government jobs! And starting a business isn't something most people, blind or not, can even do.  

&gt; description of what you would need to play and how the game should be adapted?

Well, in the case of pen and paper RPGS, the difficult points are going to be the dice, the character sheets, the maps, and the miniatures if any.  How to adapt them depends on the game. Does that RPG have a good software system for doing character sheets on the computer?  If so, the blind player could bring a laptop.  If not, how often does the character sheet change during play?  Could the DM email the blind player his updated character sheet before the start of each session, and the blind person could just print it out in Braille, and keep track of changes during the session in his head?  Same for maps. In some systems, they're just atmosphere, and don't matter at all. Maybe a quick description would be enough. In others, they matter a lot.  As for dice, accessible dice exist, and so do accessible computerized dice rollers. So it's going to depend on the game, the DM, and the players. I don't think there's ever a one size fits all solution that would fit every group, even for the same game. Because RPGs are so much about roleplaying, and house rules, and so-on, I think the adaptations also need to be more customized to that group and that game, than say, adapting poker.

Well, the broken laptop is a discontinued windows 7 HP machine that I purchased on clearance three years ago for like two hundred bucks. So I'd say it's done it's duty, handling Windows 10 fine, and working for as long as it has.  The upside is that absolutely anything I buy at this point will be a pretty big upgrade.

&gt; Perhaps touch could work as an amplifier or enhancer

Yes, I can see this being more likely.  I did go to a movie theatre once where the seats could vibrate/move/tilt slightly based on what was happening in the movie, and it worked pretty well for me, and drew me a little deeper into the film.  Unfortunately, I don't remember much about the theatre or the movie, and I've never heard anything about this technology since, so I guess it didn't catch on.  Also, the experience apparently wasn't outstanding enough to make the plot of the movie associated with it stick in my mind.  It was some largely forgettable action flick, as far as I can recall, and it didn't have audio description.  It would have been in Canada around 2014 or 2015, so based on some quick Google research, it seems likely the thing I'm thinking of was [d-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Box_Technologies).  But I'm not absolutely sure of that.  I know it was something that theatre was offering to the general public for that particular movie, not a private screening tech demo or anything. But I've never heard of it since, at any other theatre for any other movie.

Your comment about touch enhancing other forms of entertainment also brings [feelies](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Feelies), the objects shipped with older text based computer games, to mind.  Unfortunately, I'm too young to have purchased a text based game back when this was a thing.  So know idea how well they worked.

&gt; let me know if I'm loosing your interest 

Nah. I can ramble on about almost anything, pretty much forever. LOL.  

&gt; If I were to ask you to give me an object or objects that you associate with leisure and entertainment, what would it or they be? Why?

Hmmm.  Well, pretty much all of my solo entertainment comes from my phone or my computer.  But then, pretty much all of my work is also done on my phone or my computer. So I wouldn't say there's a strong association there.

I do have a portable AM radio that I use exclusively for listening to baseball games, and that I take to the ballpark with me whenever I go. I refer to it as my baseball radio in conversation (""Where'd my baseball radio go?"") and just expect that anyone who knows me will know what I mean.  I literally can't imagine anyone listening to music on my baseball radio. It just seems strange, and I have no idea what it would even sound like.  Man, that makes me seem really weird! It's not as strange as it looks when I write it down, honest.

Braille cards, obviously. I play a lot of card games with my extended family. So the box and the cards are all strongly associated with family and fun.  Similarly, I also have several other Braille games (dominoes, yahtzee dice, etc) that I play with different people at different times.

My TV chair.  Again, that sounds stranger than it is.  It just happens that because of where that chair is in the house, I only sit there when using the TV (either alone or with others).  I don't know why I'd ever sit there without TV, so again, the association is pretty strong.  Other people do sit in that chair and don't watch TV, so it's not as unthinkable as someone listening to music on my baseball radio. So I guess that's not quite as strong an association. Either that or I don't feel that the chair is ""mine"" (it's just the chair I sit in when I'm using the TV, unless someone else is already sitting there) in the same way that my baseball radio is ""mine"" (and I keep it in my room next to my bed, and nobody else ever uses it for anything).

I'm sure there are others, but those are the first few that come to mind.  

&gt; how do you interact with other people 

Movie nights, and gaming nights, yes. Though not as many gaming nights as I'd like; accessible versions of games are expensive, and I don't own as many different games as I'd wish.  Plus, I have to bring my accessible version of the game, so if I'm hanging out at a friends place, we can't just all spontaneously decide to play cards. If I didn't bring Braille cards with me, I can't play.  Plus, the fact that we all have to use the accessible version of the game can make it harder to get together with people I don't know that well and game.  

I do participate in book clubs sometimes.  However, most books aren't available in an accessible format, even today.  So when the book club is reading a book I can get, I'll go.  When they're not, I won't.

Well, the broken laptop is a discontinued windows 7 HP machine that I purchased on clearance three years ago for like two hundred bucks. So I'd say it's done it's duty, handling Windows 10 fine, and working for as long as it has.  The upside is that absolutely anything I buy at this point will be a pretty big upgrade.

&gt; Perhaps touch could work as an amplifier or enhancer

Yes, I can see this being more likely.  I did go to a movie theatre once where the seats could vibrate/move/tilt slightly based on what was happening in the movie, and it worked pretty well for me, and drew me a little deeper into the film.  Unfortunately, I don't remember much about the theatre or the movie, and I've never heard anything about this technology since, so I guess it didn't catch on.  Also, the experience apparently wasn't outstanding enough to make the plot of the movie associated with it stick in my mind.  It was some largely forgettable action flick, as far as I can recall, and it didn't have audio description.  It would have been in <LOCATION> around 2014 or 2015, so based on some quick Google research, it seems likely the thing I'm thinking of was [d-box](<URL>).  But I'm not absolutely sure of that.  I know it was something that theatre was offering to the general public for that particular movie, not a private screening tech demo or anything. But I've never heard of it since, at any other theatre for any other movie.

Your comment about touch enhancing other forms of entertainment also brings [feelies](<URL>), the objects shipped with older text based computer games, to mind.  Unfortunately, I'm too young to have purchased a text based game back when this was a thing.  So know idea how well they worked.

&gt; let me know if I'm loosing your interest 

Nah. I can ramble on about almost anything, pretty much forever. LOL.  

&gt; If I were to ask you to give me an object or objects that you associate with leisure and entertainment, what would it or they be? Why?

Hmmm.  Well, pretty much all of my solo entertainment comes from my phone or my computer.  But then, pretty much all of my work is also done on my phone or my computer. So I wouldn't say there's a strong association there.

I do have a portable AM radio that I use exclusively for listening to baseball games, and that I take to the ballpark with me whenever I go. I refer to it as my baseball radio in conversation (""Where'd my baseball radio go?"") and just expect that anyone who knows me will know what I mean.  I literally can't imagine anyone listening to music on my baseball radio. It just seems strange, and I have no idea what it would even sound like.  Man, that makes me seem really weird! It's not as strange as it looks when I write it down, honest.

Braille cards, obviously. I play a lot of card games with my extended family. So the box and the cards are all strongly associated with family and fun.  Similarly, I also have several other Braille games (dominoes, yahtzee dice, etc) that I play with different people at different times.

My TV chair.  Again, that sounds stranger than it is.  It just happens that because of where that chair is in the house, I only sit there when using the TV (either alone or with others).  I don't know why I'd ever sit there without TV, so again, the association is pretty strong.  Other people do sit in that chair and don't watch TV, so it's not as unthinkable as someone listening to music on my baseball radio. So I guess that's not quite as strong an association. Either that or I don't feel that the chair is ""mine"" (it's just the chair I sit in when I'm using the TV, unless someone else is already sitting there) in the same way that my baseball radio is ""mine"" (and I keep it in my room next to my bed, and nobody else ever uses it for anything).

I'm sure there are others, but those are the first few that come to mind.  

&gt; how do you interact with other people 

Movie nights, and gaming nights, yes. Though not as many gaming nights as I'd like; accessible versions of games are expensive, and I don't own as many different games as I'd wish.  Plus, I have to bring my accessible version of the game, so if I'm hanging out at a friends place, we can't just all spontaneously decide to play cards. If I didn't bring Braille cards with me, I can't play.  Plus, the fact that we all have to use the accessible version of the game can make it harder to get together with people I don't know that well and game.  

I do participate in book clubs sometimes.  However, most books aren't available in an accessible format, even today.  So when the book club is reading a book I can get, I'll go.  When they're not, I won't.  

I also enjoy traveling/having a night out with friends.  When a group of us get together to try a new restaurant or visit a new museum exhibit or go to a concert or something, I really enjoy it.  Sure, I could do all of those things alone, if I had to.  But the extra logistics of getting cab rides, reading menus, finding my way on my own, not having any friends around to describe anything, etc, just suck all the fun out of whatever I'm doing.

In that case, you'd need to strip out the graphical content or something. Because software piracy is a huge problem in the blind community, unfortunately.  So you need to make sure pirating the ""blind version"" isn't just a back door for sighted people to also pirate the game when it hits torrents about a week after release.

&gt; but i could always factor it in as an update.

That's the way to go for Xbox, at least.  Unfortunately for the PC, your choices are to distribute via Steam and lock out lots of players (though it does give us more ammunition to pressure Valve to make Steam accessible, not that they give a damn despite the multiple petitions, and publishers like Skullgirls and Choice of Games publishing accessible games on Steam), or do a separate ""blind"" version.

I think what is a bit disturbing about the original post by Maria, is how it is addressed  in universal terms. It is addressed to all children of blind parents, as opposed to to her own children specifically. If it were worded differently it would not only be more personal and impactful, it would be less disturbing and offensive. She is taking her own experience and generalizing it.  That is how stereotypes happen.  

She is not doing it intentionally, but it is potentially very damaging if people take it at face value and make the assumption that her experience is true of all blind parents. 

*Sigh

In fairness to Maria, going blind as an adult, and suddenly to boot, is hard. She isn't just adapting to how to relearn everything, she is also figuring out who she is. So much of our identities are based on our abilities, the things we are good at, the things we like doing.  Transitioning from being a sighted person to being a blind person is daunting, sorta like transitioning between genders. You aren't  just adapting to your new life, you are figuring out who you are within that new life.

235,"&gt; neither one of them would be comfortable with a blind O&amp;M instructor

Even (and perhaps especially, sometimes) blind people who work in the field can have lower expectations for themselves or for others than are truly possible. 

There have been blind O&amp;M instructors for a couple decades now at least, so if there were some spate of blind instructors getting their clients run over we'd know about it.

240,"Can I ask your general age?  This sounds a lot like myself during high school and early college.  I got up the nerve to ask one girl out after several months of general niceties both ways (nothing over-the-top) and she thought I was nice but it wasn't time for a boyfriend.  (I was about two weeks to early, apparently, because she started going out with someone else then.)

I was lucky enough to be on the Internet when it was more of a hobbyist thing.  I met most of my girlfriends (including my fiancee) online first.  Even the ones I met in real life first included a lot of talking online- one was a co-worker that made up a cousin I was talking to until she got to know me a bit better; the other was a friend of a friend that I talked with at night.

The biggest thing, imo, is that maturity makes a big difference... on both sides.  In high school and both times in college (right out of high school and again 20 years later), I picked up on the same vibes from most women.  There will be some that stand out, but a majority just aren't ready at that point.  It's not ""harder"", it's just more ""different"" than many want to undertake with everything else going on.

Reeking of desperation, ""please talk to me, be close to me"", etc., pushed some girls I'd originally gotten close to, away.  I usually stumbled into another relationship when I'd gotten to the point of ""it'll happen when it'll happen"".

247,"&gt; Would you call yourself a collector? 

No.  First of all, I've never gone anywhere with the specific purpose of buying a radio. It always just happened by mistake.  I went to the local electronics store sale, because how couldn't I? Huge blowout! Everything 50 percent off or more! Who could resist that?  But I had no idea what, if anything, I'd buy.  Similarly, the garage sale where I got the old table top radio was just something I happened to be walking past, and the person I was with pointed it out to me.  I've never gotten up and thought to myself, ""Hmmm, today I'm going to ad to my radio collection!""  Second, I don't think of the radios as a collection. They aren't on display anywhere. I don't keep them in the box, so they'll stay in mint condition. In fact, I use them sometimes. They aren't even all together in one place.  Unless the oddly specific subject of portable radios comes up, I don't feel a pressing need to talk about them, or show them off to anyone.

&gt; Why portable radios?

Because they're interesting!  You'd think for a device that simple, everyone would agree on what features a portable radio should have, and how it should be designed. Then they'd just crank out a few nearly identical models and be done.  But no!  I've seen large tuning dials, tuning dials with a smaller dial inside for more exact tuning, dials with two smaller dials inside each other, digital tuning buttons, strange dials with a small handle sticking out, and more.  And that's just for the basic function of changing frequency. Never mind the question of what frequencies should it have? Does it need to have a flashlight? Plastic or metal? Wind-up? Should it be shaped like a popular Disney character?  Should it have a built-in bottle opener?  Speaking from experience, The answer to those last two questions, by the way, is ""probably not"".  

&gt; Did doing this help you make sense of not only baseball, but other games as well? Do you know what happens on a for example, football field?

No, not really.  I've walked a football field (and by football I mean NFL football), so I'm familiar with the dimensions of the field. Useful, because people often estimate the dimensions of large things like aircraft carriers and rocket launchpads in the number of football fields that could fit inside.  Or at least, the people I know often do this.  But I don't really understand how the players stand in formation, or how passes work, or things like that.  

&gt; Oh wow! That must be a prized possession, eh? When and where did you get it?

I got it as part of a publicity event I was invited to by the CNIB.  Famous players interact with disabled kids, and everyone takes photos. That sort of thing.  And yes, it's a prized possession, though I have a different relationship with it than I do most other possessions.  I keep it in a clear plastic case, so I've never even actually touched it other than when I first got it. It's up on display on one of my shelves, and I will point it out to other baseball fans.  But it's in a case, and pretty high up, where I don't really interact with it other than when I'm dusting.  

&gt; a practical or a social barrier.

Huh. Interesting. A bit of both, maybe?  I know when I listen to a group of entirely sighted people playing a card game, the flow of conversation, and the sound of the game, is entirely different.  It changes as soon as a blind player gets involved.  I've listened to a card game without blind players, and then heard that same game change, when another blind player who isn't me joined the game, while I was still observing without involvement.  The biggest change is that the flow of conversation seems to be based around who's turn it is, when a blind person is playing.  So, player 1 will be saying something, then when she's finished talking, she'll announce her play. Then player 2 will respond to what she said, and when he's had his say, he'll announce his play. And it continues around the table like that.  However, I don't think it's intentional, and I'm not even sure the players realize they're doing it.  Perhaps it's just that people don't like being interrupted, and they don't like interrupting others. So they start naturally waiting until the current person is finished talking, before playing. That just naturally evolves into saying whatever is on there mind, before they play.  And it isn't, like, a strict formal feel or anything.  Other people will still make quick, shorter statements. But it does feel like the person who's turn it is is sort of in control of the conversation, in a vague and informal kind of way.  I don't know how the other players feel about this. Do they even notice it? I do, so they must.  

&gt; Does this create a more focused gaming moment then?

...maybe?  But unrelated conversation does happen. It just changes how the conversation progresses. Hard for me to tell, because I've never been part of a game where people didn't have to announce there plays, obviously. Even in poker, the dealer's gotta announce the flop, river, etc.

&gt; the braille cards create a perhaps unusual, interrupted, environment for the sighted? 

Well, yes. I'm sure they do. They're slightly larger, slightly thicker, and have bumps on the front.  So that changes the feel and movements used to shuffle and deal them, I'm sure.

&gt; In these cases, do you use a screen reader 

Yup.  

&gt; How pleasant is it compared to audio books?

A good human reader is always better than a computer voice. But a computer voice is always better than a bad human reader. And seeing as a lot of audiobooks for the blind are read by volunteers, there are a few bad readers. And keep in mind that ""bad"" is really subjective, and depends a lot on situation. It doesn't mean bad person, or person who can't read outloud, or anything like that.  Think about a person from the southern United States, with a thick US accent, reading a book entirely set in Scotland, and doing her best to do the accents. That happens.  I'd rather read with my screen reader in that case. I'm so used to the sound of the robot voice that once I'm involved with the plot, it doesn't even register with me anymore.

Also, of course, reading nonfiction on the computer is always better, because it's easier to find keywords, annotate, etc, and you just can't do that with an audiobook.

&gt; what kind of things don't matter to anything?

""This is the Carousel Boutique, whose door is split halfway up its height into two sections, each with its own knob. Unless otherwise noted, all doors in Ponyville will have this design, the same as that of the Dutch door commonly seen in horse stables.""  -- MLP S1E1 transcript

I have never needed this information, and I could never imagine any situation, no matter how contrived, where the design of the doors of ponyville would come up in conversation, or would matter to any part of the plot of the show.  And yes, the script does remember to make note of unusual doors when they appear.  There are a lot of details like that, about setting, camera angles, background events, etc, that are part of the information conveyed visually on-screen, and yet don't actually matter much.  Though personally, I'm extremely appreciative of having the details, just in case.  But I can recognize that knowing about doors doesn't give sighted people any knew insight or useful information that I would be missing out on had I not known that.  I think the thing I still dislike about audio description is that it's a sighted person who has to judge, and decide for me, what I need to know, and what she has time to tell me.  However, I don't see any way to fix that, without bogging down the plot of TV shows with endless artificial pauses to talk about doors, or hats, or clouds. You could even argue that giving me access to all the visual information sighted people have would give me an experience that's much farther away from the sighted one, because it would absolutely destroy the pacing.  

The things that tend to be crucial are main character actions and interactions, with each other and the environment.  Because they're what drive the plot. If some part of the setting never matters to the characters involved, it never seems to matter at all, other than as a quick way to visually set the mood.

&gt; How about when, for example, someones eyes are described as blue in a book. 

Hmmm, interesting. I would associate that with ""american"". I guess because of the trope of [the all American boy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllAmericanBoy).  By the way, I wasn't aware of that trope until just now, when I looked it up, because I was curious why I strongly associated blue eyed characters as American.  So I guess colour associations can be highly context dependant, and learned unconsciously.  

&gt; How do you think an ""average joe"" would perceive you?

Eccentric, probably.  But that hasn't got much to do with my blindness, and more to do with my tastes and interests.  Also, the fact that I gave up thinking about how I look to others years ago. Don't get me wrong: I still trim my beard, am well groomed, wear matching clothes, etc.  But beyond making sure people see me as a mature, responsible, independent adult, I couldn't care less.  

&gt; something that you think needs to be fundamentally changed?

Far too many people think of blind people as charity cases, to be pitied.  Heck, some blind people think of themselves this way!  Sure, I might need a hand from time to time, and yes, my life is often more difficult.  I'll accept help when it's offered. But I neither want nor need pity or charity, and if I am accepting help, it's to improve myself so I'll need less help in the future, not because I'm helpless.

250,"I have the same feelings, but in my case with employment.  You always see articles about a ""blind man"" who works doing some impressive job, and he always turns out to be low vision. This drives me nuts, because unemployment of the totally blind is way over 90 percent in a lot of places. But when you include low vision and legally blind, you can pretend that it's only 40 or 50 percent unemployment, so everything's fine!  No, it isn't. I mean, it isn't fine either way, really.

The best choice are Turn Based Strategy games because you can take your time to assess the situation. More time to process things visually overcomes the problems of Real Time Strategy or First Person Shooter games where you need to react immediately which your vision hampers you with (where's my mouse? What am I looking at? I can't tell if that guy is in our uniform or the enemy uniform!). The Civilization series is the big name here, but there are others (Galactic Civilizations, Fallen Enchantress, the Total War series - battles are real time but you can pause and you're moving formations not individuals so things are easier). 

Any game where you can pause and take your time is good basically. FTL - Faster Than Light for example (the text is very small though, so that might be challenging depending. I love FTL though. LOVE it). RPGs also fit this category, though again text and reading could be a challenge (e.g. Baldur's Gate series, Neverwinter series, Dragon Age series, Arcanum [everyone should give Arcanum a go]).

253,"Allow me to share a story with you of which I'm not overly proud.

Back in September 2013 we were out for my mate's b'day. We'd had dinner, a few beers and headed into the CBD to a club/pub called The Duke - a real rubbish place, but I was in a good enough mood to head in. Get another drink, standing there with another mate having a yarn and this girl comes up to us.

Now the music is deafeningly loud (which we both hate) and I don't see her (too dark) but she asks my mate to dance. Problem: he has cerebral palsy and walks on sticks. Dancing is not something he does. She doesn't seem to comprehend this situation (I'm not sure what she was on, possibly just very drunk, but pills is a possibility). She then turns to me and asks the same thing, to which I respond ""I'm blind, not such a great idea"" (there may as well be no light in this place). She then proceeds to take my glasses, put them on and (I'm told) dance just a bit away from us. 

I flip out and get verbally aggressive straight up, which really isn't me, but I'm capital T Triggered and the beers haven't exactly helped. Course I didn't step towards her or anything, as far as I was concerned she'd disappeared into the ether. Luckily the wife of my mate whose birthday it was overheard and turned around. She asked me what was wrong and got my glasses back off the girl and gave her a pretty stern talking to (she's a teacher). The girl tried to pull big sad eyes and apologise (I'm told) but I was Not In the Mood and shut her down. 

She went off crying.

Moral of the story: taking someone's glasses without permission is not cool. You are, after all, literally depriving them of being able to use what vision they have. When it does happen though, keep your cool because otherwise you'll end up with a very sub-optimal ending and both parties will end up feeling bad.

I really wish I could've sat down with her the next day and talk through the whole thing in a civilised manner. 

Sounds like you handled the situation better than I did, so chalk that up as a silver lining to the whole experience.",,,,Terry_Pie,,,1489625280,t5_2qpec,t3_5zjcdd,t3_5zjcdd,1,1491514382,0,0,dezhhqj,Blind,,,,,

260,"u/Nighthawk321, mod of r/blindpokemon - over here- this redditor's gonna write Pokemon fanfic!

(I kinda was thinking of a similar premise as soon as I ran into Nighthawk's sub (which you should visit by the way for ideas)- but it was just an idea and this sounds much better. Besides, I've got other fanfiction to write...)

Out of interest, what Pokemon does your character have? I was imagining a Rockruff or a similar guide-dog looking Pokemon - but it might not have to be. 

What hinderances should she run into? Probably starting her journey as a Pokemon Trainer. Not sure when the Spearow attack happened, but it could have been when she was 8- the usual age for starting a journey. Because she missed this crucial day, maybe she had to wait... and as others have said, probably was belittled by her friends and 'protected' by her family in the way that they think she can't go on the journey through the Alola region... (I guess, or whichever region your story's set.) Then maybe all her opponents and even the kahunas could react to her in different stages of discrimination, from disbelief that she's trying to enter the Trials/Pokemon League to 'I'm going to just go easy on you...' 

And like others have said on this thread, don't make her one-dimensional. In fantasy world such as The Last Airbender with Toph, and Star Wars (where there are awesome blind characters Kanan Jarrus from the Rebels TV series and Chirrut Imwe from Rogue One) these characters may seem 'overpowered' because of their abilities (bending/force sensitivity respectively) but then, as u/blind_devotional08 mentioned, their blindness is never heard of again:

&gt; It's nice to have blind heroes, it's annoying to have blindness shown as a ""weakness"" that doesn't matter. Being blind is kind of a big part of your life, whether you want it to be or not. - u/blind_devotion08

263,"&gt; My theory is that it's because the UK has the BBC, and it produces all kinds of radio dramas. Radio dramas aren't produced as much anywhere else in the world, so perhaps actors and actresses from other countries just never feel the need to become skilled voice actors.

This might be a difficult question, or a silly one haha, but what in your opinion makes a good voice actor? What do you look for in a voice actor? Are radio drama voice actors better than say Disney voice actors?

&gt; The thing I look for most in a song is good or interesting lyrics. And that's the thing I remember most about songs I hear. So I'll listen to anything from rock to country if I like the message, or find it interesting, or it clicks with me.

Do you have any examples of songs or artists that have good or interesting lyrics?

&gt; But then, he's voiced by a star trek actor, and in recent seasons seems to have come to represent all of the self-awareness I dislike. So it could be a combination of the fact that all of his ""jokes"" are visual, and my other biases, that makes him not work for me.

I’m sorry, but I’m not too sure who you are referring to!

&gt; If I find out about a book that sounds interesting, I need to check the CNIB library to see if I can get it in an accessible format. If not, I need to check Kindle or other ebook websites. But before I can even buy the book, I need to make sure text to speech is enabled, or that the publisher isn't using any other form of DRM that would block my screen reader… So not only is there often a cost in money when I want to read a book, there's also a cost in extra effort and stress. And sometimes, after all that, I just find out that I can't find a copy of the book I want.

Are there no centralised services or databases where you could browse and/or buy accessible media, so you wouldn’t have this stress? Do you see reasons why something like this wouldn’t work?

&gt; Of course. It makes people shy and nervous around me, because they're often afraid to do or say the wrong thing. They also often want to help, but have no idea how, so wind up doing nothing, or worse, something that's actually unhelpful.

I think this relates back to not including blind people into our society in its truest sense. People probably don’t know how to behave or act because interaction isn’t facilitated. Instead of including or integrating the needs of disabled people into our society we tend to only cater for them exclusively, this way no ""real” shared experiences emerge.

&gt; Unusual, no. The majority of people in the world are sighted. Though there are still aspects of sighted life I marvel at. The idea of perspective in pictures seems so odd to me. Like, it's a flat picture. Just lines. Yet it's still completely obvious to you that some objects in the picture are far away, and some are close up. And you never get confused between a small close up object, and a big far away one in the picture. I know it's...shadows and...light...and reflections...and stuff. But it's just a flat screen, or peace of paper, or whatever. And you can still tell distance. If I touch a raised photo or painting, it's pretty much just a collection of meaningless lines, to me.

I watched an entire episode of Tommy Edison XP on youtube about drawing, and he marvelled at very similar things. He also attempted at drawing things he had touched and did a pretty good job in my opinion. I think that raised photos and paintings feel like meaningless lines to you because no one put the time into trying to communicate in “your language” instead of assuming that you would “visualise” and make sense of the world the same way as a sighted people. What do you think about this?

&gt; I've tried. But I could just never get everyone who wanted to play all together in one place at one time. I've played online, but I don't think that's nearly the same, because it's a lot less intense than face to face RP. And I don't feel like I'd be comfortable joining a group of complete strangers offline to play, even though I sometimes hear of local groups advertising for players.

What specific thing or things make you uncomfortable about joining a group of strangers playing a game?

&gt; For example, even you came to Reddit first, rather than signing up somewhere that specializes in blind conversation like the zone.

That is very true! It is easy to be casual and observe what goes on, also the barrier is very low for joining in. I also came to Reddit, because I felt that this could be a place where visually impaired individuals who enjoy activities that are primarily designed for the visual domain would interact.

&gt; software deployment and maintenance, server administration, hardware research and procurement, and writing scripts and programs to collect, collate, and monitor data.

When you write programs and scripts, what kind of feedback do you use to ensure that everything works? Do these have interfaces? How are they used?

&gt; So what new thing could I do with this, that I can't already do now? The answer seems to be ""nothing"". But maybe I lack the visual experience to imagine the possibilities, like I say.

I saw a video of a man recognise a drawing of a house with these ""glasses"", it felt quite amazing to me haha. Perhaps for you this might not be anything useful, since you seem like a very independent individual and know your way around. Maybe someone younger or someone new to visual impairment might find some security and independence in it?

If I lived in the US, and wanted to buy foaming body wash (neither of these things are true), it seems like I could easily find out where it's sold or make a purchase.  I can't say as much for competitors websites.

274,"I decided to delete my original comment and repost because I don't like to edit comments after they've been read.  My original comment lacked the explanation of how I went about finding the job I wanted.

I wasn't born blind, but my visual acuity has never been better than 10% or 20/200.  If I was American that would qualify me as legally blind even though one can still live a fairly normal life with that visual acuity assuming there's no loss of contrast, color, brightness, or field of view.

I used to love the technology of the late 80s and early 90s and was always curious about how things worked, so my aunt gave me a box with some electronic components, a manual, and a board which was an introduction to electronics for kids.  The first exercises were fairly simple to understand, however as I progressed, I stopped understanding what was going on, but the fact that I was building analog synthesizers and radios to use as toys impressed my family to the point that they decided to give me a computer when I was 12, and that took my attention away from electronics.

The first 3 years after having a computer were rather unproductive as I lacked Internet access and there was no one in the family with programming experience to teach me, however at 15 I went to high school where I chose an IT introductory course and learned the basics of programming.  Unfortunately what I learned wasn't enough to motivate me because I was never taught how to build anything interesting.

By 17 I quit high school to start working full-time as a tech support call center operator for an Internet services provider, a job for which I had enough vision.  Since I spent a lot of time doing nothing at work I decided to use the spare time to learn C properly as I didn't fully understand how pointers worked in high school.  During this time I also learned about Linux and how extensively C was used there so I downloaded a Linux distribution  and started to use it at home.  The spark that really ignited my love for coding happened when a guy on IRC wrote a small IRC bot for me to study and learn how to use network sockets in C that ran on Linux.

Fast forward 4 years and I was already tinkering with the Linux kernel when a friend of mine bought a PDA with Linux, noticed that it ran very slow, and decided to ask me whether I could update the Linux kernel in it to the latest version and optimize it for performance.  At the time I had absolutely no experience with anything the size of what he was asking but decided to accept the challenge if he managed to provide me with documentation for the hardware, so he contacted the vendor, got the documentation, and off I went with a vanilla kernel that at the time didn't even have ARM support.  When after 3 months I finally got the kernel to boot and show Tux the penguin on the screen I couldn't believe I had done it because up until that point I could only make the device's LEDs light up and send output through a serial port.  Another 3 months later I had already ported all the drivers to the new kernel and it was in fact much faster than the original port, so we decided to create a website for the project and share it with the community.  In no time we got hundreds of users interested in the project and among them were several companies inviting me for interviews, which is how I found my first full-time job as a programmer.

By 31 I went fully blind and that ended my career as a programmer.",,,,Vaelian,,,1490140896,t5_2qpec,t3_60kqa2,t3_60kqa2,1,1491680649,0,0,df8nkfy,Blind,,,,,

303,"&gt; Are there any other instances where the voice actors/actresses have been really good? 

All of the radio dramas produced by [Big Finish](https://www.bigfinish.com) are really really good.  They're what got me into Dr Who in the first place.  I'd say India Fisher is the best of an excellent and talented group, if you're looking for one stand-out example.  I actually find British actors in general are better at voices than counterparts from other countries.  My theory is that it's because the UK has the BBC, and it produces all kinds of radio dramas. Radio dramas aren't produced as much anywhere else in the world, so perhaps actors and actresses from other countries just never feel the need to become skilled voice actors.  I can name lots of British people who stand out because they sound perfect for the characters they play, even on TV, but I can't do that for Canadian's or American's. For example, Emma Watson (both in Harry Potter, and in that movie who's title I can't remember where she's playing an American), Evanna Lynch (mostly in Harry Potter, admittedly she [isn't particularly good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV1TW1hdaf8) at reading audiobooks; she's just fine, not bad, but not good either), Angela Lansbury, Peter Davison, Sylvester McCoy, Peter Jones, and Thomas Craig.  Those are the ones that pop into my head without thought; I could list more if I spent time thinking about it.  

&gt; what kind of music do you enjoy the most?

Folk music, for me. Mostly because I'm actually not all that musical. The thing I look for most in a song is good or interesting lyrics. And that's the thing I remember most about songs I hear.  So I'll listen to anything from rock to country if I like the message, or find it interesting, or it clicks with me.  I can't stand Pink Floyd, because all the music, especially the later stuff, is...paranoid and angry.

&gt; Is MLP exceptional in the way that, while it isn’t targeted at you, it still works for you? 

Yes, it is. Because it shouldn't work for me on multiple levels. First, of course, it's for young girls. Second, though, it's a cartoon. Cartoons are pretty much the most visual form of TV. Children's cartoons even more so!  Also, I suspect that even for adults, part of the attraction is how cute and adorable the ponies are. I'm left without that visual impression of cuteness to draw me in. And yet, the acting, and stories, are strong enough to hold my interest anyway.  Well, most of the time. I do find the meme and external references factory that is discord makes my eyes glaze.  But then, he's voiced by a star trek actor, and in recent seasons seems to have come to represent all of the self-awareness I dislike.  So it could be a combination of the fact that all of his ""jokes"" are visual, and my other biases, that makes him not work for me.  But otherwise, absolutely everything else in the show does work, even when it shouldn't.  And...if you haven't watched large amounts of the show, this entire answer was meaningless! Sorry!  If I was editing myself, I'd probably try and go back to find a way to make that a bit more accessible to someone who doesn't share my peculiar interest.  

&gt; Why fan content? 

Because the cost of acquisition is 0.  And by that, I don't just mean, or even primarily mean, money.  If I find out about a book that sounds interesting, I need to check the CNIB library to see if I can get it in an accessible format. If not, I need to check Kindle or other ebook websites. But before I can even buy the book, I need to make sure text to speech is enabled, or that the publisher isn't using any other form of DRM that would block my screen reader.  If you purchase an ebook you can't use by mistake, and I've done this, you can't get a refund.  So not only is there often a cost in money when I want to read a book, there's also a cost in extra effort and stress.  And sometimes, after all that, I just find out that I can't find a copy of the book I want.

In the case of a fanfic, I can go to a website like [FIMFiction](http://www.fimfiction.net), pick a story, and be reading in less than 10 seconds.  And when I'm done, FIMFiction will present me with a choice of other stories I might like to read next. And I can just choose one, and start right away. And if I don't like it, who cares? It cost me nothing, and another story is less than 10 seconds away.  Plus, there are other good things about fanfic, like a larger diversity of voices, because publishing a fanfic is easy and free. 

Fan video (or just youtube in general) is similar. Before watching a TV show, I need to see if it's audio described, or I can get scripts, or what. If it turns out I can't, and I start the show or movie anyway, what if I can't follow it?  Then I've at least wasted time on trying to watch, and on researching the show to find AD.  If it wasn't on Netflix, I've also probably wasted money.  In the case of fan video, I just click and watch.  Sometimes [ILoveKimPossibleAlot](https://www.youtube.com/user/ILoveKimPossibleAlot) is interesting and funny, and sometimes she's impossible and confusing (about 50 50).  But when she's confusing, I can just move on at no cost.  

&gt; Is there something you dislike?

Well, not all fan content is accessible. But when I've spent 45 minutes trying to watch a TV show, or read a book, and it isn't accessible, I'm upset and annoyed. When I randomly surf into fan content that isn't accessible, I can just go find something else.

&gt; does this affect how people behave towards you?

Of course. It makes people shy and nervous around me, because they're often afraid to do or say the wrong thing. They also often want to help, but have no idea how, so wind up doing nothing, or worse, something that's actually unhelpful.  

&gt; Is that interesting or unusual to you?

Unusual, no. The majority of people in the world are sighted.  Though there are still aspects of sighted life I marvel at. The idea of perspective in pictures seems so odd to me. Like, it's a flat picture. Just lines. Yet it's still completely obvious to you that some objects in the picture are far away, and some are close up.  And you never get confused between a small close up object, and a big far away one in the picture. I know it's...shadows and...light...and reflections...and stuff.  But it's just a flat screen, or peace of paper, or whatever. And you can still tell distance.  If I touch a raised photo or painting, it's pretty much just a collection of meaningless lines, to me.

&gt; Can you or have you played anything of the sorts? 

I've tried. But I could just never get everyone who wanted to play all together in one place at one time.  I've played online, but I don't think that's nearly the same, because it's a lot less intense than face to face RP. And I don't feel like I'd be comfortable joining a group of complete strangers offline to play, even though I sometimes hear of local groups advertising for players.

&gt; Are there any other “forums” that you are an active member of?

I used to be a member of several blindness related forums, and I'm sometimes active on the forums of podcasts I listen to, or accessible games I play.  However, I find Reddit has completely taken over. I love that on Reddit, everything is on one central site. So people flow freely from topic to topic.  The fact that you don't need a different website and account for each topic means even people with a casual interest will show up, leading to a wider variety of people and opinions.  For example, even you came to Reddit first, rather than signing up somewhere that specializes in blind conversation like [the zone](https://www.zonebbs.com).  

&gt; Is it safe to assume that you would welcome people to interact with you face to face more? 

If I'm at an event where that's expected, yes. I'm not sure I want random people introducing themselves to me on the bus.  But I've gone to weekend conferences, attended all the networking events, and not made a single contact. Similarly, I had four friends I made in university, because they were the four people who talked to me outside of class requirements like group projects. I'll admit I'm a natural loaner, and I think I'd still have trouble getting to know people if I was sighted.  But as it is, I have basically no acquaintances.  Everyone who makes the effort to approach me seems to become a close friend.  So I have a healthy collection of good friends, and everyone else is a stranger.  I guess you could argue that's good in some ways.  

&gt; concerns you or other visually impaired people you know?

Yes. For visually impaired people who are naturally quiet, geeky, or loaners, it's a big problem. I do know blind people who are super popular, outgoing, social, and just know all the people all the time.  So perhaps if you're a blind extravert it's less of a problem. But I'm not one, so I couldn't say.

&gt; What do you do for a living? Do you mean something other than reading by hobbies?

I'm involved in getting a tiny Bitcoin startup off the ground.  So, startup life: I do what needs doing. But on a day to day basis, for me that's mostly software deployment and maintenance, server administration, hardware research and procurement, and writing scripts and programs to collect, collate, and monitor data. 

As for hobbies, I'm a licensed Amateur radio operator (VA3SEP), so I do some reading related to that. I'm also interested in natural language processing and generation, because I believe that's the next frontier in human computer interfaces. But I'm only interested at a popular science level, because I don't have the AI, math, or programming expertise to take it farther.

I think that what you just said about language is what draws me into comics as well. I think that fluid and convincing/relatable dialogue is tricky. Some comic book writers do that extremely well. It is such a natural way of showing how events unfold that I find myself highly invested sometimes. I don't like puzzle style books either, but if I am left with a question it can be very satisfying.

Hahaha I think I get something like that too with keyboard clicking sounds. We must associate it with hard work, I remember my dad typing away when I was a kid and I liked to listen to it. I also find that the rhythm helps me somehow concentrate when, for example, typing in an essay or any other larger body of text. It puts me into... the 'zone'?

The fact that you haven't seen touch as a trigger for imagination before sounds like a window of opportunity. At least something to experiment with :) Perhaps touch could work as an amplifier or enhancer to an audio (or other sensory) experience, instead of working by itself. Interesting.

I too had a licence from when I was 20/60. But, I only drove locally in daylight and stopped when my vision got worse. (combo of my own sense and my family's request). I have limited neck movement and limited field of vision (one eye legally blind with a *very* small field and one eye impaired with a bigger but smaller than normal field of vision) which caused me to stop driving before I actually turned in my license. So, you do have to consider other factors (It was just <URL>ving up hope when I had to turn it over).","[{'start': 781, 'end': 786, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

344,"To be blunt, this sounds clunky and confusing.  Screen-readers are only clunky because they need to abstract a largely visual interface into spoken text.  The Star Trek computers, as imagined back in the original series, seem to have gotten it right: voice and conversation are the best, easiest, and most natural non-visual method of interaction.  And they're starting to become reality!  If you don't have an Amazon Echo yet, you should.  The device has no screen, and doesn't need one.  It's early days, so thus far the voice assistant can only do simple tasks.  But I expect that will change over the next 15 or 20 years.  I'll probably always have, and want, a keyboard though.  Because it's easier to type clearly than it is to speak clearly, and it's easier to edit typed text.  But I bet some day soon I'll be typing queries to a conversational interface, if I find those queries too complicated to speak out loud.

356,"&gt; what in your opinion makes a good voice actor? 

I know it when I hear it.  And I wish I had a better answer!  It has something to do with sounding ""right"" for the character. Like, if I imagined myself talking to that character, that voice is the voice I would hear in my head.  But I don't know why I imagine voices for characters the way I do.  Also, I generally can't identify good voice actors when I hear one of the roles they play.  When I hear a voice, and go, ""Oh! That's the same actor who plays so-and-so from some other show!"" it's distracting to me.  Unfortunately, while I know I can recognize voices quite well, I don't know how I do it.  But some actors can throw off my voice recognition so they sound different to me when playing different characters, and some can't.  I think the only way to answer this question might be with a study involving ""good"" voice actors recording clips as different characters, and having blind people try and identify all the clips with the same speaker.  That might provide some insight as to what exactly the actor has to do to throw us off.  

&gt; Are radio drama voice actors better 

I wouldn't say ""better"" per say. But they have to work harder, and they know it.  A Disney voice actor can depend on the animation to provide people with a better understanding of the characters. On TV, actors have to think about expression and body language, not just voice. But on radio, voice is all there is.  And I think once an actor learns how to put an entire character into his or her voice, those habits stick with him, even if he moves to TV or cartoons.  Plus, acting schools in the UK know that there is money to be made acting on radio. So it wouldn't surprise me if they put a bit more focus on doing voices, than acting schools in the US do.  It'd be interesting to ask an actual actor about this, though, rather than just me speculating.  

Also, it could be that I have an unconscious bias towards UK accents, and all of this about UK acting being better is just not true. I don't know why that would be, and I don't think it's likely. But the mind has an amazing ability to rationalize our unconscious preferences into ""facts"" and make us believe them.  

&gt; Do you have any examples of songs or artists that have good or interesting lyrics?

Great Big Sea, Meg Davis, Barenaked Ladies, Gordon Lightfoot, Lauren Fairweather, The Doubleclicks, Jonathan Coulton, Tom Smith, Stompin Tom (sometimes), Creed (sometimes), Switchfoot, Icon for Hire, Smash Mouth (sometimes), Heather Alexander, Heather Dale, Heather Hutchison (the blind singer, not the painter).  How's that for a bunch of artists you've never heard of, mostly named Heather?  But once I thought of one Heather, I thought of the other two by association LOL.  

&gt; I’m sorry, but I’m not too sure who you are referring to!

I figured that as I was writing it.  [his wiki page](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Discord) might help, but probably not, unless you watch the show. Seriously, I was just ranting.  As I wrote at the time, I should have edited that out.  

&gt; Are there no centralised services or databases where you could browse and/or buy accessible media

Unfortunately, no. The first challenge is that what's available in an accessible format changes from one country to another.  If the CNIB Library makes an accessible book, UK Blind people can't get it from the RNIB, and they're not Canadian so they can't use the CNIB of course.  Similarly, books will be published in different countries by different publishers. So while one publisher in one country might not use DRM, another publisher in a different country might. So the exact same book might or might not be accessible for purchase, depending on what country you're in.  Same for DVDs and Blue-rays.  In the UK, you have hundreds of times more DVDs that come with audio description than we do in Canada. In Canada, they have to include a French audio track. So to save space on the DVD, they often replace the Audio Description audio track with the French audio track.  So it means, because of DVD region locking, the audio description will just never be available to Canadians. Plus, DVDs are even worse because of different DVD re-issues, with different special features. Some versions of the DVD of the exact same movie in the exact same country have audio description, while other versions do not.  The same thing can happen to books, if a book gets reprinted by a different publisher. So the rights for the book go to the new publisher, and sometimes they ad DRM to the digital ebook. So a book that was available for accessible purchase yesterday might not be today.   This all just makes everything too complicated for anyone to keep track of in a central database!  Netflix and iTunes do the same thing as DVDs with audio description, by the way.  It's available in some countries and not others for the same show. And sometimes it is available for a show, and then they lose the rights to the audio description track in some countries, so take it away. Dr Who is available on BBC IPlayer with audio description in the UK, but it has no audio description in any other country.  So I have to use a VPN to watch it on iPlayer, even though I'd rather just buy an audio described version in Canada if I could. But I can't; Dr Who audio description is UK only...not on international iTunes, not on the international DVDs or blue-rays, nowhere. I'm ranting again, aren't I?  Sorry!  

&gt; we tend to only cater for them exclusively, 

Unfortunately, this is a hard problem to solve.  Do we make the world less visual, so blind people can interact better, at the expense of sighted people, who enjoy the extra visuals?  I don't see any way to make a visual experience ""equal"" to a nonvisual one. They'll always be different.  And what about deaf people?  Deaf people and blind people interacting with each other is a hard problem.  I used to think this way, that everyone should be included in everything all the time.  Don't get me wrong, I still think that blind people (and disabled people in general) can and should be included in a lot more things. But there are always going to be things sighted people enjoy, that I don't, no matter how they're adapted. And similarly, there are interests I have, that most sighted people don't share. And that's OK.  I just think we need to work on expanding that middle ground, of interests we can both share and things we can all do, rather than force a false ""equality"".  Also, keep working on the age old lesson that ""different"" doesn't mean ""not as good"", and that it's perfectly possible to work with, live with, be friends with, and even love people who are very different from you.

&gt; “visualise” and make sense of the world the same way 

Agreed.  And I think that speaks to my previous point. I never will make sense of the world the same way, and I don't think it needs to be one of my goals to try.  So I'm just not sure paintings are an experience I need to share with my sighted friends.  I'd rather we as a society focused on solving the easier problems, like improving the availability and quality of audio description, the number and availability of accessible books, improving software accessibility for everything from games to business applications, making it easier for blind people to travel independently, raising awareness so more people will feel comfortable interacting with us and sharing the experiences we can share together, and doing something about the massive (over 90 percent in some places) unemployment in the blind community.  

&gt; What specific thing or things make you uncomfortable about joining a group of strangers playing a game?

I'm sure it would put the strangers off.  And I'd have to do a bunch of work teaching the DM what I need to play, and how the game can/should be adapted. And if I show up out of the blue, I don't even know that any of the players or the DM are even willing to try.  Especially in things like games, a lot of people feel that it would be ""hard"", and just don't want to try anything even slightly difficult when they're out to have fun.  It wouldn't be that hard, but you can't change people's impressions when they've already decided it would be too hard even thinking about it.  When they're your friends, they already know what it might take. Plus, if it does turn out to be hard, friends are more willing to work for it, and find ways to make it easier.  

&gt; Do these have interfaces? How are they used?

I write everything in [php](http://www.php.net) or [PureBasic](http://www.purebasic.com/index.php).  PHP outputs errors in the browser, and Purebasic can show errors on the command line at compile time. Most things I write run on the command line, or have text only interfaces. That's OK, because they're for internal use only.  The one thing I write for partner use just has a basic web interface. Fill out the form with the requested values, and press submit. Then you get generated reports by email or JSON you can download.

As far as rhythm games go I cannot help you out much there. In my experience these games are so visual heavy that I do not even try to play them.  I tried playing Frets on Fire on PC a while back, it is essentially a guitar hero clone, and I could not play it despite still having some eyesight left.

Just to elaborate a bit on why sound is important in fighting games.  In modern games different characters have different weapons which sound unique from those used by other characters.  In addition to that, the characters' individual combos differ to such an extent that once you are used to playing with a particular character you will be able to know by the intervals between the hits and the sound the hits make whether it is you or your opponent currently doing damage. 

For example, assuming you are playing                        Soul Calibur IV on X360, if you press Y, Y, Y while you are Sigfried you will do three heavy hits in succession with the third hit taking a fraction of a second longer to hit.  When if you play as Tira and you press the same set of buttons in succession she will only do a two hit combo because the third Y press does not allow the combo to continue because their weapon styles differ.  The sound of the swings and the impacts also differ because Sigfried uses a giant sword and Tira uses a bladed hoop thing.  If you compare this to MK3, where all impacts sound more or less the same and have the exact same timing, the only difference in sound you have to work with are special moves and the length of the specific characters' combos.

368,"&gt; So you read the script to MLP separately before, during or after?

I used to read it during. But these days I tend to read it before, because I had to keep pausing the show to read the descriptions. After a few seasons of that, I realized that I was spending over an hour on a single 22 minute episode.  Reading then watching comes closer to preserving the feel of the show.  

&gt; what do you like about it?

It's just darn good TV!  The voice acting is the best of anything in the past 30 years, at least.  I couldn't say enough about how good the cast of voice actresses is. It's the only time I know of where one person plays two or more characters, and not only did I fail to recognize right away that it was the same actress, it took me a while to actually believe it when I found out.  Also, all of the voices are unique enough that I'm never confused about who's speaking. This can be a huge problem in other cartoons, when all the kids, or all the women, or whatever tend to sound really similar.  Every pony sounds distinctive, and has a voice that fits the character and dialogue perfectly.  MLP also has the occasional good song.  The plots are fun, and often don't go in the direction you would expect from a TV show for young girls.  Even as an adult, the humour is still funny, and makes me smile.  My only complaint is that it's getting just a bit too self-aware in later seasons.  I think Hasbro has given up on trying to make a show for girls, and started making a show for 30 year old men who watch a show for girls.  That's OK, I guess, but we've lost some of the innocent sincerity we had in season 1.  Plus, we seem to be losing most of the female writers.  I'm not saying males can't write pony, because they sure can, and have occasionally from the start!  But I think that the fact that the last two seasons have been written mostly by men is symptomatic of Hasbro's changing focus.  I loathe the fact that the fandom has unintentionally stolen a wonderful show from young girls, who could really use some better TV.  But I comfort myself with the fact that some of the women who left MLP have gone on to bigger and better things, like Disney. So at least there voices and contributions haven't been lost to TV entirely. Diversity matters!

&gt; How active are you in the fan community?

I read vast amounts of fan content (news, fanfic, fan theories, wiki pages, news websites, etc).  I was actually drawn to MLP originally because at that time, I felt like I had read all the good Harry Potter fanfic. So I was looking for something I could enjoy enough to get into the fanfic.  I also occasionally comment on someone's theory, or fanfic, when they post it to Reddit.  That's quite different from every other TV show I like.  In general, I'm able to realize that I can't fully experience the entire TV show, so should keep my opinions to myself.  But in the case of MLP, I've been irresistibly drawn to comment on two or three posts.  However, I still don't generally review fanfic, because my unique experience of the original show would mean I'm not a fair judge of fanfic quality.

&gt; Would you call yourself a bronie?

No.  But again, that's probably me assigning too much significance to the experiences I can't share.  I can't read the comics, so there's a huge part of canon I'm missing entirely.  I don't write fanfic of my own for the same reason.  But there are people out there who haven't even watched every episode and call themselves bronies.  So it's more about me not wanting to pretend to something I'm not, than some external rejection from the community.  Every time I have commented, the experience was positive.  

&gt; Am I making any sense?

Yup.  I also think there's a bit of a lack of communication between people born blind, and sighted people.  My experience of the world is the only one I have, so I have no way to point out, or perhaps even know, how it differs from yours.  Also, it's not interesting or unusual to me...it's just normal life.  So I'm often uninterested in talking about it, because I'm busy trying to live it.

That, and society is changing in ways that make it difficult for me to interact with sighted people whom I'd otherwise like.  Mainstream video games are completely inaccessible.  I can't read most comics. I can't watch anime, because I can't read subtitles, and I find the English dubs do a job that's so awful I'm just confused and annoyed the entire time.  I can't play any collectable card games.  And I think that based on my personality type, if I were sighted, I'd probably be part of the community that does all of those things.  I'm left with described TV and science fiction books.  And the people who like the books and TV shows I like often like many of those other things as well. So I'm unintentionally left out of half of the conversations those people want/need to have.

&gt; How often do you engage with people you don’t know?

All the time, on Reddit!  The only requirement is that they seem interesting.  Plus, most of Reddit is highly topic based.  So a discussion with someone about MLP, or Robert Heinlein, or whatever, is unlikely to suddenly become a conversation about something else, like video games, that I can't participate in.

In person, much less often. First off, I can't catch someone's eye, or see them sitting alone in the corner, etc. So if I'm going to talk to a stranger, they need to come up and introduce themselves.  Second, in person, my blindness is the first thing people notice about me, and it does put people off.  If I write a comment somewhere else on Reddit, the first thing people notice is what I wrote.  If they then click my username, they'll realize I'm blind.  But that's the second impression, not the first. And it makes a big difference.  Most of my comments do wind up being here in /r/blind, but that's more because I'm a moderator here, and thus have a duty to read every post.

&gt; Do you think you would have replaced it if it had been lost for good?

Yes, of course!  That's a bit surprising actually.  My mental dialogue as I first read this question went along the lines: ""Obviously!"" ""Why? I have loads of other radios."" ""Yeah, but I need a baseball radio!"" ""Why?"" ""Because!""  Oh well; I could probably find a similar radio at the dollar store, so it isn't like my irrationality is costing me much.  

&gt; I’ve always wanted a Mickey Mouse shaped, bottle opening portable radio! 

Well, as long as you don't want to actually listen to it. Radios shaped like characters all sound terrible. Someone on youtube had a Garden Gnome radio once, and it seemed to sound pretty average for the type.  Ah, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG657Vks5Sk) is the result of the world's strangest Google search.  It's half way through the video. But then, why would you want to skip seeing the speaker shaped like a pink pig?  That's gotta be worth 10 minutes of your life. 

&gt; Essentially what I mean is how much information do you need about a space when you’re in it?

Depends what I'm doing in it.  Sometimes when entering a knew room, I'll make a clicking sound with my tongue, and use the echo to judge how big it is, and if it's wide open and empty, or full of stuff.  But when the room has other people in it, I can get similar information from the sound of them talking, so don't bother.  If all we're doing is sitting round chatting, eating, gaming, studying, or whatever, the size of the room and how crowded it is are really all I need.  If I'm going to dance, or play Wii Sports, or help assemble furniture, or do anything slightly active like that, I usually take a walk around the edge of the space, so I know how much room I've got to work with.  If I'm running, working out, playing goalball, or otherwise being moderately to extremely active, I'll walk around the space a few times, and ask a sighted friend to describe the area, and point out if there's anything in particular that I should watch out for that I might have missed.  

&gt; So you use google, adobe acrobat etc. whilst reading? 

Yup. Both for work, and hobbies that I'm extremely interested in.  

&gt; might be interested in checking out this guy 

Interesting. Makes me think of [this](https://www.seeingwithsound.com) project.  The guy running it always comes off as a bit crazy to me.  But it's quite possible he's on to something, and the fact that I was born blind is causing me to fail to imagine the possibilities.

&gt; this smartphone app called “Be My Eyes” 

I've heard of it, but never used it. It strikes me as a bit odd to ask a random stranger for help. But I'm lucky that I always have a friend who can lend a hand, either in person or by Skype.  If I didn't, I'd use Be My Eyes, rather than just give up on doing whatever it was I wanted to do.

Well, as long as you don't want to actually listen to it. Radios shaped like characters all sound terrible. Someone on youtube had a Garden Gnome radio once, and it seemed to sound pretty average for the type.  Ah, [this](<URL>) is the result of the world's strangest Google search.  It's half way through the video. But then, why would you want to skip seeing the speaker shaped like a pink pig?  That's gotta be worth 10 minutes of your life. 

&gt; Essentially what I mean is how much information do you need about a space when you’re in it?

Depends what I'm doing in it.  Sometimes when entering a knew room, I'll make a clicking sound with my tongue, and use the echo to judge how big it is, and if it's wide open and empty, or full of stuff.  But when the room has other people in it, I can get similar information from the sound of them talking, so don't bother.  If all we're doing is sitting round chatting, eating, gaming, studying, or whatever, the size of the room and how crowded it is are really all I need.  If I'm going to dance, or play Wii Sports, or help assemble furniture, or do anything slightly active like that, I usually take a walk around the edge of the space, so I know how much room I've got to work with.  If I'm running, working out, playing goalball, or otherwise being moderately to extremely active, I'll walk around the space a few times, and ask a sighted friend to describe the area, and point out if there's anything in particular that I should watch out for that I might have missed.  

&gt; So you use google, adobe acrobat etc. whilst reading? 

Yup. Both for work, and hobbies that I'm extremely interested in.  

&gt; might be interested in checking out this guy 

Interesting. Makes me think of [this](<URL>) project.  The guy running it always comes off as a bit crazy to me.  But it's quite possible he's on to something, and the fact that I was born blind is causing me to fail to imagine the possibilities.

&gt; this smartphone app called “Be My Eyes” 

I've heard of it, but never used it. It strikes me as a bit odd to ask a random stranger for help. But I'm lucky that I always have a friend who can lend a hand, either in person or by Skype.  If I didn't, I'd use Be My Eyes, rather than just give up on doing whatever it was I wanted to do.

And I don’t mean that I don’t want to ask questions, I mean that I wish that it wasn’t all news to me!

I actually think that this happens when I play with my friends quite often that they have to announce what just happened in the game because people don’t pay enough attention haha. However, I do understand what you’re trying to say

&gt; Think about a person from the southern United States, with a thick US accent, reading a book entirely set in Scotland, and doing her best to do the accents.

Is this a common thing in audiobooks, that the reader would do accents? Is it a good thing?

So you use google, adobe acrobat etc. whilst reading? Is this for work or just to learn about the topic?

397,"Agreed. Though I want to make the point that there is no difference in possibilities. A fully blind person, with the right supports and some hard work, can achieve just as much as a low vision person, or a sighted person.  The problem right now is that the supports aren't there.  Blind people are less likely to have a university education than low vision people. Most software that is accessible with magnification to those with low vision does not work with screen readers. Many jobs that require reading some print can be held by low vision folks, but not blind folks.  Etc, etc, etc. These are the things that need changing. And I think they can only be changed by embracing the word ""blind"" as a label that we can use to get the supports we need.  And, perhaps, encouraging low vision folks to identify themselves as low vision or legally blind.  The tricky thing is, how do we do that without making low vision folks feel unwelcome? They have a lot of challenges we do not, and I think it's important that they remain part of our community. I'd hate, for example, for this sub to split into /r/blind and /r/lowvision.

Haha, don’t worry I knew it was a silly question to begin with. I was just curious to see if you had some kind of a “list” of things you look for. But it obviously depends on the character :)

&gt; That might provide some insight as to what exactly the actor has to do to throw us off.

This is super interesting! Something to consider for future research, thank you!

&gt; When I hear a voice, and go, ""Oh! That's the same actor who plays so-and-so from some other show!"" it's distracting to me.

This happens to me too. In my opinion, the voice actor of Bojack Horseman is really suitable for the character. However, I saw him acting in something else later and just had to stop the movie because I couldn’t get over the fact that Bojack Horseman is talking through the body of this random American guy. 

&gt; Also, it could be that I have an unconscious bias towards UK accents, and all of this about UK acting being better is just not true.

I have a similar bias towards British actors over Americans. Especially when it comes to accents, I feel that British actors can pull of more accents than Americans. Is this true? Who knows!

&gt; Seriously, I was just ranting. As I wrote at the time, I should have edited that out.

I would not recommend the Mint. I've been there over 15 times and even once was too many. It's very much a behind the glass experience. If you're still interested, you can still go to their gift shop without needing a tour and they have a gold bar you can touch and lift.

You had me right up until Dune.  Lord of The Rings and Dune are two classics I've never enjoyed.  

&gt; books and music are a form of media that don't require any visual elements to fully appreciate.

I think I actually made an error in my last comment.  Food is another form of art, and it's definitely a medium of expression.  So can we call food a type of media?  I suspect well cooked food can communicate the same types and intensity of emotion that good classical music can.  Unfortunately, my palate just isn't that refined.  

&gt; how much do you rely on touch, smell and taste to make sense of the world around you? 

Smell and taste pretty much exclusively for food.  Touch, I suppose quite a bit, but a lot less than hearing.  Though I spend a lot of money on mechanical keyboards, because I can't stand typing on anything else.  Though that's a combination of touch, sound, and...movement sense?  Is that a thing?  The feeling of the extra movement of the keys gives me more feedback while typing, so I make a lot fewer mistakes.  

The difficulty with using touch is that it's so localized.  It's the old problem of [the blind men and the elephant](http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/blind-men-and-the-elephant.htm).  When I'm touching something, it takes focus to make sure I haven't missed any parts, and have built up a complete mental picture of the object.  Though I'm only one person, and I know a lot of other blind people are way better at this than I am.  I do go to museums sometimes, and enjoy them quite a lot, especially when they have things I can touch. But I find I like to have a description of what I'm touching first, and then better understand the description via touch, rather than just discover things entirely by touch alone.  But that's just me, and I know other blind folks feel differently.

One other important thing we haven't touched on is that a lot of this depends on when a blind person lost sight.  For example, blind people who could once see, in my experience, appreciate audio described TV more than I do. I was born blind, so I have no visual memories of TV to draw from.  I also find, at least in my personal experience, people who could once see can read raised maps by touch, and then use that information from the raised map in the real world. Whereas I, and other friends who were born blind, have a lot of difficulty reading and using raised maps.  I think there's some pseudo visual element in the process of building a mental map based on feeling raised lines that we're just not particularly good at.  However, this is all based on personal experience, not data.  So I could be way off!

444,"Your vision definitely limits your visual reading speed if you have low vision, even with magnification. 

Lighting, colors, the font used (not just the size), your screen, etc are all factors that may influence your speed. Black text on white background, for example, might be harder (thus slower) for you to read than black text on light grey or yellow text on blue. A different font choice might be legible at a smaller level, or just faster to recognize. If you haven't, playing around with these settings on your computer might help. 

If you use zoomtext or another magnifier, screen size and the level of magnification you need are huge factors in your speed. The bigger the screen, the larger text you can fit in one screenful of information. Some people also read faster with printed materials or e-ink devices than they do computer screens, too

When you are visually impaired, reading speeds can vary even in an optimal setup due to factors like eye strain, how tired you are, the type of material you are reading, and so on. 

That said, if 169 words per minute is the limit you can comfortably read at visually, are you using text to speech to read? 

With practice (if you have normal hearing) it would be reasonable to expect that you could listen at rates substantially faster than you read visually. If you're not familiar with TTS (or even with a new voice) it will sound like gibberish at high speeds for a while, start with a speed that's comfortably intelligible and work your way up over time. TTS can also be less fatiguing to read, which might make you read more (and more easily) than you do visually. I would guess that most blind people can go over at least 250 words per minute with practice, although some read a great deal faster than this. 

Talented braille readers can also reach speeds of 200-300 words per minute, if that's something you're interested in as well. It won't rival TTS speeds for most, but can be useful in some circumstances. 


My reading speed decreased as I lost vision, so for me it wasn't a matter of practice or just not being skilled at it. But I can listen to TTS very fast using a good voice I'm familiar with, so not being able to sight read much or quickly isn't a big deal for me anymore.

While Braille sounds like it would work, orientation of braille is important as well (and it may not just be upside down, but sideways as well). Rather than using braille to denote a letter, it would be better to use partially filled cells to indicate a matching number (one side has a cell with only one dot, the other side has two dots, etc).

If your parents were able to help you as a child, then you probably got an education that was at least adequate, you probably learned to travel on your own, and you probably grew up with at least a few sighted friends. However, if your parents had problems of there own (drug addictions, extreme poverty, etc) it's doubtful you got any of those advantages.  Parents matter hundreds of times more when a child is blind, because when the child can't yet stand up for himself, nobody else but his parents will stand up for him.  If they don't do it, the child will be overlooked, and left to fall through the cracks.

Also, if you can afford to live in a large city, your job search will be a hundred thousand times easier.  Saying ""stand up and get your dream job!"" doesn't help, when you're living on government benefits that are so small you sometimes can't even afford three meals a day, never mind the cost of taking cabs to job interviews, because the place you live in has no public transit to speak of.

Do you often see movies without audio description? 

&gt;  That sounds really interesting! I'll go bother the two or three Scottish blind folks I know to see if they've been and what they thought of it. If I lived there, I'd have definitely made time to go.

You definitely should! Report back if you can as well, haha. To be honest It’s been quite difficult to find people with visual impairment to talk to here in Glasgow. Slow and steady wins the race!

&gt; By the way, are you at all familiar with the work of Dr. Michael James Heron?

I am now! Thank you!

&gt; And that's the most detailed description I can give without actually measuring anything.

This might be a silly question, but how do you feel about the radio? How does it feel? smell?

&gt; It's far from the only portable radio I have

You seem to like your portable radios! Would you call yourself a collector? Why portable radios?

&gt; I've also been to events in the past where I got to walk around the field, run the bases, and meet some of the players.

Did doing this help you make sense of not only baseball, but other games as well? Do you know what happens on a for example, football field?

&gt; I even have a baseball autographed by the Toronto Blue Jays world series winning team!

Oh wow! That must be a prized possession, eh? When and where did you get it?

&gt; But whenever someone else plays a card, they need to announce the card they played (assuming we're playing a game where cards are played face up, or tricks are taken, or whatever), so I'll know what's happening, and who's turn it is. So that can sometimes be a barrier to having relaxed conversation while playing cards, because it keeps getting interrupted so someone can announce there play.

Does this create a more focused gaming moment then? Do you know how others feel playing with you or are you just concerned that the braille cards create a perhaps unusual, interrupted, environment for the sighted? So basically what I would like to know is whether you feel it is a practical or a social barrier.

&gt; Sure. Electronic formats, like epub or html or pdf, assuming the publisher isn't using any DRM.

In these cases, do you use a screen reader or how does it work? How pleasant is it compared to audio books?

&gt;I consider music, food, and books shared experiences, even if they're not something we're all doing together. Because it's still possible to discuss them after the fact.

I find your insights into shared experiences very interesting. You are right about the fact that a shared experience doesn’t need to take place at the same time, as long as there is interaction at some point. And like you said, equal access to basic information is vital.

 &gt; Comparing those shot-by-shot scripts with the episodes that are available with audio description really reinforces just how little the things the audio describer fails to mention matter to the plot...or...well, anything really

This might be a difficult question, but what kind of things don't matter to anything? Any examples that you could remember? What things are crucial? I mean obviously it depends on the movie/tv show, but if you could remember that'd be great.

&gt; It's just a way to help associate things. For example, red is hot, angry, passionate. Blue is cold, for boys, or sad. Pink is for girls, healthy, or happy. White is good, pure, snowy, etc.

How about when, for example, someones eyes are described as blue in a book. Do you associate that with cold or sad?

&gt; Also, before I forget, you might be interested in the ad we're discussing in this thread. 

Interesting ad indeed! And it does relate to what we’ve been talking about. On that post you discuss  the wider effects of the ad, in terms of how it represents visually impaired people. This made me wonder about how you think the case is in general? How do you think an ""average joe"" would perceive you? How would you like to be perceived? Is there something that you think needs to be fundamentally changed?

493,"Hi all! 
I don't exactly have a rare disease but I had cataract in both eyes since birth which severely impaired my vision. In 2015 I suffered from retinal detachment (happens randomly to 1 in 10000 people) in my right eye. I didn't even realize that my retina was starting to detach until it was too late, I started seeing black dots but shrugged it off since it has happened before. Fast forward two years later, it's 2017 and my left eye has very limited vision and I'm legally blind in my right eye. Spectacles significantly improve vision in the left eye and barely allow me to read, play video games etc. I used to play sports before 2015 but can't anymore. Somehow I manage to drive around town like travelling to college or doing chores etc. I guess I should be grateful for whatever vision I have left.  On the bright side my  doctors say it can't get any worse now. Let's hope the future has something good for all of us

LOL. Those thanks might be misplaced!  In the words of Woodrow Wilson, ""If I Am To Speak Ten Minutes, I Need a Week for Preparation; If an Hour, I Am Ready Now.""  I'm pretty much just brain dumping at you, and not taking the time to edit out my pointless digressions, unrelated thoughts, etc.  Spewing out thousands of words is easy for me; cutting them down to a few hundred is the difficult part.  So I'm just making you do the work of sifting through for anything of value.  

&gt; Do you often see movies without audio description?

Definitely sometimes.  If everyone I'm with wants to see a particular movie, I'll still go, even without AD. But I'll always use it, whenever it's available. And I never choose to watch movies or TV shows without it when I'm on my own, with a few minor exceptions (MLP because I can get the scripts, stand-up comedy specials, and talking-head shows like The Daily Show).  

&gt; quite difficult to find people with visual impairment to talk to 

Unfortunately, that doesn't surprise me. Just on /r/blind alone, we sometimes get two ""researchers"" per day posting questions and surveys. It can be hard to tell the difference between undergrads asking questions to fill out some sort of ""how to design products"" worksheet that they themselves don't even care much about, people who are honestly interested in the questions, professional researchers who are actually trying to build/create something, and complete nutjobs.  In one case, someone posted a question asking ""people who take care of blind people, what do they like."" and then after I answered, angrily accused me of faking my blindness, because blind people can't use computers.  

These days, I'd say I only bother with about half of the ""design/research project"" questions.  I just upvote the rest, and then feel slightly guilty two months later, when I happen to notice they didn't get a single answer from over two thousand readers.  I wish I knew why university projects about blind people are so popular.  Maybe if we could get one of the professors who assigns/overseas/whatever these things here, he/she could help us create an ""FAQ for researchers"", pointing at previous research, answers to popular questions that come up in the course of this type of research project, etc. I feel like many of these people all need the same things.  I just haven't done enough (any) university research projects to have a clear understanding of what they are.

Anyway, my point is, that when a blind person hears that you have a design project, the reflexive reaction you're going to get is ""Bah. Go away!""  That's really unfortunate, and I wish I had a solution to that general problem. Because I think we're losing a lot of really smart people, who are just getting completely ignored because we can't sort the wheat from the chaff.

It doesn't really have a smell (I just checked, and I'm really hoping nobody just saw me randomly sniff a radio). It feels...like plastic. You know the kind, that smoothe, hard, stiff/brittle plastic that most cheap electronics comes in. Carefully feeling it now, I'm noticing that it's really quite scratched up.  I assume it didn't have all these little surface scratches back when it was new. And they aren't part of my touch memory of the radio. But holding it in my hand now, I can definitely feel them.  I guess it's getting old.  That thought makes me inexplicably sad.  Otherwise...I don't feel anything about the radio.  It's my baseball radio...liking or disliking it isn't a question.

Try your best to avoid making her a blind ninja-warrior. 

Transition from sighted life to blind life can be tough and involve a lot of deep emotions similar to greif and loss. 

I will only speak for myself here: As a blind guy who has been getting around college campuses for a few years now, I feel pretty good about my orientationand mobility skills. BUT, I am and always have been a little clumsy (even when I had sight.) I bump into people, bump into objects, trip, and even fall at times. Sometimes I get a little turned around and lost, and have to backtrack to reorient myself. Having the skills you need to get around doesn't make you automatically a master of those skills, and mistakers happen. Just like everyone I guess!

523,"&gt;an accident with some birds of prey

It was the spearows, wasn't it? The bastards.

In all seriousness, the depiction of the blind in fiction is a bit of a balancing act. You've already aknowledged that the goal is to not make them too helpless, but there's also a cliche of ""Handicapped person with a superpower of some kind that completely negates the disability."" So don't like, have her learn echolocation from zubats or something. Although that'd be kinda funny. 

Being that this is a pokemon universe thing, and weird abilities are commonplace, i think you have a little less to worry about, but characters like Toph and Daredevil are a bit of a double-edged sword. It's nice to have blind heroes, it's annoying to have blindness shown as a ""weakness"" that doesn't matter. Being blind is kind of a big part of your life, whether you want it to be or not. Here are some quick tips:

1: With some exceptions, it's possible to learn how to live pretty independently without sight, but it does take some learning. It's easier for kids, though.

2: Getting pity from strangers is a complicated subject. Sometimes it's nice that others show compassion. Feeling belittled for having a disability, though, sucks.

3: Discrimination against people who have disabilities is a thing. No clue it pokemon do it, but people sure has hell do. However, most of the time, it's subtle assumptions like ""you can't do it because you're blind."" not ""You're blind? EW!""

4: Conversely to pity, there's victimization. I've had people try to convince me they gave me correct change, when in fact they did not. Not sure how currency works in Pokemon world, but it might come up.

5: It's possible to retrain your brain to focus more on hearing and other senses, but we are by no means superheroes.

6: Considering that pokemon seem very intelligent, as far as animals go, I wouldn't be surprised to find some of them being trained as service animals, especially since in that setting they seem to be a part of daily life. Definitely research the type of training required of service animals, though, for ideas on how that can help a person without sight.

7: Since she was able to see up until her run in with the birds, her ability to ""visualize"" stuff by imagining it might remain largely unchanged. However, since she was fifteen when it happened, there might be a bit of an adjustment period of about a year or so where she'd need to re-learn stuff. 

9: most service animals in our world are dogs, (with a few horse-shaped exceptions) but once you've figured out the needs of your protagonist, you could figure out which pokemon fits that need the most.

I forgot to answer this, sorry! Got a phone call, thought I was done, and hit send.  Anyway, yeah, it's really common. Especially for dialogue, because many authors force the point.  If a character is written using words like ""y'all"", ""I reckon"", ""ain't"", ""figurin' on"", etc, the reader is almost forced to try and read that with an American accent, even if she's British.  Because otherwise the words just all sound so wrong even she would have trouble saying them outloud.  Same for any other character using dialect or slang from a particular culture.  When it's done right, it's a really good thing.  When it's done badly, it's a really awful thing.

539,"I work for a company that produces ebooks, including non-fiction and drama. When an ebook is read with the robot voice, the voice will presumably be the same for the whole book. Headings and sub-headings may get minor customisations, like pauses after they're read, but our books already do those bits correctly.

I was looking at CSS as a possible way to define different voices for different characters, and for stage directions. But if I did that, would anybody like it? Could it actually be worse than having the whole play read in one single voice? I don't want to over-customise this stuff if most robo-voice listeners would dislike the results.

Say there was a child and an adult character, and I made a childlike voice by using the CSS (that nobody supports) to raise the voice pitch and speed, and slowed the adult voice down slightly. But if you've already configured your reader to read the default voice at the fastest intelligible speed, the child-voice might cross over into unintelligibility. So while there's things I _could_ customise, (speed in this case), I need to canvas the preferences of actual users on how much customising I _should_ do.

And if you're used to a monotone generic robot voice, you might even find an increased variety of robo-voices a distraction, because they'll still remain unavoidably robot-like. On the other hand if you've got a play with a dozen characters, having them all read in the same voice could also be confusing. So, what's the best compromise? And I bet it's different again for a plain novel or a piece of non-fiction.

If I did customise the voices, how readily distinguishable would they be? Can I use CSS to make only 4 to 6 distinctive voices, or could I make 20? Are there any libraries of CSS voice settings I can refer to? There's lots of customising you can do - how much difference do all those settings actually make in practice? Are there any examples of ebooks with custom voices that I could study?

It seems like the answers to most of these questions are basically 'nothing supports that' or 'no'. So for now I'd probably do better to ask specifically about CSS support before worrying about particular implementation details. I need better support first, before I can implement the customisation I'd like to do.",,,,Simons_Mith,,,1491000793,t5_2qpec,t3_62oad7,t1_dfo4tpa,2,1491957017,0,0,dfo64mm,Blind,,,,,

Most of the interest in guide robots is about potentially being faster than cane travel for certain conditions. None of the robots I've heard talk of have been as versatile as either cane or dogs. Being able to travel faster inside office buildings or in urban areas is certainly useful though. As far as I am aware the only current actively used guide robots are used by cane users in a medical campus setting for more efficient travel while on campus--they leave the robot behind when they go home.

I've encounted a lot of people with vision loss, both blind and low vision, because I am an instructor for them. There is quite a variety. A short list of professions with blind workers....

Lawyer
Independent Living Skills Specialist  
Massage Therapist  
High Tech Assessor  
Piano Tuner  
Teacher  
Judo Instructor  
Writer  
Researcher  
Telemarketer  
CEO (there are a few things you need to do before that point, though)  
Student  
Musician  
Chef  
Police officer  
Aqua-fitness instructor  
CPR instructor  
News reporter  


People I don't know personally but have heard about  

Governor of a State  
Military Officer  
Orientation and Mobility Instructor (I would REALLY want to see him in action)  
Prostitute (During my job interview, I was seriously asked how I would teach O&amp;M to a blind prostitute... Because that issue actually came up).    


As for finding a job that suits you, there are a few factors to consider.   

First one is, how vital is vision to the job? While vision is important when using computers, there are ways around it. However, it would be much more difficult (and much more dangerous) for someone with vision loss to fly a plane or become a firefighter.  

Second, what is your passion? If possible, you want to find a job that you care about. The chef loves to cook, and the ILS specialist loves to help people regain their independence.  

Third, how to get the skills you need for that job? It is one thing to want to be a lawyer, but you have to put in your time studying and getting certified.

I like your take on food as being an art form. It is a very similar practice when you think of it. There are a set of rules/guidelines that people work with and they try to create experiences and communicate their takes on the discourse of 'what is good food?'. Also, fusion kitchen food is kind of like an art piece that crosses over genres and helps the medium itself to evolve and progress. I guess the main difference would be in the fact that it is also a necessity in a more fundamental way than other mediums we have discussed. I mean, it can be argued that stories, art, design and all that is fundamental to our wellbeing but not as much to our existence. 

What do you mean when you say you spend a lot of money on mechanical keyboards? Is it that you invest in an expensive one that lasts for a long time, or do you buy a cheaper one very often? I mean the haptic feedback of a keyboard does bring more assurance even to a sighted person. I have an iPhone myself and I typo all the time with the touch screen. For example, if one clicks a pixel too much to the right, it'll end up as the wrong letter on the message. I don't know how I would explain 'movement sense' but I totally think I get you. It's this kind of a feel you get when you learn how the springs on a keyboard work. You push down and create the anticipation of it springing back yourself. Am I even close haha?

Thank you for such a detailed and interesting answer man! I think that your insights to touch and this idea of visual mapping are very cool. However, I started thinking that just like food, could textures and haptic feedback communicate intensity of emotion? What if tactile pieces wouldn’t try to accurately depict something from the “visual world” but instead elicit emotions and trigger imagination to create an experience?

You are absolutely right about this being very individual, and I think that I can understand the circumstances that give individuals their own starting points for using their senses. However, I don't think that you and your friends are non-average. You are you. 

I was reading this book called “Touching and Imagining - An Introduction to Tactile Art” by Jan Švankmajer, where he says that technology has brought us to a world were hands aren’t used as much for manual labour, but for aesthetic purposes instead, and that we interact more and more with screens etc. This has lead to us not having to rely so much on our haptic memory and tactility whilst making sense of the world, but on our sight and hearing instead. I think that this has also lead to many of our activities to be on-screen, flat and therefore two dimensional.
