13,"I'm not totally blind yet, but I play D&amp;D and more (WFRP2e, SR5e, Paranoia and more). I'm close to an exclusive DM/GM, but I do occasionally play (I was in a game on Roll20 for three months this year). 

When running games, I write things up in word, large font size, white on black, and PDF it for use on my tablet at the table. I've a magnifying glass to help with content from books if it is needed (e.g. Monster Mannual). I do as much as possible in theatre of the mind, but if required I have a battlemat (three actually), whiteboard markers, and heaps of miniatures. I rely on the players to draw up rooms, move monsters for me etc. I'll have to modify what I do a little when I'm total, but for the most part it'll be the same.

As a player, I can use the form fillable PDF character sheets. In the future though, if I'm a player I think I'll just use Word and write things out and record stuff digitally only (I'm pretty big on being paperless in general). I'm guessing there are talking dice aps out there, but I like rolling physical dice so it'll probably be up to others to read in the future. 

As for online play, I really don't like Roll20 as a platform. Mate of mine has played on Fantasy Grounds and says it is much better, but it's more than just the interface itself (which is clunky and has some issues with high contrast/negative colour). It's just not the same as playing at a table, and you're constantly having issues with delay, silences, people going to talk to fill the silences only to find othes had the same idea because they were also waiting for others, only one person can talk at a time etc. I can't really comment a huge amount on the accessibility of these platforms for people who're totally blind, and I'm unlikely to ever find out because of disliking online as a platform for playing tabletop RPGs.

31,"Not blind, but I do work with a lot of blind people, and teaching eye contact is something that comes up. It mostly comes up for congenitally blind children, who aren't aware that eye contact is a thing, although it can happen to children who lose their vision later in life (the muscles to hold up the head aren't used as often, and the head starts to droop). Most people who lose their visions as adults and have no other issues usually don't have this issue, their muscle tone is sufficient to keep their head up.

One of the main reasons congenitally blind children don't do eye contact much is they don't feel there is a need for it. We point out that while it is a social convention, there is another reason for eye contact as well. When the head is hanging down, the voice is aimed downwards, and due to being children, their height is likely shorter than others they talk to. As a result, it is harder for the adults to hear them. By looking at roughly where a person's face is, they are project their voice more clearly and be heard easier. Additionally, it helps for hearing as well, but not to a huge degree (unless someone is talking very quietly, you should be able to hear them).

I do still do ARAMs in League of Legends with my yank mates though (sometimes I even do well, I got an S- with Dr Mundo the other month!

Edit: I thought I might add some more detail on League of Legends. Basically I stick to tanks and a few supports. I lose my mouse constantly, so I like and do best with champions that aren't point and click, i.e. no attack damage carries. So champions like Sona are awesome because I just move around and press buttons, aim my ultimate (which is easy to see because it is big) and right click things occasionally if possible. Or tanks where I just have to be in the middle of a fight doing damage from auras and aiming the occasional skill shot (they've large targeting things that're easy to see). I just want assists.

Worked at a library for 12 years. Got the job through a disability agency when I was 17. (I have epilepsy, and a vision impairment, but could still use computers with zoomtext software ect)

Started out in 2004 as just a shelver, so all I do was shelve the books that were returned for 3 hours each shift.

They started letting me work full time desk shifts, whenever anyone went on holiday, as a library officer.

Cut to 2012, a full time library officer job opens, I apply and they say ""Oh we want someone with more qualifications."" They then hired a 16 year old boy with no qualifications at all.

I thought ""Fuck this."" and went on part time disability pension, so I still worked there 15 hours a week but also now had enough money to move out of home ect.

Cut to 2016, we move to a brand new built 7 floor library, and they hire tons of new staff. My hours get cut tons, every other employee gets training on all the different roles, and I get shoved out the back doing nothing but covering new books in plastic contact.

Yes, it is easier to learn Braille when having some vision. One of my coworkers used to have Braille lessons with a client, who would drive home afterwards. Most of the learning is a bit easier with some vision (doesn't mean it isn't possible with no vision, may just take a little longer).

If he is bumping into things (chairs and walls impacting his knees or shoulders), or having falls (from tripping on steps and such), he should definitely consider getting some orientation and mobility training. Depending on where he is from, contact your local vision loss rehabilitation agency for an assessment.

When my client explained he couldn't read the sign (he had a white cane, but wasn't total), the bus driver told him the number without apologizing.

113,"There are a number of factors you would need to consider. Highly myopic people often have thinner retinas, which means it is more likely for them to tear or become detached. That is especially important for physical activity where someone is struck repeatedly (boxing, some martial arts), struck forcefully (hockey, football, boxing, martial arts) or an impact from behind that results in a sudden forward stop (rear-ended in a car, bungee jumping, roller coaster). 

Most forms of macular degeneration are age related, and many older people do not do as much strenuous physical activity by the time macular degeneration starts to show up (the average age of onset is 55).

You mentioned that a vase or a chair will be the same size, but you are forgetting that how it is perceived at a distance changes the sensory input. For example, imagine a lit light bulb in a lamp in your room. You can tell the size of the light bulb from how bright it is. But if that same lamp was in your neighbour's house, it would be less bright because of the greater distance.

In a similar way with echolocation, the volume of the echo (and other factors) help to indicate the distance. The same object can give out different sensory information, which can be interpreted differently. Things like sound shadows also effect how objects sound.

Also keep in mind that these concepts can be consciously taught as well. Sighted children normally learn through incidental learning (they learn it because they see what everyone else does). When children first learn to draw, people look like potato men with sticks for arms, and the houses are the same size as everything else. But as they get older, they learn perspective from visual feedback of real life objects and other pictures. The same things can be taught intentionally as well, although I don't think most parents do that much nowadays.

130,"Anytime!

I started with the machines at my trainer’s recommendation as you don’t have to worry about controlling the motion, just preforming the rep but you get the same workout for your muscles as free weights would give. 

The big thing is to not start too heavy and if you get symptomatic to stop. I usually do 2-3 sets so one day may look like: 

Tricep and bicep machines
Leg Press
leg Curl
Shoulder press
Chest or back 
Abs - this you can do daily as your abs don’t need an off day to repair. 

Each new strength day I try and increase the weight 5-10 lbs depending how I feel. 

If I’m feeling out of routine I’ll do some warm up reps a little lighter than normal and work up to my normal/challenging weight.

She can be happy, angry, humble, proud, quiet, playful, sullen, etc. If she's humble, she's humble because she's a person being humble -- *not* because she's blind. She *hates* it when people assume that her doing something means she's doing it *because* she's blind.

Hey, what's up everybody, how's it going?  
*[In the background there is gameplay of a doom level, he is currently in a cathedral, during certain parts it is alternating between shots of Toby, and the Doom gameplay.]*  
It's Berk, aka dansg08,  this video might look a little bit different from what you are used to seeing on the channel, but I promise you it's relevant, because it's to do with the documentary I made for Toby, the blind video game fan, who I met, we shot the documentary Gaming through New Eyes, together, and in that being quite a success, and this is like a mini success story I wanted to tell from the documentary, so just need a few minutes of your time, to share with you this awesome work that was done by MrAlanD1, let me tell you about what's going on here. 

(00:34)  
If you guys have saw the documentary,  you will know that Toby is a big fan of the game Doom, one of his favorite things to do is run around the Dooms level, and just kill all the monsters, he loves the sound effects of the monsters, he has been playing Doom worlds, like lots of modded Doom levels for many years now. And MrAlanD1 is someone who created some of these Doom mods, and these awesome Doom levels for people like Toby to enjoy. So Toby reached out to Alan, after we made the documentary, just to thank him for the mods he's made over the years and to also share with him the documentary, which shows him playing some of the mods Alan had created.

(01:06)  
So what happened next was really really cool, and it was the reason why I wanted to share this with you guys. Alan decided to make a tribute to Toby, so this Tribute is made up of three parts, and the first part is a special two-part level, that he designed for Toby, called Toby's cathedral. That is what you are watching at the moment. And this level is something he designed specifically for Toby, which I think is really just so awesome, and so nice of him to do that. So I wanted to thank him for that. So not only does Toby get to enjoy this awesome new level Alan has created for him, Alan has gone to the lengths of adding some accessibility features to make it easier for Toby to play, the only regular doom levels, but also customized, so modded doom levels as well.    

(01:47)     
So one of my main goals when making this documentary is to try to get the attention of video game developers so that they can do more to help people like Toby, and increase accessibility features for the blind, so that they could enjoy more games and be able to gain even more enjoyment from the ones they can already play. So it was always a lofty goal, maybe in the future, you know, a big game that gets made, will have more accessibility features, and maybe the documentary will end up being casteless of that, but this kind of change will take time, in the meantime, we have the glorious weld of modding, now these guys go so above and beyond for the community, that it is absolutely amazing. And it was always going to be modders to be the ones that made the first steps in improving accessibility features on a short term scale, and MrAlanD1, this guy you know he decided to put some time and effort into making games more enjoyable for Toby.   

(02:38)  
And the accessibility features he's created will allow Toby to enjoy even more Doom levels, and allow him to do things he couldn't do before, when he was playing Doom, so what kind of stuff did doohey, enabled him to navigate more efficently, using sound queues, because obviously for blind games, that's one of the biggest deals, being able to navigate levels effectively, so it's helped him out with that, he's put in a impact detection system so that Toby is able to move around levels more efficently, he's got sound for all of the items, and all of the keys, so that Toby knows exactly what item he's picking up, and he's also got sound,  
*[You can hear a slight ticking noise in the background]*  
he knows if he's pressing a colored key door, or if he's entered a secret area. Now maybe as your hearing this in the background, or if you go and watch it properly on mr AlanD1's channel, you might not think that this kind of stuff is a big deal, I mean the sounds don't really seem that important, obviously, you've got the obvious stuff, like, hearing the name of the thing being picked up, but it's amazing, having spent time with Toby and seeing how he plays games, and how certain things help him navigate areas is amazing.

(03:39)  
The smallest things can make such a big difference to the way blind people can enjoy video games, that is just mind-blowing. So the changes that  Alan has made here do genuinely make a big difference to the game experience of a blind person, so just really great work. The fact that Alan has taken the time to put all of this together for Toby, and to help him and other blind people enjoy games through a greater extent, is just something that I really wanted to thank him for, um, his channel is quite small, so I thought maybe because I have a wider audience, I might be able to get some people to takes some note of the great work he's doing, especially for the Doom community, I've only just included this as background footage, but to see the true extent of what he's done, and to hear him explain it in his own words, I definately recommend you to check out that video, and just send him over some thanks, because we need more people like Alan, who are willing to go above and beyond, to help make games more accessibily, and more fun for all of us. 


(04:31)  
So that's it guys, I just wanted to share this video with you, and I wanted to thank Alan publically for the great work that he did, and for taking the time to create something like this, I am just happy that my documentary, and the time that I spent with Tomy, was a catalsty in doing something like this, and maybe some of one who is watching this is a modder, or they do this kind of stuff as well, it would be awesome to have more games that have mods like this, because in the short run, if anyone is going to make the game and world a better place for blind gamers, is definately going to be modders. 

(04:58)  
So, Alan has proved it, and I'm hoping that maybe this will be something to inspire more modders out there to get onto this whole thing, and make gaming a better experience for everybody. So that's just something I wanted to share with you guys. I hope you guys enjoyed it, please please, please please, check out Alan's original video, and share him some love, because this is just something he did out of the goodness of his heart, and I want him to be noted and celebrated for this. Thank you guys for watching, and I will see you soon, take care.

Hey, what's up everybody, how's it going?  
*[In the background there is gameplay of a doom level, he is currently in a cathedral, during certain parts it is alternating between shots of <PERSON>, and the Doom gameplay.]*  
It's <PERSON>, aka <PERSON>,  this video might look a little bit different from what you are used to seeing on the channel, but I promise you it's relevant, because it's to do with the documentary I made for <PERSON>, the blind video game fan, who I met, we shot the documentary Gaming through New Eyes, together, and in that being quite a success, and this is like a mini success story I wanted to tell from the documentary, so just need a few minutes of your time, to share with you this awesome work that was done by MrAlanD1, let me tell you about what's going on here. 

(00:34)  
If you guys have saw the documentary,  you will know that <PERSON> is a big fan of the game Doom, one of his favorite things to do is run around the Dooms level, and just kill all the monsters, he loves the sound effects of the monsters, he has been playing Doom worlds, like lots of modded Doom levels for many years now. And MrAlanD1 is someone who created some of these Doom mods, and these awesome Doom levels for people like <PERSON> to enjoy. So <PERSON> reached out to <PERSON>, after we made the documentary, just to thank him for the mods he's made over the years and to also share with him the documentary, which shows him playing some of the mods <PERSON> had created.

(01:06)  
So what happened next was really really cool, and it was the reason why I wanted to share this with you guys. <PERSON> decided to make a tribute to <PERSON>, so this Tribute is made up of three parts, and the first part is a special two-part level, that he designed for <PERSON>, called <PERSON>'s cathedral. That is what you are watching at the moment. And this level is something he designed specifically for <PERSON>, which I think is really just so awesome, and so nice of him to do that. So I wanted to thank him for that. So not only does <PERSON> get to enjoy this awesome new level <PERSON> has created for him, <PERSON> has gone to the lengths of adding some accessibility features to make it easier for <PERSON> to play, the only regular doom levels, but also customized, so modded doom levels as well.

206,"In general, blind people, even the minority that are totally blind from birth, have a good idea of how sight works. After all, blind people live in a sighted society and, almost always, interact with sighted people daily. They know what sighted people can and cannot do and they know about the subjective sighted experience of color because they hear sighted people talking about it endlessly. They also know what culturally-ascribed moods or associations go with each color, such as red for warning and anger or blue for sadness or tranquility. That's because, again, sighted people constantly use color not only as a pragmatic indicator but also as metaphor. If you know English, you already know a lot about color associations. ""I'm feeling blue."" ""She's green with envy."" ""They were seeing red after the meeting.""

Color isn't that difficult to explain, at least in analogy to hearing. 

Both light and sound can be conceived of as waves. Light is perception of radiation in the environment and sound is perception of the vibration or displacement of air molecules. As waves, the distance between the crests of the wave differs. In sound, we call this difference ""frequency,"" as in how frequent we perceive the wave going up and down (oscillating). So if the frequency is high, the wave crests are close together. If the frequency is low, they are far apart. In hearing, we perceive these differences as a difference in pitch, like in this YouTube video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNf9nzvnd1k

Color is the perception of frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum, a segment of which is visible light. So color can be explained by analogy as the equivalent of pitch in vision. Just as different entities in the environment create sounds at different pitches, which allows us to distinguish a violin from a sick cat (sometimes), perceiving colors helps to distinguish objects in the environment as well as properties of those objects.

Human cultures ascribe arbitrary names to certain frequency ranges, for example we call 606–668 THz ""blue.""

231,"Interesting idea, but a few issues.


The minimum number of dots for letters is 3, and the maximum is 6. Without using the braille with less dots, you reduce the number of possible combinations.


Also, this may be a viable option if only grade 1 braille was used, because you would only need 26 characters and some punctuation. But with grade 2 braille, you would need much more symbols. The symbol used for Z (dot 1, 4, 5, 6) corresponds to an existing grade 2 braille combo (in this case, th). Same with the letter U (dot 1, 2, 4, 6) with another combo (ed). This system wouldn't work because you would need so many more combinations.


You may think ""But why do you need grade 2 braille, if all the letters are available for grade 1?"". Braille cells have to be a certain size, otherwise they can't be felt. That size is larger than most average font sizes. That results in a page of printed text being significantly larger than in braille. For example, imagine the size of a standard Bible. These two pictures are what the Bible looks like printed in Braille. In grade 2, so already compressed.

Learning two different systems also doesn't help. Between 1829 to the 1930s, there was something called the War of the Dots, when different schools were working on creating competing standards for embossed codes. Helen Keller lamented that for her to have access to printed materials, she needed to learn 4 different embossed codes. Here is an article that discussed it more in detail  (http://www.afb.org/warofthedots/book.asp).


The system is also missing a lot of punctuation. The number sign being used (dot 3, 5, 6) is used in Braille as a quotation mark, while the Braille number sign (dot 3, 4, 5, 6) is used in this system as the letter J.


There actually was another embossed code that was developed in the 1840s that was designed for adults who lost their vision later in life to read. The raised letters were designed so that adults who were already familiar with the shape could identify them easier, while also letting sighted people read it as well.

I have a limited field of vision and heavy visual static in most of my visual field, but have one good spot with only light static, but it is nearer to the top of my field at the 2 o’clock position.  

I’ve been playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lately.  Since it’s mostly exploration and manageable combat, I do okay for the most part.  I have a harder time with bosses, dimly lit environments, and when there a lot of particle effects going on (smoke, fog, etc.).   I also have a hard time seeing item drops because they look like sparkles.

I honestly find myself playing older 8-16 bit games because the graphics are just simpler.  Of course, things with twitch action or screen filling action are no goes now.  EA Sports posts here from time to time and they really seem to want to make their titles accessible to the visually impaired.  If you’re into sports, you might want to check them out.

243,"As an accessibility trainer who is totally blind, I find it helpful to break down vision loss into a few categories: people who have the ability to use the internet without any screen access software, people who use screen magnification software, people who alternate between using magnification and not using any at all, and people who rely solely on screen readers. For your first game, my advice would be to decide who your target audience is going to be. Are you looking to make your game accessible to use with screen readers? Are you thinking of a game which addresses the low vision crowd? Could you find a way to include all types of visual impairment? Two examples of games which cater to all types of visual impairments which immediately come to mind would be A Dark Room and King of Dragonpass, both of which are on iOS.

I really enjoyed Celtic Tribes at the beginning, and I know there are other games like that on the app store. The thing about Celtic Tribes that stopped me playing was this. When you get high enough to make it into the top ten alliances of the game (and I did make it that far), the way that most players in those alliances gain momentum and continue to make their empires stronger is by conquering other players. I found navigating CT's map to be too tedious and time consuming. In a web based game called Nation States, a similar challenge befell me. The region I joined liked to invade other nations. They would mass invade several regions within the span of a few minutes by flooding the nation with endorsements for an opponent. I found Discord, the chat system my region used to coordinate, to be hard to read using my screen reader at times. Additionally, I couldn't get to an enemy region's page fast enough. I probably could have done better given more time, but struggling to keep up by navigating using my screen reader while everyone else could just click click click didn't sound like my idea of fun. Another instance in which speed was a significant worry for me was in Pokemon Show Down. I found its concept to be appealing, and I have a blind friend who plays it. But I don't know that I could keep all the details of a match in my head and still make a move in an efficient amount of time. I don't have a good memory for finer details.

Text based choice games are nice, but I feel that there are quite a few on iOS already. Still, I've played some awesome choice based games: Life of a Wizard, the Hero's Rise Trilogy, Alter Ego, and Choice of the Cat are some of my favorites. I loved Alter Ego because I had always wanted to play The Sims. I figured that game was as close as I'd get to playing that. I would have loved Rollercoaster Tycoon if I could see. I would have played Pokemon video games. To that end, I play a similar accessible game called Crazy Party. They have a section called battle mode, and their cards are similar to Pokemon cards. Lastly, Eve Online is a game I've really wanted to play. I find RPG's to be appealing. My husband plays and has told me all about it. There's actually a thread on their forums where my husband asked Eve's developers if they would ever consider making their game accessible to the blind.

But if a friend told me they liked jazz, I'd say, that's cool. Tell me why you like it. The same goes for color. If someone told me they liked red, I'd say, that's cool. And I'd ask, why do you like the color red? What significance does it hold for you? Although I don't care about color personally, I like to get people talking.

He used to only be diagnosed with high myopia and he barely qualified for the vision program in our school district. Then a few years later, he experienced random bleeding which decreased his sight. He receives injections to stop the bleeding which in turn helps the vision loss. However, this is a sensitive situation because according to his ophthalmologist, the injections could just stop working one day and then the bleeding would lead to blindness. I have a goal on his IEP to learn the foundation of Braille because I feel like i would be being negligent if I didn’t introduce it. He doesn’t really have a “choice” per se but I only see him 30 minutes per week. I do agree on the open versus close minded point of view though. However, as his vision teacher i can’t ignore this just because he’s feeling bitter. 

He’s bitter about his vision problems and therefore bitter about learning Braille because it further emphasizes his visual impairment. Like I said, I don’t blame him.

281,"RP causes damage to the rods, which effect peripheral vision. Which is why often the two primary symptoms are night blindness (rods are most sensitive to low light conditions) and peripheral loss (usually presents as bumping into things or not noticing things right by you). 

There are a few possibilities about that. One, it is possible that you do have reduced fields but don't notice because when you hold your eyes out, you are unconsciously scanning with your eyes. When I do basic field tests for O&amp;M assessments, I stare at the eyes to see if they flick to the sides to see the target. Two, your fields not be under 20 degrees but your doctor thought it was best to mark it down as 20 degrees, because that is the limit for legal blindness (20 degree field of view or less). Depending on where you are, that often makes you eligible for certain concessions, which might be why the doctor did it. Three, you may have field loss in an odd pattern (may be mostly lower field loss, or unusual amount of scatomas), and the doctor just rounded it up to 20 degrees to make it easier. The degrees isn't as accurate as you would think, and often not very clear cut, even with the chart in hand.

Often for RP, we do teach how to use the cane in low light conditions, and as vision gets worse, we can build on those skills during daytime as well. Good luck with the cane training! It may feel odd at first, but you do get used to it pretty fast. I always remind my clients that a cane is a tool to help you regain your independence, not to hold you back.

299,"It gave meaning to my life.

I was suicidal and hopeless when my sister gave me this book called Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. The book is a meditation on what the gruesome experience of Auschwitz taught Frankl about the primary purpose of life: the quest for meaning, which sustained those who survived. 

I read the book in one night and have since read / listened to it many times over. The book is still with me on a day-to-day basis. Frankl views suffering not as an obstacle to happiness but often the necessary means to it, less a pathology than a path. 

”If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. 

Such men are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.”

Looking back, I can shout to the world “I went through it all!” The suffering of becoming blind had become an inspiration. It had become a trophy. It had become an achievement that no one can ever steal.

To quote Frankl; “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”

I read the book in one night and have since read / listened to it many times over. The book is still with me on a day-to-day basis. <PERSON> views suffering not as an obstacle to happiness but often the necessary means to it, less a pathology than a path. 

”If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. 

Such men are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.”

Looking back, I can shout to the world “I went through it all!” The suffering of becoming blind had become an inspiration. It had become a trophy. It had become an achievement that no one can ever steal.

To quote <PERSON>; “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”

336,"""Disability"" is a value-neutral statement of fact. Its meaning is not dependent on your subjective feelings, and pretending that a disability does not exist, when one patently does, is simply absurd.

&gt; I should've said I feel as if they're generally more humble than others

My girlfriend would fucking explode at reading this. What you see as ""humility"" is more likely to be the resigned frustration and simmering anger, at so often being treated as less-than-whole by society in general, and at being needlessly denied opportunities to participate in society.

Again, you apparently have this very patronizing perspective, and you're looking to find someone who will fit neatly into your box, which is labeled ""cute and humble and appreciative"". I think if you brought this perspective to a real, living blind woman, she would kick your ass, figuratively speaking.

358,"I'm 29 and I started learning Braille this year. I've always known that some day I'll be totally blind, I can still read with the sight I have left (although I've started using a magnifying glass to help).

I never had any interest in learning Braille, but on further consideration early this year I realised would open up opportunities later in life (specifically: there's a blind news reader on Triple J - an Australian radio station - whose footsteps I'd like to follow in). It was also a genius idea because I usually treat my performance development stuff at work with great disdain, but I could actually bring Braille training to the table as a development opportunity. I now go for an hour lesson every Thursday (which work is happy for me to do on company time).

As someone who has learnt to read sighted and gone through university, the basics of Braille are incredibly easy to pick up. I also do very well because my knowledge of syntax etc is very good, so I'm very adept at predicting what is coming. The hard part is the rote learning of the contractions, but that will come with time and use. It sounds like your student is in a pretty similar place. I think the important thing is that apart from seeing the alphabet (in the 10/10/6 configuration) so he can visual the cells, make sure he doesn't look while reading Braille. 

What sort of vision does he have at the moment? Thinking back to when I was 18, I was legally blind but I had much more sight than now and was quite comfortable not using a cane or accessible features of devices. 

Do you mean he is bitter about sight loss or bitter about learning Braille? Regarding the former, I was diagnosed with RP formally when I was 9, but before then it was pretty much assumed. I'm not saying I don't feel down about it at times, but it's never bothered me overly much. Life is life, it's best not to get to tied up in it and do what you need to, to do the things you want to do. 

In the case of the former, is he being forced to learn Braille? Does he have the choice not to learn? It's much easier to learn things when you're younger. It will also open up opportunities in the future if/when he does lose his sight. However a student with a closed mind isn't going to learn. If he doesn't want to be there and has the option not to be, it might actually be best for him not to be. This might lead to him learning hard lessons later in life, but all you and others can do is provide the advice, he has to choose whether to take it or not. 

For myself, the choice was easier because I know for a fact I will be totally blind in the future (ok, sure, there's a chance I might stay as I am now for the rest of my life, but I highly doubt it). So it might help to know more about his condition and how it will likely progress (if it's genetic and there is another family member with experience, that'd be a great comparison/example). That way you can provide advice on when Braille might become useful for him. 

Might've got a bit long so, TL:DR: yes, I am definitely going total later in life, came to the decision on my own, don't force him, he needs to come to the realisation on his own, you can help.

To be honest, one of the toughest things I'm dealing with is convincing other developers that accessibility matters. It's very frustrating trying to convince them that there's an audience waiting to play their games.

367,"Thanks for sharing this article. It's right on, and it was only last week I was talking about this issue over on /r/civ. 

I love the Civilization series. I've got all the main releases bar Civ 1 (which I used to have, but I think is gone now), plus Alpha Centauri and Civ: Beyond Earth. Firaxis have just announced the first expansion to Civ VI, which will add a stack of content that sounds really good. Unfortunately, graphically, Civ VI is a disaster for people with vision impairment/legally blind. The text is tiny and colour contrast is abysmal. This makes the game a real chore to play, compared to Civ V where the only issue I have is the poor colour contrast on the minimap and of city names/unit icons of some of the later civs to be added. 

It's frustrating that with a game where I can take all the time in the world to make decisions, the design choices making doing so frustrating. 

With games where things are happening in real time, that's a bit different and for me I doubt it'd matter what the developer did, it'd still be frustrating.

402,"Just joined Reddit today after reading posts on this subreddit's Twitter page. So I'm only just now seeing this. I married my sighted husband five years ago. His family was polite to me, but I think they were skeptical. I lived pretty far away from my husband at the time, about a five-hour plane ride. My father-in-law's wife invited me to stay with the family while visiting my husband for the first time. The thought was that this would give us time to get to know each other better (we met online) without feeling like we were crowding the other's space.

I say this so that you see, his family had plenty of time to observe me. I was the first blind person any of them had interacted with for a significant length of time, and they were impressed with me. But I have a bubbly nature and can seem rather flirty. I married young, and I think I came off a little more shallow than I meant to. All in all, as my husband's father got to know me, he concluded that I was, indeed, levelheaded and intelligent. But he thought I was too different from his son to make it work. Looking back, I think he thought I was too much like his ex-wife, honestly. And I am, a lot like his mother. I take this as a compliment. She is a sweetheart with a big heart.

I think it was a bit different for me, being the wife-to-be. His family liked me. They thought I was an inspiration. But I think they doubted my ability to be a good wife. All in all, the love is there now, with his family. But me being a part of the family didn't happen over night. It took his family seeing how I reacted in the face of challenges to believe that I was in it for the long haul. I cared for my husband when he came down with a chronic health condition. I stayed in the hospital with my husband's aunt until she died, and we contributed $700 toward her funeral costs. I found a job once I moved out to where my husband lives. And they came to know that I was a hard worker. So, looking back, my advice is this. Try to get to know your fiance's family, if they'll let you. But if they shut you out, I think it's just going to take time. They don't know you; they have their preconceptions. Give them a chance to see your actions and let them speak for themselves. Say to yourself, her family is not a part of my support system now, but there may come a time when we can rely on each other.

First, bringing her a menu is the right thing to do, because you don't know how much sight she has. Bringing her a menu treats her like everyone else, so she isn't singled out. If she had some vision, and then had to ask you for a menu, then that puts her in an awkward position. (I've worked with a man who had a significant visual disability, but with a special lens he could read text that was very close to his face.)  So ""because I didn't want to assume how much she could or couldn't see"" is definitely the right approach.

The only other guidance I'll offer is this: If a person brings a guide dog, just completely ignore the guide dog. Don't interact at all with the guide dog. My partner's dog is very well-behaved, but if you pay much attention to her (the dog), she'll get uncontrollably derpy very quickly. It can be stressful for the owner of the dog, when someone else is interacting with their dog, because they lose a certain degree of control over their situation, and they lose some capability, because their dog is now distracted.

Obviously you didn't do that, since you didn't mention that, but I'm just offering it because it is one of the biggest complaints of my partner, when she is out in public.

Thanks for being great, and keep it up.

409,"Well, i don't think it would be disrespectful, but it certainly wouldnt be an accurate way to really get into a blind person's shoes. 

To begin, most blind people have had experience being blind at least for a while. So simple tasks like cooking, traveling, and using technology would be much less daunting for us. I (and many of my other visually impaired friends) would be bored out of our minds if we had to spend a day without our phones! I'd imagine it would be hard to master screenreading software like voiceover or talkback in a day. 

Also, a lot of what ""the experience"" (imo) has to do with how sighted folks react to us. The way that someone reacts to you in a blindfold would likely be very different from how people react to me with a cane. I've been cussed out, prayed for, ignored- you name it all on my adventures with my cane. 

And lastly, blindfolding would only give you a bit of a totally blind person's perspective. Most legally blind people (myself included) still have some usable vision left. 

Hope that helps. Happy holidays!",,,,blindjo,,,1514164348,t5_2qpec,t3_7lym63,t3_7lym63,7,1515059290,0,0,drq1sox,Blind,,,,,

414,I lost 75% of my vision 2 years ago from a bad accident so it's different from your situation where you sort of know it's going to happen. I have a very small field of vision which makes me legally blind. I don't have peripheral vision or depth perception anymore so I'll never drive a car or see the effects of a 3D movie but there's still a million other things I can enjoy and I think being involved with my local blind center and learning that I could still do most activities and hobbies as a blind person helped me accept my vision loss and be happy with my situation. ,,,,bitstrip,,,1512095504,t5_2qpec,t3_7g7c33,t3_7g7c33,1,1514217072,0,0,dql96il,Blind,,,,,

419,"The second proposed feature you mentioned (intensity of vibration to denote distance) is a common method to indicate distance. The Mowat Sensor was a good example of this (it was made back in 1978  http://www.aph.org/museum-virtual-exhibit/vex9/23A18E0F-4178-4D07-AC4D-461550580040.htm ). A more recent version is called the Miniguide ( http://www.gdp-research.com.au/minig_1.htm ). The Ultra Cane does the same thing, although I don't believe the vibrations are quite as sensitive (https://www.ultracane.com/ ).

For your first proposed feature, you mentioned vibrating on the left or right to indicate if something is to the left or right. But by itself, that doesn't provide enough information to be useful. If it vibrates to the right, how far to the right? Using a clock face method of orientation, is it at 1 o'clock, or 2 o'clock, or directly ahead but just slightly to the right? That would be the difference walking past something and walking into something.

For those two concepts, they have been tried a number of times, to varying degrees of success. The UltraCane and the BAT 'K' Sonar Cane being the two most recent examples. 

Your third proposed idea has some merit (self-driving cars use similar technology), although implementation would be tricky. I've heard of some people attempting something similar, but nothing useful to date.

If you have a chance, you should talk to someone from the local vision loss rehabilitation agency (such as an Orientation and Mobility Specialist) to show you hope the cane is used and what things may already have been tried.
