13,"Hi, 

It’s kind of a tough question, but I appreciate you feeling free to ask it; I will try to answer it from my own experience. First of all, even though I was born with sight, I believe your description of the experience of someone who was born blind is, largely, correct. My wife, for example, was born blind and she does not have personal experience with sight. However, I do not believe this is as big of a deal as you might think. For one thing, I would not say that she has no concept of vision, no more than I would say that a sighted person has no concept of an atom. Of course, it’s impossible to “see” an atom, but we all have a concept of an atom thanks to the alternative ways we have experienced atoms. The same thing is true for my wife and color. If she says the word black, the color, itself, does not come to her mind, but she does know the concept through reading, living in society, and being taught from a young age what black means. So, for her, she may think of formal classy clothing, or something you would wear to a funeral, or nighttime, or mystery, or the opposite of light etc. In fact, even though I had sight until I was 18, my wife might be better at saying what colors go with what, because she had to make a point to learn such things, where as I took that kind of thing for granted as a sighted teenager.

My wife was one of the first people I ever got to know well who was born blind, and I’m ashamed to say that when we first became friends I thought there would be obvious examples that illustrated that she had never experienced sight. However, for the most part, that just is not true.

Now for me, on the other hand, what I experience as a totally blind person who was sighted until I was 18 is different. For me, I’m never really experiencing blackness either, as if I was a sighted person with my eyes closed; there are a number of reasons for this. For one thing, most of the time I see blobs of glittery colors shimmering around. Make no mistake, these glimmering shapes are not some tiny bit of vision that I still have, these colors are just my broken eye doing odd things, perhaps, a bit like the static that you would get on a broken old-school TV. You could wave a flash light, or the sun, in front of my face, or turn all of the lights out, and it would have no effect on the glittery things I’m “seeing”. Such optical phantoms, sometimes called floaters, are pretty common for people who lose their sight. It’s funny, when I lost the vision I had, due to a surgery, these glittery lights were so bright that I had trouble sleeping for a few nights. I remember being annoyed thinking, I thought being blind would consist of a lot of blackness, but here I am being kept awake by phantom lights. This feeling of being annoyed only lasted for a few days, because my brain quickly learned to make the lights go away when I need them to. Most of the time, as I go through my day, I’m not staring at glittery lights, they are often still there, but if I don’t think about them or pay attention to them they might as well not exist; by the way, since I’m thinking about them right now they are pretty bright, silver, some dark blue, purple etc. Most of the time, when I’m just going through my day, I am seeing a vague visual idea of what I’m doing. When I am making coffee, I have this idea of the coffee pot in front of me, my cup in my hands, and my cat at my feet. Now, even though I’m experiencing things in an imaginary visual way, I’m not conches that I’m doing so, and I would not have super specific details to give most of the time, unless I purposely thought about them. In other words, I have this picture in my head of me sitting on my couch typing this, but if you asked me what color my shirt was, I would have to think about it, even though I see my shirt in my mind’s eye. I think when I first lost my sight my imagined pictures were more specific, but now my brain gives me the basic visual layout, unless I ask for more.

One last thing I will say is, when I think of my memories as a sighted person, and my memories as a blind person, they are not very different. You might think that there would be some great drop or change in the quality of your experiences after you lost your sight, but for me that is not really the case. I will say that I think I am a pretty visual person, and that being a blind person makes it a little harder for me to remember things, but that is more of a practical matter, instead of a major difference in my experience. 

So, in conclusion, no I’m never really just experiencing blackness, either because I’m seeing pretend lights, I’m seeing a vague pretend picture of what I’m doing, or I’m thinking about a concept or memory and such thoughts are very visual for me. I want to make it clear, everything I have said just comes from my own experience, and my understanding of my wife’s experience. Everyone’s experience is going to be different, so I cannot speak for anyone else.

16,"I think the only thing that can be said for kiosks is that you (usually) don't have to use them, at least for now. To be usable, there would have to be a consistent standard implemented across airlines, so that a VI user knows how to start an accessible transaction. The last time I used a kiosk, I went all the way through and then at the end noticed there was some kind of hole for headphones that was supposed to allow for accessibility. Not sure how I was supposed to know that was there and only even know about it now because I'm partially sighted.

Ignoring that issue, one way a kiosk could work with a minimum of overhaul is to create an app that asks a traveller to fill out the info a kiosk usually asks for. The app could then generate a QR code that could be held up in front of the kiosk, which could then spit out a ticket. All interactions would happen on the phone. Another possibility, which is more likely but will probably take longer, is to do away with paper boarding passes altogether and do everything in an app. That's probably where things are going, realistically speaking, and as long as the app or apps are accessible it shouldn't be an issue for VI folks.",,,,Amonwilde,,,1511754611,t5_2qpec,t3_7frmx0,t3_7frmx0,6,1513040607,0,0,dqe2bv7,Blind,,,,,

Q2. If yes, do you use mobile banking? If not, do you use any other applications? And do you do any shopping?

I use the Barclays mobile app. I also use Amazons app to do some shopping.

Q3. If we were to build a mobile banking application that utilises voice, fingerprint and text recognition, do you think it is a good idea? If not, why?

I don't think it's a good idea. As far as I know, most of the big banks have apps and most of those apps are accessible.

Q4. Are there any concerns when you think of a mobile banking application that utilises voice, fingerprint and text recognition to do banking features?

Someone could hack into the app and get all the data from it and then use the voice profiles to take as much money as they could from those that use that feature.

Q5. Do you have any specifications or features that you would like to have in the application?

No.

Q6. If given the chance, would you like to learn to use such an application and actually use it in your day to day activities?

No.

Q7. Do you think an application like this would be useful? If not why? How can we improve it to make it useful, adapting to your needs and concerns?

32,"Hi.

I'd recommend asking her where she'd like to go.

Isn't that what people do when dating?

As for going to the movies with her, why not? She might not be able to see the movie, but as far as I know, she can hear it can't she? Perhaps you could try describing what's going on in the movie to her and both of you could have a good time that way. 

Or you could see if the movie theatre has headphones with audio description.

Audio description or AD is a track that plays along side the movie and describes what's going on. 


As for feeding the ducks, you can do that too. If she cannot see, i'd recommend asking her if she wants to throw the bred in the water with you or if she wants you to do it, then just start throwing the bred. If she doesn't know where the water is, you could try directing her by guiding her near the edge of the water and telling her to throw.

34,"You use the word ""supposed"" a lot in your answer. Unfortunately, this isn't a scenario in which you make the right gestures and get an automatic result. If you're thinking about this in terms of what you're supposed to do, you're not going to get very far. There's no ""supposed"" here, only what you do and what happens. It's a system, and one that rewards what it sees as valuable. You can choose to be bitter, but better to learn about the system and how to get independence, recognition, and meaning from it.

A few years ago I was fired from a decent job as a paralegal. I'd left another place to join them and the reason I was let go had more to do with the fact that the person training me decided to stay rather than leave than my vision. But at the time, it was a massive blow to my ego and my vision of myself. I think unless you've been through it, and many people haven't, you can't really understand how traumatic being let go and being unemployed can be. It's humiliating. And so I get your frustration and the difficulty of your situation.

With that said, I'll say some things with hindsight that you may or may not find useful and you may or may not be able to internalize right now. The first is that you need to let go of your previous trauma with your last employer to the best of your ability. It sounds like you had a bad experience...I'm sorry that happened to you. But two years is a long time, figure out an internal narrative of what happened that you can live with and put it to bed in your mind. You're moving on and that's behind you.

Next I think you need to look at your situation from the outside, or from the perspective of someone who will hire you. Would you hire yourself? For what position? Why do you think you'd be good at that job? Why do you think you'd be better than the other people who would apply? If your honest answer to that question is that you wouldn't currently hire yourself, that's ok. That was the case for me. But you then need to say ""What do I need to do to get to where I'd be seen as valuable in this position?""

Of the three things you said you did while you weren't working, only one, learning to use a cane, shows an interest in self-improvement and connecting with the wider world. That's bad. If you're spending your time noodling on the internet or consuming media, you're going to become less employable over time, not more employable. Support your partner by supporting yourself. Find something you care about, learn skills, read, and do exercise. Do volunteer, not so you get handed a job but to engage with people. The world isn't a machine where you push buttons and then have money and a house and stable relationships because you did some thing you guessed you were supposed to do. The world is filled with real people and real things happening and you need to treat it that way. Do things that are valuable for other people and you might get something back. It might not be fair, but that's the way it is.

Sincerely I wish you the best of luck.",,,,Amonwilde,,,1509720781,t5_2qpec,t3_7a8obw,t1_dpaddr5,2,1512086854,0,0,dpah2yp,Blind,,,,,

42,"Sorry this happened to you.

I have missing segments of vision as well as poor overall acuity. Over the last year or two one segment in particular has gotten large. There is definitely a sensation I'd associate with it, not like pain but more like some kind of subconscious mental aggravation, like my brain is frustrated that it can't see that part. Kind of akin to losing a tooth.

While this stinks it does seem that if your vision is stable your brain will get used to the missing patch and sort of work around it. In fact, you may not even ""see"" the missing part, your brain will kind of even fill that part in sometimes. It takes awhile, though, and sometimes the ability of your brain to ignore that hole can be jostled out and the sensation of loss returns.

I'd recommend not thinking about it to the extent that's possible and just let your brain carve out some new pathways that will let you deal with it, which takes time. You'll also pick up some new behaviors, like holding your head in a new position while walking or driving. This all comes without your conscious effort but it does take some time, usually months.

This creates an interesting design decision. I thought about having it spell each word automatically, but my wife said that would be condescending. What do you think?

Another important design decision is around the word re-key process. Having users re-key the words is critical, for sure, to confirm that they were captured correctly. Breadwallet reveals your seed words and then makes you type them all back in on a separate screen, where you can no longer ""see"" the original list (thus proving that you wrote them down). Trezor goes a step further, prompting you to enter all of the words in a random order after they're given (which is done to prevent any malware from intercepting the original seed word order, which adds a layer of security). For this new accessible wallet, assuming it's being run as intended (i.e. on a Raspberry Pi that has never been and will never be connected to the internet), the whole random order re-key stuff shouldn't be needed. So part of me says it should be fine to just ask people to enter each seed word right then and there after hearing it... but technically that invites the possibility that someone might just rush through the seed word process and skip the writing down part, and I feel like it's important to do everything possible to ""force"" people to make their offline backup of their seed phrase, since that's critical to keeping their funds safe in the event that the Raspberry Pi blows up or is stolen.

So at this point I'm thinking the safest and most thorough process would look like this:

1. Provide each word and its spelling, since the BIP39 word list evidently does include homophones. Offer the option to repeat as needed.

2. After all 12 words are provided, ask for them to be re-keyed to confirm that they were captured successfully. I'd probably do this one at a time, and in order, versus making people enter all 12 words at once only to find out that they had a typo in the 2nd word and then had to repeat the whole thing.

54,"I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I was diagnosed with MMD about 4 years ago, and it's really difficult to know what to expect since there's no way of anticipating when a bleed may happen or what lasting impact it may have. I haven't kept close track, but over the past 4 years I've had 12 or 13 shots total between both eyes, which is a bit more frequent then most people with MMD. I've had one bad bleed in each eye which has left central vision distortion from the scarring on the macula. My visual acuity with corrective lenses is 20/140 in my left eye, but still 20/40 in my right eye. I still drive during the day, but I stick to places that I'm familiar with since reading street signs can be difficult. 

The injections to treat macular degeneration only started being used about 10 years ago, so for those of us who are being diagnosed at a younger age, there's really not much information available to know what the long term outcomes may be, along with the fact that you can go over a year without a bleed and have things be normal, and then a day later have one that severely damages your vision. Or one that doesn't leave behind any scarring. I know that's not entirely helpful, but as another poster mentioned, myopic macular degeneration really doesn't have much research done on it, and most resources I've found just include it as a footnote when talking about regular macular degeneration. I do believe your doctor is correct and in the majority of cases, people with MMD receive injections very infrequently and can go a long time without having an episode. And you learn to adjust to the changes bleeds do cause to your vision.   If you're on Facebook, there is a group that I'm in called  ""Fight macular and myopic degeneration"" that has been helpful, both in asking questions and hearing experiences of those who are also dealing with this, to simply venting frustrations to a group who understand what you're dealing with, since it's hard to explain to others.

After over 3 years mourning my loss of  sight (which I'm not completely done with)  I  found something to spend time on: learning piano.

Even though it's a challenge both for me and for the teacher, I'm learning very fast.

165,"I'm not blind, but I do own a PSVR, so I just booted up Skyrim VR and played with one eye closed for a bit. The graphics understandably suffered a bit in that the loss of some depth perception made objects like grass and bushes to appear more like 2D images than 3D objects, but I imagine that issue is not that dissimilar to real life. In the real world shadowing probably helps our brains process depth. One consequence of VR games' low graphics (to save on processing due to hardware constraints) is shadowing is reduced to basic detail, so you're not going to get a ton of help in that regard. That said, the games are definitely still playable. I can't think of any VR game where you explicitly need the use of both eyes. It's not like any games are drawing one set of images on one eye screen and a different set on the other, that would be a recipe for instant nausea. You'll just have to rotate your head further to see your entire field of view.

166,"This is actually not an easy question to answer, and it depends. Remember that sight is in the brain, not in the eye. For example, hallucinations mean that you see something that isn't actually there, but you're still seeing that thing...it just has no real analog in the external world. Sight can't really be separated from things like attention and memory, or even the input from other senses.

One woman I know formerly had limited vision and now has no vision, even light perception. However, subjectively she sees colors that she says are very beautiful. When she holds a card from her wallet, she'll say it looks green. Does it actually look green? Yes, because green is in the brain. When electromagnetic radiation reflects off that card, is it within the wavelengths on the human-visible spectrum that we've decided to call green? No. But her brain has hooked up some equipment that she formerly used to perceive radiation in the environment to some of her other senses.

Daniel Kish, who uses active echolocation for navigation, rightly describes what he perceives through sound as sight. That's because all evidence points to his using the same neural equipment that sighted people use for sight. Since sight is in the brain, he sees things through echolocation.

So your question sort of assumes that sight is like a movie or a show, a series of images that, like JPEGs or GIFs, have some objective numeric value. But, really, human experience is the product of a cascading series of links forged and links cut off in the brain. That means that what blind people see is not really black, and it's also not really nothing. The answer is that seeing is really just an abstraction of what's really happening that's useful when discussing most issues day-to-day but which breaks down when you try to talk about something like what blind people see.

204,"Well, if she refuses to take someone’s arm, she would probably really hate the idea of using a cane to help her find obstacles or drop offs. 

There are devices that use sonar to detect objects and then transmit a vibration in to the hand of the user. Check out the Mini Guide from APH. The biggest issue with this kind of device is that it will not detect a drop off, so curbs and stairs can still pose a hazard. 

She may need to focus more on scanning with her eyes. I know that her central vision is going to be her weakness, but if she adds movement to her eyes or head, it will increase what she sees. Try a left to right to left pattern. Then maybe add a downward pendulum motion. It takes practice and training to use these scanning techniques, but they can make a big difference.

I have a lot of different games, but the one I get to play most often is X-Wing (the minis all come pre-painted, so that's a plus. There is pretty big power creep in the game though). 

My mate and I have been playing weekly for over two years now. He went to a regionals event and after that encouraged that we should head along to the various events (fortnightly and monthly tournaments etc). I've been to quite a few now and I've found people are pretty good with it, some more so than others. You just need to make it clear to them. I get my opponent to help me find dice, read the results, move ships etc. We actually just had a team epic tournament on the weekend. My mate did the moving and most of the rolling (to be fair, we were both rolling dreadfully) and conferred on moves (I claim the title of better pilot. Case in point: he ran over one of our Lambdas). We came third (out of eight), so that was pretty cool.

I also went along to a gaming club to play Guild Ball weekly for about three months this year. The guys were also really helpful and helped with moves and counting results etc. I've not been in ages though because I've been lazy. 

Personally Bolt Action is my favourite wargame. For someone who is vision impaired, WWII games are really good because real world uniforms and paint schemes are much simpler than things like Warhammer or Infinity (unless you're doing German splinter camo or something). Basically I use flat colour and inks, I almost never highlight or shadow (I can't tell the different well enough between the shades). One day I'll have to stop of course, but you can keep playing until you're unable to distinguish units and terrain.

By having a middle man that is the employer's  introduction to you,  calling people for you, advocating for you etc. it's starting you off as being different then sighted people and I don't think that helps. There are lots of extremely qualified blind people who deal with discrimination in the job market. You have to try harder, be more qualified, and be able to prove yourself more then the sighted people that you are competing against. If the employer gets the idea that you can't even call them for yourself, why would they think you could effectively do their job.

247,"If your fiancee had said racecar driving, playing baseball, and bird watching, I would have said that he should investigate new interests. But law, math, and woodworking are all entirely possible to pursue without vision. Math may require learning braille, though law probably will not. My brother, who is low vision, just passed the bar and is working as a lawyer, and law is one of the most common careers pursued by the blind. I've also heard of woodworking as something that other blind people enjoy, though my knowledge of the subject is pretty limited.

Sounds like you're already supporting your partner in an effective way. What you're saying is true...there is life after loss of vision and he will be able to do the things he did before. However, your partner may need time to grieve and it may not be until after the worst happens that he can start turning things around. As you seem to understand, his attitude will be crucial. Blind people often succeed and live well, but depression and inaction make that proposition a lot more difficult. Eventually he will have to rise to the occasion to reclaim his life but it may take him time.

I'd have him talk to his current employer and ask for six months rehabilitation leave. That's probably the minimum amount of time he would need to adjust, and it's probably a bit optimistic, but it may work out. If he can, he should start learning screen readers (Voiceover on iOS and NVDA on Windows) as soon as possible as that's one of the main tools used every day. I recommend those platforms because they're the most robust, so even if he uses Android now I'd recommend he buy an iPhone.

Once your partner loses his vision, he should get a mobility instructor and learn to use a white cane. He should also start learning braille since he has an interest in math. In the long term, you might consider lifestyle changes such as moving to a walkable city.

I'm not going to lie--this is going to be tough. But there is life, and good life, after this kind of event if he chooses to seek it.

tv was one of the hard ones. i can't watch things in languages i don't know because i cant see subtitles well enough. but if it's in a language i do know, i just turn it up and i can see sort of vague shapes so i get what's going on. video games are the same.

So the first stage of software like this is human teachers, or other source material that was made by a human at some point.  This is why lots of people have first hand experience of being the human behind the technology. 

As a business idea, paying people long term to do this work would be completely stupid. The technology exists to do what they are doing, and even if they had failed to teach their AI, and resorted to only using humans and lying about it, they will eventually be overtaken by someone doing it for real.  There's apps to recognise buildings, apps that recognise written words, etc etc. It's entirely possible some of the requests end up with a person, but this is to teach the AI new things, or to test it against a human benchmark, or something like that.

However, no screen reader will stop reading when a web page is playing audio.  It can't know that your audio is a voiceover; maybe it's a youtube video, and the user wants to find the pause button.  What many screen readers will do is lower the volume of webpage audio while they're speaking. That way, the user can still hear the screen reader (and thus use her computer) while listening.  And if the user wants to listen to the voiceover, she can always press control to stop the screen reader speech, and then read the alt-text after the voiceover is finished.  After a little thought, I'm sure you'll realize what a bad idea allowing the developer of a website to control when a screen reader is allowed to speak would be; that needs to be entirely up to the user.

295,"Honestly, as one's eyesight changes your worries also change. At one point I was like ""as long as I can read print books, I'll be fine."" My ability to read print went and it was annoying, but you get over things and adapt. After a while, you find other things you can do or which you can better enjoy. Now if I'm in a room where people are watching TV I'm more likely to be ignoring it and listening to something, and that's too bad. But it's also not the end of the world. There are other things, like mobility and using a computer for work, that tend to matter a lot more. So I guess my main answer is, sometimes you're not able to do things the same way you did them before, but life goes on.

With subtitles, on Netflix now you can have them read aloud to you if you have an Apple device, and I've gotten a program called KMPlayer to read out subtitles that are included with videos as text files, like you get in a torrent. But, yes, I'd imagine it's pretty annoying for sighted people. But at least you can still watch on your own or watch with a very tolerant sighted person.

304,"My left eye was damaged from birth. No central vision. Plenty of peripheral vision. My left eye's condition hasn't changed since birth.

My right eye was perfect from birth.

When I was 25 I started getting active incidents in my right eye a little to the top and left of center. I've had about one incident a year in the 13 yeaers since then in roughly the same spot, but only 3 of them were serious enough to cause vision loss. Right now I have lost vision in the top left up to the center, but I can still read and watch movies etc with the vision in the 3/4 of vision that is unaffected. But I see everything obstructed. like looking at stuff with a BB floating in front of my eye.

I don't know what triggered the reactivation. The doctors I've spoken to say they're not sure, but toxo generally gets active when the immune system is weak for any reason. But there's nothing specific in my health that they can identify. I'm generally in good health for my age with no other issues. The thing about toxo is that the parasite lives in cysts in the retina and can stay dormant for decades but then activate.

I'm sorry to hear about your son. The only advice I can offer is to look into prophylactic care. There is an anti-biotic that can keep flare ups from happening. I have been unable to take it because I'm allergic, which is why I have yearly flareups.

Also, teach your son to know the warning signs. A new attack usually starts with a pulsing in distinct areas of vision. It looks kind of like an animated hurricane image on a TV satellite map that fades in and out with a shimmery effect.

With a bad attack, it gets worse until it feels like you just looked into the sun, where there's a dark after-image obscuring your vision.

Whenever the swelling hits hard, you also get hundreds of spot floaters and darkening of vision. It looks like hundreds of seeds floating in front of you.

333,"Update: After some extensive research, I've found that the BitcoinJS library is going to be perfect for this. It's the same library used by the blockchain.info site and Trezor's web interface, so it's solid. It can run on the Pi with Node.js and be used from the command line.

So far I have a simple command line script that can generate a new hierarchical deterministic wallet private key and its associated mnemonic seed phrase. I need to weave this into an interactive prompt to establish the ideal process for issuing secure mnemonic seeds, which is to provide each word individually and then confirm that they were captured correctly. Since I'm building this with accessibility in mind, I also want to make it easy for the screen reader to repeat words as needed and things like that.

Once the wallet creation process is complete, then it'll be time to tackle the transaction signing stuff. It's definitely going to be a little more fiddly than it would be with something like a Trezor, but at least it will be secure and completely accessible. The biggest hurdle is getting a destination Bitcoin address onto the Pi in a reliable and accurate way. Nobody ever wants to have to type an address by hand, so I'm thinking that a simple companion process can help. That process would involve storing a destination address in a file on a USB drive, and the Pi being able to read the address in that file. Then the transaction can be confirmed via interactive prompt, and the signed transaction can be stored on the same USB drive (where it can then be transferred back to a live machine and broadcast). Similarly, the wallet address generated on the Pi could be transferred to the USB drive so it can easily be moved onto a live machine, copied/pasted, etc.

The final piece of the puzzle will be exactly what you suggested: getting the Pi to boot up to the command line with an active screen reader. It'll also provide some simple instructions on the commands (creating a new wallet, restoring from a seed, and creating a transaction).

I'm hoping to create a ""rough cut"" of this soon, and I'll host the image for testing in GitHub. In addition, I'm carefully documenting everything that I'm doing (starting from a base Raspbian distribution) so anyone can effectively build the same setup on their own without needing to trust anyone.

366,"Thanks for writing and sharing your perspective.

Funny enough, I always had a very different feeling about the world and about vision loss. I was never the kind of person to look at sunsets and think about beauty. I always thought, and think, about the world in terms of information and abstract concepts. For me, going blind has been about getting that information in different ways. It seems to me that it would be hard to be into beauty in and of itself and then have to deal with blindness. People generally don't do a great job describing things and so I think you'd have to just find beauty through other senses. Music comes to mind, obviously.

Thank you, I always like to hear how people deal with their blindness, as long as it's productive. You seem to have made some peace with it and I congratulate you.",,,,Amonwilde,,,1511824402,t5_2qpec,t3_7fz3k3,t3_7fz3k3,5,1513068017,0,0,dqffv2b,Blind,,,,,

I'm actually waiting on a referral from my GP for a new eye doctor. That's both because of that visit and because to my knowledge she has either retired or will be retiring soon. 

Thanks for your response. I wish I had a doctor like yours. He sounds great. ",,,,BeardedJerry,,,1511475130,t5_2qpec,t3_7f0yk6,t1_dq93e2t,3,1512942348,0,0,dq93t0s,Blind,,,,,
