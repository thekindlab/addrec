1,"I am told I was born with sight, but already had problems and lost it very quickly so I have no memory of seeing anything.

I perceive some amount of light in one of my eyes, but this is very unreliable and faint, and it's more the quick change in light than light itself. I can't tell you at a given moment if it's light or dark but I can tell you if suddenly light increases. This has no direction or colour or anything, it's just a vague sensation.

The other eye perceives absolutely nothing. It's not black or darkness (how do I know, because it doesn't feel like darkness does on the other eye, in fact it feels like nothing). The only way I managed to get through to sighted people about this, is asking them what do they see with their toes, or earlobes.

10,"I had my left eye removed when I was 17 due to pain, but I'd been blind in it since birth, so for me it was a no-brainer. However, after dealing with only a few months of glaucoma issues in my remaining eye, at age 30, I can't imagine dealing with that for years/as a teenager. The constant back and forth and the pain and the emotional ups and downs of it all would be awful.

But you know how much of that you can/are willing to tolerate. Either decision to remove the eye or wait is perfectly valid. 

There is something to be said for being able to put all of the hassle and pain and worry and fear behind you so you can start to move on. Even when the outcome isn't what you wanted going into it, having some closure can allow you to start healing and adapting emotionally/mentally. 

But at the same time... vision. Really, this comes down to you deciding if the vision you have in the eye now is beneficial enough to fight to keep it.

It's not a decision you have to make right away, though. You can keep fighting a while longer and then say ""enough"" whenever you want to, so don't stress out over making the decision. You'll know when the time is right, if it comes to that.

43,"Keep in mind that a character is more than someone with vision loss. He's his own person, who happens to have vision loss. I often see characters who are almost completely centered around their vision loss, and know nothing else about then. What do they like to read? What do they like to drink? What are their aspirations and goals?

Perhaps they have a focus on their vision loss (maybe they want revenge on someone the person who blinded them or something). But what are they doing about that? Just sitting and thinking? Working out like a maniac and shooting up steroids? etc.

When someone loses their vision, they don't automatically get better hearing, as people assume. What happens is people learn to use their hearing better. But that takes time and practice, it isn't instantaneous. Over time, though people can hear how sounds echo off walls and identify hallways, doorways and sometimes smaller objects like poles. Same with feeling, it takes time to build up the sense of touch (For example, the 5 Braille textbooks that my organization uses, the first book doesn't even have Braille.

88,"Because the cause of vision loss is in the processing portion (brain) rather than the sensory portion (eyes), it makes things a bit more complicated. It isn't always just the field loss, there could be other effects. For example, one of my clients had brain surgery and got CVI. He had severe trouble seeing cars.... unless they were red. For some reason, he could easily idenify red cars coming towards him, but not other cars. He may also like flashing lights or similiar effects (imagine sequins in the sunlight). 

One common thing with that kind of vision loss (depending on exactly where the damage took place) is hemispatial neglect. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemispatial_neglect

In those cases, the brain itself doesn't percieve one side of things. They may eat only half a pizza, or only dress half of themselves. If you notice anything like that (it is usually quite notiacble), you should talk to your doctor about it.

With his left peripheral field missing, you may notice he bumps a lot into things on his left side (corners of the wall, chairs, coffee tables, etc).

99,"The thing with vision impairment is that it is very easy to conceal. Just this passed weekend I had the check out chick at Coles (Australian supermarket chain) say to me ""If I didn't see your badge, I wouldn't know you couldn't see"". I don't use my cane when I do my grocery shopping (one hand is already taken for my grandma trolley, so I don't want the other occupied with a cane), and I don't always wear a ""Vision Impaired Badge"", but as her comment illustrates, without these things, nobody would know.

And I don't think it is unreasonable that they wouldn't know, or that they wouldn't think ""oh, he must be vision impaired/blind because he bumped into me/can't tell where the EFTPOS machine is/can't follow where I'm indicating something is"". The article states that there are two million people ""registered blind"" in the UK, which has an estimated population of 65 million. The chance that any one person has experience interacting with someone who is blind or vision impaired is quite low. In addition people who are not totally blind still appear, for all intents and purposes, as fully sighted (provided they do not have a cane, badge, or dog) unless you have had that closer interaction with them. 

I do not think it is unreasonable then that a bouncer might take a potential patron aside because they appear to be spaced out with unfocused eyes, especially if you lack anything that clearly states you are vision impaired. It's their job to ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable night, and to promote the responsible service of alcohol through vetting those who've already had their fill. If they don't do that, then their employer is at risk, and likewise the patron in question, and other patrons depending on the first patron's disposition. 

If you do not have a cane, badge, or dog that clearly shows you have vision impairment, how is it the bouncer can tell that your unfocused gaze is due to vision impairment as opposed to inebriation? They can't.

That's not to say greater awareness needs to be raised around vision impairment. Think in comparison to hearing loss. Hearing loss is just as concealable as vision impairment, perhaps more so. In any interaction, the person with hearing loss simply says ""Sorry, can you repeat that, I have hearing loss"" and without hesitation they will. But if you say ""I'm sorry, could take my hand and place it where you are pointing, I have vision impairment"", the person is likely to find the request somewhat strange. The idea that vision exists on a continuum like hearing is a foreign concept, especially a continuum on which you might have vision loss but not use aids like a cane or dog. 

So I don't get annoyed when people don't understand vision impairment. I do not find it unreasonable the majority will treat you as the majority is. If you look like a completely sane able bodied person, people will treat you as a completely sane able bodied person until you advise them otherwise. To me, stories like this reinforce the importance of having a cane, even if it is only an identification cane. 

Of course, that can lead to new and exciting forms of interaction with bouncers or airline staff - like when they try to confiscate your cane because ""it could be used as a weapon"" (no joke, true stories).

If you want to help him with gardening the key things (as with much design for people) are affordances, constraints and feedback.

The stings laid to to mark the edges and other lines of the garden are a good example of **constraints**.

**Affordances** are anything that make it easier to do the right action, for example a water can is easier than a hose to put the right amount of water in the right place.

**Feedback** tells you when you have done the right or wrong thing. Having plants with distinct leaf shapes or textures will make it easier to tell them apart from weeds. Plants that produce sweetly scented flowers will let you know when your garden is growing well.

Think about these design principles when helping your grandfather with gardening or anything else.


The next thing to remember is that a blind person can do many more things when a sighted person works with them as part of a team.

109,"Please do!  If there's anything I can do to help with testing, just let me know.  I got as far as setting up and configuring a pi, only to discover I couldn't get any of the available Linux screen readers to run. I do have a pi that I use VIA SSH, but that means connecting it to the Internet, thus removing all the security advantages.  So I don't know how accessible any of the Linux wallets are at the moment.  I suspect making improvements there is going to be the first task, if we go with option 1.  The second, of course, will be finding an accessible way to broadcast transactions from the internet-connected machine.  These days, 99 percent of blind folks run either Windows or OS X, because that's where desktop access is best. So we'll need a bitcoin client that works both on the pi and on Win/Mac I guess.  I know Copay is accessible on Windows; is there something that can interoperate with it that will run on the pi?  I know copay itself doesn't.  I really have no information on how offline transactions are intended to even work; it's not something I can do at the moment. :-)

Option 2 is a much better option. However, I have no idea what type of chip the Trezor's firmware is written for, so that could turn into a huge job.  It's probably better to focus on just getting something that works, for now.  If we can, ideally, create an image that can be written to an SD card and will boot-up talking, and will work with some windows or mac client to broadcast transactions, that's a big win as it is.

112,"Your medical situation sounds almost exactly like mine when I was a teenager. I was born with glaucoma, had the cataracts, over thirty surgeries etc. etc. etc. I also had an eye that stopped doing me any good and was only a source of pain. I can’t give you any perfect or easy answers, but I will pretend like I’m getting the chance to tell my teenage self what I wish I could have known back then.

First, I would imagine that your feelings and worries are totally focused on the state of your eyes right now. This is very understandable, every time you are talking about your eyes with a doctor or family member the conversation is going to be about if your eyes are going to get worse, if the pain is going to go away, and what can be done. I was in the exact same boat back in the day. The number one thing I wish I had known back then was that I should not have been focusing on my eyeballs. Of course, it is impossible to keep from focusing on pain, and I have no words of wisdom for my teenage self about pain.

I’ll go through what ended up happening with my vision and how the experience brought me to where I am today. When I was 15 My one eye had not worked for a long time, and I was spending lots of time in dark rooms with the pain. My doctor removed the eye and I was better off without it. Of course, that eye may have been in a worse state then your bad eye, my doctor was fine with taking it out, and once it was gone I had no regrets. A few years and surgeries later, my vision in my good eye had become worse and worse. When I was 17 I started walking with a long white cane, and I lost all my vision when I was 18. Yes, when I first lost my site it was a little bit difficult, but I was fresh out of high school, I had a life to live, and no tools or understanding of how to live it. I spent 9 months in a training center for blind adults getting a crash course on all the skills I needed to live a productive life. I was brand new to braille, navigating cities with a white cane, using a computer as a blind person, cooking and cleaning as a blind person, etc. I learned all of this, and much more, and went straight to college, where I graduated ahead of schedule. I am now 25, I have a good job, a good home and a wife and cat that I love.

When I look back at the first 18 years of my life, with its countless eye surgeries, I have one major regret. I really wish me and my family had spent less time fighting to keep my vision, and more time preparing me for losing it. I do not know a lot about glaucoma, but everyone I know who had it from a young age lost their vision sooner or later. I am not saying this is true for you, your doctor would know more about that then I would. However, if someone has a good chance of losing vision, they need to be prepared for loosing vision. If ten percent of the resources and effort that went to trying to save my broken eyes had been spent to teach me braille growing up, I would be a much better braille reader. If conversations and prayers and thoughts had been aimed at my living a good life, not saving my vision, it may have felt less like a failure when I lost my vision.

All I’m trying to say is, you do not have to “spend every day with the never-ending worry that one day everything you worked for will be impossible”. However, it is largely up to you to keep that worry from becoming a reality. You need to ask yourself two questions, what are you working for, and how are you working towards it. It is true that there are some jobs that will be hard to do if you have low vision. You mentioned medical school, and yes being a doctor is one of those jobs that will be difficult; I do know of at least one blind doctor, but there are not many. If you are extremely passionate about a medical career you will have to make some hard decisions about if it’s worth pursuing a medical degree. I am not saying that kind of decision will be easy, but it is your decision to make. Vision is a tool to be used in the pursuit of your goals. It can be a useful tool, and not having it could keep you from some goals. However, if your focused is on your vision, you are focusing on tools, not goals.

You say you are feeling hopeless. This is very understandable and natural. Most of the millions of people, who go through what you’re going through, feel that at some point. The question is, what is your hope. If your hoping to both keep your vision and escape the pain, then yes you might have little hope. If your hoping to escape the pain, I believe that can happen. It sounds like you may be at the point soon of removing the one eye; that might go a long way to improving the pain. If your hope is to become a doctor, your hope may be uncertain, but let me say this. Everyone is different, but when I was sixteen I was in no position to know what I was going to do with the rest of my life. At first, I wanted to run a skateboard shop. When I was 17 I wanted to go into music. When I started college, I wanted to be a social worker; by the time I graduated I had changed my major five times, from social work, to mass media, to teaching, to creative writing, and finally to communications. When I first graduated I worked as a social media manager for a nonprofit, I briefly worked in radio, and now I work in I T. Some people know exactly what they want to do from a young age and they never change their plans, but if you do change your career plans you will be in the majority, not the minority.

Now for the second question, how are you working to ensure that one day everything you worked for will not be impossible? Have you asked your doctor to tell you, in an honest way, what you are most likely facing as far as further vision loss, pain etc. I think I had a good doctor, but I wish we had more conversations about what was going to likely happen to my vision. Have you asked what the end goal of keeping your bad eye is? Does your doctor think it is going to provide something that is worth the pain, or is it just about maintaining the status quo? It’s good that you are reaching out to other blind people. I will say that for me the laser surgeries did often hurt my vision, but on the other hand, I am not in pain any more. Have you researched how your vision might impact what your goals are? Have you googled people who have low vision in medical school, have you read about what fields of medicine might be the most practical for someone who has low vision? Have you considered fields that are related to medicine, such as occupational therapy, chiropractic’s etc. these jobs are definitely done by low vision and blind people. 

I’m sorry, I don’t know enough about vision stats to know what 20-400 looks like for you, is your vision impacting things in your daily life? If so, how are you working to overcome _this? Do you use magnification soft where on your computer? Do you have any experience with screen reader programs, such as NVDA or JAWS? Have you ever been taught how to use a long white cane?

I’m glad that you have a counselor. What you’re going through is hard, and I understand that, trust me. I hope I have not sounded too harsh, I am just trying to be honest while offering some light at the end of the tunnel. Please feel free to PM me about anything you might need to talk about.

Does Cataract Surgery Cure Floaters?

By Vance Thompson, MD

Cataract surgery restores vision that has been diminished due to clouding of the eye's crystalline lens, which is located directly behind the pupil.

Because vitreous floaters occur in the posterior part of the eye (the vitreous body is located in the large cavity in the back of the eyeball, between the lens and the retina), removing a cataract and replacing it with a clear intraocular lens (IOL) will not diminish the appearance of vitreous floaters.

In fact, if you have vitreous floaters, the increased clarity of your vision after cataract surgery may make the floaters even a bit more visible.
Artist simulation of what spots and floaters look like in the eye.

If you see large spots and floaters, treatment may be possible.

Vitreous floaters are common. Most floaters are relatively small and are only a minor annoyance under certain lighting conditions.

If you are bothered by large vitreous floaters after cataract surgery, ask your eye doctor or cataract surgeon to refer you to an ophthalmologist who specializes in the treatment of floaters.

In some cases, a procedure called laser vitreolysis can safely and effectively remove large floaters that interfere with comfortable vision.     ",,,,homerq,,,1507433960,t5_2qpec,t3_74w3as,t3_74w3as,1,1509625067,0,0,do2aiza,Blind,,,,"According to this article, it may make floaters a bit sharper

Its hard at times, but i know that i still have value as a person and that my eyes don't diminish that value.

Also, it kind of makes me uncomfortable that there is such an emphasis on ""the cure.""

People tend to assume that we'll never be whole until our eyes can be fixed, and though it would be nice to see, most of us can do alright without it.

My son does sometimes neglect his left, I have seen him not eat the left half of his dinner, and when I turned the plate around, say ‘oh, I forgot!’, I think this is worse when he is tired.
He also does tend to crash into things a lot. As he is two he is a whirlwind of energy and likes to run full pelt around the house, and I think he relies on his familiarity with the layout to not crash, as if things move he will do.
I have access to a very small ‘sensory room’ at the local children’s centre, which seems very much based on the snoezelen room. I have only used it the once. While my son enjoyed it I was unsure as to how much help it was for him. I may give it another go! I haven’t heard of any snoezelen pools or similar where I am, but his physiotherapist has recommended hydrotherapy before for his physical rehabilitation and so I may ask her if she knows somewhere that takes the more multi sensory approach, thank you.

I don’t know when my son developed the Visual Impairment, it could have been from birth with his stroke, or I wonder if it was a year ago when he developed epilepsy. His first seizure left him with total left sided weakness which he hadn’t experienced before, and he has had to fully relearn the use of his left side to sit, walk etc and now working mostly on the use of his left hand.

169,"Maybe or maybe not. The important thing to remember is that raised shapes aren't experienced visually, so it can create quite a different impression. With your eyes, you can look at something, and get an overview of the entire thing quickly. Touch is much more granular, and lends itself to a more detailed, and slower, experience of an object.  Also, colour and texture are quite different experiences, as far as I can tell.  So things that work visually may not work tactilely.  Also, tactile information is just processed differently. And I might not have the context to recognize things that would be obvious to someone visually. Statues and figurines are a good example. I can never identify them unless someone tells me what to look for, first.  Then I can usually pick out the unique/interesting parts.  But even though a figurine is perfectly obvious visually, I've never scene the character in question, and so touching it just doesn't draw any obvious connections for me.  And after I touch a figure of, say, a famous movie character, it doesn't change the way I imagine that character in my head.  That figure and that character just aren't strongly connected for me, even after I've been told what it is.

I suspect that as Bitcoin becomes mainstream, other wallet developers will do the same. All the currently existing web wallets (blockchain, bitgo, coinbase, etc) are all accessible.  

The big challenge is hardware; because unlike software accessibility, it has a much higher added cost.  In software, a developer can just fix a bug and recompile. For hardware, the design has to include much more complicated components like a speaker, and some system capable of generating spoken numbers (tts or recorded speech).

If the robot holds the cane stationary, then the things can impact the person from the sides (think of chairs, benches, mail carts, doors, etc). 

If the robot moves with the cane tip.... well, let's assume the robot is only one pound. Attach that to a 54"" pole (the average height of canes for the population).

I used to be a graphic designer myself years ago (obviously long before my sight loss).

If you don't mind, let me give you a piece of advice...  Don't get carried away with ideas like Embossing or using fancy inks like gold/metallic.

The company owner of the place I used to work for ended up putting a ban on hiring any designer with a recent degree.  It seemed like the trend at universities was to teach the various aspects of design and completely ignore the other part ofthe process - the production of that design.  

New hires with fresh degrees would be full of enthusiasm, but have no idea about how their designs would affect cost or the processes used to create them and frequently go way over budget because they had only been taught about their narrow part in the process.

Dies for cutting or embossing are expensive and if it's a fairly small run (less than 1000) can add a fair chunk to the end cost for the client.

Same with metallic dies - they look good, but also add a substantial cost due to the rollers in the press needing a complete thorough cleaning before &amp; after use.  The printer at my old place had to remove the rollers from the Heidelberg to do this.

Embossing/Cutting can be useful in it's appropriate place, but doing it purely to give a tactile feel to the visually impaired doesn't really give any extra info to that person and unless there is a decent number of visually impaired in your target demographic, would only add cost.

For transparency's sake, I have the device because I've been in and around the accessible tech industry for a while now. I didn't use the crowdfunding, and unfortunately  their policies don't allow for returns, except in very specific person-to-person situations. 
I'm also not expecting anywhere near the device's cost - and I'm unfotunately not at a financial place where I'd be able to simply donate it, which I wish I was. The way I'm hoping to pay it forward is to at least help someone get a device which can actually help them for less than the cost eSight wants to charge them for. 

To eSight's credit, they are working on the bureaucratic end of things to get funding programs in place (government/insurance/etc.) to make the device cheaper, so I'm not trying to demonize them here.

But that, plus continuing volunteer work etc, is limited by being in a nursing home because I assume he can't come and go as he pleases? If he can, then I'm sure you could find him some suitable volunteer work.

Audioeye frequently makes it more difficult for screen readers, magnification (zoomtext) and dragon naturally speaking users to access Audioeye enabled websites.

Blind people, however, tend to have more variance, even amongst the people that identify with the ""blind"" label.

For example, many blind people are very proud of their blindness, even to the point of viewing it as a gift or blessing from their particular God.

On the other hand, many blind people would jump at the opportunity to be cured. Many people will raise tens of thousands of dollars for any attempted improvement, even at the risk of losing more vision.

Yet, still, there are people who would turn down any and every offer of a cure. They're happy with who they are, and how they are, and wouldn't want the extra stress of vision, and the learning that would come with that.

Basically, some blind people resent the idea of being cured, and some people jump with joy at the thought of it.

An immediate solution would be to use an existing Bitcoin client that generates private keys and run that on the Pi.

This would emulate the current functionality of hardware wallets, though not as smoothly as what you get with the plug-and-play of a Ledger or Trezor.

A more challenging (but worthwhile) approach would be to make use of the Trezor's open source firmware to adapt its functionality such that you get the true plug-and-play benefits, just through a Pi with the proper accessibility in place.

I can start to explore the first option on my own and see what works with respect to both accessibility and simplity (i.e. the minimum number of steps to take to sign a transaction and broadcast it).

Less issues, much more well designed and functional screen reader and VI options, XCode is accessible, as are VIM and emacs using Terminal or iTerm2,  and you can dual boot it with Windows if you absolutely have to do so. I was a Mac and Windows power user since the 80's, and just prefer the Mac overall. Really happy that I can still use them after losing my vision, and after learning VoiceOver, Jaws, and NVDA, VoiceOver is just superior in my opinion. Also depends on what type of coding you want to get into. Practically all startups use Macs, especially if they are concerned with iOS apps, so if you want to get into tech, Macs have become the better option. Web coding can be done on any system, but in my opinion and experience, MacOS is prone to much less problems than Windows, is easier to troubleshoot and fix, the experience and interaction amongst all iDevices is completely integrated so nothing is ambiguous,  and they have much better security overall, plus Apple is much faster at fixing and patching security issues as they are found. 

Yes, they are pricey, but they will last you for a long time and are good investments due to the overall versatility of the systems.  Why not go for a refurbished 2015 MacBook Pro?

1 - Download a fresh copy of the windows 32 bits (to be on the safe side regarding your windows architecture) and unzip the zip you've downloaded, named musi-win32.zip.   

2 - After unziping the downloaded file, a folder claled musi-win32 will appear where you unzipped it. Enter this folder and open the file ""musi-touch.exe"".   

The game should, at this point, open up and a female narrator will explain the fundamentals of the game. 


Some problems yet not solved:
1 - There is no introductory levels at this build of the game yet. The first level is already a challenge composed of 13 tones. getting this combination right will point you to the next level, with no need to press any key. The narrator will inform you when the next level start.   
2 - The game has currently only six levels. And after the end of it, you will be automatically transferred to the main menu and the welcome info should play after the victory message.


If you do try it out again and if it work fine, please, I would love any feedback, specially problems that you find, so I can add it to the already existent list of bugs to be solved.

##Action Point

Pokémon Go was a huge fad for millions of people around the world. Hordes of trainers would go outside each day to catch new Pokémon, power them up, and then train to take over the nearest gym with their teammates. Teams had to be on guard for attacks from rival trainers seeking to take over gyms. 

Life involves always being on alert and training for what Satan may throw at you next. 

\&gt;How can you ""power up"" your walk with Christ, so you are better prepared for difficult times?

280,"Very rare.

Many people have regular toxo. In some countries where it's hot and damp, up to 90% of the population might have it and feel nothing as long as their immune systems are healthy.

But ocular infection requires a mother-to-child transmission in utero. In utero can, even more rarely, also cause problems like swollen heads...but the primary issue is scarring on the back of the retina from swelling during active infection phases.

The major problem with toxo in the retina is that the infection NEVER GOES AWAY. It goes through cycles of activity and cysts of dormant parasites will remain embedded in the retina between active periods. Once a cyst is established, there is no way to remove it. Sometimes the cysts don't activate for decades (as with me) Sometimes it starts activating and then keeps activating every year for a decade (as with me). A major risk is for the active parasite to colonize new areas of the retina setting up new cysts there.

As I said, there is no cure. No real treatment even. You can only use an antibiotic prophylactic to prevent activation from the cysts. 

I hear it's effective, but I'm allergic to the antibiotic, so I'm not able to benefit. I'm in the middle of trying an alternate antibiotic prophylactic, but it seems only marginally effective.",,,,ImamBaksh,,,1507783779,t5_2qpec,t3_75mvga,t1_do8vxip,2,1509753164,0,0,do94aei,Blind,,,,,

284,"Yes, “blind pride”, or something that is equivalent to “death pride”, is a thing. Let me just start by saying there is no simple right or wrong way to look at blindness or disability. As previous commenters have illustrated, there is a wide variety of perspectives around this kind of thing in the blind community. Lots of blind people have pragmatic reasons for not wanting sight, but people who express a truly congruent perspective to “death pride” are probably the minority in the blind community.

Your question is very interesting, and to truly consider it we must compare the medical model of disability to the social model of disability. The medical model of disability is what most people are familiar with, and it is currently hegemony for sighted and blind people alike. Basically, the medical model of disability sees blindness, or any other disability, as an inherent problem to fix. This is an understandable viewpoint for doctors, because it is their job to “fix” disability. On the other hand, the social model of disability sees disability as a social identity, similar to race, gender, etc. For this model the problems of disability are primarily outward issues with society, such as discrimination and ignorance.

In order to better understand these two models, it might be helpful to relate them to how people viewed race in the 19th century. Back then many people would argue that some races were inherently inferior. Such people might look at poverty and low literacy rates as proof that a groups racial makeup is a biological problem. For our flawed comparison, this biological view of race is similar to the medical model of disability. On the other hand, the viewpoint of race, which has thankfully become hegemony, approaches race as a social construct. People who share this perspective argue that issues such as poverty and low literacy rates are results of societal forces, not inherent shortcomings of racial groups. I just want to make it clear that this comparison is simply meant to help explain the two models of disability, I am by no means trying to say that doctors etc. are comparable to racists.

I’m sorry for that long-winded lecture on disability studies, I just think it’s a key element to the question of blind pride. I believe what you are describing as blind pride is an extreme believe in the social model of disability. In other words, there would be no problem with being blind if our society was designed with blind people in mind, and there was zero ignorance and discrimination. I know this believe exists, because I use to strongly hold it myself, and I attended a training center where it was taught. I lost my sight when I was 18 and I received training at an NFB training center. After this experience, I was an extreme believer in the social model of disability, and I was a very proud blind person. However, in recent years I have become more of a moderate when it comes to the two models of disability; my own current thinking is not very relevant to the question of whether or not blind pride is a thing.

The bottom line is, yes there are people who have “blind pride”, people who believe there is no inherit issue with blindness. Most people, however, are somewhere in between the medical model and the social model.

If you are interested in strong examples of “blind pride, check out the National Federation of the Blind. The NFB is a large organization, who’s members have a wide array of beliefs, but the Federations official perspective is full of “blind pride”; I would point at the recorded speeches from https://nfb.org/banquet-speeches as rhetorical examples of “blind Pride”.

How well do screen readers and such work in virtual machine environments?

Because, you know, if you love working with a Mac because you like MacOS better, it’s still possible to virtualise Windows (and your preferred Linux flavour as well) *inside* a fully functional MacOS environment.

It comes at s prize, though. A virtualised Windows setup on top of MacOS forces the laptop to “do the work of two” at the same time, and it’s perhaps not worth the hassle to do it this way if you really *need* Windows software.

That said, have a talk with your school. You *want* to use MacOS because it works better for you.  And maybe you can without trouble. And maybe you need to virtualise Windows for one single course in three years.

You don’t *have* to pull your “I’m legally blind, you have to accommodate my needs”-card, but you can have a talk and see how much of a hassle it is for teachers to adapt for you. It’s probably not as difficult as you may think.

I've re-taught myself how to see a lot of things, and it's actually helped me become better at what I do. (I have a previous post here about how my synesthesia helps.)

You might laugh, but what I've found really helpful are hidden object games on my tablet. They've helped me re-learn how to pick out shapes and distinguish shades of colors. I really, really recommend ""Mirrors of Albion"" because they also add scenes with temporary visual distortion; at first I would dismiss the distortions, but I soon learned the added challenge was helping me. I've even regained a tiny bit of vision in my right eye, which completely shocked my eye doctor!

I miss depth perception more than anything. I was already clumsy, so I really didn't need to make it worse. I've learned that sometimes I have to warn people so they don't come up on my right side; my startle response is no joke!

323,"Reading your experience, I would say that the company appears to have handled the situation very poorly. There's a few different elements at play here though.

Probation period. If a company doesn't think you're up to scratch by the end of the probation period, they let you go. I've never had the experience, but my father has and my understanding is they pretty much can just say ""sorry, we don't think you're up to our standard"" and that's that (note: I'm in Australia). 

Which gets to the first bit of poor management, because they've sat you down to have a serious meeting and pressed you on why you haven't performed (from their perspective). Highlighting lack of experience and training is a good point, and here in Australia that would absolutely be sufficient reason. I'm not a lawyer, but if you went to an Industrial Relations court over unfair dismissal and argued your case based on that, I suspect it would find in your favour. 

On the other hand however, you should have stated the obvious after that. Remember that for most abled-bodied people, disability is taboo. If they bring it up, they feel they must be committing discrimination etc. I don't know your condition or what you were thinking at the time, but I suspect it was something like ""if I admit my vision impairment could be problematic, they'll absolutely have grounds to let me go because visually inspecting properties is a core duty"". The thing is, if that was up front, it makes it even worse that you weren't provided with sufficient training. With sufficient training you would have known ""ok, this is what is required, these are the things I need to identify, these are the challenges I have in doing so because of my sight"". You can then work with your employer to develop strategies to complete your duties to their satisfaction. 

I've said on this sub previously that I usually don't raise my sight with potential employers. Your experience is a very good example of when it is important to raise it with your potential employer/employer, and be properly across the tasks you need to complete - I'm not saying you didn't do your best in this regard, you don't mention this aspect, I just mean as general advice for blind/vision impaired people. 

Finally, I'd advise against seeing a conspiracy in their actions. Maybe it is the case, but no body likes a man (or woman) with a chip on their shoulder. Focus on the aspect of the company's poor management of you as an employee. Learn from that experience and identify strategies for next time (push for more training etc). I'm not sure what the situation in the UK is, and you might have recourse given the way they handled your situation as I mentioned above. I probably wouldn't bother though. 

The problem with any industrial relations dispute is that once it escalates to that level, you aren't going to want to work for the company unless those in management change, and they aren't going to want you to work for them either. The best case scenario is you get some money out of them. But you weren't with them for long, so I suspect you wouldn't have claim to much even if you were successful. 

So it is best to dust yourself off and move on.

Addendum: I wrote all the above and then remembered I actually have a story about where my sight did impact my duties at work (actually, I've two, but this one is relevant. The other is a more amusing one where I almost distributed classified information to members of the public). In university I worked retail at a consumer electronics store. We closed up one Thursday night, but I forgot to bring the bin of $2 Vodafone sim cards inside - I didn't even notice they were out there. Subsequently they were all stolen that night. 

The area manager got involved in the incident (as he should), and I had a meeting with him and my manager from the night. It was my manager who actually brought my sight up and said ""You didn't even see them because of your sight did you, Terry_Pie?"". I responded in the affirmative and said that I didn't even notice them nor did I realize they weren't inside. The area manger nodded and told us both to be more careful next time and the issue was considered closed.

I was just a casual, and any other staff member would have had a written warning at the least, if not having their shifts cut or being dismissed. But by saying ""I didn't see them"" (which wasn't untrue), taking any such action would have been discrimation and I would be protected by law. 

If you had had the experience you did in Australia, if you said ""I'm vision impaired, I didn't see those issues"" and they haven't made reasonable efforts to make your job accessible (i.e. appropriate for you, as mentioned above) and they dismiss you: that's discrimination, and I'd be even more confident an industrial relations court would find in your favour.",,,,Terry_Pie,RP - Legally Blind,,1507765616,t5_2qpec,t3_75qygi,t3_75qygi,4,1509746009,0,0,do8q3ko,Blind,,,blue1,"Reading your experience, I would say that the company appears to have handled the situation very poorly.

If you're doing a presentation, say what's on your slides without making a big deal out of it. (You should be doing that anyway.) If you're at a restaurant, you can say things like ""I think I'm going to have the blah, but the blah and blah look good,"" which can give people an out if they haven't looked up the menu beforehand.

Anyway, relaxing and not being weird is the most important thing, then after that learn what's helpful (if anything) and do it without making a big deal out of it. If you don't get to that second part that's fine too.","[{'start': 274, 'end': 282, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 202, 'end': 210, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 187, 'end': 195, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

329,"Yeah, thank you for that, you've got the second guess correct. I do actually have medical issues, one of my conditions affects my cognitive functions and that may have had something to do with being uncertain about my question, I don't know, I just genuinely didn't know the answer and I didn't want to make assumptions about it. I just wanted to learn. Hurts being called an idiot though, but then again you're not the first person to insult my intelligence. One of the perks of having medical issues I suppose.
