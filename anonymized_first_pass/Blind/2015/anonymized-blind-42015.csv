I meet with my O&amp;M specialist once every few weeks and I am coming close to completing my training fully.

If you don't have something like Rehabilitative Services for the Blind you can look for private organizations (I have two in my area).

My caseworker at RSB made sure I got the training I need, she also pointed me to another organization which provided me with over 5,000 dollars in low vision technology including a desktop CCTV, iPad, and handheld video magnifier.  These are all things that I wouldn't have been able to afford by myself.  Luckily there are resources, you just have to seek them out.

Back to the cane, I really enjoy the confidence it gives me.  People make room for you and you don't get the frustration from people in public.  Part of the problem is that just because you are visually impaired and prone to running into things does not necessarily mean you look like you have that problem to the public.  The cane makes your disability visible which is good for a lot of reasons.  The one I like the most is the not getting in hassled part, however it is also very important for safety.  It is a very visible warning to drivers that you are visually impaired and may not see them and it has gotten me out of a few situations where I didn't hear a car coming due to the noise level of my surrounding.  If for no other reason than that I will not leave the house without a cane in my hand.  

Beyond the warning it gives, you just won't run into stuff as much and that is a fantastic perk :)  If you can find an organization that will train you for free they will probably also provide you with a cane for free.  If you can't find one, I don't think it would be impossible to train yourself on the basics.  It isn't exactly rocket science and if you needed guidance I could PM you some basic techniques.

Back to the cane, I really enjoy the confidence it gives me.  People make room for you and you don't get the frustration from people in public.  Part of the problem is that just because you are visually impaired and prone to running into things does not necessarily mean you look like you have that problem to the public.  The cane makes your disability visible which is good for a lot of reasons.  The one I like the most is the not getting in hassled part, however it is also very important for safety.  It is a very visible warning to drivers that you are visually impaired and may not see them and it has gotten me out of a few situations where I didn't hear a car coming due to the noise level of my surrounding.  If for no other reason than that I will not leave the house without a cane in my hand.  

Beyond the warning it gives, you just won't run into stuff as much and that is a fantastic perk :)  If you can find an organization that will train you for free they will probably also provide you with a cane for free.  If you can't find one, I don't think it would be impossible to train yourself on the basics.  It isn't exactly rocket science and if you needed guidance I could PM you some basic techniques.  Canes are cheap ($20-$30), I like <PERSON> canes, they are very durable and offer customization for your comfort (different tips, lengths, materials, etc.)  Let me know if you have any other questions :)  Good luck!","[{'start': 2396, 'end': 2404, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 62, 'end': 72, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

And they may not even look, having tried so-called text-based games that sighted friends have told them might be accessible (NetHack, Dwarf Fortress, Runescape, etc) and found them totally unplayable, thus giving up hope.  

Wow, all that posting by hand must take you hours.  And then checking back later to <URL>at's dedication!  If other MUD owners were as dedicated to promotion as you obviously are, maybe the genre would be in better shape.

94,"I have learned that the phrase “legally blind” will get doors slammed in my face; I have had interviewers turn away from me and start looking out windows while tapping their pens on their knees and notebooks; I have had interviewers slouch in their seats, resting their heads on the backs of their chairs like they were going to take a nap on me; I have had interviewers tell me they could put me to work right away, go as far as show me the workstation I would be using then a day or two later inform me that the company is going to continue looking.  I have had interviewers start talking to me as if I were six years old again or start talking to others in the interview as if I wasn’t there.  I had one company tell me the job had been filled that very morning, pull the job off their website and re-post it a week later with a “REQUIREMENT” of a valid drivers license even though the description stated zero percent travel.  

I truly believe that the average person doesn’t understand the difference between “legally blind” and “totally blind”.  My empirical evidence indicates that most people sub-consciously make a connection that if your eyes don’t work and since your eyes are in your head then there must be something wrong with the rest of your head.  

I no longer use the phrase “legally blind” when my vision comes up in an interview, instead I use the phrase “very near sighted” which seems to be more acceptable to people, it is something they can relate to I guess.  Using “very near sighted” is a way to open the topic for conversation and allow me the opportunity to quantify my vision, offer examples of how my vision is an asset to me in my job as well as, hopefully, an opportunity for me to dispel some false assumptions the average person may have about people with visual impairments.  

A potential employer needs to know and not making them aware of my vision during the interview would, I think, come across as being deceptive.  One of the best opening I get is when I am asked what my strengths are to which I reply that being very near sighted from birth has given me a lifetime of experience in problem solving and that I have honed that skill to a razors edge.  More often than not I am asked to elaborate on the “skill” of problem solving before I am asked about the “tool” of being very near sighted

He had an interview today, actually. I encouraged him to bring up his restrictions prior to the interview so they're not shocked. He knew there was going to be a written test on paper so beforehand he emailed the recruiter and explained that he had limited vision so the test would need to be on either a computer with high contrast or someone would need to read it to him. The guy emailed back and was very nice, and at the interview today my boyfriend didn't end up having to take the test because they couldn't have it reprinted or get authorization from the company they buy it from to have someone read it to him.

100,"Edit: The average human speaks at 150 words per minute, not 50 words per minute. I knew this, but my finger just didn't wanna hit that ""1"" key, apparently.

Personally, no.  I have my TTS set to well over 300 words per minute, and the average human speaks at 150 words per minute.  Sure, for fiction books and stories, I love audio readings by a real human, because they can dramatize the fiction in a way a computer never will.  But for the vast majority of the blog posts I read, a human reading would add no value.  I can honestly think of only 2 of the 20 or 30 blogs I read regularly that I'd enjoy having read to me. For the rest of them, I'd use my TTS even if I had the option of a human reader.  TTS is faster, and if the article has been well-organized (headings, etc), I can skip the uninteresting bits.  

Also, every single blog I read includes multiple images in the articles with no alt-text, or where the only thing in the alt-text is photo credits (stockphoto/Wavecraft Media is not valid alt-text, no matter that it passes all the tests, and fulfills your obligations to give photo credits).  I'm absolutely serious about this, without any exaggeration at all:, every single blog I read has photos with no alt-text or invalid alt-text.  So trying to get bloggers to read their articles out loud is just a tragic waste of resources, that could be better spent advocating about alt-text.  If you use an image, for anything, it needs a description.  Who cares if you take the 25 minutes required to record a reading of your article, if you flatly refuse to take the 45 seconds needed to describe an image you included.

I can use the video controls without crashing at all, and the Netflix app never crashes when I start video playback.  I did have it crash at launch once, but I just don't have the time to give it another 10 or 20 tries and see if it keeps happening.  I also still have huge lag when swiping through things like search results and recommendations, and if I swipe too quickly, the app will still crash.
