So I can't really speak for that idea, other than that it has never personally worked for me, but it may work for you so don't feel like I'm discouraging you.

I personally choose to make use of disability assistance technology (primarily on computer) so that I can write independently.  Simply saying ""rely on touch typing"" isn't always helpful, especially if you already work visually.  That being said, make sure you can touch type, it's a life saver.  That's the first step.  The second step is to get a screen magnifier, I use ZoomText as do my VI friends.  It is very powerful software that will allow you to magnify, adjust colors/ contrast, and it can read to you to just name a few benefits.  It has a heavy price tag though, I believe over $500 USD.  If that is a problem, you can apply for support through a government disability office or through a local private Blind support organization.  I had ZoomText given to me by my state.  If you are losing vision it is good to establish relationships with these groups anyway.  They can provide you with technology, mobility training, and more.   If you need to take this exam soon, you can get a trial version for 60 days from AiSquared.  

If you need to hand write it, looking into a CCTV, video magnifier, or powerful traditional magnifier might not be a bad idea either.  Again these organizations can help you with that.

I find that these techniques work for me, because I have not stopped using my vision as a resource, and likely won't until I have hit my absolute limit, at which point I'll need to reevaluate, but until then I'm personally sticking with using my eyes with heavy assistance.

If that's what you need, then I'd explore those options, otherwise if you think going with a scribe is your best option I'd start talking to one as soon as possible to develop strategies and possibly practice prior to your exam.

I hope this was helpful.  Good luck on your test!

It's very similar to a lot of other degenerative conditions like RP.  I have some functional vision but I use a white cane and other tools to help me get around/ function.

65,"Hopefully some of these answers can help you understand a bit more. Let me know if you have any more questions or would like some clarification.

&gt;I have never tried to learn to read or type braille. Are braille typewriters still a thing? How difficult and how long does it take for a newbie to learn braille? How useful is it to you? Can you use a ""sighted"" computer keyboard with ease?

*Braille Typewriters are still available and very much in use
*The majority of my blind coworkers read braille (some of the sighted ones do as well) with different levels of skill. Some were born blind and others lost their sight later in life. As with any other skill it is easier to learn if you are younger but and adult can definitely learn braille. Speed wise it depends person to person. 
*Braille is literacy and all of the braille readers that I know love it and use it every day. This is not to say that every braille reader feels this way.
*Blind users can use PCs 

&gt;How does walking with a cane or stick help and does it work for everyone? What kinds of things can guide dogs help with and are there cons or tradeoffs that sighted people might not know about? My roommates have dogs. Do guide dogs get along well with other dogs? Do they need to play with other dogs to be happy? Can they stay focused or be released to play on command?

*The guide dogs vs canes depends on the person. If you don't like dogs then it's probably not a good idea. 
*We have several guide dogs in the office as well as pets. Some of them get along, some of them don't. Once thing to consider with guide dogs is that you have to train them. Guide dogs are trained to a point but you have to continue their training. When you get them they are not fully grown either so you will be dealing with a young dog so a lot of your energy is going to go into finishing the training that it was receiving.

&gt;I'm a university student studying computer science. How do blind people read and write code efficiently?

*Yes. You can use a screen reader or a braille notetaker

&gt;Do you shop with a friend to find clothes, food, etc.? Do stores usually have an employee help if you ask 

*You can go with your friends to go shopping. There are also volunteers that can go with you. 

&gt;What things are less important to blind people? I imagine blind people caring a little less about fashion, TV, and movies. I know there are audio guides that describe TV and movies, but how good are they and do you find them useful or adequate? Where is modern technology lacking in helping blind people?

*I don't think there is a general consensus that blind people care less a bout a certain thing. Fashion is definitely important to some of my coworkers. Let me tell you they come in to work looking amazing. They go to the movies, watch TV, and go to the theater a lot more than I do. 
*The technology point is a very important question. Unfortunately, braille technology has not made much progress in past years. If you look into notetakers they can be priced at $6,000 for technology that has been around for ages. Think about how much progress phones have made where you can buy an iPhone for a couple of hundred dollars. There are organizations working towards improving this technology but it's slow progress and a lot of the technology ends up around the same cost.

&gt;Do you feel safe drinking alcohol? With the way alcohol impairs the senses, I guess if I was blind, I would be hesitant to drink, already having one less than I'm used to.

*When consuming alcohol you have to be smart no matter if your blind, VI, sighted, blind etc. 
*Alcohol consumption is all about personal preference.

&gt;Do restaurants have audio or braille menus? Sometimes I eat alone. Are servers known to have the patience to read a menu to a blind customer?

*There are restaurants that carry braille menus you just have to ask. There are also apps that can tell you what's on the page. You can take a picture of the menu and your phone will read the print or it will describe what you took a picture of. For example if you don't know if you have a five dollar bill or a one dollar bill and you don't have anyone around you you trust you can use that app. There is also a new app where you can video conference someone and they can explain what you are showing them.",False,False,t1_cooasjf,NationalBraillePress,,0,1424195599,t5_2qpec,t3_2w6by0,t3_2w6by0,3,1424640755.0,0,0,cooasjf,Blind,3,,,,

Pressing the button just keeps cycling through the available options, round and round and round, with no indication when it's been through each option, and has started the cycle again.  So, even if I know that the modes are in order: off, movie, music, concert, and custom, if I have no idea what mode the amplifier is in currently, I can't tell what mode is going to come next.  I can usually figure it out by listening carefully, but it's still really annoying.  The amp also has all kinds of settings, to due with everything from volume shaping to surround sound setup, and all of them must be changed through a menu.

100,"Your friend is either tragically misinformed, or is trying to screw you royally. Source: I am a guide dog user of just over 6 years.
First of all, the medical expenses... There are vets who take care of service dogs pro bono. Even if there are none of these vets in your local area, the dog only needs a checkup every year, shots, and visits if he gets sick. Even without the free services many vets provide, the medical expenses should be along the lines of 400 bucks a year maximum.
Second, grooming. Guide dog schools give extensive training on dog grooming, along with providing brushes and other assorted grooming stuff. The master grooming his own dog is also an important part of the bonding process, and is emphasized by many schools as a technique for keeping your relationship with your dog at the high level required to be a good working team.
Food... Uh, 80 dollars a month on food is insane. The standard food for a guide dog from the school I attended is Purina One. It costs around 35 dollars for a 40 pound bag. This should last a month and a half to two months.
As far as transportation, that has nothing to do with the dog.
Sorry to say it, but this is a scam.
It is infuriating to hear about people trying to get by with this level of fuckery.
Think of it this way. Your total expenses a month ad up to over 500 dollars. This amount of money would be enough for the guy to hire a personal driver to take him wherever he needs to go. 
If it cost this much money to have a guide dog, there would be nobody with them.

112,"Hi there, you guys may already have this covered but, your grandbaby will qualify for an IFSP (individual family service plan). It is like an IEP for special education in school, but for babies and families. It's universal across the U.S. And it will follow the child anywhere in the U.S. as long as they qualify for it. You guys should ask the local doctor to refer your grandchild for these services locally. They can vary by county depending on where you live. The family and the child needs support from a teacher of visually impaired and perhaps even an infant development specialist (depending on need), as well as any other needed services. The IFSP will get you guys access to all of that. You should have a local regional center that will do the intake process, get you a case manager, and start the ball rolling on getting those services. The sooner, the better! 

Here are some good resources for families:
www.wonderbaby.org is my favorite go-to website for parents. It's packed with resources! You will find development charts for blind babies, suggested toys, articles galore, ideas for activities, etc.
Here is a list of [books and videos](http://www.wonderbaby.org/articles/book-list) for parents of blind babies to get you started.
[Paths to Literacy](http://www.pathstoliteracy.org/toys-promote-pre-braille-skills) is another fantastic website with tons of ideas! Lots of teachers in the field post on here and use this website as a resource too! New ideas are added all the time. You can sign up to be notified by email when new resources are posted.

As someone who works blind infants my first suggestion is to 'wear the baby'. By that I mean, in a sling or carrier, as much as possible! Parents should make an effort to be constantly talking to the baby as they go about their day while wearing the baby: ""I think I'm going to make a bowl of cereal. First I need a bowl. That's up here in the top cupboard. Now I need to go to the pantry for the ceral. (Shake the box, let child feel and listen). Now we need some milk from the fridge. (Brrr, the fridge is cold!). Now I'm pouring some cereal, and now the milk."" It will seem strange at first, but it will get easier! And it is SO beneficial to the baby. Providing the baby with this kind of rich language combined with multi-sensory experiences (touching, hearing, tasting, smelling, etc) will help them develop important concepts that sighted children pick up naturally. The whole family will need to get used to taking about and showing the child what they are doing, how things work, how they fit together, etc. I have many a time taken kids outside and held them up to feel all parts of a tree, put them up on the table so they could feel around the wall where the AC vent was because 'where that cold air came from' was a mystery! Then we went and felt the back of the portable and found the AC unit! It's these kids of things that blind kids have to be taught, where as sighted kids just pick it by from their visual experiences. 

Exposure to a wide variety of textures is always a good idea too! Grass, sand, mud, cool whip, raisins, pudding, etc. These textures are not always easy for blind children to tolerate. Regular exposure early on will help! 

See if the family (or the agency that provides service!) will help you to make a toy gym/little room for the baby. Here is a great example of a [Toy Gym](https://adaptedworld.wordpress.com/pvc-toy-bargym-instructions/) with instructions for an infant. The purpose here is to help the infant develop a sense of object permanence (everything is on elastic so it doesn't just ""disappear"" when tossed), it allows for exploration of a variety of sounds and textures (put jingle bell balls in a little whisk for example), provides consistency (you don't change items out too often unless they don't play with it), and encourages exploration of their environment. The blind child needs to develop a sense of confidence in exploring their surroundings (safe, consistent, rewarding experiences) which will lay a nice foundation for the child to develop the motivation and confidence to begin walking/crawling/scooting, etc. once the child is moving around this is no longer appropriate and can be hazardous if the get themselves tangled in the elastic. This is a supervised activity for infants and children who are not yet moving around on their own.

You can also put your sewing skills to good use too by making [quiet books](http://craftyladylindsay.blogspot.com/2011/01/quiet-book.html?m=1). Another example here for [texture books](http://www.pathstoliteracy.org/resources/diy-book-textures-sensory-book). A quick google search for quiet books, tactile books, or texture books will pull up tons of ideas! 

Also, www.seedlings.org has beautiful children's books with braille added for very good prices. And they will give you 2 free braille books a year through their Angel Program. Expose that baby to braille just like you would a sighted baby to print and picture books!
