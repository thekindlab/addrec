&gt;He was speaking directly with disability services. If disability services declined your BFs request, they probably talked to the college's legal department and have a good reason for saying no. These decisions are not arbitrary. There is probably legal case law on this matter that justifies the decision.

They didn't take it to legal. He made the request during a meeting with disability services employee and they verbally said no, it wasn't submitted ahead of time, or reviewed or anything. So this at least gives me hope that maybe we should resubmit a formal request and have it reviewed by legal. Do you think that's a good idea?

&gt;Your BF can probably request an appeal of the disability services decision.

This is also helpful information, the kind of information I was originally looking for in my last thread. Not just people telling me that the university is right, the end. If there's an appeal process then we would absolutely seek that avenue.

&gt;If your BF can not request an appeal, or is not satisfied with the results of the appeal, he can hire a lawyer and sue the college.

This is what we'd like to avoid, obviously. Which is why I came here because I was looking for other avenues. But it may come to that. If he fails this class he can't continue on with the program.

People still sometimes grab my upper arm and offer to help me but I just tell hem my dog will find it. I've had a woman ... errr assist me with sitting down as well. I was turning around and she grabbed my hips to 'assist me'. Very awkward. As a 33 yo man there is a certain type of 30-50 yo woman, the very motherly nurturing personality who is always trying to help. Sometimes they are a little too physical or insistent and I suspect this is because they have kids. (For the record I'm 33 man and have 4 kids of my own).

If someone grabs you, the best thing to do in my experience is to stand still and say very loudly that you are OK but thanks for offering. Don't let someone jeopardize your safety for the sake of trying to be polite.

Facebook and twitter can be really good - even more so than for ʻregularly abledʻ people so ʻmake sure he explores and gets comfortable online. So many blind and visually impaired use twitter. Just find cool resources and get started.
So many groups also for both blind &amp; friends.

He may - and probably will - some friends to whom his inability to see the world with eyes is too much. (That happens with any disability unfortunately) But there will be new friends.
And you can still do all kinds of cool stuff with friends - anything really (except driving a car). Watch movies, read books (audiobooks are nice, and so much faster to read than braille until you get a lot of practice) - and even regular libraries have so many audiobooks. Shping, going out to eat with friends, sports, cooking together - thatʻs all good stuff.

The other night i was looking for my wine glass for nearly 15 minutes. It had red wine in it. I donʻt live in a big apartment and i just couldnʻt find it.
And it took me 30 minutes to find to the other side of the block to the last web accessibility meeting (Iʻm guessing it would have been a 2-3 minute walk). Adventure time ;)
I put some beepers on my headphones and ipad case so i can find them - and often accessibility translates to ""where is my ipad?"".

You can get those beepers from Braille Bookstore online, $15 for 3 (pretty good deal I think). Also a simple talking watch is just around $10, and they have so many other cool gadgets too. No-tie shoelaces are available in many styles and colors, cooking and measuring tools make cooking easier...

I like where I live. Feels safe, I can walk and run (gasp.. In bright daylight) around. But I can't get a bus alone, I can't cross any of the big roads - and it's very difficult in the small things in life right now.
Like: trying to talk to your neighbors (I find it easiest to say hi to all dogs with their owners in my area. As all that I need is to feel safe around the dog, and then can ask what kind of puppy he is etc).
And other ""little things"" - using a phone indoors/outdoors (I have an iPhone), watching TV (let's just say I've given up with the remote. TV = apps on iPhone or iPad). Cleaning home. Figuring out what to wear that is pretty, clean, appropriate for style and occasion, will work for weather (cold makes me ache), does not make me look like an easy target etc.
I hate some buses here - no announcements, no clue where it goes... Or when it comes because I don't want to use an app to find out, and it is very loud in this city so it's difficult to find out when/which bus it is. Just feels uncomfortable. So I have to change to express line if I take the other bus...

Are those blur people safe? Which way am I going? Let's walk until I can find a landmark that works for me... Fine, 5 minutes and I'll ask someone, or think about actually whipping out the cane).

I know what you are talking about with the lack of self-advocacy, I worked with some people from the local school for the blind on a summer job at a warehouse that employed only legally blind people with the exception of forklift operators.  They really struggled with advocacy.  Since about 3rd grade in elementary school my father has put me in charge of advocacy.  If I was struggling he would step in and guide me, but he saw the importance of me communicating my needs (he is a college professor) so I have been advocating for myself for 8 going on 9 years.

My old caseworker was the one who pushed me to do it, but I didn't have a lot of communication with her.  When I met my new caseworker she was just very honest with me and told me she didn't think there was much that I was going to get from it.

194,"i never went to college. Finished high school and made that mistake of not knowing what I wanted to be, so I was a lot of things. Waited tables, worked in an arcade, stocked shelves at grocery stores, cleaned floors, etc. I decided I wanted to be a 911 dispatcher, but to do so requires experience. Started with a cab company as a radio dispatcher for a couple of years and one day the position of GM fell into my lap. It was a relatively small company and the GM and dispatch supervisor (husband and wife) were quitting to move out of state.

195,"I would think the best advice is pretty much the same as it is for all women; find out what *she* likes to do. I mean, don't ask her straight out, but you know, get her talking about herself and the things she likes doing just like you would any other girl and figure out a way to make those things into dates.",False,False,t1_crl0jyu,Bob_0119,NFL Referee,0,1432613733,t5_2qpec,t3_37a4nv,t3_37a4nv,3,1433268910,0,0,crl0jyu,Blind,3,,,,
196,"Man, in college, that's going to be rough. I really hate to say this, but he may need to take a semester or year off to learn the skills he needs to be independent. Sure he could probably get through if someone guided him around, read everything to him, and wrote everything down for him, but that's just degrading. First off, he needs to get oriented with computers and screen reading software. I recommend NVDA, although some people use JAWS, witch costs about 1000 dollars and does the same as NVDA, witch is free. He'll also need to learn braille. Logically speaking, if he wants to continue his education, he won't reading braille for his assignments; it takes years to get fast at it, and it's very inconvenient. He'll also need to get a cane, and learn how to use it. I believe there are several programs to help recently blinded people, perhaps he should sign up for one of those. I hope this helped and let me know if you have anymore questions.",False,False,t1_cr7fqom,Nighthawk321,,0,1431490948,t5_2qpec,t3_35lwd8,t3_35lwd8,7,1433034278,0,0,cr7fqom,Blind,7,,,,
