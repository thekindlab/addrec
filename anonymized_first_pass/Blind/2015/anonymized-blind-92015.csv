2,"Alright I'll give it a shot :)  Please forgive me if this gets long.  I am an 18M located in the United States.  My cause of blindness is Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA).  I have three major symptoms:

* Night blindness
* Restricted peripheral vision (I have a very narrow field of view)
* Sensitivity to light

I have some functional central vision but I need some pretty heavy correction as well as magnification and color enhancement in order to read.  LCA is very similar to Retinitis Pigmentosa if you are familiar with that condition, and it is a genetic, degenerative retinal condition.  My vision is holding steady where it is for now but the future isn't 100% certain as to whether I will lose more, when that might happen, how much I will lose, etc.

My parents first noticed what they thought were problems with my vision when I was learning to walk.  They noticed I would trip on things and walk into walls but it was obvious that I could see some things.  They consulted with a doctor who thought the issue was just that I was an overexcited toddler who wasn't paying attention.  Come Kindergarten I struggled to read letters on a page and I was having trouble with recognizing objects that were low contrast.  My parents took me to a different doctor who ran tests and gave me the diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa at the age of 5 (re-diagnosed with LCA at age 13).  So essentially I've had this since birth and we noticed when I started school.  With a diagnosis we were able to start looking for solutions.  It sounds like you are already ahead with your son, and that's awesome!

My night blindness is pretty severe.  In the dark I have no functional vision, I can't see shapes or shadows, it's just darkness.  If a place is adequately illuminated (basically completely flood lit) then I can use some of my vision but this is almost never the case and often the extra light messes with my overly sensitive eyes so it's kind of like fixing a problem with something equally terrible.  Street lights tend to just throw me off because I don't get enough information so I don't trust anything visual I get at night.  It's to the point where my orientation and mobility instructors advised me to just where my shades at night because I wasn't getting any useful information either way and the lights were uncomfortable.  Hopefully that gives you some idea on where my night blindness is.  If you need me to elaborate on anything let me know.

So I'll discuss coping mechanisms in the order that I implemented them since your son is still very young and some probably won't work for him yet.  The first thing my family did was learn how to use sighted guide technique.  This worked well for going out at night, to movie theaters, etc.  Leader Dogs for the Blind has a pretty good explanation on how to do sighted guide [here](http://www.leaderdog.org/clients/families-friends-coworkers/leader-dogs-in-the-workplace) under the heading ""The New Leader Dog Handler.""  This is for aiding with introducing a guide dog to a new environment or workplace with their handler but the same basic principle applies.

To give a brief crash course, the visually impaired person should take your elbow and the guide should walk about a half step in front of the visually impaired person.  The guide should not push the person being guided, but rather pull them.  In addition the guide should call out obstacles.  This doesn't really fully explain it but further down I'll explain how to get professional help with this and other things.

This technique does work well, and it served well.  However as one gets older they don't want to use this as much.  I wanted to have my independence and to be in control which I think is 100% natural, and I still feel that way.  I also like not being dependent on sighted guide because someone I trust to give sighted guide is not always available.  I am a public transit commuter and have been offered sighted guide from random people and I will never take it, it's a major safety issue for me.

For those reasons I currently employ two mechanisms and I have a third coming.  The first step I took after I decided I wanted to shift away from sighted guide was to get a flashlight.  I like the Streamlight Protac 2L because it is small, lightweight, super bright, and good on battery life.  I still carry it and it definitely illuminates a path.  However I don't rely on it anymore because I shifted to a white cane.  This was in large part because of new struggles I was having with peripheral vision.  I use a white cane day and night because of my sensitivity to light and lack of peripheral vision.  I find that my eyes play tricks on me either way and having tactile confirmation that I'm not going to trip on something is important to me.  Not everyone likes a white cane though.  If he isn't going to have trouble during the day then this may not be something he wants in the future.  The one thing I would say is that a cane can be folded and stowed in a bag when it isn't needed so it may be useful for him in the future.

The last thing is that I was approved for a guide dog last week (so excited!), so come June 2016 I will be replacing the cane with a dog in day to day operation.

Ultimately when he gets older he will have to decide how he wants to cope with it, but these are the ways I have used/ currently use/ will use to cope with mobility issues.  For now I would look into sighted guide because that is something you can implement as soon as you want and it is very easy to use, learn, and teach.

When you want to figure this out with him I would get in touch with an Orientation and Mobility Specialist (O&amp;M).  The O&amp;Ms I have worked with in the past all had Masters Degrees in this specific field on top of whatever other Bachelor's they earned.  They are very good at what they do and are incredible resources.  They can teach you hands on how to do sighted guide and start giving you tips on how to manage night blindness.  If you develop a relationship they can give lessons to your son on how to navigate in the dark and should he opt for cane training they can provide that.

This sort of gets into the next question of resources making themselves available to him since he is only night blind.  In my experience I have had really no trouble getting services.  I also have a lot of other problems with my vision other than night blindness so it's not exactly the same situation you and your son face.  I received training from two entities and I'll explain my experiences with both.

The first entity that I received training through was my local Department of Social Services, Rehab Services for the Blind division.  I met with one of their O&amp;Ms once every couple weeks to every few months depending on how much they were in demand.  This was alright training but it was very spaced out, I was split between two instructors, and I couldn't practice in different lighting conditions because they did not pay their staff to do night lessons.  The DSS also appeared to have enormous amounts of red tape to cut through and it was sometimes frustrating trying to get what I needed even though my caseworker was trying to get me help.  These are still good resources but they often take more time and work to get what is needed.

While I was working on this I was put in touch with a local organization who put me into an intensive 3 week O&amp;M course with private contractors that they hired and some O&amp;M interns working towards their certification/ Masters.  I worked with an O&amp;M and her intern every day for three weeks on solo lessons.  The student to instructor was 1:2 for everyone in this program and it was awesome.  I was given the opportunity to go out on night lessons pretty much every night and had tons of day work.  I did not pay a single cent for this service.  My local Lighthouse for the Blind also offers free night O&amp;M lessons with one of their instructors, so organizations do recognize the need for these kinds of services.

It is for this reason that I would look into non-profits in your area and start talking to their coordinator of services about what they can offer.  In addition to training they may have more free programs that interest you.  You can google your area for organizations that aid the blind or you can look in this sub's Wiki in the organizations section.  It is still in development and more organizations are being added but it may have something that can help you.

I think that about covers all of your questions, sorry if I went overkill on information, I wanted to make sure you have all the information you need.  If you need me to elaborate on anything or have any other questions let me know.

So if you're aiming the garden at people who won't be experiencing it visually, I'd think about getting hold of older flower styles which keep more scent.

7,"Yeah 2-3 feet should be fine for overhead.  So traffic monitoring is a tricky situation because there are a lot of variables and different situations.

&amp;nbsp;

I listen to traffic and judge it as either parallel or perpendicular traffic from where I'm facing.  At lighted intersections I cross when my nearside parallel traffic goes.  So if I'm walking on the right side of the road that would be the traffic coming from behind me.  This works pretty well and is safe if you are paying attention.  At stop signs I will either wait for ""all quiet"" or I will cross with a nearside parallel ""blocker car.""  Basically if you cross with a car that blocks the intersection then no car moving perpendicular to you will even try to enter the intersection with you in it.  I hope I'm explaining that well.

&amp;nbsp;

I talked a lot above about the simplicity and reliability of a cane above and I think that also applies to general Orientation and Mobility skills.  I worked with instructors to learn how to audibly analyze intersections and different traffic situations and those skills are priceless parts of my mobility system.  Cane skills are just the first part of learning how to get around with a visual impairment, that's where the rest of the O&amp;M training comes in.

&amp;nbsp;

I think you'll run into a similar problem with replacing the cane as you will with a traffic analysis system where those with refined O&amp;M skills will prefer to use their judgement over trusting an electronic device.

&amp;nbsp;

I think you'd also run into issues with the actual traffic analysis part of it.  There's a lot of cars, irregular roads and intersections, different intersection control systems, etc.  The closest we have gotten to accessible intersections is audible signals, and particularly in my area they are limited.  Even with an audible signal I still find myself double checking.  I don't know what you have in mind, it may work.  I'd just say that for me personally I probably wouldn't add a device that analyzed traffic to my system because I'd prefer to do it myself using my best judgement.  I will just add one thing and say that cars are getting quieter, hybrids in particular are a bit of a concern because they are pretty much dead quiet under a certain speed and they are kind of hard to detect.  A solution for this may be necessary at some point in the future, for now I'm just being extra cautious.

18,"It would certainly be interesting...  I can tell you that I am personally very wary of trusting a piece of technology over my cane.  A cane doesn't fail unless it snaps, an electronic device is subject to battery life, glitches, and other kinds of equipment failure.  I'm a fan of keeping things simple and a cane has been working for me.  I do like trying new things out but putting obstacle detection and avoidance in the hands of an electronic device is not something I would personally do.  I would be interested to see what you come up with though if you pursue it, I've seen a few posts here from people wanting to reinvent or replace the white cane as a project either personal or for some kind of university related assignment.

While the ideas are very cool, in a way I look at trying to replace or reinvent the cane as sort of as trying to replace or reinvent the wheel.  Canes work very well and they aren't subject to electronic failure.  That's not to say that there isn't room for innovation but the when your safety and mobility hinge on a battery it's not a good thing.  I think the white cane will always be a staple of orientation and mobility and I know I'm not alone in this thinking.

Something I think a lot of people don't look at is where the cane fails.

Places where the cane is very effective are on flat surfaces and finding obstacles in the way.  I really don't have failures here, it is more or less 100% effective.

However the cane has a few obvious problems.  The first is that it does not warn me of overhanging obstacles like tree branches or low signs.  It's not uncommon for me to run into things like that.  Having a system that could warn me of overhead obstacles would definitely spark my interest.  I always thought something like Google Glass with a camera at eye level that could detect obstacles overhead would be really nice.

Your idea is a good one but it would likely be very complicated and I know I'm not alone in being cautious about putting mobility in the hands of electronics.  That's not to say I don't love my accessible technology... I love things like mobility GPS systems like the Trekker Breeze, but the Trekker doesn't replace my cane, it supplements it.

In short I think the concept is super cool, and it would be nice if you could figure something out but I don't know how many people would jump on the idea of replacing their canes/ dogs.  I know you said you wanted to try the idea in a developing area type scenario but that may pose its own set of problems.

Not trying to discourage you, I'm just stating some of the realities that I personally face.  You may hear differently from others, but that's what data collecting is all about :)

I love that so many people are trying to develop new mobility solutions for the blind/ visually impaired community.  Innovation is definitely needed and I think there is a lot of promise on the mobility side of things in the cane/ dog supplement market.

The vast majority of professors (at least three quarters) refused to allow any electronics what-so-ever during the lecture: no recording, no laptops, no note-takers, nothing.

So it was easier just not to take notes at all.  Unfortunately, that means you retain less than half of the information, so you'd better hope that everything on the exams was in the textbook.  However, the professors had to make every text they'd be using available long before the start of term, so the university book store could stock them, so disability services could almost always have the textbook ready for me by the time the third or fourth class took place.

25,"I think the main fear was that the profs didn't want to be recorded, in case they said something stupid, or silly, or offensive, and then it would be all over the internet forever.  They used the distraction thing as an excuse to make the recording difficult/impossible.  In all fairness, my depressed ranting last night aside, I did only have to actually retake 3 courses because of that issue.  Once I got wise to it, I would just drop the course in the first month, and then it wouldn't count on my transcript, and I could take the course again later under a friendlier professor.  

I guess that would be my best advice, to a blind person in uni today.  Don't be afraid to fail courses: you will always get at least one more opportunity to retake them.  And don't be afraid to drop courses if, for any reason, you don't like the professor or TA.  Those courses will be offered again, with a different prof.

36,"I am completely blind and I've had two very different experiences in university. First I tried to read a degree and didn't manage, and afterwards I went somewhere else and completed another degree with fairly good results. As you can imagine I've been thought a lot about this stuff, and what the differences were, so although it may not all be applicable to other people I'll just point them out.

First, school always came fairly easily to me, but at university the workload can be much larger. Also, because I already knew some of the stuff we were studying, at the beginning of the course I would get the thought that this is really easy and I don't need to pay a lot of attention and work hard. By the middle of the course or so without realising we were doing stuff I'd never seen before and I lost the thread. In some subjects if you don't have a good foundation it will be very hard to go on, like maths-related things. Even if you think you know something it's good to firm it up and to follow with the course because eventually they will teach something new.

Another thing is lectures. They are really useful. You just have to be there and pay attention. If the lecturers don't use a ridiculous amount of visual aids they can be the most convenient way to learn a topic, since reading is not as interactive. If they use a lot of visual aids or handouts make sure you can get them in advance. One of my mathematics professors insisted in doing her proofs on the blackboard without showing them in handouts to the students because she said it was essential for them to learn, and that caused a lot of problems for me.

Another thing is there will be resources at the university or whatever organisations there are for disability provision. Use them. They are there for a reason. When you need help you need to let people know. A university is a very large environment (at least mine were) and can't keep track of every student. They will assume if you need something you'll let them know.

Other than that, you can do very well if you put in the work. Almost everyone finds university challenging in one way or another: academically, socially... This is true for pretty much all students, not just disabled ones. So best of luck, but as one of my professors said: don't wish people luck, that's what bad dstudents need; to good students you wish justice.

52,"I'm new to Reddit, in my mid-twenties, and have been blind since birth. I was born four months premature and have no sight in my right eye and can see limited colors, shapes, and objects with my left. I read Braille and can read print if it is enlarged a lot and brought right up to my face, so I generally only mess with printed text if there is no other alternative.
For me, having sight is like being in a foreign country; I have all this stimulation from the din of chatter around me, but I can only pick up on a few basic things here and there, so I just tune most of it out. Color is a bit like the difference between hearing a musical note (knowing that it is high or low) and having perfect pitch (knowing exactly where on the scale a note falls). I can see colors and know that they are different from each other, but I can't tell you what colors they are. I do like red, though, and can generally pick it out—someone told me once that red is one of the first colors infants see, so that could be why.

59,"Reading your post definitely brought back a lot of feelings for me as im nervous about all of these things as i begin applying to grad school. the most important thing that you need to know is that it is definitely possible for you to be successful in college and thrive there! I was born legally blind due to ROP, but graduated in May with a BA in psychology.  What are you thinking of majoring in?

All of the worries you have are totally natural and i think they really only start to go away as you learn to overcome those challenges. that said there are a lot of things you can do to help you succeed in college.

The first is getting in touch with the disability services department of your college if you haven't done so already. This can be especially important for finding out what services they offer for help both in and out of class these can include, finding a fellow classmate to be your note taker, arranging extra time for exams, helping you make sure your professors accommodate your needs or walking you around campus for a few days until your comfortable with your surroundings (or in my case a few weeks). 

The second thing is pace yourself and take time to understand your limits.it is really easy to get caught up in wanting to do tings like everyone else and i am super guilty of this, but in college the trick to being successful is finding the path that works best for you. if you start the semester and find that you feel overwhelmed by the work load or if you feel that way now, consider taking a reduced course load by taking 2 or 3 classesa semester instead of 4. this is something that helped me greatly. i found that i did my best when i took less classes because it meant fewer readings each week and fewer papers and assignments to focus. Also don't be afraid  to find different ways  to learn the class material. If you're taking an English classes where you have to read lots of books try using Audible.com or Libravox.org to listen to the books instead of reading them! This is something that disability services can also help with.

Lastly as for staying motivated, try to take classes that you're genuniley interested in, use sites like Ratemyprofessor.com/ or ask around to find great professors and get involved with things outside of the classroom like clubs or volunteering, it's just as important to have fun in college as it is to do well! setting small goals for yourself  and giving yourself time to enjoy life will help to relieve stress and keep you motivated.

61,"So for your first question, there's a lot of amazing technology out right now, but it is insanely expensive, and in some cases almost disgustingly expensive.  I would make an objective of whatever you do to have it be something that can be produced and sold inexpensively because there are a lot of tools that I would benefit from right now but I can't because I don't have the money to purchase them right now and applying for grants can take a long time.

With that note out of the way doing something with GPS would be a great idea.  The most popular (at least in my area) standalone GPS is the Humanware Trekker Breeze +.  I had a chance over the summer to trial run a Trekker everyday for 3 weeks and loved it.  I unfortunately don't have the $800 USD to get one myself and had to give it back to the O&amp;M instructor that lent it to me.  That is a good model to go off of.  

A few things that the Trekker does that would be must haves in a device that I would personally purchase:

* Automatic call outs of intersections and street names
* Descriptions of intersections (4 way stop, 4 way lighted, 2 way stop, T intersection and orientation of the T relative to my approach of the intersection, etc.)  This is critical information for analyzing an intersection and executing a safe crossing, while it is information I can figure out on my own it is faster to just know what it is as I approach.
* Custom landmarks
* Walking directions 
* Landmarks should be called out with either a clock direction or compass direction.  An estimated distance is also important and the user should be able to set their unit measure (I prefer Meters but some will prefer Feet).

* A ""look around"" feature that allows the user to hear lists of different points of interest like tourist things, restaurants, shops, etc.

* The device should be 100% tactile and audio controlled.

Some things the Trekker does/ did not do when I was using it that should be a part of a GPS: 

* Voice commands... This is something that might be difficult to integrate if you are already building a system from the ground up but I'm going to say it either way because the Trekker's greatest pitfall for me was trying to navigate the menu and type in information.  This could possibly be remedied by having a companion app that could feed the device with information so you can piggyback on the available voice control platform and as a result have an easier to control device that is more accurate and doesn't drain the phone battery.

* GLONASS technology integration, the gen 1 Trekker I used did not have GlONASS on board, they may have added it to the + model.  This is important for making the system more accurate and having it update position faster.

* The button layout and UI should be simple, the Trekker had a bit of a learning curve for navigating to what I wanted in the menus the first few days.

I will edit more in if I think of anything else, I'm sure I will think of more things that need to be in a system like this.  It's important that GPS never become a crutch or a substitute for proper O&amp;M technique and skills, but they are fantastic supplements.  I also prefer standalone units as opposed to phones because I need my phone to be a phone and GPS really drains phone battery.  I don't mind carrying more if there is something that can do a better job.

Okay, so for your current idea of a cane mountable, sonar/ laser system with GPS system.  I know there is at least one electric cane device on the market with a laser system integrated, I honestly don't know exactly what it does nor do I particularly care because it's over $1,000 USD and I have a tendency to bend canes that makes me opposed to spending more than $30 USD for a folding Ambutech mobility cane.  I suppose this could be remedied by making the device removable.  The other device may be removable but I still wouldn't use it for the next reason.

I wouldn't want more weight on a cane, I try to keep my canes as light as I possibly can especially because I use a longer cane relative to my height (I'm 5'10"" and I use a 60"" cane).  Having more weight I have to swing in a two point tap technique puts more strain on my wrist, when I use my slightly heavier cane I can feel the difference after a few miles of walking.

With regards to the vibrating handle, I would not use that either.  One of the advantages of a cane is it gives you a lot of tactile awareness that I very much need in bright sunlight and in the dark to tell whether I'm on smooth sidewalk pavement or if I'm about to step out onto rougher asphalt.  Anything that interferes with that or that could throw those queues off would get turned off immediately.  I prefer audio queues.  I'd look into bone conduction headsets which don't block the ears so that hearing is not impaired.

So in summary I would not personally use a cane mounted device.  This is personal preference from a public transit cane commuter in an urban area.  It may work for others but at the rate I go through canes it just wouldn't get used.  My preference is a device I can mount to my body somewhere.  When I was using it I would clip the Trekker to the cross strap of my daily carry messenger bag and that worked great.  This kind of rules out any kind of sonar/ laser idea (probably).  You may be able to make it work but I honestly would not use that system.  It likely wouldn't provide me with more useful information than my long cane and those systems are subject to interference/ unreliability/ battery issues.  I don't want sensory overload so I would probably not use this and just trust my cane.  I've heard of concepts where you take a device like this and have it replace the cane so that the user doesn't have to swing anything in front of them.  I'm not going to ever go for something like that, I will never hinge my getting home safely on a battery or electronic that can fail, aside from the fact that I would be losing a lot of information.  Technology can never take over proper O&amp;M techniques, it can improve efficiency but never become a crutch.

So that's kind of where I stand on your current idea, I really love the GPS idea, and we certainly need more competition in that market to keep new features coming out and to drive down the price, I just wouldn't practically apply a sonar/ laser/ cane mounted device for the above reasons, it's a really cool idea but I think for a lot of people it just would not be used.  That's just me though, and it may be a good warning tool for someone who doesn't need to use a cane but still occasionally runs into things, having something that signals a streetlamp or pole on their side that they may not see could be helpful for them, but for a cane user it would redundant and would likely get annoying.  Again, that's just me though, and I'm sure someone would find it useful in one application or another.

I really hope this helps, I love this idea and I had a lot of fun writing this.  Please keep us posted on the progress of your project and if you need any questions answered feel free to hit me up.

64,"The answer is 'depends'. I know someone who went totally blind overnight, he got a disease which basically attacked his optic nerves and he wnet from 20/20 to 'nothing'. He literally sees 'nothing'. It is not like closing your eyelids and trying to focus or see with your eyes shut. 

However other people see different things. I've had my retina detached multiple times in my left eye. Every single time I saw blinding white light, even with my eye shut. It was literally glowing whiteness. It was horrible and gave me headaches. Your brain is super smart though it adjusts and adapts.

The hardest question for most legally blind/low vision people to answer is 'What do you see exactly?' or 'How much can you see?' however it is one we get all the time because people are naturally curious.

Think about it the other way though, say you have 20/20. What do you see? Now describe that experience to someone who can't. Pretty hard hey?

Most peoples vision changes daily depending on if its cloudy, sunny, night time, twilight etc. Some days your eyes are just strained and tired and overworked.

90,"From a policy point of view I'd love to see national certification standards written into the regs. That is incredibly difficult, however, as there are a lot of stakeholders and interested parties. Moreover, the number of trainable tasks is quite high so the standards would be all over the board. Lastly, service animal provisions exist in the ADA, FHA and Air Carrier Access Act so they would have to all be dealt with to create uniformity. This isn't insurmountable but it would probably require legislative changes and multiple agencies to agree on new regs. The fact that it wasn't included in the regs with the original ADA in 1990 or the more recent amendments in 2008 is evidence of just how difficult it would be to get it done. There have been a ton of public and not so public fights regarding this topic every time changes are made to the laws.

I am a graduate of World Services for the Blind an organization that focuses in assisting individuals restore their life. Not only am I a graduate of the centers program but I am also a certified Instructor of Adaptive Technology for the Blind. I myself was born with a large array of visual conditions that have slowly crippled my vision. As is in the case of your girlfriend I was at school studying a career that absolutely requires good eyesight but do to my condition slowly progressing I have had to change my plans. If you wish I can put you in contact with World Services for the Blind in Litle Rock, AR, USA. In addition I could suggest some technology that might assist your girlfriend continue being able to work or go to school. The fact of the matter is that with today's technology eyesight is a minor issue if you know how to bypass it. Feel free to PM me if  you need anything.

As to what you can expect that depends on the attitude of your girlfriend. As a professional in the world of the low vision and blind I can tell you that a lot  of success has to be with the attitude of the individual being affected and the attitude of those around the affected individual. The first thing and it is the hardest is to accept the condition. I speak out of personal experience when I say that it is difficult to accept such a change. The journey into the darkness of blindness is sometimes not an easy one. What helped me and those around me was the level of trust we had in each other. I will say that I went through some low points and I am still not a total blind individual but I  used to be able to manipulate very small items like jewelry crafting and not being able to do the things I enjoyed hit me hard. My attitude changed when I dear friend of mine who was going through a similar condition challenged me to do the impossible. I accepted the truth is she was going through a worse situation but she pushed me back into the side of things were I acquired an outgoing outlook on things. This had the side effect of me now being able to help her come with me.

If your girlfriend goes total blind then she will not be able to do some things at this point in her life but technology development will allow her to drive, and do normal things in a few years.

94,"I love talking about this kind of stuff, don't worry about it :)  GPS is actually a great technology to look into.  Right now the Trekker is the lead GPS system at least in the circles I'm in.  I know that there is a company called Kapsys and they launched a device (I think in conjunction with Leader Dogs for the Blind) called the Kapsys Kapten Plus.  From what I understand it was pretty well liked but Kapsys discontinued it.  They may have launched a new device that replaced it, I haven't really looked into it since all of my experience is with the Trekker platform and I'm not in a financial position right now to be trying multiple several hundred dollar units.  The Kapten Plus is the only real competition I've ever heard of except for apps like BlindSquare, The Seeing Eye GPS App, and other non blind specific apps like Google Maps.  The market definitely has room for competition, especially for people like me who like to have separate GPS units.  It takes up more space but I need my phone to be a phone and GPS kills my battery so having a dedicated GPS is nice.

&amp;nbsp;

In the US I think there is actually a restriction on how accurate GPS can be, I'm not sure what it's like elsewhere.  I think it's a national security thing.  You can read about laws in the US in [this FAQ](http://www.gps.gov/support/faq/).  I actually got sucked into looking through it for this comment because I'm a bit of a nerd for this kind of thing.  It looks like civilian GPS in the US can be accurate to 3.5 Meters while military restricted systems can get as accurate as centimeters to even millimeters given enough time.  I believe the Russian GLONASS system of satellites is also available for civilian use, pretty sure Apple actually has GLONASS incorporated into their GPS units on their mobile devices.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pretty used to the Trekker I worked with giving me the information roughly 10-30 feet before my intersection.  I know the Trekker Breeze Plus is supposed to be more accurate.  I have been told that I'm being sent a Trekker Breeze Plus by the organization that is going to train me with a guide dog probably this week or next and that will be the first Trekker unit that is mine.  I'll be able to compare my previous experience with my instructor's first generation Trekker when I get it.  Hopefully that gives you some idea of what you can expect in terms of accuracy.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are looking at testing out GPS technology I would suggest looking into getting an amateur radio license and playing around with APRS and aprs.fi for GPS transmission and real time mapping... It would be great for prototyping.  Having a radio license opens up a lot of doors and gives you a lot of knowledge.

Last question, would a tool that helps monitor traffic for crossing the street be of any use? 

I'll get to work on the overhead tool, but if I get the sensing technology down, it would be interesting to try out. 

Thanks

101,"I wish I knew the answer to this too, but my biggest fear is fighting discrimination.

In 2014 I went through Junior Blind of America to get a job working at a warehouse that sold refurbished cell phone parts to independent repair shops.  For the most part the employees liked me, except for two people that practiced covert, unquantifiable discrimination upon which they couldn't be called out on their shit.  For example, in the mornings everyone tells them ""Good morning!"" in a warm, enthusiastic singsongy voice and they reply in kind, but when it comes around to me wishing them a good morning they immediately fall into hunch-back and monotone mode.  Other examples were co-workers receiving their six-month evaluations and pay raises, health benefits, and equal training on the entire warehouse process whereas my own evaluation meetings were ""postponed"", no pay raise, no health benefits, and got stuck into a back office separating returned product from trash.

It got to the point where I contacted both Junior Blind of America and the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation (through which I was referred to JBA) and there was absolutely no help whatsoever in addressing or mediating my concerns.  I just couldn't take the head-shaking and blustery sighs from these two co-workers that my bosses loved SO much, so I finally relinquished my position and left in order to allow them to feel more comfortable and breathe easily once again.

Getting a job is doable enough; it's finding one with tolerant co-workers that won't steer situations to disfavor the disable that's difficult.  Luckily for them I'm homeless and struggling to find safe and affordable housing now.  :-)",,,,LittleOneEyedRetard,,,1442541969,t5_2qpec,t3_3lci3v,t3_3lci3v,5,1444428443,0,0,cv5f5dx,Blind,5,,,,

We were indeed lucky to find out so early. Our son had repeated eye infections due to a blocked tear duct (incredibly common) in his first year and was referred to the Children's Hospital when it didn't clear. The ophthamologist confirmed that his duct had opened (six months later now than the referral) but was thorough and always gave all kids a full eye exam, since they were there anyway. Her thoroughness is what led to the spot being noticed and a referral for an ERE. 

So far, he really seems to have no impairment, but then, he's 2. He's not exactly out in the dark much, but does seem to be able to find the knob of his door at 4:30 a.m. without difficulty. So what his struggles will be will have to wait at least another year until he can explain himself better.

A lot of colorblind people don't have red cones, but instead they have more green cones to make up for the missing red ones. This results in no loss of acuity despite the lack of color differentiation. For me though, i don't think my green cones got the memo that the red ones were missing so i have fewer cones and therefore deficient color vision AND reduced acuity. Which is weird.

Here's that comment...

******
In a thread with a similar idea I made a few points, [here is the link to that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/3jsu4d/what_device_would_make_a_blind_persons_life/). I would also look at the post that /u/fastfinge linked to. I think the trouble with having multiple obstacle detection devices giving information is you risk sensory overload.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll give an example. I am an urban traveler, I am on public transit a lot and the areas I travel in are loud. So in addition to my impaired vision I also have somewhat limited use of the sense I use most to compensate for my low vision. As a result I have to pay extra close attention to the sounds around me to determine what could be an immediate threat. If I don't do this then I am risking life threatening mistakes. Now add something that sounds or vibrates into the mix that doesn't provide a whole lot more information than my cane and it ends up as a distraction.

&amp;nbsp;

I would also be concerned about a device false alerting me to something that isn't there and causing confusion. Electronics are subject to interference, glitches, etc. You also said this device could potentially help with areas that a cane can't reach. Just from my experience using a cane everyday for just over a year now, my cane is 60 inches long, it alerts to obstacles a few feet in front of me at my height. Things out of its reach are not pertinent to my next step. The way I was taught to cane travel was to be aware of the turns I need to make and to avoid obstacles on an as detected basis. I would imagine a dog is able to assess multiple obstacles in series and work out a plan, but dog travel is very different from cane travel. Like I said above, I have a lot of variables to manage in my head:

&amp;nbsp;

* The next step, is there an obstacle?
* The next turn to get to my destination, where am I going?
* The intersection
      - What type of intersection is it?
            - 4 way stop?
            - 4 way lighted?
            - T intersection?
                  - What is the orientation of the T? 
                  - How is traffic at the T controlled?
* What is traffic doing?
      - Is it busy?
      - Are drivers being responsible?
* What are pedestrians doing?
* Buses/trains 
      -When is my bus/train coming?
      -Where is it picking up passengers?
      -Where am I getting off?

&amp;nbsp;

I have to manage all of this when I'm traveling, and often times I have to be thinking about several of these variables at once. I already use my cane, so obstacle detection is down, and my GPS handles turn by turn for me in unfamiliar environments. The rest comes down to problem solving skills and focus. This is where my concern about having multiple things trying to get my attention comes from.

&amp;nbsp;

I do understand the idea of having backups. However I don't like to do this by having lots of different systems. I always carry a messenger bag with me that has a spare white cane and a backup power supply for my phone so that I'm not without GPS if I need it.

&amp;nbsp;

Another point I made in the thread I linked is figuring out you would mount it to keep the cameras steady, walking would shake the camera a lot. To keep it steady you probably have to figure out a gimbal or digital stabilization system. How would the cameras work in low light? Would you have to use IR? Unless you are using some pretty advanced IR cameras, how would you handle IR illumination? If you do use gen III or IV IR technology how would you make it affordable to roll out to the masses?  Would the cameras have to autogate to compensate for light entering from streetlights or daylight if you went with IR to compensate for the low light issue?  Would there have to be two cameras? The market is full of very expensive technology for the blind that isn't accessible to a lot of people because of the price barrier. Would you be able to make it accessible to people who don't have thousands of dollars in disposable income?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not trying to discourage you, I'm just pointing out problems a real world user may face with the technology.
Again I would encourage you to explore the idea of overhead obstacle detection, because there is no clear solution for that right now. Everyone I've asked about overhead obstacles has basically just told me that it's unavoidable unless I look into a dog, in which case the dog should detect overhead obstacles and move me.

&amp;nbsp;

I would really look into the overhead system because it will provide pertinent information that cane travelers currently do not have. It wouldn't distract because it wouldn't be trying to alert to things that the user has already been made aware of by their cane or will be made aware of in the next step. It would be a less complicated system, and it would probably be less expensive to produce.  If nothing else it could be a fantastic jumping off point that you can perfect and then incorporate new features into to make it a more advanced tool.

&amp;nbsp;

I really hope this doesn't come across as discouraging, I sincerely hope you are able to do something cool if you pursue this I'm just trying to give you honest feedback. Like I said above, I love my mobility technology, and I love hearing about these projects, it's incredibly cool and exciting. Again good luck :) Please keep us posted on what you do!

&amp;nbsp;

To address your other questions...

&amp;nbsp;

So, in my experience cane travel is difficult on rough surfaces like grass.  It tends to get caught in it.  Similar issues arise on brick/ cobblestone as well as on uneven pavement. Cane travel is also much slower than dog travel and it is much less fluid.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have a dog yet.  I actually just found out that I have been placed in training for June 2016 at one of the schools in the US (so excited!).  I unfortunately can't give you any first hand insight though because my experience walking with a guide dog is limited to about 1 hour with a representative from the school I'm going to.  I can tell you from my conversations with others who are guide dog users that you have to be careful about certain things.  You have to be aware of the weather and how long you are going to be exposing the dog to the conditions.  Too hot or too cold is bad.  You also have to be aware of how much you have worked the dog that day, you have to be aware of fatigue of the dog, water, food, when the dog needs relief.  Basically you have to be careful because it is a living creature and it needs to be cared for, unlike a cane which you can use all you want without worrying about overworking it because it's a folding piece of aluminum with reflective tape on it.  I'm sure that there are things I'm missing.  If you are still working on this project or are still interested in it I can get back to you when I complete training and have some experience under my belt.  Otherwise if anyone is a current or former guide dog handler here, please correct me if I'm wrong and expand on anything necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

The device I mentioned would be useful for detecting overhead obstacles which a cane does not alert to.  I expanded on it in the comment that I accidentally originally wrote to the other person.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I hope all of this helps, let me know if you need anything else :)

126,"Hi OP! I don't know how much attention this post will receive so I thought I'd chime in. I'm sighted, like you, with a boyfriend (together 2 years) who has advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa. He is mostly blind, doesn't drive, etc.

He was diagnosed at age 5 but still went to undergrad and grad school for Psychology and Consumer Research. He got a job at age 24 and worked until late last year, where he was laid off. I think he was ""laid off"" as in....he wasn't super efficient but they used another excuse to let him go. He realized at that point that his vision was getting worse and it was the wrong field for him. Sucks because he has $30k in student loan debt, but I'm glad he's realizing it now until later.

We live together and right now he's living on $900ish a month in disability. It covers his half of rent/utilities (we found a place that's cheap but still niec). He went back to school for massage therapy, a field we both researched and decided would be great for him because it doesn't require his sight at all. He will be finished next summer and is really liking it. It's a field that has a lot of opportunities.....he can work in a hospital setting, spa, work from home, sports teams, etc.

I know it seems like the end of the world but it's NOT. We are still really happy. Yes, him being blind changes things and adds a bit more responsibility for me (I'm his taxi!) but I love him and of course it's worth it.

It's not for everyone. If you stay, you need to realize that you will always have to drive. You can't resent her for that. You'll have to help sometimes. If you have kids, you'll need to completely take over some of the responsibility you'd normally share with a spouse. If she's a good partner, then she will balance that out by completely taking over some responsibilities that she is able to do still. 

PM me if you ever need advice. It's not always perfect, but no relationship is. Don't stay with her because you want to take care of her. Only stay if you love her.",,,,homeschooled,sighted significant other,,1442851892,t5_2qpec,t3_3lt8rd,t3_3lt8rd,5,1444494736,0,0,cv94hr4,Blind,5,,blue2,,
127,"If he doesn't want to work in a call center, then he shouldn't. Being visually limited shouldn't impose on one's happiness, and your career plays a big part in that. However, getting a job is one of those really scary things for a lot of people, and being visually impaired adds some new complexity. Does he drive? If not, does he have reliable transportation? Once hired, does he tell everyone at once that he's low vision by making an awkward ass announcement? Or tell people when they say ""Got your face close enough to your computer screen?"" Or, ""What are you, blind?!"" Do you tell them with humor, thus opening an invitation for everyone to continue to make jokes about it, or tell them seriously so that they feel like they have to tiptoe around it? Do you try and find the seemingly nicest person working to ask for help when you need it, or swallow your pride and admit your shortcoming to everyone once in awhile? 
These are things I ask myself in any situation in which I'll be around the same people for days at a time (like work and class). Funny, but getting older helps - after awhile, everyone's vision will start to go : ) 
Sorry, this got long - although I hope it helps you personally to have a deeper understanding of his hesitation. My advice? Take some classes. If he's interested in computers, go to a local community college and take some CS courses so that he's more than comfortable with the processes, and once hired he'll have a lot more confidence. If you guys haven't already, get in touch with your local vocational rehabilitation - they'll help with school, jobs, low vision technology, transportation - extremely worth taking advantage of.

I've only flown once since I started using a cane and had one minor issue.  The airline was either Alaska Airlines or American Airlines (we flew both over the course of that trip) and I was flying back to my home city with a member of my family.  I didn't request assistance because I was with someone who is sighted and I was in my home airport.  I guess the flight crew still called ahead and someone was there to meet me.  They were waiting in the bridge right outside the entrance to the aircraft... *with a wheelchair.*  She basically told me she was there to escort me to the exit and told me to get in.  I told her thanks but that I didn't need assistance and kept walking, the whole interaction lasted less than 3 seconds and she didn't follow me.

132,"I'm completely blind, and played chess moderately seriously during junior high and high school, because it was an activity that wasn't sports, and involved smart people my age.  Back then, I deeply preferred playing online. There were (probably still are, but this was over 10 years ago) chess apps that had been adapted to be accessible with screen-readers that could connect to the internet chess servers.  I had an accessible board of the kind you describe, and when the computer announced to me the move the other player had made, I would make that move on my board, so I could feel it with my hands.  Then I would make my own move on my accessible board, and type it into the computer using algebraic notation.

I found playing this way had the following advantages:

1.  The move timer was built into the software, so I could use my screen-reader to check my time whenever I wanted.

2.  No worries about the first touch rule, or anything else. My move only counted when I got around to typing it into the computer. 

3.  I could examine my board just as much as I wanted, no matter who's turn it was, without having any effect on the other player.  

4.  The other player never even had to know I was blind, and usually didn't.  I found this could remove a lot of barriers caused by the awkwardness or discomfort of the other player.  If you play chess online, it's possible that you have, in fact, played against a blind person and didn't even know it.  

5.  The software automatically recorded all the moves in the game, without any extra effort on my part.  After the game was over, I could review the played game whenever I wanted to help me improve my strategy. The computer also tracked my rating and rank, so I could see if I had improved at all over time.  

Playing online wouldn't work in tournaments, obviously. But I wasn't particularly interested in those; I was in it to make friends and have fun, and that's how I had the most fun.  I made the most friends in the extracurricular chess lessons I took.  Eventually, I realized that being a chess master wasn't in my future, so I mostly gave up the game. I kept the friends, though.

134,"I've played a little... It's all casual against friends and family.  I'm not totally blind so I can't speak for those who are.  The way I get around my challenges with sight while playing Chess is just making slight rule adjustments.  For one touch rule is completely gone, I often can't differentiate between pieces and my solution is feeling the tops, so that rule is completely ignored.  We also never play on a timer, that seems like more of a competitive thing either way.  I've done it once or twice and completely hated it, I didn't have enough time to take in the situation on the board and I ended up rushing decisions that resulted in losses.  Other than that I just ask that I be told when it's my turn, I'll often sit there wondering how long it's going to take someone to move when they made a move 5 minutes earlier and I didn't hear or see the piece go down.

146,"No, that's not quite what I mean by echolocation. When I'm walking, I tap my cane, and I can hear how the sound bounces off of objects around me (street signs, trees, etc).  Based on how they reflect sound, I can generally tell how large an object is, and how far away it is from me, even if I can't tell exactly what it is, or exactly what shape it is.  When I'm standing still, and/or don't have my cane, I make a clicking sound with my tongue, that gives me the same information.  So when I'm walking down the sidewalk, tapping my cane, I can hear the sound reflecting off of street signs and trees just fine.  Or if I'm sitting down somewhere, I can click my tongue and get a vague idea of the size of the room I'm in, and what's near me.  I can generally differentiate between wood objects, cloth objects, and metal objects.  So for your system to be useful to me, it would need to give me more information than the basic size, shape, distance from me, and material of nearby objects.  If your system could let me find ""large wooden object 6 feet in front of me"", I already knew I was walking towards a wall from the sound of my cane tapping, so it hasn't told me anything knew.

171,"I'm 33 male and legally blind. I use a Guide Dog for mobility. I've never been able to read menus at Fish and Chip Shops, McDonalds, Canteens, Cafes.

My best recommendations are similar to others - if you know you are going somewhere in advance find a menu online. If it doesn't have pricing, call in advance and explain your son is vision impaired/legally blind and do they have a menu with pricing you can look at to assist him with his ordering. Especially if this is a place he is likely to frequent often.

If this isn't possible or he goes out on the spur of the moment, my only recommendation is to explain you are vision impaired/legally blind (Fully sighted people get confused if you tell them you are blind but can obviously still see SOMETHING, they associate blindness with total darkness, and the words vision impaired with low vision.)

Ask them what kind of food they serve, what hot food you have today etc. I sometimes ask the person what they like the best out of the food they make. Just be polite, clear spoken and friendly. As soon as 90% of hospitality workers/cashiers realise you have a disability you tend to get there most friendly and helpful customer service. 

I used to try use a monocular when I was little, but I often found that it was impractical and often poor lighting conditions made it pretty useless anyway.

Being at a party/barbecue social gathering where finger food and it is 'help yourself' at a main table can also be quite difficult. Nothing worse than staring at a big table full of blurry colours knowing it all smells great but having no idea what's what. Again, your son is going to have to build his confidence and lean on a friend or relative and ask them to quietly describe what is available and help serve him.

At sit down restaurants I have found my camera on my mobile phone works pretty well as a CCTV to read a menu. If the lighting is just too poor, I have the person I'm with read me the titles of main sections, ask them to say read me the chicken section and just read out titles till i ask for one with more detail. This way you can quickly narrow it down to a few things rather than having someone read out the entire thing verbatim which could be embarrassing for him in a group setting.

As his mum/mom my greatness recommendation is to get him to figure out or use tricks to help himself, or have others help him quietly. It is really easy to get used to someone helping you out all the time, and to milk it or take advantage of the fact you cannot see well. As my mum used to say to me when I was little, if you can see well enough to play with the Legos, then you can feel around with your hands to tidy it all away too.

182,"I'm legally blind and just graduated in May. I'm also 28 - my lateness in graduating is due to the same fears that you currently have. But I did that shit, and if I can, you definitely can. Protips:

1. Get with the disability department of your university. Even if they can't offer solutions to all of your problems, it's on record that you qualify for disability assistance within the college, and therefore your professors have an understanding of what you might come up against.

2. Get a private tutor. Most universities have free tutoring, and that's great if it works for you. For me though, I couldn't bear having to tell someone that I'm legally blind, that I can't see what problem they're referring to in the textbook, that I can't read their tiny handwriting, every single time I needed a tutor. As amusing as it is to watch someone get continuously more flustered at the situation, I chose to spare a lot of people the discomfort and got a private tutor. That way they knew, expected it, and started to adapt quickly. 

3. Vocational Rehabilitation. If you're not already working with the VR in your area, make an appointment like, right now. They'll do everything they can to help you graduate at no cost to you. They got me some tech that was essential to my success - ipad, huge laptop, even bigger moniter, impaired friendly keyboard, Zoomtext software, and a Pebble for reading. 

4. Accept that you'll need help. Go to your professor's office hours as soon as you're able to discuss your concerns. Most of them will want to help - but be prepared for the few that are dicks too, there are a few in every bunch. 

Keep a positive attitude. It's hard, and it can be alienating. But it'll feel pretty fuckin awesome when you graduate.

Many blind or leally blind people are not totally blind. A totally blind person has no light perception.
Many have some. And a legally blind person can have some usable and correctable vision - for example tunnel vision, or some peripheral vision, or some plain cataract looking sight. Or some VI people have nystagmus (your eyes move on a rapid scan without your control - makes reading difficult). Some have some color vision too.
There are so many factors that go in determining one's blindness' status and it's legality. Maybe it's severe night blindness, retinitis pigmentosa, or deafblindness - where many deafblind can actually see some close range sign language or hear something with hearing aids.
