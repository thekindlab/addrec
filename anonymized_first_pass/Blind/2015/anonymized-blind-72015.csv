I totally get wanting to stick with your favorite platform, I'm an Android fanboy to the end and I refuse to switch until I absolutely have to.

My current phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which is about as good as it gets with the Android devices I've used in terms of accessibility.  You can use the S Pen to control a magnifier and it works so well, honestly one of my favorite features.  You can also setup a quick accessibility menu that can be activated by tapping the home button 3 times which will give you access to the toggles for Negative colors, TalkBack, and a shortcut to the full accessibility menu.  This makes it super easy to adjust quickly to different needs.

The TalkBack is unfortunately incredibly weak compared to IOS.  I know Google is working on it but if he occasionally needs to use this feature (like me) it won't be as robust as on the Apple platform.

Android is undoubtedly behind on the accessibility thing, however Google is working hard to make the platform better.  My struggle is that my mobility is impaired.  I use Google Walking Directions to stay oriented in unfamiliar environments but there are a lot of great, blind specific apps like BlindSquare, Seeing Eye, etc. on iPhone that aren't there for Android.

29,"I've lived in San Francisco since 2002, and I only went blind last year. It was sudden and I had no idea it was going to happen to me, so accessibility and that mode of thinking never entered into my mind when coming here for school. Since I have lived here for so long, I know the lay of the land and can still navigate around the city even though I can't see it. I'm still not comfortable with walking around to new locations by myself; I require an orientation and mobility trainer to get to specific destinations or at least train me on a safe route to where I want to go. I have not considered moving anywhere else, and San Francisco has so much to do and so many amazing places to visit and eat and experience in such a small area.The transportation systems are generally good, and I have access to Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft to conveniently get around to places where I want to go when I don't want to deal with the bus or train.

I would say that learning to cope with simple tasks that I used to take for granted when I could see is the most frustrating thing in day to day life. I am getting better at cooking and independent life skills, but a lot of that is trial and very messy errors. When out and about, finding restrooms and having to navigate non-family/single restrooms is difficult. I have basically memorized every Starbucks and coffee shop location around places were my girlfriend and I tend to visit so as to always have a convenient option available when I don't want to deal with a multi person bathroom. I have noticed that people are generally happy to help if I ask for it, which is nice… Much better than being ignored, although you will encounter people that really don't quite know what to do or decide to be over zealous and being helpful before you have a chance to explain exactly what you want them to do.

I think one of the biggest things that I struggle with is not being able to just get out of my house and quickly go do an errand. Everything takes a lot more planning and a lot more time.

It was sudden and I had no idea it was going to happen to me, so accessibility and that mode of thinking never entered into my mind when coming here for school. Since I have lived here for so long, I know the lay of the land and can still navigate around the city even though I can't see it. I'm still not comfortable with walking around to new locations by myself; I require an orientation and mobility trainer to get to specific destinations or at least train me on a safe route to where I want to go. I have not considered moving anywhere else, and <LOCATION> has so much to do and so many amazing places to visit and eat and experience in such a small <URL>e transportation systems are generally good, and I have access to Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft to conveniently get around to places where I want to go when I don't want to deal with the bus or train.

I would say that learning to cope with simple tasks that I used to take for granted when I could see is the most frustrating thing in day to day life. I am getting better at cooking and independent life skills, but a lot of that is trial and very messy errors. When out and about, finding restrooms and having to navigate non-family/single restrooms is difficult. I have basically memorized every Starbucks and coffee shop location around places were my girlfriend and I tend to visit so as to always have a convenient option available when I don't want to deal with a multi person bathroom. I have noticed that people are generally happy to help if I ask for it, which is nice… Much better than being ignored, although you will encounter people that really don't quite know what to do or decide to be over zealous and being helpful before you have a chance to explain exactly what you want them to do.

I think one of the biggest things that I struggle with is not being able to just get out of my house and quickly go do an errand. Everything takes a lot more planning and a lot more time.

61,"In general, I get really fed up with applications where the developers are too lazy to label their buttons. It's one of the easiest things to do when coding, so why they do not label them especially after constant feedback is beyond me. I also hate it when they sacrifice accessibility for form; adding animations and cutesy things around the interface which make it impossible to use via voice over. Being a former animator/designer, I know that form and accessibility can work hand-in-hand for both The sighted and visually impaired.

As for getting around, I live in San Francisco and encounter quite a few issues daily when attempting to use Muni or navigate the streets. The most common issues I encounter are improperly installed tactile mats at intersections/street crossings. Normally at each corner of an intersection, there are supposed to be yellow bumpy tactile mats for each cardinal direction to help cross the street in a straight line. For some stupid reason, the engineers to install these mats get lazy and install only one curb cut that points 45° out into the middle of the intersection rather than having to curbs for each cardinal direction. Sometimes when they're actually are two curb cuts for the proper directions, they are not pointed straight at the other one across the street and are not lined up appropriately which can become dangerous when crossing the street. The locator tone beacons for street crossing signals are also a problem when the volume isn't nearly loud enough to compensate for traffic flow and you can't hear them to adjust your position when crossing the street or navigating to them to get set up for street crossings. I've contacted the traffic in engineering group here several times to get the volume raised on a common route I take, only to have nothing happen even after they say they've changed things.

Getting on subway trains can be problematic when you don't know what train has arrived at the station. There is usually an audible announcement as to what trains are coming and how long it will take to get there, but at most stations The announcement is not loud enough or is located at a part of the station where it is far away from where you have to be to board the train safely. Train operators calling out stop locations when the trains are out of the subway and on the street is also very intermittent and frustrating when you are going to a new location by your self. Sometimes you will get great bus and train operators who announce every stop clearly and efficiently, and then other drivers who don't give a crap and just expect you to know where you are at all times and say nothing the entire trip, even when prompted to do so as soon as I enter the vehicle.

Going back to street crossings, it's really annoying when there is street construction going on and The workers do not properly place safety baffles or appropriately Mark a safe route around the construction. In San Francisco, there is always construction going on, and sadly a lot of it is happening on one of my most common routes through the city. Every day, the area outside the construction zone is different, with different replaced cones and barriers that are always a surprise when attempting to do appropriate cane travel through the site. I actually almost completely walked into the construction area because someone left a fence gate open wide enough that shoreline Eng brought me straight through the entrance rather than around to continue along the fence line outside the zone.

I have a disability parking placard that I bring along when people drive me around. People who temporarily park in blue disabled zones to speak on the phone are profoundly annoying especially when we are attempting to find parking around a busy area of the city.

118,"The post is just fine; discussion and questions are just as welcome as news!  

If I may ask, were you born blind?  I was, so I've never known a life where a lot of these small tasks were easy.  So it just doesn't impact me, because it's how I grew up.  I've often thought people who weren't born blind have it a lot harder, because they have a loss to grieve for, and a better understanding of exactly what they're missing.  

Maybe try thinking of the things that are easier/better for us without sight? There are a few.  Off the top of my head, one big one is that I think I live in a less polluted environment.  To explain, every day the fully sighted are bombarded with images they may not want to see, especially advertising. It's everywhere: painted on buses and trucks, on billboards on the side of the road, on gas station pumps, on textbooks, on flashing neon signs in front of stores, on magazine racks at every check-out counter, printed on soda cups, on the t-shirts of people walking buy, on the TV over the bar, on every web page you ever visit an animated ad is flickering and bouncing, sprayed on graffiti on every wall, and so on, and so on, and so on. Without sight, we just don't have to deal with all of that constant, unending visual spam.  I've never experienced it myself obviously, but I feel like the peace and freedom from that nonsense is quite a mental advantage for me.  

Another one, of course, is that we can do everything in the dark without difficulty.  If you live alone, it does ad up to a small savings on the power bill, because you don't have to turn on the lights just for yourself.  

I don't know if that helps at all; all I can share are my own experiences, and it's quite possible I don't feel the frustrations as deeply as you do.  ",False,False,t1_ct9za57,fastfinge,born blind,0,1437417863,t5_2qpec,t3_3dxzp9,t3_3dxzp9,3,1438031557,0,0,ct9za57,Blind,3,,blue1,,

I also believe taking input from the community on how to make this sub in particular more accessible to more people through adjustments to the CSS for those who use color correction and magnification (like myself) as well as those who use screen readers.  Little things to improve accessibility can make this sub more attractive to the visually impaired community as a whole.

151,"With anything you should absolutely shop around for a guide dog as they're a significant change in your life. Ask what the schools train the dogs to do, what you're expected to pay for and what services they'll pick up in the long term.

I raised two guide dogs (neither made it, they loved too many other things) for two different schools. I have a brother who has a dog as well and he enjoys it but there are times he says a cane is easier and other times where the dog is easier.

As far as things I'd suggest to ask and by no means an exhaustive list:

* What do you train your dogs to do?
* What should I not expect from dogs from your school?
* What expenses will I need to cover?
* Who pays for room and board during training?
* Who pays for transportation to and from training?
* Who pays for the dog? Is it paid for by donations?
* Who covers veterinary care?
* What will be expected of me?
* What is the typical time frame?

As far as getting and making the most out of your dog, it's like anything in life. If you put effort into adjusting your life to accept a guide dog and learning to work together I think you'll find it useful. A dog will need attention and on going training. You should expect any school to expect this from you. If they don't mention it ask them about it.

If you're proactive you can really build a bond of trust with the dog and you'll be able to learn together how to help each other. All for the low cost of some attention and love those dogs will work tirelessly for you.

184,"I'm low vision and really struggle in the dark, I have just about no vision in low light.  Most restaurants that I frequent are pretty low light so I've had to work around that.  I don't really see a way of getting around that without ruining the ambiance for everyone else, as a result I've figured out ways around having no sight in these situations.

Beyond that my three biggest issues are the menu, navigating the restaurant, and the check.

I always carry my video magnifier on me in my messenger bag to help me with text based things, however that has a battery and it has been known to die when I most need it.  I think having a decent amount of large print and Braille menus for those who need them is a good start.

With regards to navigation, I am personally a white cane user with formal orientation and mobility training.  I think if you are looking into training employees getting in touch with a local O&amp;M specialist would be a good start.  I've found that most people who have had formal O&amp;M training usually speak roughly the same language when referring to matters of navigation.  Using things like clock directions is an example.  Usually there isn't too much walking around that needs to be done, but finding the register if the check is paid at there rather than the table, or finding restrooms is particularly challenging at times.  On this note, finding staff members when I need something is pretty difficult at times.  I don't have a specific idea on how to make that easier but an O&amp;M specialist could help come up with a solution for that.

The last piece is the check.  I usually pay with debit so there is a signature required.  I think a lot of staff members forget about all the aspects of being visually impaired and they just leave the receipt at the table.  I have a hard time finding the signature line.  Making sure that the staff asks if the person can find the line is a good start.  Many people (including myself) will carry signature guides, which are small business card sized cards with a hole cut for a signature.  I usually have the person waiting on me place the signature guide on the line and signing is easy.  If for whatever reason I choose not to use a signature guide I usually just ask that the person guide the pen to the line for me and I sign there.  If I'm paying with cash, I think most people prefer to have cash stacked from lowest denomination to highest.  I also appreciate it when they tell me how many of each bill there is because I fold my bills for identification.

With regards to equipment, I typically carry all the equipment that makes my life easier anyway, so I don't know what else you could add.

221,"We really need to do a little more community promotion.  Of the blind people I follow on Twitter, Facebook, etc, most of them still think Reddit is inaccessible to screen readers.  So, of course, they won't have heard about and joined this community.  If we can make this community larger, not only will that be a good thing for us, but having more blind people participating in Reddit overall will raise awareness of access issues in other communities.  

As well, today, most blind people seem to participate in mailing lists, and websites like the Zone, that are entirely separated from the larger online community, even when they share the exact same interests.  I'm convinced that this increasing isolation from the sighted world is an extremely bad thing.  We at /r/blind, by promoting not only our sub, but the use of Reddit in general, could help to lift at least some of this isolation.  

The question, of course, is how?  Off the top of my head:

1.  Podcasts.  A lot of blind people listen to a lot of Podcasts, so it could be helpful to create podcasts that demonstrate how Reddit works, in audio form.  For example, how to use Reddit with NVDA, how to use accessible Reddit apps like Bacon Reader, information about the other subs that those of us active in /r/blind subscribe to and enjoy, etc.  

2.  A twitter account.  I have no idea how, but it must be possible to link a Twitter account to a sub, and have it post out a new link every time a post to /r/blind is made.  Thanks to the many, many accessible Twitter apps like TwBlue, Twitter is where most screen reader users tend to hang out.  Heck, as someone who does check Reddit daily, I'd still find a /r/blind Twitter account useful.  

3.  Host AMAs of interest to the blind community.  A good AMA drives a lot of traffic to a sub.  Perhaps we could host an AMA from someone at a company offering a new accessible service, or a person writing a new book about blindness, etc, etc.  The promotion works both ways, and everyone wins.

222,"So I have actually had my home visit for one school and have an application out for another school.  I am in a similar boat, I have some vision but my O&amp;M encouraged me to seek a dog because of the speed I'm looking to attain that a cane just does not provide.  I actually had a chance to trial run a dog and LOVED it.  It is so much better than a cane in every way, for me.  It definitely is not for everyone, if you like having tactile awareness then you will lose that with a dog.  For me tactile awareness isn't as important as speed.  I'm an urban traveler and have to hit public transit connections fast.

A few things that I learned from my research and speaking with trainers from multiple schools.  The first is make sure your O&amp;M with a cane is solid.  Know how to track traffic phases, use cardinal directions, etc.  You should also make sure your technique with a cane is very refined.  They will need a report from an O&amp;M professional certifying that you can do all of this.

The other thing is make sure you live in an area and have activity patterns that would warrant the use of a dog.  They won't give them out to people who won't be able to adequately work the dog.  Being an independent traveler as a pedestrian/ public transit commuter was appealing to the schools I applied for.  

The last big piece is financial.  Dog schools are essentially free for most schools.  The only school I've ever heard of charging is Seeing Eye, and it's $200 I believe.  That is nothing compared to what it costs to pair and train you with a dog.  Every other school is completely free, at least the schools I've applied for.  They will pay your airfare both ways, lodging, food, dog, equipment, and everything else.  However when you get out you have to support the dog yourself.  You need to be able to cover food, veterinary care, and all other expenses.  The estimates I saw were over $1000 a year to maintain a guide dog, and there is usually about a ten year working life before you are supposed to retire the dog. 

There are a lot of positives and a lot of negatives.  For me the positives vastly outweigh the negatives so I'm going forward with it.  I've been thinking about this decision for several months now and finally decided to go with the recommendations I was getting.  It's a lifestyle shift but it may be worth it for you.
