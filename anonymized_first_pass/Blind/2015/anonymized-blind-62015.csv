I'm 19 and haven't been officially diagnosed yet but my optometrist has said I have myopic macular degeneration, and i'm currently going through tests to test for retinitis pigmentosa as my ophthalmologist said he thinks I might have it too. I was aiming to be a General Practitioner but have taken a year off school to get my eyes sorted out and decide what I'm going to pursue. I've though a lot about it and still am not totally sure what way I'm going to go but it will be very, very tough to pursue a medical career if my vision goes quickly, and i'd imagine the same for any STEM degree. There's really no putting it light that you may really need to consider something else. At the same time though if you plan on working around computers a lot i'm sure there are a lot of programs to help you with that so you might be able to do it. I've read about a guy that went to Business  school and now works for a huge American Bank (I can't remember the name but i've seen it thrown around a lot), and i've read about a woman going to university and getting a Degree (Again it's slipped my mind) both while being blind, so there is hope. I'd imagine in astronomy and engineering you need to be able to see graphs and lines and things, i'd imagine that's going to be difficult blind.

So yeah just think about you future and what is reasonable. If a lot of your data that you work with is presented on graphs and other visual things, it might not be reasonable.

Stay positive though even if it gets hard, who knows what the future has in store for us, there are already bionic eye's in the making and maybe one day in our lifetime they will be good at manipulating stem cells to just grow a new retina or some shit.
