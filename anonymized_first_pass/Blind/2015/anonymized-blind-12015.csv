40,"I would suggest you learn a bit more about braille. There are two reading levels of braille. Level 1 braille is basic braille taught to beginners and children. Unfortunately there aren't many books in Level 1 braille that are not considered children's books. Level 2 braille uses a lot of contractions since braille takes up a lot of space and there are no font sizes saving space is important. Another thing to note for English speakers is that the English braille code is changing. All English speaking countries are changing to Unified English Braille (UEB) so it will be beneficial to you to start learning that code. Math uses another code but I will not get into that one. 

That being said there are several books you can start with. The first is *Braille for the Sighted* by Stanley Collins. The second is *Just Enough to know Better* by Eileen Curran. There are many other books out there but those are the ones that I can think of at the top of my head. Print/braille books might also be helpful. Remember that most young adult and adult books are written in Level 2 braille and are pressed to be double sided making it difficult to try to sight read them. 

You might also want to get an alphabet card. We have them (National Braille Press) and I can mail you one for free but these are not UEB. Once you are familiar with the basic alphabet code you can begin learning contracted braille. UEBonline.org is a good place to start learning Level 2 braille.

There are two reading levels of braille. Level 1 braille is basic braille taught to beginners and children. Unfortunately there aren't many books in Level 1 braille that are not considered children's books. Level 2 braille uses a lot of contractions since braille takes up a lot of space and there are no font sizes saving space is important. Another thing to note for English speakers is that the English braille code is changing. All English speaking countries are changing to Unified English Braille (UEB) so it will be beneficial to you to start learning that code. Math uses another code but I will not get into that one. 

That being said there are several books you can start with. The first is *Braille for the Sighted* by <PERSON>. The second is *Just Enough to know Better* by <PERSON>.

* The cost to produce braille literature is a lot higher than the cost to produce print books. There is no average in the same way there is no average price for print books. Now I can't speak for all braille presses but we believe in parity not charity so we charge the same amount for a braille book as we would for a print book.

48,"I didn't do a very thorough examination of assistive technology yet. What I found on youtube though didn't look very promising to me.

Two key parts of the system will be the custom editor, which will be very VIM-like, and the custom code-to-speech transformer.

In editing source code in a normal editor we as sighted people use visual feedback loops for just about anything. In VIM, a lot of these feedback loops are already abbreviated. If I want to delete a line in a normal texteditor, I have to select the line and then delete it with a key. In vim, I just press dd, and the line is gone. More complicated things like ""delete everything inside this html tag"" is also easy.

While a braille display could still be useful there, I don't want to require it (for now). The braille keyboards I have seen look as if they need several keystrokes for many characters. I don't believe that this is a good idea for an editor which relies on key combinations to do most of the work.

Another important factor in this framework is the way the user interface is programmed. For example, this is a rough design of how a user interaction with keyboard and tts would look like.


    def addition_drill():
        yield from speak(""Mental Addition Drill."")
        ndigits = yield from number_input(""Enter number of digits"")
        yield from speak(""Let's start."")
        for i in range(10):
            a = randint(0,10**ndigits)
            b = randint(0,10**ndigits)
            question = str(a) + "" plus "" + str(b)
            c = yield from number_input (question)
            if a+b == c:
                 yield from speak(""Correct."")
            else:
                 yield from speak(""Wrong answer. "" + q + "" is "" + str(c))

I haven't implemented all the details yet, but general keyboard events etc work already. The ""yield from"" syntax enables us to use coroutines/generators for asynchronous processing.

My thinking is that it would be easier for blind programmers, especially beginners, to write user interactions this way rather than create windows, widgets, html code etc which then have to be decoded again with the screen reader. And this model still allows for concurrency just as normal user interface frameworks do.

A nice benefit is that this user interface does not require a windowing system or even a screen.",False,False,t1_co1uw8b,bayesian_horse,,0,1422319380,t5_2qpec,t3_2tpfjk,t3_2tpfjk,1,1424373235,0,0,co1uw8b,Blind,1,,,,
