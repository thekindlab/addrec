5,"No problem :)  I got my intensive training over this past summer through a local organization, the program was for people about to enter (like myself) or just starting college, and it was just for people in my local area.  

&amp;nbsp;

My instructors have spoken very highly of the Leader Dog Accelerated O&amp;M program though which doesn't have an age/ stage in life/ location requirement.  I think I also mentioned that I'm pretty sure you get a free Trekker, I know you do in the guide dog program.

&amp;nbsp;

When I started cane training I had absolutely zero intention of pursuing a guide dog.  I had this idea that it was just for people with total blindness, or absolutely no functional vision whatsoever.  I had an O&amp;M ask me if I was thinking about it and encourage me to do it because of my fast pace and public transit commuting.  After working with him and having a chance to do both a Juno walk and a trial run on a guide dog in training, I decided that it was what I wanted to do.  At this time I don't have a guide dog, however I was accepted into a couple of programs and have decided with my O&amp;Ms to go with Leader Dogs for the Blind.  So basically I'm flying out in June to get my first guide dog at Leader.  I can't really speak for the experience other than the hour or so I had to actually walk with one, but it was an incredible experience for me and I'm way too excited for June right now.  So yeah, that's where I stand with the guide dog.

Have a volunteer watching the movie do their own audio description as it is playing, which could then be fed to headphones.  Could be an interesting activity for any students in a theatre/drama program.

I am not pursuing anymore cane training at this point as I feel confident in traveling independently.  I don't think you necessarily need that amount if you are feeling good but it was definitely helpful to me.  I'd say if you don't feel confident yet, get more, insist to local organizations and your local Rehab Services for the Blind (If you are in the <LOCATION>) that you feel that you need more training.

41,"Well, we made an app for Android called:

[DrawBack Blind Draw and Feel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stereomatch.blind.draw.back.tactile)

The original intent was for it to be the blind man's drawing tool - where they could draw with finger, and then feel what they have drawn.

This arose out of some discussions we were having in the eyes-free google group (which is a group for blind and visually impaired android users - we were there because we interact with them to get one of our audio recorder apps to be accessible for blind users as well - since it is designed to be used for heads-up use).

Anyway, with all that context out of the way, the app itself does not in practice work that well.  The problem is that we used vibration of the phones to simulate the buzz you feel when your fingerprints moves ridge by ridge over a texture.

That was the intention - to make a phone give the sense of haptic feedback or tactile feedback similar to swiping your finger over a piece of paper or a textured surface.

In practice it doesn't work that well, because phone vibration modules are not that responsive, and are usually just oscillators.

HOWEVER, there is potential if we were to use audio feedback, where the audio were to mimic the sense you get from feeling a textured surface - well like a phonograph needle moving over a textured surface type of thing - that could be done.  But android's audio latency is not so great (compared to iphone).  So it remains to be seen how perfect that could be made.

But we had several users on the eyes-free google group test it out, and some of them reported they were able to write simple letters and recognize them by feeling.

Later we also got feedback that one of the users there had used it to instruct blind children - i.e. had them draw things, and then used an embossing printer to print out the stuff.  And then had them feel that actual print with their fingers.

So anyway, it is something you could try.  And it is free.


Another thing you could try if the child can understand English - is our app:

[Amazing Audio Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stereomatch.amazing.audio.voice.recorder)

This is the app we were saying were interacting with the eyes-free google group about.

This is probably the best audio recorder app available on android for blind users.

Our next app (currently in Alpha Test) is already being tested by blind users (it has background recording, MP3 recording etc.) - and they say they are making it their main audio recorder app.

However, for your purpose you can use the current app whose link is above - it doesn't have background recording.

But what you could do is use it to have the child record sounds and play them back - it has a convenient and centrally located buttons.

NOTE: for blind users, you would use TalkBack, the screen reader for the blind which is included with Android devices - Settings - Accessibility - TalkBack - turn it ON.  Not sure if an autistic child will find the sounds that makes disconcerting or not, since TalkBack makes a lot of noises like that.

But one feature these apps have is Ear Detect.  In this, you can record just by moving phone to ear, and moving it away to pause.  Then you can play it back.  You can also flip phone so it is face down to record, and face up to pause etc.

Perhaps a better one may have been one where it played back immediately after you moved the phone away from ear.

For that you could try some of the Talking Tom Cat type of apps, which will speak back what is said (but in a usually higher pitched voice so it sounds like a cat I guess).

Anyway, just some ideas.

You can arrange the apps anywhere on your screen. Folders are useful - so items can be put where htey make sense. For instance ""books"" for a folder with all book related items, ""social medias"", ""videos"" and so on.
You can also put e.g. Apps of a specific kind on the corners or on the left or right side of the screen and so on.

It did take a bit of figuring out how I'd arrange mine shifting from using without VO to using with VO and all the other accessibility things on.

Talkback on Samsung seems pretty good too, but I've only played shortly with it.
With VO you can just set up and try so many things. So many languages are included too, and voices. So if you don't like the standard voice, try with different ones. I often use one of the UK voices. And you can have multiple languages working on the same time - so if some text doesnt get recognized and read correctly, put two fingers on the screen and do a rotary motion to get to rotary settings where you'll find language (after you've set VO to use more than one voice), and can just swipe up or down to pick a different one. 
This langusge thing can be a huge benefit to multilanguage people. And also a nice new discovery for learning new languages - because why not :) 
The voices are clear and have a correct type intonation, so I've been tempted to find a course that works with VO for Japanese....

87,"Well, it depends on the movie.  Musicals can actually be the worst without audio description, because so much of the character interaction is through dance and physical movement, and the dialogue is forced to be a song, meaning it can't always address what the characters are doing at the moment.  Older black and white movies tend to be some of the easiest to follow; they were filmed to be watched on a small, black and white screen, and the script-writers were often the same people writing audio only scripts for old time radio dramas.  Also, there was no CGI or other advanced effects, so a lot more of the plot had to be presented through dialogue.  

To be blunt though, I probably wouldn't go to a public movie event that didn't offer audio description.  Even when I watch movies with friends, if I know what we're planning on watching in advance, I'll listen to the movie first by myself so I can either hear the audio description or read the screenplay.  That way, I can follow what's going on, and they don't have to have the description track turned on, or pause and describe things to me.  But that only works well when I'm enjoying movies or TV shows with friends.  I often find myself enjoying my friends reacting to the movie, because I already know exactly what's going to happen, more than I enjoy my second listen to the film.  In a public venue where I don't know anyone, and everyone's being totally silent anyway because it's a public viewing, I wouldn't get to have that experience.  And the same movie twice in a row just doesn't appeal to me at all.  

If you're focusing on accessibility though, I would encourage you to just leave the audio description on for everyone.  You already have to leave the captions on the screen for the deaf people, so I don't see why playing the audio description to everyone is any worse.  Also, it raises awareness that audio described movies are a thing.  It drives me crazy that a lot of these types of events are perfectly OK with turning captions on, and displaying subtitles on the screen to everyone, but refuse to turn on audio descriptions.  If you're not turning on captions, don't turn on audio description.  If you're turning on captions, audio description needs to be on, to.  But if you have neither audio descriptions nor captions, you're not accessible to blind or deaf people, meaning you might as well call it a movie night for the physically disabled.

97,"/u/geoffisblind put it perfectly, I couldn't have said it better myself.

It's amazing how much you adapt &amp; adjust.

When I lost most of my sight last year (stroke during heart procedure) I thought my gaming days were over - I only have tunnel vision on my right side &amp; I'm totally blind at night/low light.

1yr later, after changing monitor to one with a square screen, relearning how to 'look' around with the mouse since I only see the middle of the screen - I can now play shooters again.  Completed FarCry 4, All the Borderlands games.

I also have mobility problems and can only walk about 20yds or so - again after relearning how to look around and scan my environment, I'm now able to get out on a mobility scooter and not stay trapped in the house.

It's only natural to be worried - I came close to a complete breakdown.  In the space of one week I lost most of my sight, my cat died just short of his 26th birthday and we found out my father had a massive brain tumour that took up the entire left side of his skull.  Also support for people with sudden sight loss is abysmal in the UK so I was basically dumped at home with no support or knowing how to cook/function on a day to day basis.

But I coped and now enjoy 99% of the things I used to.  Made my own latex prosthetics for a Halloween outfit and have taken up making latex masks as a hobby - something I never though about even when I had full sight.

If you're struggling with your phone - I've heard good things about the Iphone and blind users.  If it's out of your price range (like me), I bought a Windows phone - Nokia 635.

It's amazing how much you adapt &amp; adjust.

When I lost most of my sight last year (stroke during heart procedure) I thought my gaming days were over - I only have tunnel vision on my right side &amp; I'm totally blind at night/low light.

1yr later, after changing monitor to one with a square screen, relearning how to 'look' around with the mouse since I only see the middle of the screen - I can now play shooters again.  Completed FarCry 4, All the <LOCATION> games.

I also have mobility problems and can only walk about 20yds or so - again after relearning how to look around and scan my environment, I'm now able to get out on a mobility scooter and not stay trapped in the house.

It's only natural to be worried - I came close to a complete breakdown.  In the space of one week I lost most of my sight, my cat died just short of his 26th birthday and we found out my father had a massive brain tumour that took up the entire left side of his skull.  Also support for people with sudden sight loss is abysmal in the <LOCATION> so I was basically dumped at home with no support or knowing how to cook/function on a day to day basis.

But I coped and now enjoy 99% of the things I used to.  Made my own latex prosthetics for a Halloween outfit and have taken up making latex masks as a hobby - something I never though about even when I had full sight.

1) Speeding really isn't a problem.  IMHO the penalties are high enough, and raising them further doesn't really fix anything.

2) The driving tests have nothing at all to do with driving skill.  Having to take the test more regularly won't improve how people drive.

4) More incentives for carpooling aren't going to help, because there's no way to give people enough incentive to make it worth their time.  Even here in california, where the roads are terrible, I still don't bother to carpool - it's just not worth the effort.

5) This one is an infrastructure issue.  I don't know that law enforcement would ever be able to do that effectively.

6) Heck yeah, self driving cars are the way to go.  Self driving cars basically fix all the problems, all at once.

7) I don't think a non-qualified license is the correct way to handle self driving cars.  I'm pretty sure that set of problems will be solved a different way.

8) This is another area I don't think is necessary, but that's more because I think liability will be handled differently when we have these kinds of vehicles.  I wouldn't worry about this just yet.

9) Again, driving test reform is likely to do nothing but waste people's time.  It's not going to magically make people into better drivers.

10) Anti-cell phone laws already exist.  The problem isn't that it's illegal, the problem is that there's no way to catch enough people doing it for it to matter.  Again, a problem that goes away with self driving cars.

141,"As of now I think I have enough in the way of social media already.  I primarily use Reddit and Twitter; occasionally I'll venture onto Facebook or Tumblr if I have time.  At this stage I have neither the time nor the desire to engage in a new form of social media.  In addition I think social media is supposed to be a way of engaging with people who have different experiences, I love the community here at /r/Blind, but I also love that people who aren't necessarily part of the blind/ visually impaired community who come into to take part in the discussion.  In addition Reddit provides the platform for this community as well as a number of other communities I'm interested in from my local area to my academic interests.  That's what makes it different.  I wouldn't want to just get on a network of blind/ visually impaired individuals because it isolates the community from the broader global community, if that makes sense.  As I said, the reason why I love /r/Blind is that it integrates this community into the broader Reddit community which makes this place so unique.

&amp;nbsp;

So in summary, I probably wouldn't use it personally.  What I would suggest looking into is making systems that allow the blind and visually impaired to access existing social media more easily.  There are a number of third party Reddit apps, maybe make one that is optimized for those who are blind and visually impaired.  Something like that would be great, but like I said at this stage I wouldn't adopt a new social media platform solely for the blind.",,,,geoffisblind,LCA (Low Vision),,1448596858,t5_2qpec,t3_3uduvh,t3_3uduvh,2,1450045381,0,0,cxee97x,Blind,2,,blue1,,
142,"I think in general, you will express the big emotions the same as a person who has normal vision.  However, some people with visual impairments may have conditions that effect the muscles in their eyes and therefore, may not have all the subtle movements.  In addition, you don't get that feedback from others if you are completely blind.  

Ex 1:  I'm visually impaired with astigmatism.  My eyes cannot focus for a long time on an object and typically shoot out to the sides a bit.  I do try to look at people who are talking to me in order to look attentive but I just can't keep my eyes on a thing.

Ex 2:  One of our family friends who can only see light and shadows will make random facial expressions over a conversation.  While a lot of us have a blank face for when we don't feel strong emotions, he (as well as a few other low-vision individuals I know) will show more extreme facial expressions even during a no-nonsense conversation.  This is probably due to not getting those social cues that tell us that we need to look a certain way for people.  I guess the best way to describe it is a bit like how the face of a toddler changes when you talk to them.

143,"This is really interesting, and you have some good points.  It's something I've thought about as well.  Since you raise a lot of points I'm going to respond in the order of the points you made.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 1: harsher penalties for speeding. This one is self explanatory, mostly, but it comes from the fact that I hear so much about how people have to speed to keep in line with other traffic, or they don't feel safe. This is stupid, IMO, and if people can't follow the rules, they shouldn't be allowed to drive the most dangerous machinery that everyone has access to.

&amp;nbsp;

So at least in my area this would not go down well.  Tickets in general have been under significant scrutiny in a lot of areas.  The accusation is that local governments are establishing quotas to maintain fines as a revenue stream.  Whether the allegations are true are up for debate but the concern is real and very controversial.  Although an emphasis on following the rules of the road should be there I don't know if increasing fines is necessarily viable because of the controversy of raising those prices.  While it makes sense that when people are operating vehicles they should be cognizant of the rules, that just doesn't happen (as we all know too well).  I doubt many people would get behind this in a vote, and it would have the potential to harm the political careers of representatives.  However if speeding were cut there would undoubtedly be an increase in safety, not just for the blind and visually impaired but for the community as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 2: Everyone retakes the test every 2 years. I know the DMV is a place where souls go to die, but if people had to go through all the tests every two years, the number of poor drivers should decrease because they're getting up-to-date training every two years.

&amp;nbsp;

I discussed the idea of public resistance in the last point, but I'll touch on it here again.  People would not like this, vote for it, or support politicians who ran on this as part of their platform.  However, I think this one is more possible, and would probably have a more meaningful impact on preventing dangerous driving.  A few years ago I had a summer job where the only people working in the warehouse (except for forklift drivers) were legally blind.  There was a woman who was legally blind who drove to work every day because her license hadn't expired yet.  She almost hit me twice, as well as a fellow coworker and this drove me insane.  This person of course thought it was hilarious that she had almost killed/ seriously injured me.  I totally get independence but when someone is unable to operate a vehicle to the point of harming someone else it is time to hang up the license.  In short, I totally get you on this and agree that this needs to be a thing.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Mandatory statewide day-to-day transit services for people with disabilities. I can get to a doctor appointment just fine though my medicaid, but the grocery store, bank, and a job are more difficult to get to, and that's dumb.

&amp;nbsp;

This is another nice thought, but in areas that are struggling with funding it may be difficult to make it happen.  I've kind of just accepted public transit as my only means for independent commuting which is fine by me, I kind of like getting outside and walking.  However this admittedly takes longer than getting a ride but I usually just try to plan ahead.  Some people don't like this and I totally get it, but individual transit for people who can't drive due to a disability would be enormously expensive and most places will probably stick to offering discounted Call-A-Ride services.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 4. More incentives for carpooling/mass transit. A special lane that people abuse anyway isn't enough, especially since that lane isn't available everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Couldn't agree more :)  The amount of cars on the roads, particularly in the US is entirely too high and the country would benefit greatly from a more efficient and refined public transit system in it's major urban centers.  I like to use London, New York, and Chicago as examples of places that do it right.  I think refining public transit systems incentives their use in and of themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 5. Civilians should be able to use their phones to record a speeding or unsafe driver and give that information to law enforcement efficiently. I can't tell you how many times I've almost been hit by people not observing white cane laws, and I want those people to understand how unfair it is that I have almost no recourse.

&amp;nbsp;

At least in the US I don't think there is anything illegal about this.  When in public people shouldn't have any reasonable expectation of privacy and lots of times cell phone recordings are used as evidence in all kinds of cases.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 6: self-driving vehicles should be incentivized. Companies should get more grants from the Dept of Transit, owners should get tax breaks/credits.

&amp;nbsp;

This is definitely the way to go.  Self driving cars are definitely the way of the future and they kind of solve every other problem on the road today with regards to poor driving habits.  However the technology is still not all the way flushed out and it is very expensive.  Google and more recently Tesla have been having a lot of success with it, and other companies are hard at work.  There are a lot of political hoops to jump through before it becomes a thing though.  We just have to play the waiting game, but I am really excited about the progression of this technology.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 7: More on autonomous vehicles: We need a new class of driver's license; Non-qualified operator license. This license would be given to someone who owns an autonomous vehicle, but can't operate a non-autonomous one for some reason, either because they have a disability or chose not to. If there's an accident, non-qualified operators can't be at fault unless they actively screwed up somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know how viable this is.  One of the biggest controversies over autonomous cars is who will be at fault in the event of a fatality.  If a license is offered to those with disabilities that prevent the safe operation of a vehicle that gives the immunity from responsibility over their vehicle, everyone will want one regardless of disability.  This I think will be the hardest part of getting autonomous vehicles on the road regularly and it still needs to be worked on in the legal system.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 8: Disabled owners of autonomous vehicles should have their auto-insurance be part of their medicaid.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think any politician would give the go ahead on this.  It also seems like it is assigning an unfair privilege that tax payers have to pick up to insure a convenience item.  Everyone else has to pay their own insurance, it's part of owning a vehicle.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 9: in general, more strict driving tests, and getting a traffic ticket should mean automatic retraining that the driver has to pay for. Dept of Transit can use increase in funding to help pay for aforementioned medicaid-auto insurance and other stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

I can get on board with more strict and frequent driving tests, too many people are incompetent drivers that don't deserve a license.  Driving is a privilege, not a right.  However I can't get behind increased fines, it just seems far too harsh.  In addition fining people more to pay to subsidize free insurance for disabled drivers probably wouldn't go down so well.  I also take issue with the idea of an immediate requirement of payment and suspending the license until it is paid (if I read that correctly).  Many people rely on their vehicle to get to work to pay for that ticket, removing that ability makes things harder and is kind of counterproductive.  In addition, not all tickets make sense, I have family members who have had to fight stop light camera tickets because it was taking pictures of plates even though they weren't running them.  The same goes for questionable speeding tickets.  Everyone should have the ability to contest those charges in court without being punished in the meantime for an infraction that they possibly didn't commit. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 10: using a cell phone while driving is a primary infraction, and hands-free calling setups of any kind are no exception. Any use of cell phones while traveling more than 10mph results in a ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

So I have family in California, they really don't care about the no phone rules.  I don't think these kinds of laws actually work anywhere.  I don't think anyone is going to give up their hands free calling either.  The fact is that the distraction is there and it's up to drivers to be responsible about what they are doing but increasing the penalty isn't going to make people stop doing it.  Just look at speeding, I have a family member who was caught speeding way over the limit, $600 dollar ticket... he still speeds.  If you just revoked licenses then no one would be able to drive, I can't think of a single driver that I know who hasn't been pulled over for speeding and/ or ticketed.  Tickets just make everyone angry and they don't really prevent speeding practically.

&amp;nbsp;

I think you raise some good points, it's just some things aren't all that viable.  I for sure think that autonomous cars need to be integrated into the traffic system as soon as possible.  Anyway, thanks for sharing :)  I love discussions about this kind of stuff and hearing other people's input on how we can improve.  It's good to think about.

It's something I've thought about as well.  Since you raise a lot of points I'm going to respond in the order of the points you made.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 1: harsher penalties for speeding. This one is self explanatory, mostly, but it comes from the fact that I hear so much about how people have to speed to keep in line with other traffic, or they don't feel safe. This is stupid, IMO, and if people can't follow the rules, they shouldn't be allowed to drive the most dangerous machinery that everyone has access to.

&amp;nbsp;

So at least in my area this would not go down well.  Tickets in general have been under significant scrutiny in a lot of areas.  The accusation is that local governments are establishing quotas to maintain fines as a revenue stream.  Whether the allegations are true are up for debate but the concern is real and very controversial.  Although an emphasis on following the rules of the road should be there I don't know if increasing fines is necessarily viable because of the controversy of raising those prices.  While it makes sense that when people are operating vehicles they should be cognizant of the rules, that just doesn't happen (as we all know too well).  I doubt many people would get behind this in a vote, and it would have the potential to harm the political careers of representatives.  However if speeding were cut there would undoubtedly be an increase in safety, not just for the blind and visually impaired but for the community as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 2: Everyone retakes the test every 2 years. I know the DMV is a place where souls go to die, but if people had to go through all the tests every two years, the number of poor drivers should decrease because they're getting up-to-date training every two years.

&amp;nbsp;

I discussed the idea of public resistance in the last point, but I'll touch on it here again.  People would not like this, vote for it, or support politicians who ran on this as part of their platform.  However, I think this one is more possible, and would probably have a more meaningful impact on preventing dangerous driving.  A few years ago I had a summer job where the only people working in the warehouse (except for forklift drivers) were legally blind.  There was a woman who was legally blind who drove to work every day because her license hadn't expired yet.  She almost hit me twice, as well as a fellow coworker and this drove me insane.  This person of course thought it was hilarious that she had almost killed/ seriously injured me.  I totally get independence but when someone is unable to operate a vehicle to the point of harming someone else it is time to hang up the license.  In short, I totally get you on this and agree that this needs to be a thing.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Mandatory statewide day-to-day transit services for people with disabilities. I can get to a doctor appointment just fine though my medicaid, but the grocery store, bank, and a job are more difficult to get to, and that's dumb.

&amp;nbsp;

This is another nice thought, but in areas that are struggling with funding it may be difficult to make it happen.  I've kind of just accepted public transit as my only means for independent commuting which is fine by me, I kind of like getting outside and walking.  However this admittedly takes longer than getting a ride but I usually just try to plan ahead.  Some people don't like this and I totally get it, but individual transit for people who can't drive due to a disability would be enormously expensive and most places will probably stick to offering discounted Call-A-Ride services.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 4. More incentives for carpooling/mass transit. A special lane that people abuse anyway isn't enough, especially since that lane isn't available everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Couldn't agree more :)  The amount of cars on the roads, particularly in the <LOCATION> is entirely too high and the country would benefit greatly from a more efficient and refined public transit system in it's major urban centers.  I like to use <LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> as examples of places that do it right.  I think refining public transit systems incentives their use in and of themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 5. Civilians should be able to use their phones to record a speeding or unsafe driver and give that information to law enforcement efficiently. I can't tell you how many times I've almost been hit by people not observing white cane laws, and I want those people to understand how unfair it is that I have almost no recourse.

&amp;nbsp;

At least in the <LOCATION> I don't think there is anything illegal about this.  When in public people shouldn't have any reasonable expectation of privacy and lots of times cell phone recordings are used as evidence in all kinds of cases.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 6: self-driving vehicles should be incentivized. Companies should get more grants from the Dept of Transit, owners should get tax breaks/credits.

&amp;nbsp;

This is definitely the way to go.  Self driving cars are definitely the way of the future and they kind of solve every other problem on the road today with regards to poor driving habits.  However the technology is still not all the way flushed out and it is very expensive.  Google and more recently Tesla have been having a lot of success with it, and other companies are hard at work.  There are a lot of political hoops to jump through before it becomes a thing though.  We just have to play the waiting game, but I am really excited about the progression of this technology.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 7: More on autonomous vehicles: We need a new class of driver's license; Non-qualified operator license. This license would be given to someone who owns an autonomous vehicle, but can't operate a non-autonomous one for some reason, either because they have a disability or chose not to. If there's an accident, non-qualified operators can't be at fault unless they actively screwed up somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know how viable this is.  One of the biggest controversies over autonomous cars is who will be at fault in the event of a fatality.  If a license is offered to those with disabilities that prevent the safe operation of a vehicle that gives the immunity from responsibility over their vehicle, everyone will want one regardless of disability.  This I think will be the hardest part of getting autonomous vehicles on the road regularly and it still needs to be worked on in the legal system.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 8: Disabled owners of autonomous vehicles should have their auto-insurance be part of their medicaid.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think any politician would give the go ahead on this.  It also seems like it is assigning an unfair privilege that tax payers have to pick up to insure a convenience item.  Everyone else has to pay their own insurance, it's part of owning a vehicle.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 9: in general, more strict driving tests, and getting a traffic ticket should mean automatic retraining that the driver has to pay for. Dept of Transit can use increase in funding to help pay for aforementioned medicaid-auto insurance and other stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

I can get on board with more strict and frequent driving tests, too many people are incompetent drivers that don't deserve a license.  Driving is a privilege, not a right.  However I can't get behind increased fines, it just seems far too harsh.  In addition fining people more to pay to subsidize free insurance for disabled drivers probably wouldn't go down so well.  I also take issue with the idea of an immediate requirement of payment and suspending the license until it is paid (if I read that correctly).  Many people rely on their vehicle to get to work to pay for that ticket, removing that ability makes things harder and is kind of counterproductive.  In addition, not all tickets make sense, I have family members who have had to fight stop light camera tickets because it was taking pictures of plates even though they weren't running them.  The same goes for questionable speeding tickets.  Everyone should have the ability to contest those charges in court without being punished in the meantime for an infraction that they possibly didn't commit. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; 10: using a cell phone while driving is a primary infraction, and hands-free calling setups of any kind are no exception. Any use of cell phones while traveling more than 10mph results in a ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think anyone is going to give up their hands free calling either.  The fact is that the distraction is there and it's up to drivers to be responsible about what they are doing but increasing the penalty isn't going to make people stop doing it.

&amp;nbsp;

Other than that, I can offer advice on things to look into to start getting exposure to, some of this will probably only be applicable later on, but maybe one of these things will be useful now, or will give you an idea.  I should also note that I am primarily a PC user so compatibility may or may not be an issue.

&amp;nbsp;

For math, I would look into getting a fully fledged calculator, Texas Instruments has emulators that you can put on a computer, and you should be able to find one on the Mac App Store as well.

&amp;nbsp;

In terms of English, I would make sure she is proficient in typing.  When I was in grade 1 I was taught on a program called Type To Learn.  I was having less issues with my eyes at the time though so this may or may not work.  You should definitely find her a program to get her typing proficiently, that skill has been the most valuable skill I have when working with a computer as a visually impaired person.  You can also look at Dragon Dictation which I have used and liked, but I ended up sticking to typing in the long run. 

&amp;nbsp;

For science, I can't think of anything that would be super useful at her age.  In high school level junior and senior sciences (Chemistry and AP Physics I) I've been introduced to software called LoggerPro, and next semester (my last semester of high school) I am receiving some instruction on Matlab.

&amp;nbsp;

LoggerPro is for data analysis and graphing from sensors like a photogate or digital thermometer.  Matlab, from what I understand is a programmable, customization data analysis calculation platform that is used in lots of STEM education and in most of the STEM fields on a professional level.  I can't imagine a 1st grader getting into all of that quite yet, but perhaps some of these will be a good jumping off point.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll respond to your last questions now:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What is the hardest part of your day? Getting ready? Walking to a destination?

&amp;nbsp;

I'd say the hardest part of day to day interaction, excluding school related accessibility issues are mobility related, I have very restricted fields of view and if it is too dark or too bright I have no functional vision.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What are you currently using to get around?

&amp;nbsp;

I currently use a white cane in conjunction with a HumanWare Trekker Breeze + mobility GPS.  In June I am getting my first guide dog.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Is your day generally pretty structured or restricted because of mobility restrictions?

&amp;nbsp;

During the week when I don't have time to spend two hours oh a whim to get from place to place on my city's less than ideal transit system so I usually don't venture off my schedule.  However if something comes up I am certainly not restricted from getting there, it's just more inconvenient.  For example, I went to visit someone in the hospital a few weeks ago, it took me a little longer, but I was able to do it.  I think once you get good understanding of how to navigate public transit and strong O&amp;M skills it is easy enough to do. It's not that hard, but it certainly takes longer than it would if I could get private transportation everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What types of technologies do you use? Smart phones? Smart Watches?

&amp;nbsp;

I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, I may switch to iOS at some point because the accessibility on Android is a little bit lackluster.  I really don't want to, I'm an Android fanboy to the death but I may have to swallow my pride at some point.  Anyway, I use Google Maps on that for walking directions sometimes if I just need quick directions and don't want to go through the somewhat tedious process of programming a destination into my Trekker.  I don't use a Smart Watch, probably won't ever.  I prefer my [Eone Bradley](https://www.eone-time.com/) tactile watch.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If you do use a smart phone what does that usage look like? talking into the phone?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not 100% I understand this question.  In terms of usage it gets used for phone calls/ texts mostly, occasionally I go through Twitter and Reddit on it, but I like to keep my web browsing/ social media/ Reddit usage to my computer where it is *much* easier.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;How is health insurance utilized for being visually impaired? Meaning what tools (seeing eye dogs, canes) are covered?

&amp;nbsp;

So my experience may be a little different from everyone else's.  This kind of thing varies from country to country.  I'm in the US, and I have health insurance.  Insurance covers most of my eye care/ glasses until my deductible is met and then it covers all of it.  That is the extent of what insurance will do for me.  All of my devices/ canes have either come from my pocket, independent non-profits or my state's Department of Social Services Rehabilitation Services for the Blind.  Canes in my experience aren't horribly expensive, and lots of places will provide them for free along with training (at least in my area).

&amp;nbsp;

Guide dogs are a bit of a different story, and fortunately I have a little bit of insight because I have completed the application and admissions process to get my first this June.  I know we have some current guide dog users here too and they can probably offer better insight than me.  Here is what I do know though.  First, getting a guide dog at most schools in the US is completely free.  The only well known school that I know of that charges is The Seeing Eye, and it's something like $150 for new clients, $50 for returning clients, and $1 for military veterans.  Those costs are negligible compared to the price of flying someone out, housing, feeding, and training them and their dog for a month.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going to a different school that isn't charging me anything, they are flying me to and from their campus on their dollar, housing, feeding, and training me with my dog for the 26 day residential program.

&amp;nbsp;

While they will pay for everything during training, the financial burden will fall on me after training is complete.  I will be responsible for all food, veterinarian care, and other supplies.  I don't believe insurance will cover any of that, at least I am operating on the assumption that it won't, I'm taking it on because I know it will be helpful to me.

It's not that hard, but it certainly takes longer than it would if I could get private transportation everywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;What types of technologies do you use? Smart phones? Smart Watches?

&amp;nbsp;

I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, I may switch to iOS at some point because the accessibility on Android is a little bit lackluster.  I really don't want to, I'm an Android fanboy to the death but I may have to swallow my pride at some point.  Anyway, I use Google Maps on that for walking directions sometimes if I just need quick directions and don't want to go through the somewhat tedious process of programming a destination into my Trekker.  I don't use a Smart Watch, probably won't ever.  I prefer my [Eone Bradley](<URL>) tactile watch.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If you do use a smart phone what does that usage look like? talking into the phone?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not 100% I understand this question.  In terms of usage it gets used for phone calls/ texts mostly, occasionally I go through Twitter and <PERSON> on it, but I like to keep my web browsing/ social media/ <PERSON> usage to my computer where it is *much* easier.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;How is health insurance utilized for being visually impaired? Meaning what tools (seeing eye dogs, canes) are covered?

&amp;nbsp;

So my experience may be a little different from everyone else's.  This kind of thing varies from country to country.  I'm in the <LOCATION>, and I have health insurance.  Insurance covers most of my eye care/ glasses until my deductible is met and then it covers all of it.  That is the extent of what insurance will do for me.  All of my devices/ canes have either come from my pocket, independent non-profits or my state's Department of Social Services Rehabilitation Services for the Blind.  Canes in my experience aren't horribly expensive, and lots of places will provide them for free along with training (at least in my area).

&amp;nbsp;

Guide dogs are a bit of a different story, and fortunately I have a little bit of insight because I have completed the application and admissions process to get my first this June.  I know we have some current guide dog users here too and they can probably offer better insight than me.  Here is what I do know though.  First, getting a guide dog at most schools in the <LOCATION> is completely free.  The only well known school that I know of that charges is The Seeing Eye, and it's something like $150 for new clients, $50 for returning clients, and $1 for military veterans.  Those costs are negligible compared to the price of flying someone out, housing, feeding, and training them and their dog for a month.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going to a different school that isn't charging me anything, they are flying me to and from their campus on their dollar, housing, feeding, and training me with my dog for the 26 day residential program.

&amp;nbsp;

While they will pay for everything during training, the financial burden will fall on me after training is complete.  I will be responsible for all food, veterinarian care, and other supplies.  I don't believe insurance will cover any of that, at least I am operating on the assumption that it won't, I'm taking it on because I know it will be helpful to me.

&amp;nbsp;

I think that just about covers it, let me know if you need anything else.","[{'start': 4337, 'end': 4347, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3449, 'end': 3459, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3114, 'end': 3122, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3048, 'end': 3056, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2770, 'end': 2775, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
157,"This is the correct answer. I'm working on my graduate degree for teaching cane skills, and we recently spent a whole weekend simply learning how to be guided by someone else while under blindfold.

Finding some way to make these more accessible, or creating an app that would hide them entirely, would make it much easier to keep up with my family and friends online.  Could all photo posts be converted into text using data that already exists about the image? For example, ""Joe posted a photo of himself with Bob and Alice taken in Time Square.""  Facebook already puts tags and geolocation data on photos, so that should be doable.  Maybe use OCR to try and recover some of the images of text.  

3.  Pinterest is totally inaccessible.  I don't know enough about this to even have any ideas for what, if anything, could be done about it.  

4.  An app that posts audio clips to Facebook the same way photos are posted to Facebook might be useful.

182,"Well, it's complicated haha.  I love the idea of story based music, and I have a lot of story-based albums from groups like Ayreon that I really do enjoy.  Unfortunately, these days, I mostly listen to music in the background, on shuffle.  Thanks to iTunes and the iPod, the idea of a consecutive album has been totally shattered, and music has been turned from an experience into a commodity.  I'll admit that it does have it's advantages; music all the time is wonderful for keeping energy up through the day, and being able to have the exact song at exactly the time I want is a wonderful thing.  But I miss the days of putting on a tape or record, and just sitting and doing nothing but listening to that one album, in exactly the way the artist intended.  So...I guess I really like the idea of story based music, but I find that it doesn't fit into my life in reality as much as I wish it did.  Honestly, have you considered distributing your album as one single, giant track?  I don't think playback on shuffle would work at all for what you're doing, and so if you make it one hugely long track, it'll encourage people to listen to it in order, and stop it from popping up when people are just playing there collections on random.",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1447285516,t5_2qpec,t3_3sdypp,t1_cwwx6fx,1,1449746899,0,0,cwx3qdy,Blind,1,,blue1,,

190,"So I think you need to more specifically defined your terms. I'm not really sure what your purpose here is. If you're asking if there needs to be a social network that provides full access for the Blind and visually impaired, then the answer is no. Multiple social networking platforms are already completely accessible. If you are approaching this from the social side, and are asking if the blind and visually impaired would like a site that provides interconnectivity between the various blind individuals and organisations across the world, then the answer is a bit more nuanced. Yes in theory this would be a good thing, but it comes with a few technical and a few social problems. On the technical side, you need to consider that at the moment the social networking Paradyne is predominantly visual. The idea of a ""wall"" or ""feed"" for instance is a relatively visual concept. You will need to approach the design of your platform from an entirely different perspective, and frankly I do not know how to help you with this. From the social side, you need to consider that such a social network would effectively function to isolate the blind community. It would be a good thing in some ways, but I'm not 100% sure that we should be encouraging our community to segregate itself in such a fashion. There's also the question of distribution. At the moment, most social networking functions as a result of people meeting each other in person, and then connecting online in order to stay in contact. If it is a blind only community though, such personal interactions will be significantly more rare. I am personally a blind traveller, and yet I must admit I need relatively few new blind people even worldwide. So, the question will be how are you to distribute this network and how are you to forge the connections between people who are unlikely to meet in person. It is most likely possible, especially if you draw on sites that already exist for the Blind, such as audio games forums, but it will require a new approach that has not yet been used.

The only exceptions are that while I can smile naturally, I can't seem to smile for a camera; I just have to think of something happy, and then I smile, whereas if I try and smile on command, I have no idea what to do with my face.

If that's a thing they teach children to do, I apparently missed that class, and as a 27 year old man I don't feel like asking at this late stage.  I can get buy perfectly without waving greetings and farewells at people.  And I rarely point because it's rare that I know exactly where something is with enough accuracy to point at it.  Plus, if someone else points at something, it doesn't help me, so when I'm trying to communicate with someone else, it doesn't often occur to me as a method of communication.

I noticed that one link went to an official website and one went to an indiegogo (this one).  This one was removed because it had less upvotes and the other link stayed because it goes directly to the project's website.

I removed your post and wanted to provide an explanation.  You posted about the same thing twice in the same day.   I noticed that one link went to an official website and one went to an indiegogo (this one).  This one was removed because it had less upvotes and the other link stayed because it goes directly to the project's website.  If you would like to reference the indiegogo, feel free to leave a comment on your other post.  I understand that you probably didn't intend it to be spam, but it could be perceived this way.

218,"I live in St. Louis, Missouri.  Public transit has gotten much better but it is subject to bickering between municipal governments that has prevented further expansion of the rail system for years.  Buses average about 30 minutes per connection which means if one bus is off you are stuck for a while.  The operators seem pretty understanding of disability issues for the most part but on more than one occasion I've had a driver forget to let me off where I asked them to.  In addition I've had drivers make assumptions about my abilities and tell me they won't let me off at a certain place, even if it is a sanctioned stop.  This actually happened to me on Tuesday, I was riding in a part of the city I'm not normally in to go visit someone in the hospital, I asked the driver to let me off at an intersection to connect with the line that went to the hospital and he told me that he didn't feel comfortable letting me crossing that street with my visual impairment and that he would let me off further down where he was more comfortable doing so.  Which is great, but it's not what I asked him to do and it was kind of insulting.  This is aside from the fact that I missed my connection and had to wait for 30 minutes on the side of the road for the next bus.

&amp;nbsp;

The other issue I've had is a lack of modern integration, it seems like all of the decently sized cities in the US are getting some kind of smart card system to pay for transit easily, we haven't got that yet except for disposable, flimsy monthly passes that can be swiped.

220,"I don't have a whole lot of experience dealing with adapting things like coloring books, when I was younger I never really did much with those kinds of things because of my difficulties with contrast.  What you are doing sounds good, although I don't know how much she would get out of coloring in something that she still wouldn't be able to see.  The raised lines sound good in principal, but she probably won't be able to experience what she did.

With regards to adding Braille with glue, I think your suspicions are correct.  I am not a Braille reader and only have extremely limited experience with it, I have enough central vision to read large print with adjusted contrast, but for the people I know who do read Braille the spacing is important.  I would recommend looking into one of three options.

&amp;nbsp;

The first is getting an embosser and then you can use [Duxbury](http://www.duxburysystems.com/) to convert plain text to embosser friendly Braille.  The one problem with this is that embossers can get quite expensive and I don't know what your budget looks like.

&amp;nbsp;

The second is to get a manual Braille typewriter.  I got mine for free from a family friend, I'm sure you could find a local organization that would be willing to donate one.

&amp;nbsp;

The last is to try your hand at manually embossing with a stylus and guide.  This will take the longest and it gets a little weird because you have to emboss in reverse on the other side of the paper.  A TVI who was working with me as an intern for her Masters in Orientation and Mobility was explaining that this was one of the more difficult things for her to master.  If you want to take that on, more power to you.

Of course you can also contact the publisher of the book and see if they offer a Braille version or ask if they can direct you to a company who produces Braille versions of their book and circumvent all of this extra work.

225,"I wouldn't be offended. However, you won't get the experience of what it's really like.  I was born blind, and I started getting training on how to use a cane when I was five years old.  I've also been trained on how to listen to landmarks around me, how to memorize routes when traveling, how to judge distance based on how fast I'm walking, and so on.  If you just blind-fold yourself tomorrow, without any of the techniques actual blind people have learned, you will find things much more difficult and scary than a blind person would.  It could also be extremely dangerous for you; do you know how to cross the street safely when you can't see the light?  You can do it, but it takes some practice, with a good teacher to correct you when you get it wrong.  Be careful!  I also know Braille and how to use a computer without sight, and these are both skills I use every day in my job.  Can you do your job without reading or writing anything?  

If you really want to do this, my advice to you would be to start simple.  For example, try and make dinner blind-folded.  You probably already know your way around your own kitchen extremely well, so it will make it easier for you to learn to get around with the blind-fold on.  You also probably already know how to cook dinner, so you can focus on the new experience of doing it blind.  But it isn't going to be easy!  I hope you have the recipe memorized, or that you already know Braille, because you can't read it while blind-folded.  Did you put markers on your oven and microwave? Because if not, you can't set your timer or set the temperature while you're blind-folded.  How are you going to measure things?  Hopefully you have a container with raised markings so you can tell how much of something you poured.  Once you've successfully managed to cook dinner while blind-folded, move on to another task.  This way, you will quickly get the idea of what it's like to be blind.  You can do absolutely anything you want, as long as you have a good plan, and are prepared properly.  But if you don't have a plan, and haven't taken steps to master blindness, you won't get anywhere at all.

239,"The problems you are describing are more or less what I have.  I have Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, it is for all intents and purposes Retinitis Pigmentosa from what I understand.  I mostly have difficulty  with reading regular print without magnification and color correction, restricted field of view, light sensitivity, night blindness, and contrast difficulties.  I've had mine since birth and as of now my vision is holding steady where it is, however the future is uncertain.  I know a lot of people who are just now dealing with the effects of vision loss as adults and it seems to be very startling, which makes a lot of sense.

&amp;nbsp;

My vision problems seemed to compound themselves a little over a year ago and while I had experience being visually impaired my mobility started to get to get dangerous and I found myself needing more and more magnification when reading.  Before these issues I was super active and after having more challenges I have to say that it doesn't have to mess with being active.

&amp;nbsp;

Before having issues I went hiking, spent time outdoors with friends as part of our several hobbies, and went out on a fairly regular basis to do things.  After last year I had to start using a white cane and actually not a whole lot has changed since then in terms of my activities.  My methods have had to change significantly, but that doesn't have to be a barrier for continuing to enjoy what you enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

I cut one of my hobbies that I wasn't enjoying as much with the vision issues and that was costing me more money than it was worth.  But nothing else really changed.  I've been on a few hikes in the last year.  I have to take extra time with the cane but it is still enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to the ability to move faster on hikes with a guide dog.  I've even picked up some activities that you wouldn't think would be accessible with a visual impairment.  I had a friend get me into disc golf with him which has been really fun.  I just point and pan my arm across the course until I'm pointing at the cage and he tells me to stop and gives me an approximate range, after that he helps me find my disc.  I'm not great at it but it is still a good time. If you enjoy biking, maybe look into tandem biking, I know a lot of people like that option.

&amp;nbsp;

Reading also doesn't have to be inaccessible, you can look into desktop and handheld sized CCTV systems like the Enhanced Vision Davinci or the Freedom Scientific Ruby XL which both make reading much easier.  If you want to learn Braille you can get Braille books, not to mention the prevalence of audio books.  There are tons of options.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically I'm saying you don't have to give up on really any of the things you enjoy.  You very well might have to change how you do them, that is unavoidable and you may find that you don't get enjoyment out of some things with the changes, but I can say with some certainty that you will most likely continue to enjoy the things you used to enjoy if you adapt them to your visual impairment.  Having great family and friends really helps with that.

&amp;nbsp;

I think a lot of it comes down to getting your confidence.  If you are struggling with Orientation and Mobility, find an instructor and get some training on a white cane.  Having that boosted my confidence quite a bit.  You can typically get it for free through a non-profit in your area or if you are in the US, your local Department of Social Services Rehab Services for the Blind (If you aren't in the US you will have to ask someone else what your best options are).  These places can also provide you with technology like the aforementioned CCTV systems, often times for free.

&amp;nbsp;

As you get confidence you can start branching out more.  I was accepted into a couple of guide schools earlier this year and have decided to go for training in June.  I'm really looking forward to the speed and fluidity that having that resource will provide not only in day to day public transit commuting but also in things like getting outdoors to hike or do other activities.  That may be an option that you want to consider at some point.

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, I really hope that didn't go overkill or get too sidetracked.  Thanks for posting, reading these stories is always nice.",,,,geoffisblind,LCA (Low Vision),,1448720082,t5_2qpec,t3_3uknad,t3_3uknad,3,1450080999,0,0,cxfphzb,Blind,3,,blue1,"The problems you are describing are more or less what I have.  I have <PERSON>'s Congenital Amaurosis, it is for all intents and purposes Retinitis Pigmentosa from what I understand.  I mostly have difficulty  with reading regular print without magnification and color correction, restricted field of view, light sensitivity, night blindness, and contrast difficulties.  I've had mine since birth and as of now my vision is holding steady where it is, however the future is uncertain.  I know a lot of people who are just now dealing with the effects of vision loss as adults and it seems to be very startling, which makes a lot of sense.

&amp;nbsp;

My vision problems seemed to compound themselves a little over a year ago and while I had experience being visually impaired my mobility started to get to get dangerous and I found myself needing more and more magnification when reading.  Before these issues I was super active and after having more challenges I have to say that it doesn't have to mess with being active.

&amp;nbsp;

Before having issues I went hiking, spent time outdoors with friends as part of our several hobbies, and went out on a fairly regular basis to do things.  After last year I had to start using a white cane and actually not a whole lot has changed since then in terms of my activities.  My methods have had to change significantly, but that doesn't have to be a barrier for continuing to enjoy what you enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

I cut one of my hobbies that I wasn't enjoying as much with the vision issues and that was costing me more money than it was worth.  But nothing else really changed.  I've been on a few hikes in the last year.  I have to take extra time with the cane but it is still enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to the ability to move faster on hikes with a guide dog.  I've even picked up some activities that you wouldn't think would be accessible with a visual impairment.  I had a friend get me into disc golf with him which has been really fun.  I just point and pan my arm across the course until I'm pointing at the cage and he tells me to stop and gives me an approximate range, after that he helps me find my disc.  I'm not great at it but it is still a good time. If you enjoy biking, maybe look into tandem biking, I know a lot of people like that option.

&amp;nbsp;

Reading also doesn't have to be inaccessible, you can look into desktop and handheld sized CCTV systems like the Enhanced Vision Davinci or the Freedom Scientific Ruby XL which both make reading much easier.  If you want to learn Braille you can get Braille books, not to mention the prevalence of audio books.  There are tons of options.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically I'm saying you don't have to give up on really any of the things you enjoy.  You very well might have to change how you do them, that is unavoidable and you may find that you don't get enjoyment out of some things with the changes, but I can say with some certainty that you will most likely continue to enjoy the things you used to enjoy if you adapt them to your visual impairment.

240,"Interesting project. I have a couple issues with my cane. The first is that the reflective tape on mine begins to peal off after a few months of use.

242,"So I started to see the need to use a cane a little over a year ago, I was running into everything and tripping and it was honestly becoming a safety hazard for myself and the people around me.

&amp;nbsp;

Overall I like the cane, I definitely prefer it to trying to navigate my way without it.  The problems I have with it are mostly design/ quality issues.  As /u/Nighthawk321 stated, the tape tends to peal off quickly, especially on the bottom segment of my cane which gets hit a lot.  I also find that the joints tend to loosen up after a little bit which is a little weird for me.  This is why some people like fixed canes, but I have no clue how I would personally handle carrying around a 60 inch fixed stick in any convenient manner.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not so concerned about things loosening up, canes aren't exactly cheap, but it doesn't break the bank to pick up a new one every once in a while.  I like Ambutech canes, depending on the material it's something like $20-$30 USD.  I got another one after my old cane started getting loose and just threw the old one in my bag as a spare.  I'll probably do that again before the end of this year.

&amp;nbsp;

On that note, I like to keep the weight of my canes down, and I am curious to try new materials like fiberglass, carbon fiber, and graphite because they are supposed to be much lighter than the aluminum canes that I am used to.  Keeping them lighter is nice because it reduces wrist strain, especially for people like me who walk a lot every day.  However the lighter the material, it seems the more the price goes up.

&amp;nbsp;

The last piece that bothers me is the tips.  I need to change out my tip once every few months because it starts to sharpen up.  I use a pencil tip in a two point tap technique and the sharper it gets the more it catches on things.  I usually neglect to do this because there is no easy way to buy tips in bulk that I have found and buying several individuals can get expensive (something like $2.65 a tip for the one I like).

&amp;nbsp;

In terms of aesthetics they are fine.  I don't really look at them needing to be attractive.  White canes are very utilitarian for me.  I know people who have gotten different colors and styles which I won't do.  I understand it can be fun but for me having it white with the red strip at the bottom lets everyone know without a doubt that I am visually impaired.  So I'm going to keep it that way.

&amp;nbsp;

Really my complaints are only design related.  I like navigating on a cane, it is reliable, and it catches pretty much everything if your technique is good and consistent.  It can be slow, but it is reliable and that's what I need, it would be nice to go faster though.  It doesn't catch things above you like branches which isn't so great, but right now there isn't really a solid solution for that.

&amp;nbsp; 

I'm kind of resistant to the idea of switching out my cane for an electronic device as some people have suggested could be a possibility.  I don't like the idea of trusting my safety to an electronic device that is subject to interference or battery life.  The only option that I would consider (and that I'm actually doing) is getting a guide dog.  Come June I will replace my cane with a guide dog in day to day use.

I'm going to direct you to some threads where I've gone way in depth on the technology side of mobility in case they are useful to you.

271,"Depending on your budget I have a few ideas.  I have experience with three systems.  On a regular basis I use an Eschenbach Smartlux Digital.  It's alright, although I'm not so thrilled with the construction and I had to warranty return it a few months ago to get a new one after the battery failed.  It's $600 USD plus depending on where you look.  I've had limited experience with the Freedom Scientific Ruby XL and I really liked it, but Freedom Scientific products are typically quite expensive.  I don't own one but I want one.

I also own an Enhanced Vision Davinci, which is also alright.  It usually runs between $2,500 USD and $3,000 USD.  I got mine through an organization and I'm grateful for it, but if you are spending your own money I would really look through your options.  I have problems with it struggling to pick up text sometimes depending on the ambient light.  The OCR was an exciting prospect for me but it turned out to not be very effective and I don't bother with it anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

The last option that I have some experience with is called the Magnalink, I think it's made by a company called LVI.  I don't use it, my brother who is also visually impaired does.  It also runs close to $3,000 USD.  From what I've experienced it's a really nice option, it can fold and packs into a laptop bag sized case and it has a battery so it doesn't have to be plugged in all the time.  I don't think she would have much luck using it on her lap though, it really needs a stable surface because while portable, it's kind of heavy.
