2,"I'm blind and I write code. I don't think addressing the AST is likely to be a very good way of going about it for a number of reasons. The AST is built on the basis of the needs for the compiler, and, in a sense, the final output. For example let us say that you have a class, which is further modified on the code. The AST will just contain the final result of that modification without regard to how the source is organised. And the way the source is organised is indicative of intent. So AST is usable, but it removes the possibility to understand intent.

I would say the things that would make life considerably easier are:

* A good accessible editor with good navigation (previous function, next function, folding of blocks...).
* Commands to present autocomplete information accessibly. For example a command that would present (in a way the screen reader can grab) which methods on a class begin with what we have on the cursor, or which variables in scope exist beginning that way, etc.
* Direct documentation access, so that one can place oneself on an identifier and get type, and if there's associated docstrings those too.

Some tool to help laying out GUIs would also be handy. How I envision this is having a tree view where you can add objects (lists, edit fields, menu items) and another frame where the GUI is previewed.

31,"I am a low vision mum of two, born with cataracts, developed glaucoma as a toddler. I have a seven year old boy a one year old baby girl. I have always been partially sighted but in the last two years my sight has declined to a point where I now use alot more assistive tech. I will eventually in the next few years lose the sight I have left. 

I have alot of concerns about my ability to parent and what I'v found is that I worry far more then I need to about it. There are definitely things that I'm not going to be the person who teaches or does with my kids, such as teaching them to drive. More then that though, there are so many things I will still be able to do and still do now. I am the stay at home parent currently, I take my son to school, change nappys, bath them, bake, and read to youngest (my oldest reads his stories to me and his sister which is perfect for practice and good sibling bonding.) I do the food shopping and make birthday cakes, I just bought an 8ft xmas tree for us to decorate this weekend and made salt dough decorations with my oldest to hang on the tree. 

In april when I first found out I was going to be completely blind I struggled with doubting myself as a good parent and my father in law told me that there are plenty of sighted parents who are assholes and the love and time I put into my kids will more then make up for any perceived shortcomings from being  blind. I was also stuck on those things I will miss seeing. I think there will always be times where I feel sad about not seeing a moment - especially major miles stones, like weddings, school plays, graduation and thats okay. 
The blind foundation here (I'm in New Zealand) have been amazing with coming up with ideas and ways I can use the equipment and skills I have to play and parent with my kids.

I really recommend getting in touch with your local Rehabilitation provider. Also looking at what available for recreation for adults and children who are vision impaired. Large print cards, balls that make sound (we have a soccer ball we kick around that has bells in it) boardgames, audio books, braille books, craft projects that are tactile etc. Having a cane has meant I can still go to baby groups with my youngest, I take them to school, we go to the beach, bush walks, shopping.

I have a seven year old boy a one year old baby girl. I have always been partially sighted but in the last two years my sight has declined to a point where I now use alot more assistive tech. I will eventually in the next few years lose the sight I have left. 

I have alot of concerns about my ability to parent and what I'v found is that I worry far more then I need to about it. There are definitely things that I'm not going to be the person who teaches or does with my kids, such as teaching them to drive. More then that though, there are so many things I will still be able to do and still do now. I am the stay at home parent currently, I take my son to school, change nappys, bath them, bake, and read to youngest (my oldest reads his stories to me and his sister which is perfect for practice and good sibling bonding.) I do the food shopping and make birthday cakes, I just bought an 8ft xmas tree for us to decorate this weekend and made salt dough decorations with my oldest to hang on the tree. 

In april when I first found out I was going to be completely blind I struggled with doubting myself as a good parent and my father in law told me that there are plenty of sighted parents who are assholes and the love and time I put into my kids will more then make up for any perceived shortcomings from being  blind. I was also stuck on those things I will miss seeing. I think there will always be times where I feel sad about not seeing a moment - especially major miles stones, like weddings, school plays, graduation and thats okay. 
The blind foundation here (I'm in <LOCATION>) have been amazing with coming up with ideas and ways I can use the equipment and skills I have to play and parent with my kids.

I really recommend getting in touch with your local Rehabilitation provider. Also looking at what available for recreation for adults and children who are vision impaired. Large print cards, balls that make sound (we have a soccer ball we kick around that has bells in it) boardgames, audio books, braille books, craft projects that are tactile etc. Having a cane has meant I can still go to baby groups with my youngest, I take them to school, we go to the beach, <PERSON> walks, shopping. Most things are still very possible to do with  a little adaption.

It took some massive vi balls to get past those shrinks (they were depressing) but here we go. No sighted a-hole can make me feel like shit again.

I have the luxury of defining how i lost what i don't see or didn't see.
Brain injuries? Check. Eye surgeries? Check. Myopic macular whatchamacallit? Yep? Glaucoma? Technically yes... Etc. neurodivergence? Hell yea. Can't see your facial expressions for sure, can't hear between the lines... PTSD? Yep. Charles Bonnet? Oh yep.

What worked for me is picking my secondary disabilities (like brain injury and ptsd, all which are valid, with language etc).
Learning the skills. Braille - especially if you grep the basics before you really have to. How to put that best... Eye opening. Because what you can see or read or write is no longer defined to your eyeballs, optical nerves or occipital lobes.

A third and relevant thing: hook up with blind groups around where you live.

The most popular is probably LearninAlly, a paid service (it used to be called Readings for the Blind and Dyslexic.) I am not sure if they only cater only to students nowadays or not, so that might be something to check, however it is nice because they have volunteers who actually come in and read the books as opposed to a synthesized voice. The downside is that nowadays they are mostly electronic as far as I know, but it might be worth asking them if they still send out CDs and CD players that your friend could use.
LibriVox is a great free resource for books that are in the public domain. They are in MP3 format, so they could be loaded onto an MP3 player like you suggested.

BookShare is another great resource. It requires a paid subscription, but they have a lot of great books and I believe that you can download them in MP3 format. The downside is that the audio is in a synthesized voice, which some people do not like.
All of the paid subscriptions require documentation of a print related disability, so you might need to help her get set up if she does not use computers.

I've shifted around a couple of times but I have ultimately settled on a mechanical engineering major, and I hope to work in aerospace.  Having that dream in my head has been super important in getting me through high school with good grades in upper level courses and I imagine it will be very important to getting through engineering school.

&amp;nbsp;

Think of what makes you excited, what you want to do with the rest of your life, and don't let that idea out of your head for a minute.  You have to want this, more than anything.  If what you are considering doing with your life doesn't make you excited every time you think about it then it might be time to think about what does.  That's the way I personally get motivated.

&amp;nbsp;

The other thing is to keep positive.  Having vision loss sucks, there isn't a super easy way around it, but it doesn't have to be debilitating or limit you or your potential.  I try to keep it light, I encourage blind jokes among my friends because you can either feel depressed about it or laugh about it, I choose to do the latter.  I also take a proactive approach to handling the challenges, I work with local organizations and agencies to make sure that I have the tools and training I need to stay competitive with my sighted peers.  It all comes down to your approach, keep it positive, be competitive, and seek out what you need.

&amp;nbsp;

Having a support network helps a lot too.  I have some awesome friends and family that have helped pick me up when I've been down.  In addition this sub has been awesome for me personally.  You can get advice and learn from people who have had to deal with some of the things you have to deal with already.  In addition I know we have at least one other student here.  If you need advice, or just someone to commiserate with there are plenty of people here to help you out, that's what makes reddit, and this sub in particular so great.

&amp;nbsp;

Best of luck though :)  If you ever need to talk feel free to PM me since we are in a very similar situation.",,,,geoffisblind,LCA (Low Vision),,1450908433,t5_2qpec,t3_3xzncb,t3_3xzncb,2,1451822543,0,0,cy9elsp,Blind,2,,blue1,"Let me first reiterate what <USER> said, they are totally right.

You can take tests and quizzes early if you need more time, or take the test in the Disabled Student Services office with some assistance (ex: someone to read the questions to you).

You can review the syllabus at the beginning of the course and determine if a project is outside your skill set. Then have DSS and the professor generate an alternative project.

141,"This has been one of the bigger frustrations for me.  My city's public transit system is alright I guess but it needs a lot of work.  The work it needs probably isn't going to happen because my area is divided into over 100 small municipalities that can't really seem to agree on anything so public transit is probably going to stay where it is for the foreseeable future.  Buses hit their stops once every 30-45 minutes which makes planning incredibly annoying and I often times just walk if I have the option since waiting for a bus for that long makes me impatient.

&amp;nbsp;

I unfortunately don't have a whole lot of options.  I'll catch rides with friends and family when I can, but when I have to do something spur of the moment it is typically on me.  Unfortunately public transit is really my only option in those situations.  I can't afford taxis or Ubers so if I can't walk it I'm riding.

This is one of several reasons I am moving at the end of this coming summer to the Pacific Northwestern United States.

166,"Depending upon the legislation where you live (it may vary college to college) as has already been mentioned, don't go to your professors with this, go to the special needs department or whatever your particular school is going to call it. You'll need an evaluation from your doctor stating both the level of your vision and your specific requirements. You should talk to your doctor about this in detail before he or she fills in the paperwork. The college should pay someone to take duplicate notes for you, you should be able to get digital copies of all of the class material etc. A lot more schools are using ebooks so you may want to consider getting a tablet with a really good screen to use as an e-reader. And something that I'm trying to encourage my boyfriend, who is also low vision, to do is learn how to touch type. It is incredibly helpful.


Once you have your doctors report take it to your special needs department.  They should fill out a form detailing your requirements.  That is what you'll give to your profs.  

At age 47 my boyfriend went back to University and did four a year honours program in public-policy management. It was extremely difficult but he got through it. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.  

If you are going to buy a tablet look into one that has an OLED display, the contrast and brightness are much better than your average tablet. My boyfriend bought one last year and it is incredibly helpful. He's probably only got a year left where it's going to be of any use to him but right now he's enjoying it.

I have pretty functional central under the right circumstances but my fields are restricted below 20 degrees and I have extreme light sensitivity and total night blindness which makes mobility difficult.  I got to work with a Leader Dog on a trial run last summer and absolutely loved it, it was amazingly helpful to me.  

&amp;nbsp;

I had an O&amp;M start talking to me about a guide dog last year which I wasn't sure about because I thought it was really more for people who had no vision at all.  He informed me that this is not the case at all and that lots of people with low vision find them useful, but you have to have bad enough vision that you can resist some basic urges.

&amp;nbsp;

If you can't fully put your trust into your dog then it won't work, you can't guide it.  It is a team effort and you can't be doing the dog's job for it.  I guess it is best to think about how reliant you are on your cane.  If you can walk out of the house without it and walk down the street confidently and safely then they may have some issues training you.  I was talking with a GDMI, I forget from which school but he was talking about clients he has worked with who he has had to blindfold because they couldn't resist the urge to guide the dog.

**tl;dr:** I'd recommend combining some or all of the following products: (1) Read&amp;Write Gold, (2) Kurzweil 1000 or 3000, (3) a regular scanner; consider getting one with tactile buttons instead of touchscreen, such as the HP Printer/Scanner 4630, (4) ZoomText, which has a free trial, and (5) a CCTV Desktop Magnifier.

**Recommendation:** I am most impressed with a software called Read&amp;Write Gold. It is most common for students. It reads any text out loud to you, including text from a document which you scanned into your computer. If you don't want it read out loud to you, you still get the benefit of having a software that will convert scanned documents to text. And as you say, text is easier to read once on your computer.

I would suggest using this software with a scanner. Alternatively, you could get Kurzweil 1000 or 3000 - they are a bit more expensive, but the software was designed by Ray Kurzweil, who was the person who first invented Text to Speech, which is referred to as Optical Character Recognition or OCR. Kurzweil 1000 and Read&amp;Write Gold basically do the same thing.

If you have a scanned document sitting on your computer as text, or you are able to get all your books as a PDF, then maybe you might make good use of a magnifying software. You can zoom in on anything on your screen and make it as big as you want. The only software I recommend for this is ZoomText. The publisher, AI Squared, offers a free 60 day trial for Windows users and 15 day trial for Mac. I high recommend trying it out.

If you are left only using a book and do not want to use your computer, you can purchase a desktop magnifier. They are referred to as Desktop CCTV Magnifiers. They will enlarge anything you put under the camera onto a 24 inch hd monitor. Most of these devices can also read the text from the page out loud. My personal favorite manufacturer is Enhanced Vision. They are located in Huntington Beach, California, but they likely have a sales rep in your state or area who will come to your house and let you try any of the machines without obligation to purchase.

One of the benefits of getting involved with an organization like this is for you and your son to meet positive role models. People who are blind are fully capable of living normal, independent, successful lives, but it's important to set high expectations.

Also, assuming you're in the U.S. she'd recommend getting involving in your state's Early Intervention program (for 0 - 3 years) if you're not already.

There are some specific things you do need to do to help blind babies. For example, most blind babies don't naturally have the same desire to start moving, because they don't see a toy across the room they really want. Your Early Intervention program should provide therapy to teach crawling and walking at the appropriate time.

Other than that, treat your son just like you'd treat any baby that age. Give him the same independence and responsibilities that any other child that age would have. He might do some things differently, but that shouldn't ever be an excuse for him to not participate in anything.

197,"I'm completely blind.  Regarding videos, less than a tenth of the videos that do have subtitles come with an audio description track for the blind, describing important imagery in the video that couldn't be figured out just by listening to the dialogue.  While Youtube supports subtitles, sort of, it doesn't support audio description at all.  The only online website that does is Netflix, and 4 movies on iTunes also have audio description.  And...that's it.  

Unfortunately, there is absolutely no way for a blind person to read any of the text on memes.  As you can imagine, this leaves us out of about a quarter of Reddit.  I don't even bother with Facebook these days, as about half of the things on my newsfeed are just images without description.  The ideal web surfing experience would be if all important images and videos online had descriptions or labels.  

However, this is harder than it at first seems.  First of all, a person describing images needs to figure out if they're important, and why they're important.  For example, if someone described all of the icons in a computer program with what they actually showed (thumbs up, paper clip, floppy disc, blue letter e, etc) a blind user would probably be quite confused.  Instead, these icons get descriptions based on what meaning they're trying to convey (up vote, attach, save, internet explorer, etc).  Also, most websites have lots and lots and lots of images.  Assuming it takes at least 20 words to describe an image, describing every image on any major website would just drown a blind person in endless walls of text.  Similarly, when an audio description of a video is being made, the describer can never speak over someone who is speaking in the video.  So she has to carefully decide what the most important thing happening on screen is, and then squeeze descriptions of what's happening in around the dialogue in the movie.  There just isn't time to describe everything!  

So describing images and videos for the blind is, I think, much harder than captioning for the deaf.  While I've never done it, I'm convinced I could provide adequate captions for a video; all I need to do is make sure they're in-sync with the audio, and write what people are saying.  I don't need to provide any interpretation at all.  On the other hand, describing for the blind is much more like translating, because you need to figure out why the image is important, and put it into words.  As far as I know, there is no perfect, unbiased way to do that.  That's not to say it's impossible; this [text description of the comic Watchmen](http://lianaspaperdolls.com/watchmen) may be the best example of describing images ever.

Any student can bring a complaint if the institution isn't working toward compliance (at least), and all complaints require investigation and resolution.

What I can tell you is that you are right, university is achievable A hell of a lot more than university is achievable, in fact.

Having someone else going through something similar, or someone else who has gone through something similar, is the best way to maintain mutual support.

Perhaps also try to minimize the slides. I don't know how much text you put on your slides or how many of them you have but you could try to reduce both the number of slides and amount of text.

If there are information graphics, org charts, diagrams try to convey this information non graphically in the email using bullets, tables or descriptions. Make sure to speak to the essential conclusions of the visual material; you don't need to describe it in it's entirety but you should quantitatively, if appropriate, describe the important part. ie. ""Sales have risen quarter over quarter by at least 25% each quarter for the last year"". Just reading the raw sales numbers for each quarter or even the increases would not be a substitute for the graph--most blind people are no better than anyone else at making sense of a jumble of numbers read at them.

241,"I found it easy to begrudge ""sighted-people"" their perfect eyesight when I was younger. I was bitter and angry that my extremely poor vision held me back from all the things I wanted to do, and seemed to close doors at every alternative.     
     
That bitterness followed me into young adulthood, where I would get steamed by people asking the seemingly innocent question ""have you ever thought about seeing an eye-Doctor?"" Man, that question used to piss me off more than any other.     
     
As I got older, I began to recognize that we had no common frame of reference. They don't know what life is like for me. They don't think about my limitations or struggles because they don't expirience them every waking minute like I do. It's not that they are assholes. They aren't trying to be rude by asking me about seeing an eye-Doctor; it's just what people do. They are legitimately trying to be helpful, and probably feel stupid almost as soon as that question leaves their mouths. Kinda like walking up on someone changing a tire and asking ""you get a flat?""     
     
When people see someone struggling they typically will try and offer what I call ""30-second advice"". It's hard to give a clear example other than what I have provided, but if you watch for it, you'll notice it more and more frequently. It's not meant to be insulting or degrading. It's more a way of attempting to bond with a fellow human being.     
     
Sighted people don't generally harbor any specific grudge against the blind or visually impaired, but it's not always easy to know how to prepare for us all and our different needs. Some people go over-the-top in their efforts to be helpful and others try not to say anything at all for fear of being insensitive or screwing up and hurting someone's feelings by offering unsolicited assistance.     
     
At the end of the day, it's not their fault we can't see and we don't make it any better by snapping at them or alienating them by lashing out at them because what we are secretly truly unhappy about is what seems to be the unfair hand *we* were dealt.

250,"If this was 5 years ago I would have been hard pressed to not tell you to either go full out laptop or just get the apple device. Tablets running windows and android are now much, much further along. Honestly, there's not a single thing my ipad mini 4 does that I can't get my samsung tab 4 or my Samsung galaxy s 6 to do. If I'm being completely honest, I prefer my s 6 phone to my ipad.
I did some quick searches on both the apple store and the playstore for movie and music editing software. It was a shock because some of the same software is on both operating systems. Then, for kicks, I did the same searches for windows.  In some ways the windows was better for that search, in other ways it wasn't so good. 
So, really, the days of one being better then another, in my opinion, are over. It really only depends on what you like and prefer. All three operating systems link with bluetooth keyboards, if you don't want a laptop. All three do perfectly fine with accessability, though android and ios streamline it so that it requires less resources and doesn't read out file directories unnecessarily. 
Here's another way to look at it. Does everyone you know use apple products? Are they facetiming all the time, or are they just using regular skype? 
Not to be cold water on a cold shoulder, but picking based on accessability of the operating system shouldn't really be your deciding factors. Not any longer.

262,"Can't say I've ever thought that.  People certainly overlook problems, and I will occasionally have my life inadvertently made more difficult because someone didn't consider something that might make my life harder.  But that's not really their fault, we live in a world that is made up primarily of sighted people.  That's why we have to adapt to the world around us, it isn't cut out for people with low to no vision by default. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am relatively uninformed when it comes to matters that concern the deaf, mobility impaired, or really any other disabled community because those disabilities are not directly part of my life.  I certainly understand the basics, but there is so much nuance to how one manages with a disability that it is impossible to understand every facet of how one handles it.  I can never fully understand every disability, so why would I expect someone who doesn't have a visual disability to fully understand mine?

&amp;nbsp;

I understand the frustrations, but I think it's important to contain them and maintain a professional attitude so that the blind community is portrayed in the most positive light possible, the last thing we need is a negative image.  That's not to say we shouldn't voice problems, but we need to do it in a way that is respectful to everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't resent people for having full sight.  My problem is genetic, there is no one to blame, and certainly it isn't the fault of the people I interact with who don't understand every aspect of my disability...

267,"First off if you provide your location it may help users provide area specific advise since laws and regulations are different between countries.

&amp;nbsp;

That aside I'll give you what I know for the United States. I think we are in a pretty similar situation.  I'm going to be graduating from high school in May of 2016 and going to school for engineering.  I have have Leber's Congenital Amaurosis which is in the same family as RP, mine has just been around since birth as opposed to the later onset found in most  cases of RP.

&amp;nbsp;

So here is what I know from being a visually impaired student since forever who is also about to go into college.  

&amp;nbsp;

The first is to get in touch with your local Department of Social Services, Rehab Services for the Blind.  This is absolutely critical as they can provide you with technology, training, and in some cases even funding.  My DSS has committed to paying my room and board as well as all of my textbooks, a new laptop, another CCTV, and several other things.  They may also cover a portion of my tuition if that is necessary.  The DSS is a *huge* resource available to you and you shouldn't look it over.

&amp;nbsp;

The next step is similar and that is to contact local non-profits that aid the blind for the same reasons as above.  They are another resource for you to use.

&amp;nbsp;

The next piece is if you are losing vision in a way that it is inhibiting your travel get orientation and mobility training now.  Struggling with travel is not another thing you want on top of your classes.  I decided to get training way too late and I regret not doing it sooner, having those skills and the confidence has drastically improved my personal and school life.

&amp;nbsp;

The next piece is extensively review what you need from your school's disability office.  It sounds like you've already done that so you are probably in the clear but always be thinking of ways to make it easier on yourself and keep in communication with them.  My school has a disability specialist and while I was her first legally blind student she has done an awesome job of adapting and helping me.

&amp;nbsp;

I would definitely look into the things /u/DocCyane mentioned.  Testing accommodations, adaptive technology, and syllabus review are all key.  However if you are like me you might not want to do a different project or have someone else take notes for you.  I prefer to take my own notes and I've gotten pretty good at getting the notes I need just by listening to lectures since I can't read the board.  By that same token I like to do the same projects as my peers, if it's overly visual then I may ask to do something less visual, but as a standard I prefer to do what everyone else is doing.

&amp;nbsp;

And here is where I'm going to respectfully disagree with /u/DocCyane, they made some awesome points but I disagree with the following:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I do NOT recommend talking with professors individually, as they are usually not up to date on the legal responsibilities a school has for differently-abled students.

&amp;nbsp;

I totally get the frustration of working with instructors who don't get it all the way, but in my experience they figure out.  I find that self advocating directly to the instructor shows a few things about you.  It shows that you take charge of your disability, you are looking to be a productive member of the class despite your challenges, you have self confidence, and you respect the instructor enough to fully tell them what is going on and to have a discussion with them about the problems that you face.  The first day of every semester I make a point of staying after class with a new teacher and tell them everything about my challenges, and how they can help.  This leads to good discussion and mutual respect.  In addition, my father teaches on the University level and has had one totally blind student and several legally blind students in the past.  He has told me that every year the disability office sends him a stack of learning profiles for all of students who have disabilities ranging from learning disabilities, to visual impairments, to hearing impairments.  He has told me that in his experience it is extremely difficult to keep track of all of these needs for every one of his students in all of his classes.  He values students taking the time to talk with him so that he knows exactly who they are and what they need from him, and then he accommodates.  I actually can't recommend self advocating directly to the instructor enough.

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, if your instructor is not working with you, absolutely get Student Disability Services to intervene on your behalf, you aren't stuck just dealing with an uncooperative professor, however I prefer to get help intervening as a last resort, and I've only had to do it once in my memory.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, that's my two cents, good luck!",,,,geoffisblind,LCA (Low Vision),,1449096518,t5_2qpec,t3_3v5qet,t3_3v5qet,2,1451400299,0,0,cxkyjsh,Blind,2,,blue1,"First off if you provide your location it may help users provide area specific advise since laws and regulations are different between countries.

277,"Yes, I've experienced this multiple times.  When I used to go to the movies regularly, my solution was to try and always go to the same theatre, at the same day and time every week.  After about a month of going to a described showing once a week, the staff had there act together, and stopped making mistakes.  Unfortunately, attending a movie once a week for a month can be pretty pricey.  Also, you need to make sure you get a theatre that has a described showing of something once a week.  And if you stop going for a couple weeks, you'll need to get the staff back on the ball all over again.  After I moved to Ottawa though, I haven't bothered going to a single movie over the last year.  My plan is to start attending described movies again about a month before the release of Fantastic Beasts (the new Harry Potter movie), because that's a movie I really care about getting described.  So paying for 3 or 4 movies I don't care about beforehand is worth it to me.  

Edit to add: the new star wars movie will be described on blue-ray, so at least you haven't missed the audio description entirely.  But from what I've been told, it won't be described on DVD.

When I used to go to the movies regularly, my solution was to try and always go to the same theatre, at the same day and time every week.  After about a month of going to a described showing once a week, the staff had there act together, and stopped making mistakes.  Unfortunately, attending a movie once a week for a month can be pretty pricey.  Also, you need to make sure you get a theatre that has a described showing of something once a week.  And if you stop going for a couple weeks, you'll need to get the staff back on the ball all over again.  After I moved to <LOCATION> though, I haven't bothered going to a single movie over the last year.  My plan is to start attending described movies again about a month before the release of Fantastic Beasts (the new <PERSON> movie), because that's a movie I really care about getting described.
