4,"Braille Screen Input has nothing to do with a braille display. It is literally what it sounds like, entering braille using your screen. You enable it in the rotor options, then any time you are on an active text field,  you can quickly switch to Braille Screen Input. A special keyboard appears on the screen with 6 keys, and you can either type on them with your phone flat on a surface using a standard brailler layout, or you hold your phone in Landscape mode with the screen facing away from you. Bracing the phone in your hands with your palms, pinkies, and thumbs, you are then free to curl your remaining 6 fingers inwards onto the screen to start typing braille characters. iOS interprets multiple forms of braille, a right swipe with a single finger types a space, a left swipe deletes a character. A 2-finger swipe left deletes a whole word, a swipe right is like pressing Return, so it either makes a new line or presses the Send/return key depending on your situation. In kik, for example, I can type a message and immediately swipe right with two fingers to send it to the chat rather than hunting for the Send button on the screen. 

A 3-finger swipe right or left toggles the braille entry mode from 6-dot to contracted, and a 3-finger swipe up and down toggles screen orientation lock so you don't accidentally jump into table mode when moving around in screen-away mode. 

Plus, it looks pretty interesting to people who have no idea what you are doing when using Braille Screen Input, and they are all blown away when I explain and demonstrate it. This, Actions like mentioned in the comment above, and well-designed features like Magic Tap that can be enabled by developers are very important to know and understand for a fully comprehensive comparison, not to mention that all standard Apple library controls when building apps in Xcode are inherently accessible.

43,"UGH!

My son has RP. In his case, it is autosomal recessive. It doesn't ""run in our family"" but my husband and I both have the recessive gene. In our case, we have a 25% chance of any of our children, boy or girl, having RP.

I was told I couldn't have any more children because of a medical condition I have before we received his RP diagnosis at age 4, even though I wanted another baby. So DH got the big snip. But even if I could have another biological child, I wouldn't let the risk of 25% risk of RP stop me from having another baby with my husband. My RP son, 7, is legally blind and is a rock star at Braille. He won 3rd place in his state's Braille Challenge this year in his division. He's also getting really good with his cane. He doesn't let RP stop him!

Blindness may be a lift altering condition, but it is not a life limiting disease. It's also a condition that can be adapted to. If DH and I had a 25% risk for some other condition that shortened our future children's lifespans or put them in physical pain, we'd likely have a different outlook and adopt instead.

I'm sorry this hurt you to read. It hurt me to read too, if that gives you any consolation. And the answer to OP's question in AITA is yes, he is the A-hole.

De Leon isn’t the only one who loved it. Last month, pop singer Bea Miller called it the “purest thing ever” to her more than 800,000 Twitter followers.

Note: I Can’t cut and paste twitter posts from my phone. 

And her followers, some of them also volunteers, responded:

Plenty of other people have taken to social media to say that answering a quick call to help a blind person is “so awesome.”



It’s the most popular time of year for giving, but some people shy away from pledging their time to help others because they feel overwhelmed in a flurry of holiday gift-buying and travel. Yet interacting with people while volunteering is the most emotionally rewarding way to give, according to Ashley Whillans, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies how people navigate trade-offs between time and money.


“If you give time away, you actually feel like you have more of it,” Whillans said, explaining that we often are not as busy as we think we are.

The Be My Eyes app has attracted more than 100,000 visually impaired users since a Denmark-based team launched the app in early 2015. When one of those users makes a call for help on his iPhone or Android device, 10 randomly selected volunteers get alerts on their own phones.

The first person to answer sees a video image of the blind user’s environment and tries to help resolve their issue. A volunteer may read the label on a soup can, look around a caller’s house for a missing object or do one of hundreds of other tasks that can be difficult for people with impaired vision.


“Sometimes it’s a quick fix, other times it’s a longer conversation of what’s life like where you are,” said Christian Erfurt, the chief executive of Be My Eyes. “That reminds us that we’re not that different, and the gap between ‘us and them’ is minimized.”

People who are visually impaired can use accessibility features to make calls from smartphones. The software uses speech and touch to communicate with users. Some phones also offer increased text sizes or color contrast to help people with low vision.

In the two years that she has used Be My Eyes, Alaina Walker has made more than 10 calls for help. Although she said she most often uses the app for guidance matching her outfits, she has also called volunteers for help determining if her oven was on and navigating from a bus stop to a nearby dollar store.


Walker, who is visually impaired, said she gets excited when she connects with a volunteer from her state of Alabama or from a different country.

“What I think is cool about it is it’s anonymous,” said Walker, a 43-year-old makeup saleswoman. “Some people are so self-conscious about asking for help.”

Be My Eyes doesn’t do background checks on its users or volunteers, although rules of conduct and respect are published on the app’s website. The company gives everyone “the benefit of the doubt,” Erfurt said, and bans people if someone reports their behavior as abusive more than once. Erfurt said the company relies on the assumption that the app’s users will see any inappropriate behavior as simply bad apples.

That proved true for Pittsburgh-based volunteer Jacqui Giordano. When a caller once asked for her phone number, she said, she declined and assumed the uncomfortable experience was an anomaly.

Giordano’s second call through Be My Eyes was far more successful. Several family-related issues had left her crying before work one morning in August when a visually impaired user called to ask for help matching a pair of colored jeans to a shirt and scarf. The call was no more than 15 minutes, but Giordano said she probably would never forget it.

“It came at the right moment, because there were struggles going on in my life, and I thought, ‘There is still good in this world,’” said Because I know they’re only a phone call away.

Yet interacting with people while volunteering is the most emotionally rewarding way to give, according to <PERSON>, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies how people navigate trade-offs between time and money.


“If you give time away, you actually feel like you have more of it,” Whillans said, explaining that we often are not as busy as we think we are.

The Be My Eyes app has attracted more than 100,000 visually impaired users since a <LOCATION>-based team launched the app in early 2015. When one of those users makes a call for help on his iPhone or Android device, 10 randomly selected volunteers get alerts on their own phones.

The first person to answer sees a video image of the blind user’s environment and tries to help resolve their issue. A volunteer may read the label on a soup can, look around a caller’s house for a missing object or do one of hundreds of other tasks that can be difficult for people with impaired vision.


“Sometimes it’s a quick fix, other times it’s a longer conversation of what’s life like where you are,” said <PERSON>, the chief executive of Be My Eyes. “That reminds us that we’re not that different, and the gap between ‘us and them’ is minimized.”

People who are visually impaired can use accessibility features to make calls from smartphones. The software uses speech and touch to communicate with users. Some phones also offer increased text sizes or color contrast to help people with low vision.

In the two years that she has used Be My Eyes, <PERSON> has made more than 10 calls for help. Although she said she most often uses the app for guidance matching her outfits, she has also called volunteers for help determining if her oven was on and navigating from a bus stop to a nearby dollar store.


<PERSON>, who is visually impaired, said she gets excited when she connects with a volunteer from her state of <LOCATION> or from a different country.

“What I think is cool about it is it’s anonymous,” said <PERSON>, a 43-year-old makeup saleswoman. “Some people are so self-conscious about asking for help.”

Be My Eyes doesn’t do background checks on its users or volunteers, although rules of conduct and respect are published on the app’s website. The company gives everyone “the benefit of the doubt,” Erfurt said, and bans people if someone reports their behavior as abusive more than once. Erfurt said the company relies on the assumption that the app’s users will see any inappropriate behavior as simply bad apples.

That proved true for <LOCATION>-based volunteer <PERSON>. When a caller once asked for her phone number, she said, she declined and assumed the uncomfortable experience was an anomaly.

Giordano’s second call through Be My Eyes was far more successful. Several family-related issues had left her crying before work one morning in August when a visually impaired user called to ask for help matching a pair of colored jeans to a shirt and scarf. The call was no more than 15 minutes, but <PERSON> said she probably would never forget it.

“It came at the right moment, because there were struggles going on in my life, and I thought, ‘There is still good in this world,’” said Because I know they’re only a phone call away.

**Contact Lenses that Respond to Light
UV-responsive dyes embedded in contact lenses can quickly adapt.**

**Sunglasses that darken automatically in response to bright sunlight have been available for eyeglasses for 40 years. But adapting this flexibility to contact lenses has proven challenging. Now researchers in Singapore have developed UV-responsive, or photochromic, lenses that darken when exposed to ultraviolet light, protecting the eyes against the sun’s damaging rays, and return to normal in UV’s absence.**

**Seeing the light: A new contact lens technology responds to UV light. The key is a novel polymer laced with an intricate network of nano-sized tunnels that can be filled with dyes. Initial studies have shown that the technology performs faster than the light-sensitive sunglasses on the market today, says Jackie Ying, director of the Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN) in Singapore, and developer of the lenses. The research is part of a broader effort at IBN to develop new materials for contact lenses that can dispense drugs and diagnose diseases.**

**Conventional light-responsive sunglasses are coated with millions of molecules of photochromic dyes, which are transparent when out of the sun. These molecules change shape when UV light hits, enabling them to absorb UV light and triggering the darkening of the lens. When UV light disappears, the molecules change back to their original shape and transparent appearance.**

**Few previous attempts have been made to design light-responsive contact lenses, largely because it’s difficult to apply dye coatings uniformly to the delicate, soft surface of a contact lens. Ying and her colleagues got around this by developing a contact lens that embeds dyes uniformly throughout the material.**

**This approach allowed them to pack more dye molecules into the material, Ying says, giving the contact lens greater sensitivity to light and thus a faster response.
Researchers created the spongy nanostructure material by mixing specific combinations of water, an oil solution with monomers commonly used in contact lenses, and a novel surfactant–a compound that encourages mixing between water and oil solutions.**

**The resulting material is studded with tiny pores and tunnels, which can be loaded with agents such as UV-sensitive dyes. The lens material’s porous structure provides a flexible environment for dyes to transform from dark to light and back again, says Edwin Chow, team leader and senior research scientist at IBN. “If the polymer is too rigid, the dye is stuck and can’t transform,” says Chow. “This pore structure and polymer happens to give the best environment for dyes to react quickly.”-**

**Speed performance is crucial for photochromic eyewear, particularly for adjusting from high to low levels of light. “When your car suddenly goes into a tunnel, the amount of light is very dim, so you need your lenses to transform back immediately,” says Chow. While this can take minutes with sunglasses, he says, “Our response time is 10 to 20 seconds.” The team is getting ready to test the photochromic contact lenses in animals. The researchers have already tested the lens material, without dyes, on rabbits, and have determined that it is biocompatible. Ying says the main concern in animal tests is to see whether the dyes are successfully contained within the lenses, or if they leak out.**

**In addition, researchers will work to focus the dyes so that they cover only the corneal region of the eye, to block out the most UV light. The lenses now have dyes distributed throughout, and would darken a wearer’s entire iris–a potentially unsettling effect.**

**The institute has created a spin-off, iNano Pte Ltd., to commercialize the technology. It will initially target markets in Japan and Korea. Ying estimates that photochromic contact lenses will be commercially available within a year.**

**Jan Bergmanson, director of the Texas Eye Research and Technology Center in Houston, says athletes may benefit the most from such contact lenses. “If you are a tennis player, and you perspire a lot, perspiration on sunglasses may be a distraction,” he says. “If you had [photochromic] contact lenses, you wouldn’t have to deal with this dilemma. So this may have a market as a sporty lens.”-**

**In the meantime, Ying is exploring other applications for the photochromic material, for instance as UV-sensitive tinting for windows and windshields, or as a cheaper coating alternative for sunglasses.**

This happens regularly, at the grocery store, at school, at work, etc. All day, every day, they stare and assume based upon what they see and don't bother asking questions because what they SEE must be it, right?

154,"Inaccessibility in every arena prevents anyone needing accommodations from full participation.    Some PWD need accommodations from birth and don't get them.  Those who get to college level are well aware of these barriers and have some skills at getting around at least enough of them to succeed as much as they have.   

It is my experience that as much as tech might create or fix an obstacle, my biggest and most insurmountable barrier has forever been people.   Those on positions of power to provide supports, facilitate participation or require changes that facilitate that participation are the always the ones whose attitudes make or break a situation.

Ex: I was one of the first mainstreamed VI kids in my pss.  The same woman who made that program, got some of us to camp for b/vi kids for years.   The bad side?   She controlled access to the library. (I was banned for a couple years because she felt I'd read everything accessible.) She decided what classes we could take (No art  for any of us but advanced sciences and career oriented courses were off the table, too.)   She also redistricted us to schools of her choosing.    (She was single handedly responsible for the best thing in my childhood - camp AND facilitated daily sexual assaults, bullying and relentless abuse at the hands of teachers, peers and other kids in the program.). 

This same woman pioneered all things braille for our pss.  She retired nearly two decades ago and as far as I know, still is the spearhead of new tech for braille transliteration of all HS math course materials from her home office.    She doesn't have the power she once had, but she can still decide whether a student has free access to a class via materials.  

 She's taught her secrets to others, for sure but they're less willing to do the work so a student actually used to have a better chance if she says 'yes' than if another teacher had to do the work.   She may have died by now.   Her good qualities were a blessing but she was human and a mess and we paid very well for her gifts.

So it is at every stage of our lives.  College fir me was just as mixed.  I had yo find my own enlargement service for my Russian materials but the math dept did their own magic.  The ODS chief forbade biology classes so most of us didn't even try as her interference meant out of pocket readers, notetakers, labs assistants and proctors.   She controlled find disbursements.    

Pick your battles. Persevere. Leave an easier toad for the next guy.  This is our plan for success.

207,"Hi there. I’m an Orientation and Mobility Specialist; I teach blind and visually impaired people how to travel independently. 

I’m not a doctor, but I’ve seen a few clients with trauma induced vision loss. It sounds like you were hot hard enough to detach your retina. If the doctors didn’t detect that early enough, it’s likely that the retina malnourished and died, leaving you a blind spot. Unfortunately, that was in your macula which is responsible for fine detail vision. Once the retina dies, it does not come back. 

It is strange that you are now experiencing issues in your other eye. It could have something to do with the optic nerve, the retina in that eye, or the visual cortex of the brain itself. It could be that there was a micro tear in that retina and it is now progressing. The brain is a really powerful thing. I’ve read stories of people growing up and losing their vision slowly, and not even realizing it until they cause some sort of accident that warrants a doctor’s attention. The good news is that you’ve identified the issue now. The sooner you can get medical attention the better. I know the holidays complicate that...

Also good news: if you find that print is difficult to read, there are free services out there for audio books, like the National Library Service. There is free software that will help you use your phone and computer by enlarging the screen or by using audio. Also, every state has a department dedicated to rehabilitation services for the blind and visually impaired. If you need help connecting to them, I would like to help.

219,"Hi! I use tinted contact lenses (sometimes). The ones I have cover the iris - they are entirely tinted.

I have albinism and therefore am photophobic and my acuity varies wildly depending on lighting. 

Take the following with a grain of salt because everyone is different 

The pros :
- you can add sunglasses on top of them 
- you can choose the tint you want (there aren’t a ton of options, but there are a few gradients) 
- they are pretty effective in situations with fluorescent lighting
- better acuity - I can read a  line Lower than with regular contacts (not the whole thing but a good chunk of it) (like from line 2 to 3) 
- good in snowy, reflective environments 

The cons: 
- they are thicker than regular contact lenses (or at least that’s how they feel to me). It takes a little while for me to get used to then when I pop them in, but afterwards it’s fine.
- I have yearly contacts. The closer I get to the end of the year, the less comfy they get and the less I will wear them
- my main issue with them is that I’ve had multiple pairs and after a while I have trouble focusing with them . Probably an issue with how they fit me personally.
- the ones I have make me look creepy. 
- not great at night, unless I am going to a concert. Makes the bright lights less annoying. 

That said, if you are photophobic or light sensitive, they are definitely worth a try. They take some getting used to, but if they turn out to be a good fit, than that would be excellent because I do see sharper with them (at a certain distance) and most importantly I am not as bothered by the sun or crappy overhead lights. 

I don’t know where you are located but when I was in Canada i couldn’t find them (actually got laughed out of multiple optometrists offices....) so it would be about finding someone who is more knowledgeable.

I see static of multiple colors, along with random flashes of various colors (yay, fireworks I guess?!?). I even see the static with my eyes closed.  I also have pretty much zero vision in low light.  I no longer drive and can’t read much other than digitally magnified text.

If you haven’t seen a low vision specialist, you should.  They can recommend assistive technology and set you up with orientation and mobility training.  Luckily, I have enough usable vision that I can navigate by sight (mostly), but I’ve ran into people and things much like you describe and it is embarrassing.  I use a signal cane in crowded environments, not so much to navigate, but to communicate my partial sightedness to others.

Just as important, though not at the age of two of course, they allowed me to take risks and got out of the way. Not that they wouldn't care or help me if I asked, most of the time at least, but they were willing to let me make my own choices, sometimes hurting myself in the process (unfortunately this is probably an inevitable part of learning).

I do something similar, but I have some vision, so I still use images, just *my* images rather than the true picture, if that makes sense. I have certain distinct features on people and places that act as identifying markers. A lot of it too is memorizing paths rather than places, so I can tell you how to get to another building based on my path, but not tell you what it looks like. 

With people’s faces, my brain fills in gaps, so it’s strange how often I forget their “true” face until they get close to me, esp with professors. 

Supermarkets and stuff are similar to campus- the Target near me recently completely remodeled and it fucked me up so much!!

I have never been able to keep track of overarching directions (like driving). I do notice landmarks that let me know I’m about to be where I’m headed, but that’s it. 

Mental maps are absolutely exhausting to keep up with, so I only bother remembering “important” faces- the people on either side of me in class, my profs (if I like them), my friends, family, and the children I babysit (moreso than their parents). Places are easier because they so rarely change, but they’re still a huge pain in the ass.

Sighted people so rarely understand that these maps take so much thought and memory, and often when you would be focused on an activity or task, we would be torn between cross-referencing mental maps and the actual task/activity at hand. That’s why accommodations matter- they free up brain space that we shouldn’t have to lose to things like this, we should be using that space to do the same things our peers are.

Newer, tall office buildings have elevators that don't have the floor buttons inside anymore, but they have a touchscreen security panel that displays the floors you can access when you scan your card in. While they do have an ""accessible"" feature built in, it is virtually useless when it is busy (which is most of the time). For example, my client scans in her card, and it starts reading the available floors (10 possible floors, out of 50). But it takes roughly 10 seconds to read them out... by which time, someone else has hit a button and that floor gets selection, which is most likely not her floor. An actual, accessible means of selecting the floor in a realistic use scenario would be amazing.

And on a related note, a method of locating an arriving elevator when you have a bank of 8, or 10, or 12 elevators. They make a sound when they arrive, but with a large number of elevators, it takes time (which you won't realistically have) to locate, especially when you have to factor in two different sides. And, related to the first problem, if it is the wrong elevator, then it would take you to the wrong floor (because of the security pass issue).

* Farts. Slightly embarrassing but she'll lift a butt cheek to let out a fart and was completely certain that the slight movement would be unnoticeable. To everyone else its an exaggerated motion that you do when your joking or something.

* Lights. My wife was pretty surprised to discover that when the lights are off I can't see her facial expression. When I explained further how difficult it can be to move around and do stuff in the dark she made the comment that eyes are useless and was quite chuffed that she could do a lot more than me in the dark.

* Direction and Sight line. Specifically... I can't see something if I don't turn my head and look at it. Also a funny situation that resulted in the comment from me ""Can you please move I can't see the TV"".

Thanks for your answer. I use a lot of sensory references too, as well as ""verbal scripts"" or instructions. What I don't do that you discussed is the sense of the angles. I just don't have that intuitive sense.

Can you clarify something for me? Say you're imagining the route from your house to any place in walking distance (insert whatever applies). If you were thinking about how to get there, would you imagine the shapes of the streets and how different buildings are related to each other, or is it more ""Turn left here, turn right there.""

Another thing I can't do for instance is integrate routes. At my school I was taught to walk from the student center to the library. I was also taught to walk from the student center to my classroom buildings (academic complex). This does not automatically teach me how to get from the library to the academic buildings; I would have to go back to the student center first and then go from there to the classes, unless it's literally along the same linear route or an O&amp;M instructor explicitly teaches me a new route.

She may be willingly adding the dynamic of accessibility to your thinking for your training.  Some of us do intentionally walk into situations like that but we definitely learn how to be a benefit and not a further hindrance.   This transition clearly hasn't happened with either of these two, yet.

For explanation...
Benefits :  You learn a little about formatting options or services that can help you.   You learn how to try to make your presentation accessible to ONE person with a vi.   Maybe this opens your eyes to accessibility not only in your work but your final product, too.  

Hindrances:    This heretofore unknown element affects your grade?   You are not prepared for any aspect of inclusion for her.  Added time and stress of trying to plan for unknowns which may be completely useless.   Reinforcement that she IS a zoo specimen and it's way easier to not have to think about her or any other permutation disability can throw at you.

That last hindrance really does a number on folks who genuinely want to help include/inyegrate/normalize non-mainstream persons.   

Yeah, slap him senseless.  He's subverting decades of progress on an individual/class level.  

Meanwhile, if this experience does inspire you to think of such things in a positive way, reach out to The Specimen*or your campus Office for disabled students and offer help with note taking or other mundane student tasks.   That way, you can learn from a range of individuals what works for them and remove the showmanship aspect from the equation.  

*She doesn't deserve this moniker even if she feels it's applicable.   It stems from us being 'the first' at something, or the one to speak up, or the only one like us in a situation.   Tokens.

The balance happens when she decides to advertise that she's willing to help students make their presentations accessible to her BEFORE she's disclosed as part of the panel.   He could add a lecture about accessibility and have a range of people speak and at the end of term, you learn they're judging.  Or!

For example, lip and tongue placement can disambiguate what is being said, or mouth movements may help identify who is doing the saying (sound localization). So, a low vision or blind person may not have these additional cues if the auditory information is somewhat ambiguous. I don't think I've personally experienced better hearing, but maybe someone else can speak to this.

That being said, one context where being low vision or blind can actually be helpful is when listening to a speaker explain something complex. Usually sighted people, when thinking about or hearing about complex things, will direct their gaze to simpler stimuli (e.g., a white wall). But a blind person should have less interference from those other senses.",,False,,Knight_Knave,,,1544070328,t5_2qpec,t3_a3jtjv,t3_a3jtjv,8,1547080401,0,1,eb6yiz3,Blind,,,,,

715,"Apart from braille screen input, another feature you didn't mention at all which in my opinion gives iOS and VoiceOver a massive productivity boost over Android is what Apple calls actions.

&amp;#x200B;

The vertical swipes that normally move to whatever the rotor is set to have another option which is automatically selected if whatever you focused has them, simply called Actions. VoiceOver will notify you if they're available. Actions allow you to, well, act on a control simply by swiping down and up through the available options and double-tapping to perform them. So, if you're focused on a message in your Email inbox swiping down through the available actions will give you options like reply, flag, mark as read and delete.  In an app that lets you work with files, you get things like copy, cut, rename, delete or show info, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Many developers, including Apple but also Microsoft, Facebook in both the Facebook app as well as Messenger and WhatsApp, and Twitter, both in the official app and 3rd party clients like Twitterrific, make extensive use of this feature, and it makes it extremely fast to do an action which would normally take someone using a Screen Reader a lot longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I quickly want to sort through Email, on Android you have to double tap to open a message, then explore the screen to find the button to delete a message, and then double-tap on it. On iOS, all I have to do is listen to the message preview, and if it's something I don't want to read it's simpy a matter of swiping up to select the delete action and double-tapping, which is almost as fast as pressing delete on a computer. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a Twitter client, any links and hashtags of a tweet are turned into actions. So if I see a tweet with an article I want to read it's simply a matter of swiping down once to select the link action and double-tapping to open the browser. Compare this with Android, where tapping on a link is either double-tap to open the tweet in detail, then explore to find the link and double-tap again to open it, or bringing up the local menu, selecting the links menu and double-tapping, and then selecting the link propper and double-tapping again.

737,"I experience something like this, yeah. I think it might be heightened vulnerability to sensory overload? This reminds me of one time, at band camp, when percussion was practicing in an exceptionally echoey chapel room. I was on orchestra bells, and could not hear anything I was doing. Like, more so than any other environment we played in. It might as well have been the heart of a thunderstorm.

I don't know how much my blindness is part of this, though. I went to an NFB National Convention, once, and it was *awful*. The big, tile-floored rotunda areas were sufficiently stressful that I made a point of trying to get past them long before anything opened, just to avoid the crowds. I wanted to spend more time in the Exhibit Hall, because it's not like there's a Wal-mart for blind people products, but the crowds were just *too much*. That scene in the 2003 *Daredevil* film, where he talks about how the rain gives him better feedback than usual? My experience is the opposite, other than extremely perfect situations (ex, the rain is very light. Also if I'm under an umbrella, that makes the sound worse.).

While blindness might contribute to this sort of thing, I get the impression that one has to already have some other traits that lend themselves toward being overwhelmed this way. I mean, there were over 3,000 blind people at that convention, so clearly it wasn't torture for all of them.

I just realized that none of the examples I gave are specifically what you asked about.
