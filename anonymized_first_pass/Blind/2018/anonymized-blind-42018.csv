Counterfeit Monkey - Possibly not the easiest game to play completely blind, since it's in part about spelling. But an amazing game. You have to escape a banana republic with only a gizmo that lets you change items by changing one letter in their names.  
Kerkerkruip - Not an adventure game, more of a roguelike RPG. You have to defeat seven monsters in a dungeon while growing more powerful. The game changes each time you play it, and the order in which you kill the monsters is critical to success.  
Spider and Web - Just thinking about this game gives me chills. This game has the single best puzzle in any game I've ever played. You'll know which one I'm talking about after you solve it. Try not to use a walkthrough until the end sequence, which is fine but not as important to not ruin as the rest of the game.  
Superluminal Vagrant Twin - A weird game, in that the ""rooms"" are not rooms, but planets. The game is sort of zoomed out in a weird way that gets rid of a lot of clutter. Has some fun easter eggs and the writing is great, if spare.  
Treasures of a Slaver's Kingdom - The writing in this game is a take-off of Conan and is great purple prose. Some RPG elements. A good laugh if the premise appeals to you.  
Varicella - Most of these recs aren't very puzzle focused, but this one is. An interesting protagonist and some strange and memorable characters.  
Hard Puzzle - Don't play this game. I'm warning you!

Considering the fact that you are over 18, why aren't you making these choices for yourself?
As a follow up, to that, If you don't want SSI, why are you still accepting it, and what are you doing to get yourself off the system? 
Additionally, how would you obtain access to a job or other resources you need without systems and laws like the ADA in place? Unrestrained capitalism creates a very strong incentive to justify the mistreatment or out right exclusion of blind and other disabled people from society.

I used to code back when I had sight but stopped doing it after going blind because it requires too much effort for too little return and doesn't flow naturally with me anymore, so now I sleep as much as possible and browse reddit twice or thrice a day to stay up to date with the news and complain about my blindness.

My sister comes over for a visit almost every day and that's usually the highlight of the day except on Tuesdays when I talk to a psychologist about the past when my life was great and get to introspect about what bothers me in blindness.  All my conversations either revolve around blindness or end up leading there, so you can imagine how annoying it must be to be around me.  Even here on /r/blind people are getting tired of me.  My friends distanced themselves when I lost my sight and rarely, if ever, contact me.  When asked about me some of them say that I've changed my phone number, which is not true, and this tells me a lot about their intentions.

I've tried to learn piano and was doing fine with the first grade songs, but as soon as the songs started to force me to lift my hands off the keyboard and I learned that I'd need years of practice before I could get it right I decided to quit because, again, music was no longer flowing naturally with me and unlike in coding there are no special techniques to get better at it other than training a lot.

Back in 2014, shortly before going completely blind, I fell to a railway because my contrast perception was already too bad to distinguish the edge of the platform and got hit by an incoming train but unfortunately didn't die, so now I have to endure this.

75,"I read my wife this post so I'm going to give her perspective and my perspective:

"" I had 20/20 vision until I turned 30. I started to lose my vision so I went to an eye doctor thinking that I simply needed glasses. When I went, the doctor scooted back in his chair and said, 'whoa, I can't help you.'  He sent me to a neurologist, thinking there was something wrong with my brain. Many invasive tests later, he sent me to an optoneurologist. He knew once doing his test that he would not be able to help me, so 2 years in he sent me to a retinal specialist. All of my friends had doubted me, saying I should seek psychiatric help. The retinal specialist, after lots of Clockwork Orange style tests and dyes injected into my arms was able to determine that I have a rare recessive disorder called progressive cone dystrophy. It causes me to go blind slowly. Visual acuity is the first to go. Color vision changes, sometimes achromotopsia. It was a relief to get a diagnosis. I wasn't crazy. It takes a long time to adjust to losing your independence. You have to go through the stages of mourning over the loss of your sight.""

From my perspective, being stressed or scared is natural. but remember, you can't change some things and you have to take a roll with it approach. My wife and I knew each other for many years but didn't start dating until her vision started to go. I've seen her depressed at times over this, but you just have to go on. I think the hardest thing for her is her loss of her ability to find a job. She's on disability now. She also has battled alchohol abuse. Part of this is boredom on her part. Being blind is boring af. We still go camping, hiking and do other activities. It's obviously hard for a person who was previously sighted to lose their vision. For me, the only major change is that I have to read menus for her when we go out to eat. 

Best of luck to you and your husband. ",False,False,,ratadeacero,,,1524605206,t5_2qpec,t3_8djxue,t3_8djxue,2,1526700850,0,0,dxwppy8,Blind,,,,,

106,"Most of the blind people I know prefer dating sighted people. All of the visually impaired people I know who are married are married to a sighted person. I myself am legally blind and dating a sighted woman. I have to say that in my experience, blind-blind couples are far more rare than blind-sighted couples. 

Sure it's nice in theory to have someone who understands what it's like to be visually impaired, but there are thousands of conditions and everyone has their own unique experiences so really, whether you end up dating a sighted person or a visually impaired person they probably won't fully understand the nuances of your personal situation anyway, even if they have the same condition as you. 

Frankly, having a sighted partner can make your life a lot easier in some situations.

None of us had enough vision to be able to read the menu which of course we weren't familiar with and there was a significant language barrier between ourselves and the server.

I suspect that was because he was very familiar with the layout and the garden beds had larger edging (rock lines and low rock walls) that he used for guideance. He always uses gardening gloves from memory.

As for mowing lawns, grandpa may have mowed the lawn occasionally, but he'd usually get my dad or one of my brother's to do it. If he did mow it on his own (which honestly wouldn't surprise me, we're quite the same in that we'll just go ahead and try doing something ourselves irrespective of the challenge due vision impairment in my case and total blindness in his) I suspect he'd use the rock lines a guide. So he'd get in line (using feet to feel the ground) and mow slowly till he hit the rock line, then turn and head back. In the spots where it would have been possible to cross onto a path, it'd be pretty obvious and the mower blades shouldn't strike the concrete or pavers, so you should be ok.

I'm only maintaining two garden beds and keep weeds out my paving (it really needs to be redone), and I'm often lazy about it. But grandpa was maintaining a full size garden - front and back lawns, five separate garden beds, greenhouse, a vegetable patch with four or five beds - on his own (bar the aforementioned help mowing the law) and he'd be out there most days. It was the best kept garden in the street as I recall, and he couldn't see a bit of it!",False,False,,Terry_Pie,RP - Legally Blind,,1523405830,t5_2qpec,t3_8b8wi0,t3_8b8wi0,2,1526188611,0,0,dx5p5wd,Blind,,,blue1,,

Letting me know e.g. that there's a shorter way to X is fine — I might not have known — but just saying ""don't go that way"" is not. Nor is it OK to get between me and a wall I'm shorelining, or tell me how to use my cane.

I got accommodations that the teachers, for the most part, respected. The school system sent a tutor out to my school to teach me braille. The accommodations allowed me to be academically successful. 

I've also learned that self-advocacy is a great tool to have when it comes to being visually impaired in a classroom. I'm 18 and still struggle with advocating for myself, but I've learned that teachers will listen, especially if you have accommodations, a 504, or an IEP to back you up. The teachers sometimes just need a little nudge or reminder.

I hope this helps in some way and good luck! I understand the struggle.

128,"I think this is pretty solid advice. I'm sighted, but someone being blind wouldn't stop me from dating them. You have to make a good first impression, though, because there's hundreds of thousands of people to sort through. Based on the dating sites I've been looking through, a lot of sighted guys could use this advice, too.

For me? I like a guy who looks and presents himself as classy. Not arrogant or 'above other people'. Just someone who takes care of himself and has a professional look. I'm also into cosplay and such, so someone who is interested in or at least is neutral to partaking in the same hobby is a bonus, too.

I apply the same logic to myself. Recently I've decided I wanted to try dating, and I realized that I need to get myself in a place where I feel comfortable with that. I've gone to the gym, watched what I eat, and plan on making myself a new wardrobe soon - all before I've started making serious efforts in actually looking for someone. About 8lbs to go and I'll probably hit 19-20% body fat and be pretty darn fit. All in all, it'll probably about 8 months of effort in the end, but when you want a date you have to go in knowing you're not the only one and it doesn't hurt to stack things in your favor as much as you can.

First of all, they start off their video in an inaccessible way- like would it really be that hard to read out whatever text they were showing on the screen? I know its a minor detail but it immediately indicates that this is intended for a sighted audience, not a blind one. 

My next issue with this is their ""evidence"" that most blind people can't read braille. Yes, braille literacy is low, but that's mostly because 1. A large portion of the visually impaired population has some remaining sight and 2. the massive increase in screen-reading technology. Yeah, braille is really difficult to learn at a later age, and admittedly i read braille about as fast as a kindergartener reads any text, but attributing the low braille literacy to difficulty alone is just plain wrong. 

My next issue is practicality- when the heck could this ever be used? It seems like it would be much more difficult to learn to differentiate between at least 26 complex different symbols than it would be to remember the combinations of 6 dots. I can't imagine anyone reading this with speed and accuracy. 

And i know he mentioned that sizing is adjustable, but even at a small ""font,"" the symbols would probably take up just as much space or more than good ole braille. And we all know how bulky braille books can be. So an average book can still take up several large volumes.

Speaking anecdotally here- most people i know don't use paper all that often anyone. Most of my braille reading friends use braille displays to do their work. Can this company produce an elia equivalent? Or can elia ONLY be read on paper- thus making it mostly useless to tech-loving people

And what would people do if their printer broke down? They'd be out of a writing system (at least temporarily), unless this company can design and produce its own type of slate.

See if you can get a technology assessment through the DOR (if you live in the states)  so you can find the best set up for your needs. 

I use a unit called a ""revo to go"" (basically a fancy android tablet). It can connect wirelessly to a small portable camera so i can ""look"" around the classroom and view things from a distance. It also comes with an optioonal stand so i can prop the tablet up and use the tablet as a CCTV. 

It's fairly lightweight and it performs wayyy better than my visionbook did. The only downside is that the actual cctv function (just for looking directly at papers) is pretty limited. But, that won't be an issue for you in college. A lot of information will be available online and you can request to have your materials sent to you in an accessible digital format, so you don't have to use paper all that often anyway.

Generally coffee or drinks, usually in the afternoon. It's got to be some place with people and something ya can leave fairly easily if it's just going awfully!

Last date was in a coffee shop I picked. It was a lot busier than expected, which was annoying.

I thought it was going well for I guess nearly the first hour - she laughed at all my jokes. I thought the conversation flowed and she had plenty to say for herself.

Then at a certain point things changed and she just wanted to get out of there - she didn't say that obvs but that's the vibe I got. This was coming toward the hour and a half mark. Naturally I obliged and ended it as quickly as possible when I got that vibe.

I still have no idea why, which is annoying because she was the pick of my dates so far, she was clever, cute and funny.

I asked her afterwards (online) where it all went wrong and she said she'd had a lovely time, I was a lovely fellow etc. but I just wasn't her type ... or words to that effect.  Clearly though, we can't put too much weight on what she said there, since she was obviously trying to be nice and would probably say something similar even if she actually had a really awful time - I would in her place.

418,"For most people the question would be about safety. If getting a guide makes the travel significantly safer then possibly. However, should you trust the stranger? Is the stranger a safe guide? Is there any special risk where you are travelling? These are all questions a blind person will be asking themselves whenever offered assistance by a stranger in public.

In most cases getting a stranger's ""help"" isn't quantifiably better than the blind person making their own way. The blind person may be familiar with the route, have good mobility skills, feel safe without assistance, don't want to talk to random weirdos, prefer to use their dog or cane, etc. so generally blind people aren't interested or wanting of guides. 

Before GPS my wife would sometimes ask to the people around her ""Is this 5th and Main?"" for confirmation. Now she may still ask ""Is that the number 12 bus approaching?"" but beyond the cases where she is requesting confirmation she doesn't want or need assistance. In either of the examples the confirmation assists her but certainly can be done without if unavailable.

She has accepted assistance from random people very occasionally for situations like the city has dug up the sidewalk and not coned off the holes and her dog is having a problem finding a path. Happens surprisingly often. Getting through the jam of people at concert at intermission to find the bathroom she has sometimes asked for someone to show here the way.

I have trouble knowing how far away traffic lights are and how long it will take to get to them. Most of the lights I deal with have pedestrian timer signals next to them, which I can usually make out the time on, especially now that I've had so much practice reading them at a distance. The ones I'm used to sync with the light, so that the pedestrian countdown is counting down to the instant that the traffic light will turn yellow. I use those to gauge whether I need to worry. If I seem to be at risk of dealing with a yellow, then I make a conscious effort to compare my speed to how far away it seems, and I try harder to figure out how far that is. The relative size of cars closer to the light helps, as does the relative size of the traffic light. Not applicable to you, but it helps me to look at things a little to the left and a little to the right to try to get some input from each eye.

On another note, I find it easier to gauge distances when I'm in traffic with plenty of cars around me. The relative size of cars and distance between them really helps me figure out how far away things are. It's open road that I have more trouble with.

[*Young blind man in a sweater, sitting alone in a room with brick walls. Background cello music.*]

**Young man**: It was very new to me when I tried it for the first time. It was like a different world.

[*black screen with white text*] Over 253 million people in the world are visually impaired.

(00:10)  

[*The young man is wearing black virtual reality gloves, waving his hands in front of his face*]

**Young man**: I was thinking - how can I feel in these gloves? How the hell am I supposed to feel something now? Then the vibrations came and it was something I totally didn’t expect.

[*black screen with white text*] Neurodigital presents TOUCHING MASTERPIECES

**Young man**: Art is not always explainable just by words. The element to touch it, and to know, to feel it is missing.

(00:33)  

[*black screen with white text*] A unique VR experience for the blind and visually impaired.

**Young man**: When first touching the virtual statue I was kinda puzzled, like

[*The young man is now wearing a tuxedo and VR gloves. Behind him is a digital rendering of the Venus de Milo. As the young man moves his hands, we see what part of the statue he is “feeling.” He smiles broadly.*]

**Young man’s voice**: It actually works! Yeah, there’s something in front of me that is existing. 

(00:52) 

[*Camera is moving down a museum’s long hallway. A sign says the exhibit is called “Touching Masterpieces.”*]

**Young man’s voice**: Usually when you come to a museum you can’t touch these things, so I can just hear about it from a guide or someone who is with me reading that. That’s not the full experience. 

[*We see the young man in the brick room, then some Braille signage on a museum display about da Vinci’s David*]

**Young man**: It shouldn’t be.

[*black screen with white text*] March 2018, The National Gallery in Prague

(01:08)

[*Close up of many adults putting on virtual reality gloves*]

**Young man’s voice**: The best moment, of course, was when I started to have an idea of, like, what part of the body I’m touching.

[*We see several participants using VR gloves to experience David, Venus de Milo, a bust of Cleopatra. Close ups on various faces - they all look genuinely excited.*]

**Young man’s voice**: Having the art in front of you, and you can explore it and see how much your imagination was right and what you wouldn’t expect. For example about David, like, yeah, I knew this guy would have a big head, but that it’s this big?

[*A VR display shows Venus de Milo. There are red, green, and black marks indicating where a person is “touching” it. A young woman is now speaking to the camera. She is in a museum hall.*]

**Young woman**: I recognized the dress of Venus de Milo, I said, like “This is the dress!” and they said “Yes, alright!” [*laughs, screen fades to black*] 

**Young woman’s voice**: So it was the greatest.

(01:48)  

[*Back to the young man in the brick room*]

**Young man**: The entire experience, this is something that adds this element which was missing before. That you can...see it, really, and know the beauty of the art and touch it.

613,"So basically, the light the sun emits has a few effects that contribute to retinopathy.

UV scrambles DNA in your cellos, which can lead to mutations, this could cause cell death, cancer, all sorts. Our body has an intrinsic ability to correct these mutations but it is not 100% accurate, which is why if you get too much sun exposure you're more likely to develop skin cancer. 

Some people are just genetically more predisposed to sensitivity in photoreceptors. This means that staring at the sun, which emits a lot of concentrated radiation, focused on your retina, can cause a metabolic overload in the cells that are basically working too hard to try and convey to your brain ""whoa there is a lot of light here"". If you keep staring at the sun, the cells tire out and if you have particular genetics this can cause buildup of reactive oxygen species and other molecules which are harmful to cells, causing them to die, if they cannot be removed quickly enough. Unfortunately the retina doesn't have a great deal of regenerative capacity so once enough photoreceptors die you start to lose vision.

The app has issues, but the matching algorithm is quite robust and with some navigation workarounds in the app and the site, it is quite functional. As with all dating, you will only get out of it what you put into it, and it really is like a full-time job. It comes down to how you present yourself, how well you communicate what you are looking for, and if you actually meet people with whom you can share interests. 

Full disclosure, I lost my vision entirely 4 years ago, met someone on OkCupid a few months later using my new VoiceOver and accessibility tech skills, and we are still together today. We are in an open relationship and I seek additional play partners using both OkCupid and Tinder. With Tinder, I just keep swiping right and let the onus on matching go to the women. I am fully open and honest about my relationship and blindness in my profiles, plus my partner and I are linked in OkCupid so anyone can view both our profiles. Tinder has been pretty successful, plus I wrote a fun blog about dating a blind guy and tend to link matches to it if we are clicking and are trying to set up a date. Getting offline ASAP is most helpful so you can assess chemistry and how you click in person. Some women will look past the blindness, others will be curious, it will always be a crapshoot. It's awkward, there will be rejection, but just stay persistent and understand that dating always goes through peaks and lulls and if you give it solid attention, you'll be much more successful. 

Confidence, not making a big show of the blindness and normalizing it and just being yourself will go a long way! So depending on what you are looking for, OkCupid is your best bet for general dating, Tinder is for hookups and play no matter what anyone else tells you. You can try other apps like Plenty of Fish or Coffee Meets Bagel, but OkCupid is the most successful and robust in my dating experience.

651,"Hey, I’m a nearly totally blind student at a fairly ‘elite’ (according to whatever standard US News and World Report uses these days) college. I would say one thing that almost every blind student I know struggles with is the bureaucracy/incompetence of DSS offices. I once spent six months arguing to get a textbook I can read, and have spent whole semesters without accessible readings. Yes, there are technically laws in place to stop this, but it happens anyway. I don’t think I’ve ever met another blind student who hasn’t struggled with this in some way. 

I prefer to read things I need to understand well in Braille. I have a Braille display; you can just Google to learn more about those. Socially, I would say I’m introverted. I have leadership positions in two organizations on campus, and I’m president of a pretty well-known group on campus. So I interact with people a lot, and I’ve had to learn to force them to become comfortable with me and my disability. I would definitely say I have a few close friends I prefer to keep to, though. Academically, things are pretty much the same as with sighted students, I just access material definitely. Romantically...I’m a heterosexual woman and have never really been in a serious relationship, but I don’t think that’s blindness so much as me being awkward, haha. 

I love hiking! I generally prefer to have a sighted guide for it, both for the help and also because they can describe things. :) Honestly, I would say the most poignant moments for blind people are the same as for sighted people.

- Move, find somewhere with public transit, get signed up for paratransit, like a mini bus for people with disabilities who can’t drive for whatever reason.

- Stay depressed, stay a hermit, stagnate and be unhappy.

It’s harsh, but that’s reality for blind and visually impaired people. I was 18 when I lost almost all of my vision, but I forced myself to accept it because all the thoughts, prayers, hopes and well-wishes in the world won’t change the fact that I’m blind now.

 It's totally OK to _offer_ your arm, or to touch (when relevant) purely to help indicate where you are — _if_ you've made verbal contact first to establish that they want to be interacting with you in the first place.

 To do so, use the _back_ of your hand (_not_ palm) to touch the blind person's forearm. That way we know where you are, how to get hold of your arm, _and_ that you're not going to be the (extremely common) grabby-assaulty type.

 Do _not_ grab a blind person, and especially do not fucking grab their cane. (You wouldn't like it if someone grabbed _you_ by the eyeballs.)

2.  Some people (eg me) prefer to not hold on to sighted guides at all, and just follow by sound. 

 For that, it's helpful if you keep talking, or drag/scuff your feet a bit. It can be quite hard to track a specific person, especially in a noisy environment like a subway station with lots of people.

 In particular, please remember to make sure you're audible if you take a turn, go off to talk to someone, etc. If you leave without indication, the blind person will probably not notice, and get annoyed / confused / disoriented.

 It's also helpful, for sound-based guide, to walk about a step behind and to the side, so you're not in the way of the cane or changes in direction (e.g. to follow a wall). Don't worry about crowds; the white cane is a more effective Moses than you are. :-P

Holding on vs following by sound is definitely a matter of preference though. You can ask, if it's established that someone wants your guidance in the first place. More likely though, the blind person will probably just indicate which they prefer.",False,False,,saizai,lightblind,,1523629465,t5_2qpec,t3_8bvcmt,t1_dx9yyrf,5,1526281426,0,0,dxau3zw,Blind,,,blue1,,
