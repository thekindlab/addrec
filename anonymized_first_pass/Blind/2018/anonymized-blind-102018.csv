42,"Apple's edge on this kind of thing is that they are pretty good at accessibility.

And, which is also important, they are *consistent.*

The accessibility features are well thought through, and they have behaved pretty much the same say, with only minor changes, since they were introduced. In other words, once she figures it out, she can confidently switch over to any new iPhone later when the time is right for that.

That's the main reasons why may users with vision impairment won't even consider having something else. She'll be in good company with her iPhone.

The first thing you might need to consider is getting her one of the largest available phones. iPhone 6 plus or any of it's Plus-branded siblings. They are the ones with the larger screen. It's what we buy to our near-pensioners at my job when they can no longer use a phone without also fetching their reading glasses, because you literally make the phone behave as if it was one of the really small screen'ed iPhones, but with a huge screen.

If her vision is so poor that it won't help her any to have a larger screen to look at, disregard what I just said. It's merely a food for thought-thing.

As long as she can sort of see, it's worth fiddling with the accessibility menus and try different settings for how buttons are represented, text size, zoom and so on. But...if she can't see what happens, the only sensible route forward is to help her learn to use the screenreader, VoiceOver, blindly. Yep. That annoying thing that forces you to click everything several times while it speaks the screen contents. That's what she'll have to rely on when she can no longer actually see the screen.

Along with making sure that all the important apps are always at the same location on the screen, setting up favourites in the Phone app and so on, that's how you make it practical to use it.

There is a learning curve for Siri, the voice assistant, but once it has learned to understand her it's also a pretty awesome compliment to VoiceOver. It's often more practical to tell your phone to *""phone mum""* than to actually click on the screen several times until it does it. Siri starts with a blank knowledge about you and your family. There will be a lot of *""call dad.""* - *""Who is your dad?""*-conversations with Siri before it's useful. But it *is* useful once it has made all the relevant notes in your phonebook. Make absolutely sure that you use the iCloud backup so that what she teaches this phone in terms of who is who will follow to the next phone in the future.

Siri is one of those times when us lazy people who want to have our phone do mysterious things for us while we are driving has turned out to be a pretty good accessibility feature too. She just starts pretty dumb, Siri, and needs to be taught a lot of things.

Siri can be a bit headset dependant, training her with a bluetooth headset that has a lot of audio enhancement features may mean she'll have to be properly trained again if you switch to Apples own headsets. I have a lot of trouble with Siri when I switch back and forth between my Plantronics headset and the car. And definitely also when switching from the AirPods to the car, but less so when switching from the Plantronics headset to the AirPods. In other words, don't switch headsets unnecessarily. But definitely have a headset so that she can use the phone out among people without having others constantly being able to listen in on what she is doing. Apples cabled headsets (the ones that are shipped with the phone) are awesome for this. They really are.

iPhone can also make use of Bluetooth keyboards, which means that if she has trouble figuring out the typing thing on the screen, it's possible to buy a really small bluetooth keyboard and hook it up, so that she has something in her pocket that has proper keys. They are easier to learn to type on. And a lot faster too, if the phone will be her only communications-gadget.

It can also help a bit with the small screen to use a smartphone pen, though that means that there is even more stuff she has to carry with her to confidently use her phone. Let's not exaggerate unless she needs it.

And, oh. It's probably a good idea to lock the phone in either Landscape or Portrait mode, so that things are definitely not moving around on the screen just because she tilts it once she has learned where to click after them.",,False,,enjoyoutdoors,,,1538742222,t5_2qpec,t3_9ljbdz,t3_9ljbdz,2,1540710503,0,0,e77l2hm,Blind,,,,"Apple's edge on this kind of thing is that they are pretty good at accessibility.

And, which is also important, they are *consistent.*

The accessibility features are well thought through, and they have behaved pretty much the same say, with only minor changes, since they were introduced. In other words, once she figures it out, she can confidently switch over to any new iPhone later when the time is right for that.

That's the main reasons why may users with vision impairment won't even consider having something else. She'll be in good company with her iPhone.

The first thing you might need to consider is getting her one of the largest available phones. iPhone 6 plus or any of it's Plus-branded siblings. They are the ones with the larger screen. It's what we buy to our near-pensioners at my job when they can no longer use a phone without also fetching their reading glasses, because you literally make the phone behave as if it was one of the really small screen'ed iPhones, but with a huge screen.

If her vision is so poor that it won't help her any to have a larger screen to look at, disregard what I just said. It's merely a food for thought-thing.

1. leaves, branches, etc that jut out into sidewalks

Common and pretty much unavoidable unless you know that specific spot from previous experience.

I always wear a wide-brim hat, so I can partially avoid/shield this by just looking downwards, if I have a half-second or so of reaction time to go defensive.

2. street signs, phone booths, etc

If I notice a pole, I try to clear it vertically in case it has a projection. But depending on how fast I'm walking and how wide my sweep, I might not get the pole, and thus might not notice the sign or whatever projecting out from it. Or if I'm tired or distracted, I might forget to clear it.

In London (where I mainly live) this is almost never a problem. They have all signs mounted above head level.

(I did however once walk face first into a wall-mounted TV monitor with nothing below — in a UK government building's waiting area. That was a major fail. I reported it, but still waiting to hear back.)

In most other cities this is a major issue. Boston &amp; DC especially, IME.

3. indoor stairs

Rare, but sometimes. Mainly two-level stores where they've failed to put barriers under the stairs. Hit myself pretty bad at a Starbucks in DC once.

4. tree branches in open fields

Its probably not the same everywhere, but at my university when a student has accommodations every professor of that student gets the same email with the list of accommodations. What happens a lot is the student won't actually need some or all of the accommodations in every class, just in the classes they struggle with. So professors might not go out of their way to arrange extended time for an exam or provide class notes until they are asked to by the student. Otherwise the professor will have gone to the trouble unnecessarily. I'm not saying that's the right way to go about it, but that's what happens a lot. Especially in large lecture classes, professors can get a lot of students all with particular accommodations and it can be difficult to keep track of.

I knew I couldn’t see well, but for the longest time I didn’t realize that other people really could see more... I’ve never been able to see better than 20:60 my entire life (with glasses), and it’s gotten worse over the years. 

I spent about 3 years thinking like you did. My vision was holding steady at 20:100 and I knew I needed help but didn’t want to have to. I didn’t feel like a sighted person, but I certainly didn’t feel blind. And yet I was angry at the sighted world for not being more accommodating. 

I was declared legally blind, then spent ten years pretending it didn’t matter and that I was fine. I stayed as far away from visually impaired and blind people as I could, so much so that random people on the street knew more blind people than me and i was blind myself. 

Eventually, my eyes got even worse and I started to need my cane every day and magnifiers and tech on the computer to be able to see it. I’ve never switched to voice navigation for the computer, but I use it on my phone sometime and do most of my pleasure reading with books on tape. It took time to get used to listening instead of reading. There are days when I hate that it’s so much less efficient, but if I try to read with my eyes for any length of time, I give myself a migraine.

I have no peripheral vision so if I open a kitchen cupboard door and forget, I will snack my head on it a minute later.
People say, don’t you remember that you opened it? But that is the job of peripheral vision. A fully sighted person doesn’t remember they opened the cupboard door. Their peripheral vision reminds them. 
So it’s not just unfamiliar places, it’s at home too.
My legs always have bruises on them from catching furniture corners. I misjudge door frames and catch elbows or shoulders.
I’m probably safer outside because I have my guide dog with me or my long cane. Long cane doesn’t protect against overhanging branches though, or low hanging signs. My dog will scan upwards too and lead me away from an overhanging branch,

Of course, licensing fees for the FineReader engine are quite pricy, too, so in a way, I understand why the high prices.
2. Offline recognition. Seeing AI can recognize documents and guide the user for an optimum document capture, however, the recognition happens online, via neural net. If the app could do accurate offline recognition, this would be immensely useful, especially for sensitive documents.

As for the dating thing, my boyfriend and I actually started dating while I was blind. We were friends first, and he was used to helping me around while I was adjusting to a new life, but it didn’t deter him from dating me. What you should realize is that not everyone sees a disability as who you are. There are people out there who recognize a person behind a disability, so I feel that though it may be a more difficult start, you definitely could get yourself out there for dating. 

My boyfriend actually got his degree in CS. As for transportation, again, it is a routine you will have to get used to.

He lost his right eye when he was born and then through a combination of laser therapy and chemo it caused severe damage to his retina and optic nerve so the expectation is that maybe he can see broken parts of a scene in front of him, but because the severity of the damage they can’t say if a particular area of vision would be better or worse I.e. looking up or down for instance.

I have a structural defect in my right eye. Tear fluid is usually released from two outlets per eye, one above and one below each iris, then it's 'drained' into the tear ducts that are in the eye lid.

I'm missing a tear outlet on my right eye. My eye has a fluid bubble inside of it. It's slowly swelling and frankly doesn't comfortably rest inside my eye socket anymore. My astigmatism is that swelling and the fact that tilting my head moves the fluid bubble- if I pay attention I see objects change shape as I tip my head.

So this is a ""fix the eye or remove the eye"" situation. This is slowly getting painful and will eventually be dangerous.

353,"Hi I’m Usher too with one child who is a carrier but does not have Usher.
I’m assuming she’s a carrier because she definitely has one faulty gene from me because I don’t carry a “normal” gene. But of course her other gene from her dad is “normal” so with Usher being recessive and not dominant, she’s fine. 
She has a risk of having children with Usher if she meets another Usher carrier, which is what happened with my parents, Neither of them had Usher (or anyone else in both of their families) but they were unknowingly carriers. They had two kids. Both (me and my sibling) have Usher. Being recessive it’s supposed to be a one in four chance but stats don’t work like that 
I chose to take the risk of becoming a parent because the chance of my husband also being a carrier were incredibly slim, And if it turned out my kid did have Usher - well, I’m the best equipped person to be their parent and how to handle it. The promising research also played a part - I do believe the cure will be implemented in my lifetime and therefore my kids lifetime too.
Now. Being an Usher parent is hard. I was 39 when I had my kid. The pregnancy definitely took its toll. And running around after a very active kid when you can’t see/hear very well is hard. It really is. My kid has a mum who says sorry darling, mummy can’t do that. But we make it work and I wouldn’t change it for the world, no one said life was gonna be easy :)

- College is an experience that will allow me to see that I’ll be able to independently live on my own, so find a college with decent public transportation.(Again, don’t let your girlfriend dictate where you guys should go)
- get to know the vocational rehabilitation counselors that handled the area where you’re going to school, and leverage the resources that they have available to them that you might not.

358,"Hi ClaudeMichel! Thanks for the response. I like your version actually! I probably wasn't very clear with the story. It might also be tricky to read the document maybe. I will try to describe it here a little bit.

&amp;nbsp;


The film takes place at our main character's, Paul's apartment. It is only black screen so the audience sees nothing in the beginning. I wanted the audience to experience Paul's world a little bit so it will be only sound for a while. 

&amp;nbsp;


He lives alone. He tries to use the BeMyEyes (the app that connects blind and low vision people with sighted volunteers for visual assistance) to get help on some housework tasks and also initiate some social contact through the app. We hear a phone call being made and a automated operator says ""Establishing connection with, Karen"". He is very dubious of this service and this second attempt of his goes pretty bad. The voluntary that responds the call get's overly excited and makes him feel alienated. He says ""Jesus... not this."".

&amp;nbsp;


After a few days of this phone call he gets sick with high fever. He is taking antibiotics. His alarm goes off to remind him about his pills. He is not in a good mood and says ""Tired of these fucking pills"" to himself. He is distracted and ends up dropping the pill. Screams ""Fuck!"" to himself and starts looking for the pill. He starts having a mild panic attack but then calms himself down. We understand that by hearing his heavy then steady breathing. We hear a phone call being made, ""Establishing connection with, Jane"" says the operator. This time, the volunteer that responds the call is a calm and a gentle person. She responds by saying, ""Hi, I’m Jane. How are you doing today?""
Paul gets surprised by the response and whispers himself ""How are you?"" then starts talking with her, still sceptical, and unconfident of himself. He slightly stutters due to that. He says, ""Uhm. Yeah, hi, thanks, I'm fine, well... not really, not right now. Uhm, and you?
Jane responds, ""I’m doing alright, just missed my train so glad you called and keeping me company. Did you miss yours too?"" she chuckles. 

Paul nervously chuckles back and says, 
""Something like that. I, Uhm, I, actually dropped my pill. (pauses) You know, if I can’t find it, I might get some fascinating hallucinations right before I pass out."" 

Paul turns on the camera and the light in the room gets help from Jane and eventually finds the pill. As he turns on the light in the room, this is the first time we see Paul. The camera is behind Paul and we only see the back of his head and top of his shoulders. 


Paul starts using the service and we see series of scene where he gets help through this service. The camera follows Paul from behind through out every scene but with each new phone call, the scenes get more colorful, sharper and spacious. His body covers less of the frame and we see more of what's happening when he talks to more volunteers. He gets more confident and overall happier with the service and himself.


&amp;nbsp;


After some time, by coincidence, he gets connected to Jane again. To the woman who gave him the courage to continue with his calls. They have a pleasant conversation but the thing that Paul needs help with sounds complicated. Jane figures out that they actually don't live so far away from eachother and she offers to come over to his place to help him out in person. When she arrives to his place, the camera moves from Paul's back to Jane's back. We see Paul from the from for the front for the first time. They are both happy and engaged. We hear nothing except the upbeat music taking the scene over.

The end.

382,"Minecraft has no objective, it's a sandbox. That either sounds amazing or terrible depending on your outlook, but for boys 8-13 it's irresistible. I'd play it a little yourself first. One thing to understand is that you're not meant to just boot it up and play, you'll be confused. Most of the knowledge about how to build things comes from reading the wiki or, in practice for kids, watching YouTube. After loading up the game, have a tablet or computer with you and do a lot of Googling, like look up ""make shovel minecraft"" and similar.

I'd set a goal of making an item out of iron when you play. If you achieve that, you'll know enough to help your son with most things until he's self-sustaining. The steps you would take to do that are:

1. When you appear in the world, look for a tree.
2. Hit the tree with your fist until it drops some wood.
3. In your inventory, put the wood in the gird of 4 boxes and then click the output box to get the wooden planks. You're making the wood into wooden planks.
4. Make sticks. (You'll have to start looking things up here, you use the planks to make the sticks.)
5. Make a wooden pickaxe.
6. Use the wooden pickaxe to collect stone.
7. Make a stone pickaxe, shovel, and axe.
8. Collect more wood using the axe. If night is approaching, use the shovel to dig and hide yourself until morning. This can be annoying, go get a cup of coffee until the sun comes up. Once you're good at the game you can make a shelter in the first day and this kind of thing isn't necessary. Basically, when it gets dark, monsters appear and you will die right away, more or less. If you bury yourself somewhere you won't die. Just dig three squares down and put some dirt above you to cover yourself up.
9. Build a furnace. Burn wood to make coal.
10. Make torches and a stone sword. 
11. You're ready to explore a cave. Stumbling around you may have seen a cave. Use the torches to light your way and if you see a monster, hit it with the sword. Make sure you're not hungry, otherwise your health won't come back.
12. Find iron ore in the cave, which can be tricky. Also find some more coal.
13. Use the ore and the coal in the furnace to make an iron ingot.

If you can do even part of this you'll be in a good position to help your son. It's a great and actually rather wholesome game more focused on building than destroying. You create your own objectives as you realize you need more and more stuff to complete projects. Like, for example, sometime in the above you're going to want to make a house, and perhaps even a farm to grow food.

391,"I used to feel that way when I was 20/100 or so. Would not see people in the cafeteria and wouldn't know where to sit, would walk past people. Sometimes, games and stuff would be annoying on the computer, and reading was tiring.

Then it got worse. I couldn't read books. Couldn't really see what was happening at the movies. Could only make out a few words at a time on the computer. Later, I couldn't see faces, even if I was right in front of them. Can't see when the light changes on the street, can only see people when they're right  in front of me.

Funny enough, the more blind I got, the better I got at dealing. I levelled up my speaking skills and have the right thing to say to make situations less awkward, both for me and for others. I learned programming and developed ways of doing my work even better than I did it before. I learned to enjoy listening to audio speech, not the nice stuff but the initially bad-sounding espeak voices. Now I read 10-15 million words a year or so. I started running and lifting. Basically, I did all the stuff that people imagine they're going to do. Guess I felt like I needed to in order to survive.

I'm 20/800 now on a good day, but I could outthink, outtalk, and very probably beat up my 20/100 self. Not sure if that's just maturity and time and it would have happened anyway, but it seems that something in the adversity might have triggered a determination that might otherwise not have been there. I am literally a better person at 20/800 than I was at 20/100, not in some metaphorical way but in a real sense.

Basically, your eyes are only a part of the equation. I, and probably many people here, would love to have vision like yours.

If you focus on what you do poorly and how unfair it all is, you'll eventually realize that that is a dead end. You got dealt a deck of cards that's better than almost everyone else at the table, assuming your in a developed country and you don't have other mental and physical ailments. Play your cards well, don't complain that the game is rigged.

The takeaway isn't to buck up and get on with it, though that's not the worst sentiment either. Just realize how literally lucky you are, and start focusing on all the ways, the hundreds of ways, you can make your life better. Make people around you happy. Go out for a walk and say hi to people. Volunteer. Learn to play the cornet or program yourself a for loop.

392,"Learn how to use Voiceover yourself then teach your sister how to use it. Configure the home key so that triple click brings up a menu to enable/disable accessibility features including colour inversion and Voiceover. This will let you easily switch between the two modes.

Voiceover is a lot easier to learn when you are fully sighted as you still have visual feedback to help you interpret the audio feedback. You can then sit with your sister and guide her when she gets lost or just needs encouragement.

My top hint for using Voiceover is to be patient with it. After it tells you what you have touched it will sometimes give you options for what you can do next. It can be tempting to touch the screen again as soon as you know what you've touched but you need to get used to Voiceover been slower than the normal UI.

437,"Thank you very much for your reply. I will read through the links you have posted.

You are right about those questions and these are things that would be researched and tested through design process. 

What exactly the sensors will be able to detect it up to which sensor we use and that is something we are looking in to at the moment. This is obviously the first thing that we will do to see if this is even feasible. 

As the device is a spherical shape it is currently intended for it to have several sensors where one points forwards, one points upwards and one points downwards. These sensors are currently intended to be on the ball between your fingers while you are grasping it. How many we use will be up to research. In worst case scenario we can fit 12 of them on the ball (3 between each finger), but that's probably over the top.

As for how accurately we would be able to convey to the user is something we will be able to flesh out once we have a working ball full of motors so that we can test to see just how accurately a human can  detect the direction of vibrations on a ball. So the accuracy will be decided by the number of motors we plan on using and how well we can insulate them between each other.

First, I really like what you're doing here. I switched to the new Reddit a while ago and found it to be better than the old layout. Obviously that's what the developers hoped for with the redesign, but it's always great to see accessibility work provide the same outcome for a blind person. I like the toggle buttons that actually tell me I've upvoted something, the comment level labels, the headings for different parts of navigation, and so much more. Now that I understand how it works, I really enjoy being able to j and k through comments.

I have two suggestions regarding comments:

* Whenever I press j and k, my screen reader, NVDA, reads the upvote and downvote buttons before the comment. Other than that, everything announces perfectly. Can this be excluded without compromising navigation or usability in another way?
* I would love to have the option of navigating by comment level, e.g. pressing 1 for top level comments, to for comments underneath it. This is similar to the way heading levels work in most apps.

For example: electronic braille displays exist, wherein you can connect them to a phone/tablet/computer and have braille output to use as opposed to speech. Rather than haptic feedback, the displays use a series of pins that come out of the display area to form the characters you're reading.

576,"This sounds impractical and superfluous at best. A product like this would have numerous issues. Using three ultrasonic sensors means you would be relying on the sound bouncing off something.

Let's say you are crossing in a clockwise direction in a country that drives on the right side of the road. To your right is the intersection where there is nothing for sound to bounce off of. To the left there may or may not be cars or the sound to bounce off of for half of the crossing. Ahead of you there is typically nothing for the sound to bounce off of. Any ultrasonic equipment at a reasonable price range likely won't have anywhere near enough range to bounce off of anything. Further, this will be immediately thrown off by any pedestrians crossing along with you.

For the most part we simply rely on hearing. Orientation and mobility training can teach people how to navigate a crossing by sound alone as long as there are cars. Typically we may only deviate by a meter or so in either direction; it's not ideal but far from actually dangerous.

Honestly this product sounds like it would simply be a crime against fashion. We've got enough funky gadgets weighing us down.

Now if you were to really make this work it seems much more practical to use an accelerometer and gyroscope along with a hall effect sensor. Most smartphones have these and they can maintain a straight path far better than any ultrasound sensor could. This could be done on an app. No extra hardware required.

Same goes with steam groups. I shared a friends steam group here a couple of years ago, but since it got marked as inaccessible I don't think anyone got the chance to see it. Did that help us get more visibility in the gaming community? I don't think so.

I like that Discord is very good on my eyes. Skype have a good dark mode now, but me and my friends can never go back to that, since teamspeak and discord arrived. We're planning to go back to ts now, since we found a good dark mode plugin for it, and sometimes private Discord servers are pretty unstable.",,False,,Raf_AL,,,1539970840,t5_2qpec,t3_9pc8pt,t1_e81qarl,1,1541234725,0,0,e82nyyu,Blind,,,,,

607,"&gt; I'd like this to be the last of these sorts of devices that I end up having to buy, if that's possible. 

Probably not.

I personally own a braillenote apex notetaker which I use as a braille display connected to my iphone, ipad, or computer. I'm happy with it, but I got a great deal on it secondhand. I've previously owned a braillenote which got about a decade of total use. 

Depending on the device and company you go with, warranty support may be limited (one or two years) or cost significant extra money to extend. Devices may eventually need things like professional cleanings, replacing bad cells, and battery replacements that tend to be costly out of warranty, and compatibility with newer devices eventually can become an issue.

If you can, see if you can demo devices in person through a local blindness organization or vocational rehabilitation service. If you can get a chance to go to CSUN (or a major blindness conference) you can demo pretty much all the tech. If you're in the US, you might be able to get short term loaned devices at home through your state's assistive technology exchange. If you like a device, ask the device manufacturer questions about what the warranty does and does not cover where you live, if extentions are available, and what they personally charge for common repairs. 

If you're paying cash, look into the APH orbit reader 20. It has some limitations (only 20 cells, slightly slower refresh than other braille displays,) but at $449, the value is amazing. I was impressed with the demo of the device I saw, and provided it's available, it will be the next braille display I purchase.
