0,"Your post seems like it was aimed towards a specific person, although I'm not sure who. I also agree that the eSight device is quite useful for people who can use it, although it doesn't benefit everyone. 

I think some people have an issue with their advertising slogan, which is ""Making Blindness History"". I've had a number of clients complain that their advertising campaign makes it sound like it cures blindness and vision loss of all types, which it doesn't.

One thing I am curious about it, who told you that you don't need to use a cane when using the eSight device? When I was trained as a eSight pre-screener (this was ages ago, when the device was first coming out), we were told specifically to remind clients they still needed to use their canes. Because of the design of the device, it allowed someone to read upcoming signs and identify landmarks. But due to the reduced fields when using it, someone can't see drop offs. That is why the device can be lifted up, so the user can use their existing vision when traveling. I haven't had a chance to try the newer version of the device, but I can't imagine the fields have increased to such a significant degree. Their own FAQ says...

""With eSight’s patented Bioptic Tilt capability, users can be mobile while using the device. They can tilt the eyewear to the precise position that, for them, presents the best view of the video feed, while maximizing their natural peripheral vision (which is often still functional for people with low vision). This, along with imperceptible short latency, ensures that a user’s balance is not disturbed and, hence, no nausea occurs – common problems with immersive technologies such as virtual reality headsets.""

It would normally be the peripheral vision that would detect the drop off. But if they need to use a white cane because the peripheral vision isn't sufficient, then the device wouldn't be able to assist.

18,"I know that the NFB has a unique perspective of blindness and independence. They want people to be as independent as possible, no excuses. They are almost militant about it. NFB canes are longer than other canes, and they typically don’t fold. Why should you hide your blindness? Something inherent in this view is discrimination against people who are blind and who have additional disabilities. The NFB typically does not train individuals with cognitive disabilities. I can’t say if that’s intentional or not. 

One main difference in these organizations is that they are either “for the blind” or “of the blind.” An organization for the blind is one that works to do whatever for blind people. The NFB is OF the blind, meaning that most of their directors are blind, and all of their members are blind. No exceptions.

80,"Right, so a few random thoughts:

Closed captioning typically refers to the text at the bottom of the screen when characters talk in tv/movies, which is typically not helpful for people unable to read said text.  The term you are looking for is audio description or descriptive audio, which is a narrator who describes the visual details on screen.  For descriptive audio for porn, go check out porn hub, they have a category of examples.  Whether or not descriptive porn is good is up to the individual listener.

I know of blind people who like all the formats of porn, including video, literature, and audio.  Video-based and audio-based porn are pretty similar if the person watching has no vision at all.  If they have some vision, the gratification from video porn is pretty much the same as a sighted person.  For audio-based porn, there’s pretty much no difference between blind and sighted people, since they perceive it in the same ways.

Since then (26 y/o now), I've lost an additional 80% of my sight and am legally blind with a FOV of only 5 degrees, though I can still read and use the phone/computer provided there's good contrast and font size.

I think for me it was a bit easier because I've grown up knowing that my sight is slowly escaping me, but it doesn't mean that I wasn't scared or that I don't still mourn it sometimes. Now that I've entered the stage where I'm having trouble being independent and also losing the ability to read/watch movies etc. it hurts even more. 

As other commenters mentioned, you will grieve and experience loss, anger, depression and the lot, and please do allow yourself to feel those things without anu self-judgment. They're normal and human. Still, at the end of the day it's important to remember that you are *not* your eyes, your body is not you, and the loss of vision doesn't define you as a person.

161,"I’m married to legally blind individual. So far we don’t have children, but he does help me take care of my mother who is unable to do a lot of things. He can’t drive, but we live in an area where public transportation and uber allows him to get around pretty well, and he’ll take trips to go take care of my mother and has even gone over to her house to help her get ready and then taken her by taxi to an appointment. He can’t “pick up/drop off” things that are far away at the drop of a dime, but it isn’t much of an obstacle since I drive. I was also raised by a single mother, so anything he “can’t” do doesn’t seem so outlandish for me to figure out, because my mother relied on herself alone throughout my entire upbringing. Children will add an interesting twist, but he has a friend who is completely blind who married a blind woman and they had a child, and while we’re not close enough with them to understand their daily experiences, they are managing with the help of an aide/assistant/nanny. 

Otherwise things are normal, we’re each other’s support systems, friends, lovers, all that great stuff. The ups and downs are typical, but sometimes include personal frustrations with the physical limitation. I’m constantly amazed at what he’s able to do and how his thinking and processing reflects the world without the endless visual stimulation/distraction. He’s able to focus well and learns really well aurally. Those kind of things just amaze me because it shows a different angle on experiencing the world.

Anyway, if you have more specific questions, feel free to PM me as well. We’ve been together for 8 years and I remember once when we were at a hospital there was a nurse who took me aside and told me to break it off with him before getting too deep because life would be difficult. I can’t help but think that woman was way out of line. I didn’t have a father growing up so I know having my husband as my support system is helpful. I am not “taking care of him” in lieu of myself. I help him as much as he asks, but assistive technologies are great and help him get around.

My second theory is that a lot of MUDs seem to think that more is more. More classes, more races, more skills, and more rooms. Many of them boast of the thousands of rooms that they have, though not really saying that most of them are vanilla.

I don't use sites that I can't use. lol But I know Twitter has an alternate version of their interface for the blind in their IOS app that works really well. The only issue is when they add new features or changes there can be a slight delay before we get them. Normally I would just want them to modify the existing site but there are certain stylistic choices where you really can't have both so I would say the alternate version should be a last resort. I know Gmail used to have one that I used but they stopped and made their regular interface more accessible. And I agree that the headings and other navigational markers are important too, more for usability than accessibility. There's a difference between really being able to use something and being accessible enough to sort of use it, if that makes any sense. Also, I'm surprised this hasn't been brought up, if you use an image captcha without providing an alternative your completely blocking the blind. This is probably the most frustrating thing.

They're even there when i close my eyes, so i technically havent seen complete darkeness in 4 years. And since they're not real objects that exist in the real world, i can't focus in on them to get a more clear understanding of what they look like myself.

 I normally can't see faces unless i'm uncomfortably close (inches away), but i can often imagine the faces of people that i'm familiar with.

282,"Guessing from your post history (and the fact it was an endocrinologist), I would guess the doctor is having an eye specialist check for diabetic retinopathy (just a guess, it could be something unrelated).

It is best not to wear make up, especially if they have to put drops into your eyes. Some of it can run out, and some of those drops make you tear up as well.

Depending on the cause of vision loss, there may be some treatments for them. But before jumping right to the treatments, take the time to research some of the side effects. You can also always ask for a second opinion, if you aren't confident in that eye doctor. 

If you do have the start of some vision loss, definitely connect to your local rehabilitation agency. Getting training earlier is helpful, even if it turns out you don't need it.

333,"There are two sides to this issue.  ""Blind"" as a label for the disability that someone has is never derogatory; it's just a statement of fact.  I'm blind, and I'm going to need my lesson materials in an accessible format.  Similarly, ""blind"" to mean ""unable to see"" is not Derogatory, either. Someone can be blinded by the light, or the blinding reflection of the sun off the snow.  Again, that's just a statement of fact.  

However, ""blind"" to mean stupid or ignorant is absolutely derogatory.  But at the same time, we can't police every single word everyone uses. If a sentence like ""blind to the truth"" was in a textbook, I might complain about it.  A textbook should have gone through multiple rounds of editing; someone, at some point, should have noticed the unfortunate association.  In a lecture, though?  ""Blind to the truth"" could also mean that they were literally unable to see the truth, in some fashion.  We could certainly argue that the colonists were culturally unable to visually perceive the truth of what they were looking at.  A cultural or moral disability, as it were, rather than a physical one.  Or it could just be a turn of phrase that your professor used without thinking.  Either way, it's not a thing worth worrying about.  ",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1518617168,t5_2qpec,t3_7xdaqm,t3_7xdaqm,1,1519235490,0,0,du8eug6,Blind,,,blue1,,
334,"My wife started going blind about 3 or 4 years ago and could no longer work at her job. She pretty much went on disability which wasn't much but she kept a roof over her head and food on the table. She was offered training in use of her blind cane, braille, and received some specialty items like gloves to protect her hands when cutting food. We had started dating when she was going through this. 

She still gets disability, but I'm the main earner in our household. Disability doesn't go far. Her job opportunities are bleak. Others on here have talked about blind relatives who had professional jobs. My wife had worked supervising group homes and working with people with disabilities. The only job the people helping her train had to offer was working with her former disabled clients folding towels and such. She just can't do that. She would find it humiliating to work next to the people she used to supervise that have severe learning and mental disabilities.

A big problem I see in the blind community is what I call the blindness employment ghetto. Most blind people who have jobs work for organizations that help the blind, as I did with the city bus company. We're really only going to improve the standing of blind people if we get out there into areas that aren't used to having blind people and show the world we can do it, too.

338,"Well, I think the number of rooms can be not just intimidating, but also unnecessary. For example, in one MUD in which I've been dabbling, I'm currently trying to level up in a forest area of a couple dozen rooms that are all basically identical. With the battle/exploration system we're developing, the entire ""world map"" outside of a main city is likely only going to be a couple dozen rooms, with plenty to do within the rooms. I think this will make it easier to keep people (visually impaired or not) from getting lost, but give everyone plenty to do.

I think this was more of a problem when MUDs were relatively more popular. With 200-300 people on a server at any given time, and with how combat text would spam for everyone in the room, you'd need tons of rooms to keep things clean.

Things that helped me:

- monitor arms that I can move forward 
- setting up a TV as a second monitor 
- playing SOME games in black &amp; white 

There are some games I just can't play which are mainly FPS based. 
Simulation games I can get on with although at first I had to use the magnification tool on windows before I memorised the layout of the UI. 
Strategy games like CIV are good, but I wouldn't recommend CIV VI. 

It really depends on how far your sight has deteriorated. 

Also what do you want from gaming?

Is it the adrenaline you get it from playing in highly competitive games?
Have a look at some sports visually impaired people can do. 

Is it the immersion? 
Audio books. 

Is it the stimulation? Find challenging puzzles and problems to solve.

Tran Quoc Hoan was born blind. A customer service officer at Donkey Bakery, Hoan is one of the bakery’s first staff members, having started a year after it opened in 2009. His colleague, Nguyen Tuan Huy, who is deaf, brings my food to the table. Below is Hoan’s story.

“I love learning English and working in customer service and that’s why I chose this job, because many foreigners come here. I take their orders by phone, from the website and email. We use a software program with a screen reader.

I was born in Ha Tinh province, in the middle of Vietnam, near Hue. I’ve been blind since birth. I’m the youngest of five children, and my parents are farmers from the countryside.

For people who become blind later in life, usually they need a period of rehabilitation and learning, to acquaint them with the tools they can use: Braille, cane navigation, screen readers, etc. After that it depends a lot.

Some countries have fairly generous disability assistance, some don't. In some places blind people can access specific employment programmes. For example in Spain there is an organisation for the blind which sells lottery tickets and used to have a semi-monopoly, and it employed most blind people in the country.

441,"Did the doctors say if it was a lazy eye? For a lazy eye (amblyopia), patching is still one of the better treatments. The problem isn't the eye itself, but actually the brain. The patch is forces the brain to use the weaker eye, and improve the connection. The earlier the patching, the better the results. Unfortunately, it isn't always the easiest to pick up, since the kid can compensate with their other eye.

The only eye condition I can think of off the top of my head where there has been minimal research into correcting is myopic degeneration. With our current knowledge, there isn't much to prevent it (it is inherited), and most of the treatment is to fix the retina if it becomes detached. Monitoring the eye condition is the next best thing, and avoid impacts that can cause retinal detachment.

It's a lot of fun, and you meet a lot of interesting people, at least with the industry I'm in. I recommend it if you can find a good place to work.

&gt; If you don't mind, I would appreciate more details about your job.

My job has two parts, advertising, and sales. We run a skeleton crew, so everyone pulls double or tripple duty where I work. I get there early, 6:00 AM, 6:30 on my gym days. First, I check and respond to whatever emails may have com in for my directly. Then any leads that were generated that provide phone numbers get split between our sales team, and I take anything that's email only. I do posting on local websites, such as Craigslist, Kijiji, etc. Normally by now the phone is ringing so I'm trying to sell while posting, which I'll typically pause to talk.  If I can't help them, I take their information and email the lead to another salesman or another department.

Typically when people call they have an idea of what they want. Worst case, they know why they need it, and I'll ask questions to find the right style of item for them. From there, I find out how often they'll use it, how long they'll be using it, and what their budget is. Then I walk them through the options I have, including year, make, model, price, and general condition. Once they pick one, we'll walk through options to figure out exactly how it needs to be equipped to work for them.

If they pay cash, take their billing and shipping informaiton, make out an invoice, and email it over with wire instructions.

If they're financing, then find out what style they'll need, and send them the right applications. If they send the applications back, see that they get to the bank. And make sure the bank follows up on their application. Then send the invoice to them both, bank and person.

Once I'm funding, arrange shipping through our typical broker if they're in the mainland US, or through one of a few freight companies if going to Alaska, Hawaii, or out of North America. Canada is my typical broker too.

Sometimes these conversations are quick, and within 10 minutes you can have a guy asking for instruction on wiring you $150,000.

Sometimes they drag on and on, and after exchanging dozens of emails, phone calls, pictures, and finance documents, you'll get a wire from a rip off finance joint for $20,000.

Typical commission equates, roughly, to 1% gross sale before tax.
