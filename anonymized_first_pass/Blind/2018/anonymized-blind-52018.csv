45,I notice that you said that he believes that the amoled.  I am going to suggest something that I think others are pointing to as well.  Perhaps he does not need amoled.  It sounds like his vision is not great.  With an iPhone 7 he could likely read and respond to texts and emails much more quickly without looking at the screen at all.  That way he will get a break from straining to read or dealing with light at all.  Just because he has some vision does not mean he has to use it all the time.

55,"Hi there. with enough Googleing/researching questions and issues, plus reaching out to JAWS users, I think you may find the learning process easier then it might seem at first.

Remember that you don't have to try and learn all of the random features that JAWS has. Honestly, I think it has way too much going on in it's settings, at least for my specific needs; even though I have been using it off and on for over a year now I am sure I do not know what half of the settings and random features are for. Voice Over on the mac is much more basic, compared to windows screen readers, but I don't think most users have a mastery of all of it's settings and features either, which is not a bad thing. Most users have no reason to use the Voice Over commander to remap hot keys so they never have to move their hands from the home row and are therefore more efficient. yes, this is something I actually did when I was a mac user.

So just remember, poring over JAWS documentation and audio help files is a good idea, but you don't need to know a lot of the available features to become a decent JAWS user. Honestly, I think the OS of windows itself offers a steeper learning curb then jaws, when it comes to switching from the mac. Even though I love windows now, there are a lot of things about it's file system, settings, apps etc. that are odd and inconsistent, and mastering these idiosyncrasies takes time and patience. Once you get the basics of the OS down, Windows Explorer, the desk top, ribbons, the start menu etc. the JAWS part should be much easier, I would think. The experience of using most screen readers in web browsers is pretty similar, with some variations in feature sets of course. Apps can be pretty unique and take some poking around to get comfortable with, just get ready to do a lot more tabbing and shift tabbing instead of using the arrow keys as much. The different cursors you have access to with JAWS can be hard to get your head around, but you won't need to mess around with them too much in most situations; I think this is a very good topic to read documentation about. Read this page if you have not already, it's the first thing that came up when I googled JAWS and cursors just now.

I really think the main thing you need is just a lot of hands on time and experience. I was a hard core Mac OS user for the first 7 years of my life as a blind person. Despite receiving JAWS training at multiple training centers I never spent much time with it or windows, and I never became comfortable with them. I believe this was because I never used windows in my day to day life, I would only boot into windows during training classes, or when I needed to do one specific task, which is not a great way to become a competent user of anything. However, at one point I was in between jobs, changing careers and I knew I would need to learn Windows for my next job. I finally decided to stick with windows and learn it properly. I decided to only use Windows for a month, booting into Mac OS only when I had no other choice. After a few weeks of using Windows every day I never looked back and I am now exclusively a Windows user.

70,"Can't say I've been shoved into a cab, but I can definitely attest to the gross invasion of personal space. Probably the two worst examples I can think of were when I was at rehab. I was under blindfold walking down the street. There was no tactile distinction between the parking lot on my left and the sidewalk. I bumped into a parked car, realized I had veered into the parking lot, and started making my way back to the sidewalk when a woman slides her arm through my elbow\-\-square dance style\-\-to ""help"" me back to the sidewalk. Keep in mind I had already realized where I was and was making a course correction. The other time, I was at a post office, innocently asked where the end of the line was, and a girl grabbed my hips and steered me there like we were in a conga line. Neither of these people asked to touch me in any way, and I had no idea the first lady was even there before she decided to play personal space invaders with me.

An honorable mention has to go to the morning I was on the bus to work when an absolutely plastered lady got on and started talking to my dog. She attempted to pet her, but in her drunken state, missed the mark and started petting my leg in stead. I quickly relocated to the other side of the aisle, but for the rest of the trip she kept groping the air a foot or two in front of where my dog was lying in a futile attempt to pet her.

Speaking of busses... these crazy memories are just flooding back to me right now... another bus related incident at rehab this time, I had forgotten to slip my ID lanyard under my shirt when I left the building, and while on the bus a woman grabs my ID and starts looking at it... while it was still around my neck.

Something like thick paper (cardstock, manilla envelope material) or even like a thin plastic would probably be pretty easy.

This probably consists of creating documents, making PowerPoints, using spreadsheets, sending emails, and etc. I would first learn the basics of Microsoft Word and your web browser of choice. Using other computer programs will build on your knowledge of these programs. JAWs also has several key commands that are also windows commands as well. I have found it helpful to start by making flashcards to learn how to use many of the different functions of JAWS. Additionally, you might find tutorials by independent organizations to be easier to manage. Many of these can even be found on YouTube. Last but not least, JAWS has a command search function that allows users to quickly look up key commands. You would first press insert and space together. When you hear a chime, just press the J key once. You will then enter a window where you can type in key words such as ‘spell check’, and you will then arrow down to read the directions that explain what keys to press to bring up the list of misspelled words.

Things like this post, and one of the replies to this post, make me want to say that you should be asking questions about mental health issues, not blindness; I am saying this as someone who has struggled with my own mental health issues from time to time. There are lots of blind people who live happy healthy lives, and there are lots of sighted people who live miserable tragic lives. A disability can be a contributing factor for something like depression, but it is only one part of the larger picture. I have known dozens of blind people in many different life situations and 9 times out of 10 long term negative feelings are a result of things such as lack of skills, lack of education, lack of friendship or companionship, lack of ability to get over their disability and move on with life, etc. One is not doomed to such things just because their eye balls don't work.

The last thing I'm trying to say is that you don't have a right to be depressed; you have just as much the right to be depressed as you have the right to be blind, or def, or left handed, or any of the billions of conditions that life can bring. What's important is how you respond to such conditions. A person with clinical depression can't just choose to be free from their condition; however, they can regularly receive therapy, take medicine, and do whatever else they need to do to do the best they can to deal with their condition. Likewise, a blind person can't choose to be sighted, but they can choose to try and receive training, learn skills, receive education, and make the most of life.

I am a public servant. I coordinate Parliament and Cabinet business for a state government department (Australia).

In the past I've done quite a bit of briefing writing for Parliament too, but that's not a core duty for me at the moment. 

I got here via a Bachelor of International Studies, with Honours in International Relations (when I was at uni the BIS was really the new BA [Bachelor of Arts]). My focus was on Asia and I consider myself a political economist. I've had zero exposure to my field of expertise in the workplace. The general skills of organisation, research, analysis, and communication (written and verbal) are what I've used. I always wanted to get into foreign affairs or intelligence analysis, instead I got into intergovernment relations (relations between state and federal government), and made my way to Parliament and Cabinet via Ministerial correspondence. So I picked up first hand skills and experience in managing all the core governance functions, rather than specialising in delivery or management of a specific project. 

I highly recommend the public service as an employer for people with disability - certainly in Australia, and I assume overseas would be similar. Low and middle tier wages are at worst equal and usually better than the private sector and the working conditions are significantly better (more leave, flexible working arrangements, and a supportive environment for people with disability or for any other diverse group). I know two other blind public servants, both working at the Federal level in preparing data sets and I suspected they'd say the same.

Keep in mind we're all vision impaired with similar-ish levels of vision (a mix of lack of field and lack of central), but all have RP (i.e. our sight continues to deteriorate). Could you do my job without sight? Most of it, yes. Use of the ERMSs I've used in government would likely be problematic for someone who was total, but I'm sure a solution would be found.

My focus was on <LOCATION> and I consider myself a political economist. I've had zero exposure to my field of expertise in the workplace. The general skills of organisation, research, analysis, and communication (written and verbal) are what I've used. I always wanted to get into foreign affairs or intelligence analysis, instead I got into intergovernment relations (relations between state and federal government), and made my way to Parliament and Cabinet via Ministerial correspondence. So I picked up first hand skills and experience in managing all the core governance functions, rather than specialising in delivery or management of a specific project. 

I highly recommend the public service as an employer for people with disability - certainly in <LOCATION>, and I assume overseas would be similar. Low and middle tier wages are at worst equal and usually better than the private sector and the working conditions are significantly better (more leave, flexible working arrangements, and a supportive environment for people with disability or for any other diverse group). I know two other blind public servants, both working at the Federal level in preparing data sets and I suspected they'd say the same.

Keep in mind we're all vision impaired with similar-ish levels of vision (a mix of lack of field and lack of central), but all have RP (i.e. our sight continues to deteriorate). Could you do my job without sight? Most of it, yes. Use of the ERMSs I've used in government would likely be problematic for someone who was total, but I'm sure a solution would be found.

I hope that gives you some idea of what university might give you and what sort of skills you want to build to leverage yourself in the workforce.

157,"Hello there. A few quick thoughts.

losing your current source of income due to a possible disability is a totally understandable fear. You could loose your sight, and this might result in you not being able to create art in the same way; anyone who says otherwise is only hurting you. It's better to face and prepare for things, , instead of hoping they will never happen.

However, if you do lose your vision, it will probably be a very slow and long process, so you will have time to learn to adapt and adjust. I'm sure you love art, and I hope you wil always be able to enjoy it, no matter what your eye balls do, but there are countless alternative careers out there that you could thrive in as a blind person. I have known many people who lost the ability to do one career, due to vision loss, only to go back to school and end up in another career that they were much happier in. If your vision is still really good right now, I don't think you have to worry about these things, just keep tracking it and be willing to do what you need to do if you lose enough vision.

A few last thoughts about my own experiences that I hope might help. I was born with Glaucoma. I slowly lost my vision, starting at age 2. I had to use stronger and stronger glasses, magnification, and other tools, until I lost all of my vision at age 18. When I lost all of my vision I did not really have the skills a blind person needs, so I went to a training center to learn everything I needed to thrive as a blind person, braille, assistive technology, cane skills, orientation and mobility, independent living skills etc. I then went on to college, and now I have a great job, a happy marriage, and a cute cat. I am very content as a blind person, for the most part. I believe a lot of the good things in my life would have never happend if I had not lost my sight. My biggest regret is that I did not learn blindness skills at a younger age, when it was clear that I would way day need them. I believe this was, in part, due to me, my parents, and my doctor refusing to be honest about the situation. I want to help keep other people from making this mistake of refusing to face reality until they have no choice. I have known dozens of people who have had to adapt to blindness and in my experience almost everyone makes the change and goes on to live a full life.

PS, I also know how much it sucks to lose an art you care deeply about. I use to work in audio editing and podcasting. It was my passion, but a year and a half ago I lost some hearing which made me have to go into a new type of work. The emotional side of this was really hard for me, and I still get a little sad about it from time to time. Life goes on.

Good luck,",False,False,,EndlessReverberation,,,1526489766,t5_2qpec,t3_8jstzm,t3_8jstzm,7,1527537007,0,0,dz2yym5,Blind,,,,,
158,"A few thoughts.

I agree that it is interesting that we as blind people use software that was originally created for sighted people. I think an OS created for blind people is an interesting thought experiment. However, for it to be more than a thought experiment, you would have to come up with real benefits that such an OS with have over what currently exist, and I have not really heard compelling benefits yet. Someone could make an OS that uses smell as it’s only interface, or an OS for Americans, or an OS for left-handed people, but what would be the benefits of these hypothetical operating systems? For me, this question has to be the start of any serious conversation about an OS made for blind people, and it’s hard for me to imagine that the benefits would outweigh the cons that many people have already pointed out.

I hear people talk about how blind people need some fundamental change in how we use technology, and it seems to me that such people often have just not made the effort to become truly versed in the current tools that we have. I myself thought screen readers were inefficient and difficult to use when I first lost my sight. However, I made the effort to master screen readers, and I am a much more advanced computer user then I ever was as a sighted person.

If you feel as though there is a major inefficiency in your current experience with technology as a blind person, this would be my advice:
learn more about the assistive tools you are using to see if there is a method or concept that you have overlooked.
Learn more about the apps you are using to see if there is a better work flow you can use.
Research alternative assistive tools and apps to see if there is a better option out there for your needs; it never hurts to have extra tools in the tool box.
Research other operating systems in order to make sure they don’t have better features, tools, or apps for you.
Look into creating a tool app or assistive technology if you need one that does not currently exist.
If you have exhausted all of these options and nothing satisfies your need, then, perhaps, you could start to consider how a new OS would solve your problem, but even then, I think it would cause more problems than it would solve.

I do think it’s still an interesting thought experiment to imagine the hypothetical benefits an OS for blind people would have. I can’t come up with any at the moment, but I’m going to ponder the question, even if it’s just for fun.

160,"	1. Is it easy to find books for braille?

If you mean to learn Braille, it's not particularly hard. For getting books, you can purchase them, via blindness related stores like blindmicemart.com iirc or from programs like the library service for the blind and physically handicapped, who send you free books in the mail. There's also the option of Braille displays, but they're currently ridiculously expensive outside of a select few that are the cost of a mid-range laptop.

	2. How does reading speed for braille compare to sighted reading?

They are similar in people who learned as a child, but most people will read around 120 WPM visually, with skill in Braille reading easily taking a long word like knowledge and boiling it down to a single letter, letting you read faster.

	3. Despite my tension about the ordeal, I realize I'd find a way to cope. I like to think I could listen to audiobooks still, a thing I like to do. How do people go about that?

I mostly get mine via the national library service, free books and some are pretty new, as well as via paid methods like kindle and audible.

	4. I prefer phones and tablets to computers. Is it easy to be computer-free?

That's sort of a matter of preference. I use my laptop for DnD, as well as sorting files, writing, and a lot of other little things. There are also some things, like banking, that require you use their website instead of the app and they navigate like shit on mobile.

169,"Hi there,

Finding a good job is one of the most difficult aspects of being blind. There is a lot of discrimination out there in the job market. These days businesses get loads of resumes from lots of super qualified people, and employers have to find ways of sorting through the candidates to narrow the field. The ways employers do this can be arbitrary and unfair at the best of times, and people with disabilities have huge targets on our backs. You might have a chance if your resume sticks out above the rest in a good way, if you get someone who is open minded, willing to give you a chance, or if your applying for a niche job with fewer applicants.

A few random thoughts...

There is a huge growing problem in postindustrial countries where there are not enough good paying jobs for less educated people; just look at the political conversations taking place in America, Cole workers, people worried about other people taking their jobs, etc. Blind people without higher education have always had the deck stacked against them, but this is even more the case in our current climate. I don't know how much education you have, but this could be part of your problem. I believe that vocational rehabilitation in the United States will sometimes help you go to college, so if you don't at least have a four\-year degree you might want to look into that.

Even with education getting a good job is no sure thing. I have a blind friend who is super amazing; she is the biggest go getter I have ever seen, applying for hundreds of jobs, reaching out to companies that are not even hiring, just to make connections for when they do have job openings. She takes notes on interviews she gives and works on what she could have done better. She lives in NYC and has a vast network of people. She went back to school and got her masters, but she is still not having any luck, while she is watching everyone from her class get jobs. On the other hand, I got pretty lucky. I was not so amazing at applying for loads of jobs etc. and I only have a bachelor's degree; I really just got lucky with finding my current job. The only reason I'm bringing up my experience and my friend's experience is to point out how much luck and other unfair aspects go into finding a job. She deserves a job much more than I do.

One last thing, a lot of blind people end up working in the blindness field. This is one other difference between my situation and my friend's situation. for her, it is very important to get a job that has nothing to do with blindness. On the other hand, I test accessibility for a university, and my dream job would be to teach assistive technology. My wife, who has a master’s degree and a law degree, spent several years looking for mainstream jobs, only to end up taking a job working as the children's assistive technology expert for our state. There is nothing at all wrong with blind people working in the blindness field, however, it is a shame that some people have to turn to it for work because they could not do what they wanted.

So, look into further education/training/experience if you can, make connections, and consider the blindness field.

Above all, hang in there and remember that what you’re going through is a shared experience had by millions of people, it has nothing to do with your value has a person.",False,False,,EndlessReverberation,,,1527264821,t5_2qpec,t3_8lwemi,t3_8lwemi,3,1527950060,0,0,dzkcq19,Blind,,,,"Hi there,

An ipad might be a better way to read, as she will have access to more font options, brightness and color controls, as well as specialized apps (like voice dream reader) designed for large print and audio use. 

There's more ways to acces reading with audiobooks than ever. If she has (or can get) a smartphone or tablet, mainstream apps like Audible are great, but there's also several free or cheap services designed for people who can't read regular print due to a disability, like https://www.bookshare.org/ and https://nlsbard.loc.gov/login//NLS (in the US.)

An Echo (or similar device) can also be used to access kindle books and audible books, as well as numerous other sources. 

Local libraries often have selections of physical audiobooks, but if her doctor certifies that she has a disability which limits her ability to read print, she can also qualify to get them by mail order for free in the US. https://www.loc.gov/nls/ Many other countries have similar systems. 

There's also [NFB newsline]
(https://nfb.org/nfbnewsline) a free service (with proof of disability.) You can call in by phone to use it, or download the app for android/ios (and several other ways.) They have hundreds of magazines and newspapers, as well as things like TV listings.

210,"People who are born blind and learn braille at an early age can read braille at around 400 words a minute; that's how fast my wife reads braille, and lots of other people I know who have always used braille break the three hundred word a minute mark. However, like most language skills, if you don't learn at an early age you will have a much harder time mastering braille. I did not learn braille until I was 18 and I do not read fast enough for braille to have any real use for me. You should feel free to learn braille if you want, but keep this in mind. Braille is an irreplaceable tool for children who are learning grammar and language skills. Without braille there is no way for a blind person to be ""literate"". But most blind adults use screen reader software much more then braille in their day-to-day lives, because screen readers can go much faster then braille or even print for sighted people.

I have known lots of people who lose their sight at an older age, and from my experience people almost always go on to live happy well adjusted lives. There are training centers out there, such as the Louisiana Center for the Blind, who teach blindness skills to adults of all ages. One more thing, you mentioned that you use phones and tablets.

It's probably one of the most user friendly screen readers out there for new people, even though it is not as powerful as what you would have on a desktop.

313,"If I can get on my soapbox for a minute. There's this assumption that blind people can't be independent. They absolutely can. There are rehab centers that will have you doing everything from cooking to working with power tools, all under blindfold in case you have any vision. There's also a tendency for blind people to work in fields that deal with the blind, like vocational rehab, special ed, and O&amp;M. While I think it's necessary for us to help our fellow blind people in this manner, I would encourage people to widen their idea of what jobs a blind person can do. I work in information technology. I just spent the last week on my hands and knees inventorying all our equipment. It was difficult, especially because I can't see well enough to scan all those bar codes. That's where using alternative strategies come in. I separated all the boxen based on their model number. I used a magnifier, but a totally blind person could use Seeing AI to read the labels. I then downloaded the fastest free bar code scanner app I could find onto my iPhone, waved it in the general direction of a  stack of equipment, and then air-dropped the resulting CSV file to my macbook. Since this approach inevitably led to duplicates and extraneous entries, I used a bit of UNIX terminal magic to remove undesirable data. I then added the resulting entries to a master inventory file.


Why am I saying all this? Because most people--blind or sighted--probably think this sort of thing is impossible without vision. I did it anyway. I realize getting employed is hard, and luck definitely plays a role, but that's true of any job. The blind independence movement is a two-way street. While it's important to get potential employers to realize that blind people can be an asset instead of a liability, it's equally important for blind people to realize they have what it takes to be independent in the first place. Is it hard sometimes? Absolutely! Do I sometimes feel that it's a lost cause? Definitely! But I keep going. You can frame it however you want--as the oppressed blind people overthrowing their evil ableist oppressors, or removing blind people as wards of the state and turning them into productive contributors to the economy, but however you slice it, your going to be happier and healthier if you work towards independence.",False,False,,redstone1337,,,1526174625,t5_2qpec,t3_8iap7p,t3_8iap7p,2,1527400284,0,0,dyw084x,Blind,,,,,

315,"People can have other supports than their parents. Siblings, wives/husbands, good friends. 

Adaptability can be more difficult, but it really depends on how motivated someone can be to learn. I've had people who were highly motivated and practiced their skills a lot and progressed much faster than average. There are some intensive rehabilitation programs specifically aimed at getting working age people back into the workforce.

If someone had a career where vision was absolutely necessary, then they would need to make a decision regarding a career change. Do they want to learn a new topic, or learn how to adapt their knowledge to something in a related field? For example, I once worked with a taxi driver who lost their vision. But they still wanted to work for the same company, so they ended up being retrained as a dispatcher. Adaptive technology let him access the computer, and he had good knowledge of the city.

Orientation and Mobility training helps with learning how to get around safely, but there are times when it is exceptionally difficult. In those cases, there are delivery services for food. 

Losing both vision and hearing can be a great concern for some people, but there are also services that assist them. Depending on where you are, deafblind services have intervenors who can help translate and assist with other tasks. They can also provide training regarding communication as well.

Is there a federal law or something that they have to at least pretend they’ll entertain hiring disabled folk?

I am legally blind from birth, I was told as a child, my vision wouldn't get any worse or any better however as the years went on it did get worse much worse 
I was said to only have 
Anaridea, myopia and nystagmus but recently I've been told I also have cataracts and glaucoma as Well and I'll be blind completely within the next 10 years, when I went recently again they said that 10 years could be much sooner than expected 
, I am having trouble telling what colour is what,  and peripheral vision is lost, if you were to put a toilet paper tube to your eye and look through it, that has just more of a vision field that I do,
Everything constantly looks like I'm constantly in a dazy dream in one of those old fashioned movies or like when a camera goes out of focus
I have complete night blindness also and no depth perception.

All of these things and I'm trying to find a job without any help from NDIS 
It's almost impossible 
I feel so useless and helpless and I'm not the sort of person to be like that, I'm usually really independent and happy go lucky 
But when my partner and I had to cut our date night short because the movie we wanted to watch last night didn't have audio description working headphones and they lead me sighted guide to the car to go home it hit me hard
... even leading up to before the movie
We went to the arcade, I couldn't see to play the games, I had a go and tried but it was pretty pointless if I'm honest, or at dinner they had to read the menu to me, because I couldn't see it myself

These things hit me hard all at once last night on our way home 
'In never going to be able to be normal, I'm not normal, I'm built for a world that I don't fit in'
It's funny enough that my partner is a disability support worker (that's not how we met) so I'm lucky enough that they understand and support me above and beyond, maybe even more than what I deserve.
And although we had a good time last night I guess I felt bratty for ruining the movie for my s/o , I said we could stay if they wanted but they said they didn't want to watch it if I wouldn't be able to indulge as Well so we went home and cuddled in bed to netflix .

384,"It sounds like a tricky situation, and I'm afraid I can't give a great answer, since I was not there. You and the bank telor saw the person in question, I did not.  Reading between the lines of your question, it sounds like this blind person may have also been elderly, or had other things he was dealing with, which further complicates things. I will do my best to sum up what I think may have been done poorly, by multiple people; please remember I do not have a lot of info here, and this is just my opinion.

First of all, I find the customer service assistant's behavior confusing on several points. I'm not quite sure why they thought the blind person needed a chair if he was just trying to line up with everyone else; I'm constantly reminding sighted people that being blind does not effect your legs, we can stand in lines, on subways, etc. just like everyone else. Of course, perhaps there is something I am missing, such as the blind person being elderly etc.

Secondly, why did the customer service assistant have the blind man cut in line, which is my understanding of what happened. This seems especially odd after directing the man to sit down. I don't understand why the customer service assistant would think the blind man would need to sit down at all if he was going to have him jump to the front of the line; from the info I have, it sounds like the customer service assistant changed his mind after first thinking the blind man should sit while waiting for his turn. Again I'll point out that blind people should wait in line just like everyone else.

Finally, if the customer service assistant was making such a big deal about ""helping"" the blind person, I agree with you that they could have done a better job with directing the blind person to the front of the line. I think it is fine, and often preferable, to not swoop in on a blind person and assume they need lots of help. However, if your going to do that, as the customer service assistant did, it seems like your giving yourself the responsibility to aid the blind person in question and you should probably carry that job through, unless the blind person says otherwise. The blind man in question may have assumed that the customer service assistant was going to do this. He may have also been confused, due to the odd behavior of the customer service assistant.

Now it's time to go through what I think the blind person did wrong. I feel as though the blind person may have helped setup the entire confusing situation that you described; of course, I don't know what was going through his mind, or what he may have been saying or trying to due, and I'm not about to say that my way of doing things is the perfect correct method. If I walked into a bank I would assume that there would likely be a line I needed to find, in order to be served. I would walk towards any sounds that seemed like they could be employees serving customers and ask the first person I came to if there was a line for the window. I'm thinking this would have been about the point where the customer service assistant would have offered me a chair. I would have explained that I was just looking for the back of the line and that I did not need to sit down; it's impossible to say what would have followed at this point, perhaps the customer service assistant would have listened to me and showed me where the back of the line was, perhaps they would have wanted me to cut to the front of the line etc. The point is, I would have made it very clear what I needed, \(finding the back of the line\) so that the customer service assistant had no reason or excuse for being confused about how to help me. You did not mention if the blind person said anything during this entire situation, so I will just have to assume that they did not. If the blind person did not explain what they needed to the customer service assistant it's pretty understandable that they would be confused about how to help them. If they were confused it makes since that they might change their mind, chair vs. cut in line, and that they would think they were done helping when, in fact, the blind person still needed to find the front of the line. It may not have had an effect on what the customer service assistant did, but I think the blind person bares a big part of the blame for the whole situation; saying something like, ""can you show me where the back of the line is please?"" could have really clear things up.

Once the blind person has not explained what they need, and the customer service assistant has started doing a poor job of swooping in to the rescue, it made the entire thing a guessing game for everyone involved, including you. I do not think what you did was obviously wrong, in fact, it was probably appropriate for the situation. If the blind person was looking for the front of the line, I think the best thing you could have done was say something so he could hear what he was looking for. If audio clues/aid was not helping him find the front of the line, perhaps, even touching him was ok; maybe he had hearing issues. Of course, if the blind man in question said anything about what he needed/wanted then that would dictate what was appropriate. Once again, if he did not say anything he was leaving it up to others to make guesses and I don't think he could blame people if they guessed wrong.

One thing I will say about the blind man walking towards the piller. It is possible that he may have hit it, he does not sound like the most capable blind person. However, sighted people do often mistakenly believe that we are going to run into things because of the way long white canes work. If the man in question was using his cane correctly, it should have hit the pillar before him, there by informing him of its presence. In other words, the man may have been in no real danger of hitting anything, but it looked like he was. if he was a capable blind person, using his cane correctly, with nothing else going on with him, I think you should not have touched him to help with the pillar. Of course, this once again goes back to us having to guessed; ideally, I would say use words, not touching, to help the man, but I understand that it may have looked like he was about to hurt himself and that touching him would be the quickest way to help.

No two situations are exactly the same. Both blind and sighted people have to make assumptions some of the time. I am always trying to determine if a sighted person will be able/willing to offer me helpful and appropriate aid. I often am very selective about who I ask for help, and what kind of help I ask for. I understand that sighted people are also trying to make sumptions. I believe it is my job to be clear about what help I want, and to try and seem capable and independent so sighted people understand how to treat me. I believe it is sighted people's job to treat blind people with respect, and to ask instead of assuming, when possible.",False,False,,EndlessReverberation,,,1526943412,t5_2qpec,t3_8junn0,t1_dz6oqpd,1,1527792599,0,0,dzcvl5z,Blind,,,,,

429,"You have an interesting idea, but I think you should consider the human-computer interface and psychological aspects a bit more.  One of the key underlying concepts of our current user interface elements is the idea of action possibilities (also known as affordances in the field of user experience design).  Action possibilities are the idea that we draw on the user’s experiences and perceptions of an object to allow the user to intuit the possible things that they can do with a particular metaphor.  For example, when given a folder on the computer, most users will immediately assume that they can open it, close it, put things inside of it, remove things from it, and trash it.  These action potentials arise from the user’s past experiences of physical folders, and are transferred to a digital metaphor with pretty much no cognitive load.

When creating interfaces with layered focus such as your example, the user is unable to develop a model of action possibilities without a nontrivial cognitive load because they are unable to draw on natural behaviors to develop the metaphor.  This is because of the fact that layered interfaces do not commonly occur in the real world in isolation; there’s almost always a physical or temporal difference when there are two items.  For example, if you are physically performing two tasks, there’s a spatial difference between them, even if it is small.  Think of a piano player using both their left and right hands simultaneously; they are never in exactly the same place at the same time, so the brain can coordinate, even if it is muscle memory.  When the brain loses the spatial information, it can get confused when trying to determine where a particular stimuli originates from.  Even when you’re observing something spatially co-located, to differentiate the two phenomena without significant concentration, they must be separated in something like frequency.  For example, many optical illusions arise from the brain failing to interpret color because it has either been intentionally left out or is given in an ambiguous context.  The same thing can happen with audio; one of the most important aspects of audio mastering a song is to give each instrument certain areas of frequencies to play in, or differentiate them in some other way if their frequencies overlap significantly (panning is a good way to accomplish this).  Without that differentiation, the brain just perceives noise, and cannot easily identify details.

438,"I'd say the ""everything's a beep"" model would work well. There's a huge amount of information that can be sent using a series of standardized beeps and similar tones. With pitch and tone changes to underlying beep formats to denote difference within a category. Literally you could have a folder beep and then change the beep depending on what you're doing with teh folder or what type of folder it is. Likewise you could have a file beep, maybe the folder beep is a different version of the file beep with the same changes applied to it. Or it could be 2 really fast beeps to denote the folder/file relationship. This mimics the same way you can have different types of icons for different types of folders and files but they all mostly look the same at their base. Likewise for operations, you don't need to speak out every little operation, beeps and other types of sounds can give all the information needed. Words should only be used when words already exist and are mutable, like filenames. But operations that involve words like, new folder, don't need to be spoken. It's always going to be called ""new folder"", the words are thus immutable, so you can replace it with a sound. Likewise with certain folder names for showing full paths. System or root folders will likely never change their name, so can be denoted with a beep. You could potentially represent certain full paths many folders deep with just a single beep with tone and pitch transformations. Obviously there should be an option to speak it out anyways for beginners or people who've never used that thing before. The speak out function should be a single or at most double hotkey on the keyboard so it's always easy to access at a moments notice. Literally like every time you press Alt it should speak out whatever thing you're currently on or doing. Then when you know the sound you can use just the tone. Also the ability to assign your own custom quick tones for things you do often even if the text is mutable. You can cram in a wide variety of beeps and swishes and whatnot all with their own tone and pitch transformations into a tiny amount of time and convey ridiculously huge amounts of information since each beep could itself be symbolic for some complex multilayered piece of data.

444,"Depending on income, I'd also recommend getting a smart grill and marking it.

I have the Teefal Optigrill and it literally just requires a few button presses, wait for it to chime, open, put meat on with tongs, close, wait for it to chime again, it beeps as it cooks, and then pull the meat off, turn off grill, and you're done.

I've made pork chops, steak, chicken, hot dogs, burgers, paninis, etc. on it.

I'd also teach him to make stuff in the microwave. I steam veggies and make baked potatoes fairly often, and there's a lot of stuff, like pastaroni or pierogies, that are fine when microwaved, but less healthy.

An easy meal would be grilled chicken and some microwaved pasta of some variety, or some of the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice or something.

I also agree with the crockpot suggestions. I make clam chowder and chili probably every other month, and that's usually enough for 6-10 bowls. There's also easy stuff like a couple pounds of chicken, a jar of salsa, mild preferably, and a can of blackbeans. Have him take the chicken out and shred it, mix it back in, and then put it in tortillas or over basic white rice, even microwaved minute rice, and boom, easy, tasty meal.

I'd also consider marking his oven, because there's a lot that can be done in the oven just by following basic directions. There's also a bit more leeway IMO.

As far as stove cooking, there are classes he could attend, depending on where you are, that can help with that. I attended the Carroll Center in Newton, MA, and I can't recommend it enough.

I don't know if there is a perfect fix to the problem your asking about. Perhaps you can at least learn the word for assistance. maybe saying that word would be at least enough to ask the blind person in question if they want help. As a blind person, for me the most inexcusable thing that sighted people do is touch me without asking. The difficult thing is, there is no way to ever know what a blind person needs or what help they may desire unless you ask them first. Some blind people may want a lot of help, some blind people may want no help, and most blind people are some where in the middle, depending on the situation. So when possible ask, don't assume.

The great part is you can easily add more stuff like cheese, green onions, tomatoes. It was a big part of what got me to actually cooking meals that weren't from boxes.

There's some good books on ""gourmet microwave cooking"" which will provide a wide variety of things that are surprisingly good in a microwave.

514,"Hello there, I was also going to recommend looking into a residential training center, but TheBlindBookLover took the words right out of my mouth. If your dad would consider such a training center, he would almost         definitely want to attend before getting a guide dog, not after. Pretty much all training centers teach cane travel skills, and if your dad did go on to get a dog he would learn how to use it from the school that gave him the dog. Either way, your dad will not be allowed to get a guide dog until he first learns how to get around with a cane.

I lost my sight when I was 18 and I attended a 9\-month training program in Louisiana called the Louisiana Center for the blind. The students in such a center run the entire gamut, as far as age and blindness skills. There were 18\-year old kids, such as myself, who needed blindness skills to attend college, 30 something year old professional types who had always been blind but needed to brush up on some skills, and many older people who have never had training before; I believe there were several people in their seventies while I was there. The training is super intense and comprehensive, but worth it and life changing.

As far as finances and some of the other concerns you mentioned; the state payed for me to attend through vocational rehabilitation. However, I was lucky because I believe they prioritize young people, such as myself, who are primed for higher education and then the job market. I also had a great councilor who really believed in me and went the extra mile. I have no idea if your dad would have such look, it’s really going to vary by state, agency, and individual.

You mentioned someone accompany your dad, every training center is different, but this would not be allowed at LCB. Someone could bring him to the center and stay for a few days to help him get settled in, but the training center would not want someone staying in town to help him; of course, people could visit, my parents visited once or twice. The whole point of this kind of center is to instill independence and self\-confidence; there are even weekly seminars where students and teachers talk about the mental, societal, philosophical, and emotional side of blindness.

I just want to say that I’m really sorry that your mother is dealing with her husband’s blindness the way she is. In my experience, spouses often want to be supportive, but I can understand why your mom is feeling the way she is. Your mom probably thinks of your dad as the independent guy that she married, and I guess she resents who he has become for the moment. Blindness can be frustrating at times, especially when the blind person has not learned to be independent. There are two aspects of blindness that newly blind people must deal with. There is the mental and emotional aspect that requires one to realize blindness is not the end of the world and that blind people can go on to live happy, fulfilling, independent lives. However, all of that is just words without the other aspect which is the knowledge, experience, and opportunity to prove yourself and learn to be an independent blind person.

In other words, I know your family is very much stuck in a waiting game for the moment, and I would hope that your mom can learn to become more understanding, but there is a process that your dad can also go through to make things better. There is hope.

538,"Braille has genuine advantages over TTS. You can read privately while still being aware of things going on around you. It also makes programming and IT much better. Catching syntax errors is much easier. I always enjoy picking up on the nuances of punctuation when reading braille.

It's difficult at first, but worth it. The Orbit Reader 20 should finally be out this summer, so you can have a decent braille display for under $500. 

If you're like me there's some embarrassment that comes with slowly struggling through the simplest texts, but you won't improve without reading. Getting kids books you enjoyed when you were young and reading through them again is a good way to pick up speed.

There's a Linux daemon called brltty that can drive a ton of different displays, and it seems surprisingly robust given the time I've been able to use it.

My opinion has always been that people should learn to fend off with what they have and expect nothing from others, because my disability is no one else's fault, however I have to admit that living blind is much harder than living with 10% of sight and it may not be possible to live without forcing the people around me to accommodate.

If I went back to school now that I'm totally blind I would probably like to have all the books and notes in a digital format that I could listen to using my screen-reader, because I have a lot of trouble with Braille.","[{'start': 8, 'end': 18, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

578,"Hi. Have you considerred researching residential training programs for the blind? This might be more ideal since your father lives far away from any training centers for the blind. These programs typically last anywhere from 6 weeks to a year. These programs can teach him skills to live independently that includes reading/writing braille, using a cane, operating a computer, cooking, and more. This may also be a good way for him to separate himself from the abusive behavior of your mom for a short time while he focuses on figuring out how to live his new normal. Seeing your father live more independently may help your mom come to terms with his vision loss and improve her behavior. Additionally, I would also higly recommend enabling VoiceOver on your Dads iPad. It is a popular screen reader software that is already installed on all Apple devices. Tutorials on activating and using VoiceOver can be found on YouTube. My favorite are the videos published by the Hadley School for the Blind.

In this video, a blind user follows the voice of a ""virtual guide"" to navigate an unfamiliar corridor. The virtual guide is produced by a wireless headset based on scanning the surrounding space. This is the user's very first experience with the virtual guide.""

00:11 ""The top-right panel is recorded by a camera on the headset and shows what the user would have seen during the task.""

""Headphones are recommended for best audio experience. For more details please see the video description below.""

00:18 The video opens the view of a person, their face blurred, apparently wearing the headset. They are facing a door; the computer-generated voice opens with ""turn around; follow me. Follow me."" The caption reads, ""The virtual guide corresponds to the blue balloon in the point-of-view inset."" Inside the camera view for the person wearing the headset, there is a blue circle that hovers in the direction they are meant to go.

00:31 ""If follows a pre-defined path to the destination and always stays a few steps ahead of the user."" The man is shown slowly walking down a hallway with no external assistance.

00:38 The man reaches a junction in the hallway where he must either turn left or right. He turns right, and the caption reads ""The user carries a small clicker that triggers the virtual guide to call 'follow me'.""

00:46 ""3D spacial sound encodes the location of the guide's voice.""

00:50 ""The SceneReader prototype runs on the Microsoft Hololens."" The man continues to slowly walk down the hall.

00:54 ""It is tetherless, self-contained and requires no beacons or other modifications of the physical environment.""

01:02 ""The external speakers allow hearing of ambient sounds, and the system is compatible with additional use of a cane or guide dog.""

01:08 ""When the destination is within reach, a notification sound is played and the user can use hands or cane to proceed.""

01:23 ""You have arrived."" The man turns slightly left and begins to feel around the wall; he is standing in front of a men's bathroom door.

01:27 ""Alright, you made it! Okay! Congratulations!"" A man and a woman off screen offer congratulations at the same time.

That's almost like saying you're equally good at everything, and if you're equally good at everything, chances are it's not that you're equally awesome at everything.

What I'm saying is, you need to specialize. If you want to be a teacher, you need to have taught. In the unlikely event you want to be a telemarketer, demonstrate public speaking or an orientation toward service. But if your resume is written for everything, or is a hodge-podge, that doesn't look very desirable.

Pick something you could realistically do and decide what steps you're going to take to become attractive in that area. This could involve volunteering or it could involve physically getting out and talking to people who work in that profession. It could also mean starting a blog or doing something entrepreneurial.

The subtext of your post is that you deserve a job and getting rejected, and especially not hearing back from people, is an insult to you. The world does not actually owe you a job. There are millions of unemployed people in this and every country. For better or worse, it's on you to convince someone that you're valuable enough to pay for your service. It also sounds like you think you're above a job at McDonalds. Well, maybe you're not above it. These are strangers who don't owe you anything, so have humility in your attitude and interactions. You're the one asking for something, after all.

So my concrete advice:

- Specialize. Then specialize some more.
- Be humble. You're the one asking for stuff.
- Don't expect interactions. It's not really standard for you to get rejection letters and you shouldn't be surprised if you don't. It's polite for them to send you one but, again, they don't owe it to you.
- Think about what the hiring individual wants, not what you want. Nobody much cares what you want, people care about what they want.
- Don't be too hard on yourself. Most everyone is unemployed at different times. If you keep at it, you'll find a job eventually.
- Solicit feedback on your resume and cover letters. Accept feedback even if it's critical.

596,"As has already been mentioned, unfortunately there is not a great number of US cities that have really great public transportation; I believe this is especially the case in the south, I'm originally from 

Alabama. I live in Hartford CT. and I can get to most essentials by walking or using the city bus, but my wife and I still use Uber and Lift to get to places that would take forever to get to on the bus. My wife's daily commute to work is about 45 minutes on the bus, if she could drive it would take 15 minutes. The long and short of it is, even with pretty decent public transportation things are going to be less convenient when you can't drive.

Someone mentioned getting an apartment with built in laundry services, which is a great suggestion; I would hate to have to drag londry around on the bus or by walking. On a similar note, try and find a place that has grocery delivery services. My wife and I use PeadPod which is a total game changer; not only can we do all of our grocery shopping online, which is much more accessible, but it saves us money because we would use Uber for grocery shopping, because trying to load up a bus with your shopping is no fun at all. You have to consider bus lines and what is in walking distance when your looking for an apartment, but you also have to think about what the neighborhood is like. My neighborhood is great, with nice neighbors that care about the area; we also have safe areas nearby we can walk to, with restaurants, shops and parks. However, we are also a short walk to more troubled areas that you would want to be aware of and careful in. This kind of thing is not something that I am inclined to think about, but it can be an important consideration, and it's not something you can easily learn about from a far. Honestly my wife and I would have had a hard time determining which affordable areas have safer environments if we had not had the help of some of her family who came and helped us scout out locations. This is not something that requires sight, but it can help and I do think you have to at least be in the city before you can really understand it's unique areas. Plus it's also good to be able to get a feel for what your land lord is like. We got super lucky and have the best land lord we could have ever hoped for; however, before we made a final decision we were considering two places, after touring the other place we dealt with some blatant discrimination from the land lord of ther other place, which made the decision much easier.

One last thing, look into which cities have the jobs you would be applying for. In the end this is the largest factor that determins where most people live, it's why my wife and I live where we live.
