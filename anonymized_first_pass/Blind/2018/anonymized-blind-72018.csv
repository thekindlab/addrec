Most cards have little to read and could be brailled easily, the unique districts are text heavy and its small print. You could braille out a reference book with those and the role abilities though if needed)

Medium weight, area control: Small World (2-5, whacky races, easy to learn except for a single mechanic which some can find tough to understand. It's tough for me to see the borders between regions and identifying what's in them can be tough, but the other players can help.

76,"I feel you. 

I was in nursing school when this started, and I had to drop out because I was having trouble reading instruments that I needed to read and could no longer see well enough to evaluate a patient. I had gone to do the pre reqs for this and had my goal snatched out of my hands.

For the first two years after I started losing my vision, I was angry and I was suicidal. I had a bottle of oxy and was just waiting until the day that I couldn't handle it any more. The day that I almost did it, was the day that I could no longer pick up and read a book and read it. I was a shut in for the most part. I had been grabbed on the breast by some random turd in a parking lot on my birthday and was afraid to go out alone.

I started at my local blindness support center and everything changed. I saw people who were profoundly blind that were doing just fine. I went to their group discussions and activities. I met a lot of blind people. I had only known one previous to this. 


Now I have a kindle, I can make the print large enough. Or I can get an audio book. 

 They talked me into doing training with the white cane, which I was surprised to learn that I could easily master. Now, I can even blindfold myself and get anywhere I need to go. It is freeing and gave me a new sense of self confidence. 

I did technology training, to learn to use the tools that I would need. I am now working full time and I can get anywhere I want to go on the bus.  I have a bar code reader for the market, an app that tells me what it sees. I have Blind Square, that helps me navigate.

One of the trainers at the center has an awesome guide dog. I might get one of those eventually.

You are young, I was not when this started. You can start learning braille now, *before* it's a necessity. I suck at it. You have years to learn what you need and to readjust your thinking to fold in a different set of experiences.

You have a choice, you can stay mad and get nowhere, or surrender to the process and head somewhere completely different than you ever imagined.

89,"I think you may be onto something. Maybe the schools that provide service animals could be accredited and any animal graduating from an accredited school could receive proper credentials. There should be an authority responsible for making sure the schools are using the best practices in training. 

That same authority should provide a field agent for anyone who has trained their own animal and who would like to receive the proper credentials. Like I said I don’t want to take away the right to train your own animal. There are people out there who are capable of doing so and do it beautifully. Also, why force someone to get a new animal if the one they have is capable and willing to do the work. Forcing a person to get a new dog from a school would be an unnecessary burden for that person, in time and expense. A person has to invest 3 and a half weeks at a school to learn to work with a new service animal, and the cost of food and vet visits for an additional animal might be too much for that person to manage. Not to mention travel issues if that person ever wanted to travel with their pet and service animal. I know someone who used to have to fly his retired service dog home then go back to get his working service dog and fly again. 

I disagree with a standard curriculum. I think that results are more important than the content of the training. As long as the training is done humanely. 

Maybe there ought to be some kind of program the handler has to complete. That way we can be confident that the handler will have some idea how to act in different situations. They will know how to advocate fro themselves and thus be less stressed when facing a difficult situation. Animals pick up on the stress and fear of their handler and the more we can do to put the handler at ease the more likely the animal will be at ease. 

There are definitely schools that provide animals for the deaf and hard of hearing, and for seizures. I’m not sure about psychiatric service animals.

130,"As previous commenters explained, the length depends not only on your height but also personal preference. I am 170 cm (5'7"") tall and I have a 127 cm (4'2"") long cane, which means it comes up to  the bottom of my breastbone. 

As my mobility trainer explained it to me, if you naturally walk a bit faster (as I do), your cane should be a bit longer so as to signal obstacles to you on time. If you're a slower and more methodical walker, a short cane might be better and more practical. 

The biggest difference, really, is that longer canes tend to be heavier and hence require more muscle to move. A very slight change in cane weight or taking a too long or too heavy cane from the very start could cause muscle pain and tendonitis (as I discovered once when I had to use a slightly longer cane than usual for a few months). You don't feel it at first, but waving that thing around all day sure does take its toll.

If you're just starting out and do not have strong shoulder and wrist muscles, I would definitely recommend starting with something shorter and lighter, and then moving your way up as you get used to it.

131,"I have to say that I agree with you, to a certain extent. Some issues I see are who will be responsible for distributing the ID cards? The Department of Transportation? What kind of documentation will be required? Vet records and the sort won’t do much good. Should the ID cards only be provided to animals that came from a program like The Seeing Eye or Guiding Eyes, guide dog schools? That would raise other issues, like the fact that people are allowed legally to train their own pets to be service animals. I don’t think that right should be taken away. Ultimately, it seems to me that there should be some sort of good citizen test for the animals. Like a driving test to get your driver’s license. The animal should have to go through rooms set up with distractions and display that they are well behaved. This seems like it would be difficult to implement. Would every state need a location for testing? Every county? Will the Department of Transportation have to hire animal trainers who are more familiar with animal interactions? A lay person might be able to tell the animal got through the test alright, but a trained specialist might notice the animal passed but was very stressed. Lastly, should this be a periodic thing? Should recertification be required? And, how often? As I mentioned in another response a guide dog bit another dog when guiding his handler. If this dog came from a school and ID cards are just given to all guide dogs that come through proper training this would undermine the integrity of guide dog schools.

While writing this and asking these questions, it occurs to me that maybe a field agent would be best for certifying service and emotional support animals.

132,"When I had vision, it wasn't enough to get as much out of live-action or line-art, so I wound up with a strong preference for animation, big distinct chunks of color, etc. Generally speaking, the better graphics something had, the harder a time I had at making sense of it, so graphics had to be impressively awful for me to agree with those who cite graphics quality in their criticisms of things.

Shiny/sparkly things were great, but size kinda mattered. I couldn't really appreciate the difference between real and fake jewelry, visually speaking, but tiny gemstones were barely noticeable and generally just detracted from the clarity of whatever they were inlaid in, so in practice, this meant that fake won out because plastic and glass and quartz can be big enough, much more cheaply.

One thing I'd do sometimes was blink rapidly, to simulate random special effects, especially when there was more visual snow / lights being set off. I think the only time I can recall encountering any depiction of rapid blinking is from *Frog and Toad are Friends*, which is a children's book which I don't think I've encountered in any format other than Braille. (Wait, do frogs have transparent eyelids? Would that even do anything for them?)

Sometimes, when I was in water that was getting direct sunlight, and the reflection caught my eye, I would do things like splash or stir it up to watch how it affected the reflection. I kinda liked trying various ways of making splashes in general, because of how they looked and felt. (Like, striking downward with an open palm, and continuing to push after your hand breaks the surface creates a small cloud of tiny bubbles that almost feel like solid particles if they hit you. Keeping your hand half submerged and vibrating it back and forth, or maybe in a very tight, fast spiral motion, seemed kinda like an Energy Effect.)

A certain type of contrast in colors was helpful, so the decorations around Halloween and Christmas were generally much easier for me to deal with than, say, Easter (where things tend to get more ... pastelly?). Particularly indoors/at night, since Frosty the Snowman on a snowy day is a lot of pale-on-pale, but a Christmas tree in a room, covered in colorful lights and ornaments, has much more contrast). Put this together with the bits about animation, and you can probably imagine how the likes of Scooby Doo could have an impact out of proportion with how much I cared about the specifics (white, amorphous ghosts on dark backgrounds worked so well that I developed a consistent fantasia where certain words or ideas would give me a visualization of a ghost with a jacolantern floating at head-height beside it). I made a lot of audio recordings in elementary school based on dreams, and occasionally random ideas, and these involved a lot of ghosts (and Power Rangers, which has nothing to do with their very my-vision-friendly outfits, I'm sure).

Weirdly enough, glow-in-the-dark things rarely got much interest. Probably because of how remarkably dim most glow-in-the-dark things were. Things that would actually light up, though, were plenty nice. For some reason, they kept giving me those little pen-lights at the eye-doctors', which is how I discovered the limits to the opacity of human skin. Also, that place had interesting glass around one of the waiting rooms, where instead of a strip of metal dividing the panes, there was another, thick piece of glass extending inward, which either had a greenish tint, or resulted in one when looking through it at a certain angle. So I tended to look at those a lot.

I can't provide an image for reference, but I had an action figure of Marvel's Garrison Kane with his metal fan-weapon. I didn't know anything about the character, but I did know that spinning the fan while it caught the light just right was fascinating enough to prompt the imagination.

It actually took me a while to discover the eye-pushing-illusion-thing, so it's hard to say how much I did that.

I apologize profusely in the delay to my response, but a very close friend of my family, who was suffering from sever Parkinson's (and was just a few years older than I am), took her own life last week. She lived three hours away, and we've been shuttling back and forth cleaning up the house, arranging ""things"", and doing all of the stuff no one thinks of until something like this happens.

I do not blame her at all. I think she saw a window of time to control her own destiny, because one more fall or just a bit more motor skill deterioration and she would lose that choice. And I certainly understand the feeling of a (relatively, in my case) sound body being trapped in a body that has betrayed you.

If you're ever tempted to criticize yourself over how you're handling things, step back and realize that this is how it is for virtually every child that has ever been raised, and you're doing fine, and babies thrive even when things aren't perfect.

While I had many complaints, it was overall a very positive and helpful experience. There were clients from a variety of backgrounds with a variety of skill-levels, ranging from ""terrified of stairs"" to ""send them to the next town because that's the only challenging assignment left"", and it seemed to me that both ends of the spectrum and those in between gained from the experience.

The exact combination of student and instructor probably matters a great deal, though I noticed something about which students wound up with which instructors that makes me think they might deliberately try to predict who would gain most from which instructor, assuming more than one has an opening. Maybe it was just a coincidence, though.

Basically, it was very helpful, and do keep in mind that they aren't going to fix everything in a client's life, just give them the tools to work on it themselves.

Before answering though, I would absolutely recommend contacting the VA in your area and ask if a soldier with sight loss would like to talk to you for the sake of research. I am sure someone would be, and not many people have the courage to talk about someone’s blindness and ask questions. I haven’t met anyone so far who minds answering questions about their vision, but losing eyesight in battle is something I cannot imagine and it is heartbreaking. 

My vision loss was tied to symptoms of a brain tumor so I was very scared for other reasons.  I got new glasses that didn’t work after 2 weeks, but I went to renew my drivers license (even though I didn’t drive then) and I started crying in the MVD bc I couldn’t read the top line.  Anyway, the most upsetting thing was being suddenly unable to work.  I used a computer and my employers did everything possible to accommodate my sight.  They even tinkered with the graphics on their proprietary software but it didn’t work. 

When I realized I couldn’t support myself I went through pretty intense depression.  I had a lot of surgeries, lumbar punctures and awful drugs and they actually upset me much, much, more than sight loss.  My adult kids supported me through it all and I love and appreciate them but feeling dependent on them financially was also depressing. 

Another factor that has been emotionally difficult is the process of rehabilitation. I have an independent living teacher, a vocational counselor and a technology teacher.  I went to visit a residential program that wasn’t my cup of tea so the process is slower.  It took almost 2 years to get the ball rolling on my training and their resources are so stretched I only see the teachers about once every 2 months.  This has been emotional because even though Im laid back I stay pissed off and frustrated with it.

I guess my sight loss in general hasn’t been a huge emotional factor, there are some good things emotionally.  I am actually less self conscious because I can’t see when people are gawping at me.  I am braver about speaking up and asserting myself instead of being timid and passive.   I have grown in confidence by learning to navigate streets and my profanity at drivers cutting me off or blocking pedestrian lanes has become eloquent and Im not averse to smacking bumpers or car doors of people who nearly run me over.

356,"&gt; My infant daughter was just diagnosed with optic nerve hypoplasia. I'm a little terrified.

you are terrified in much the same way that a bird would be terrified at the prospect of never being able to fly again or a dolphin never being able to use echo location. these animals would probably look at how we live and pitty us. and yet we do not share their terror because not being able to fly or use echo-location is the only existence we have ever known.

-

your daughter will not miss being able to see because she wont know what it means to have good vision. the biggest barriers she will face are from the social stigmas of having a visible disability. 


&gt; Will she be able to work?

yes, with the proper training and the proper direction she should be able to do all sorts of things you wouldn't expect. this includes working.

&gt; Will the work be the same as a sighted person, or will she have to choose a job better suited to her abilities?

sadly, she will be limited in the kinds of work she can do but you already knew that. she will never be a professional basketball player. the good news is that technology is getting better and better. **accessibility** is becoming a major concern for people who develop software and other technologies. by the time your daughter is in highschool i suspect most computers will have very robust accessibility software that will allow her to use all sorts of devices without the use of her vision. this will open up a lot of possibilities for her. 

-

look up some youtube videos on NDVA and JAWS. these are software packages that allow blind people to use a computer. they aren't perfect but they do get better every year. you should learn how to use them so that when your daughter is ready to start using a computer you will know how to teach her. start her young.

&gt; Is it hard to find work in your chosen field, as a blind person?

yes. there is no sugar coating that. the only thing you can do is build a strong strategy that will give her some advantages early. 

Is higher education a possibility?

yes. like i said earlier, accessibility is a big issue right now and a lot of major players like microsoft and apple are making a big push for it. i was close friends with a blind woman in university. it was definitely more challenging for her but she managed to finish her diploma.",False,False,,LanceThunder,sighted accessibility enthusiast,,1530742239,t5_2qpec,t3_8w55vp,t3_8w55vp,7,1535666444,0,0,e1stwkt,Blind,,,blue1,,

368,"I understand where you are coming from and it makes logical sense to look at the science, however, in this case we are looking at the law. The Air Carriers Access Act ACAA is the law that the Department of Transportation DOT is interpretting with its regulations. The ACAA does not directly address the service animal issue. It simply states that air carriers cannot discriminate against passengers with disabilities, must provide said passengers with reasonable accommodations unless the accommodation poses a safety or health risk to others or poses an undue hardship on the air carrier. This has been interpreted to mean that people with disabilities who have a service animal should be allowed to fly with that animal. 

If I apply your thoughts to this law it would mean that not all people with disabilities would be treated equally. Not necessarily a bad thing. The definition of disability in the ADA is extremely broad. There are something like 292 disabilities out there. It would be a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability that requires a service animal, an animal that performs an assistive task for that person, to travel with said animal. However, it would not be reasonable to accommodate people with disabilities who have ESAs that do not perform a task but only provide emotional support. The risk to reward balancing might support this argument, but I’m not sure the science would. While the science can’t prove the benefit of having an ESA, I’m not sure if there have been any studies done showing the benefit of a service animal except through observation and surveys. If we are basing our arguments on science it seems to me that we are comparing apples to oranges. This is why I lean more towards allowing service animals and ESAs, as long as they are well behaved. 

I think that addressing behavior is the way to get around the threat to safety of others that the air carriers are concerned with. I think it would get really tricky to legally argue that some threats to safety are more acceptable than others. Furthermore, there would be people with ESAs claiming discrimination based on the type of disability they have. Why should they be discriminated against if their ESA can be shown to be as safe as other service animals?

I do agree that it seems like a lot of people are using this as a backdoor way to be able to travel with their pets. This is unfortunate and selfish. In my opinion.

397,"Probably a standardized training program certified by an appropriate government department would be enough. There’s already schools that teach this, they really just need to standardize the curriculum and agree upon a standard identity card. It’s unfortunate that something like this is even necessary because not only blind people benefit from service animals.  Guide dogs for the blind are readily identifiable, emotional support and service dogs for people with other special needs should be as easily identifiable Because there’s always going to be some special snowflake who has to have her pocket dog with her no matter how badly trained it is and at least this way it would be possible to filter out the snowflakes - which hopefully will make things easier for people who have a genuine need.

Having one certification standard would make it easier to keep an eye on certified service animals, I don’t think you can put a specific timeline on “recertification”. Much of that depends on the owner and how well they maintain the training and the dog itself. That’s why guy dog puppies go through such rigourous training, to make sure that they’re suitable before they even start training as adults.

As others on here have said definitely find out your state’s rehabilitation institution. In Florida, where I am, it is The Florida Division of Blind Services. They have been extremely helpful and provide a lot of support for getting you on track to a career. They can even help pay for your education. They also bought me a Macbook Pro with voiceover, a scanner, and a printer. These are all things that will help me in acheiving our shared goal of self sustainability. They also got me mobility training and the mobility teacher showed me around the campus and helped me map out and strategize where my classes are. They also can pay for your books.

At the school you will want to work with disability services. With a receipt of your books and some paperwork you should be able to get your books in alternative formats. I chose PDF versions of the books and use the Voice Dream App on my ipad to have the books read to me. It is a really useful app. Takes some getting used to, but once you’re used to it it is excellent. You can even ask for the school’s office of disability services or the rehab institution of the state to break the books up into the assigned readings. Pages 11-34 for example, can be put into one file. This way you don’t have to try and figure out what page to stop on, or on what page to begin.

You also need to learn to be a good advocate for yourself. A lot of people will ask you what you need rather than make suggestions, so be prepared. Extra time for exams and assignments, notetakers, scribes, readers, even a private room for testing are all reasonable accommodations. If your school has the capability of recording classes and giving you access to the recorded lectures you may want to ask for that as well. This is what I receive in lieu of a note taker. Be prepared for some push back because some schools want to do the minimum required. If this is the case get what you can and then use your improvements as reasons why more accommodations would help to maximize your potential.

I can hide the earbud with my hair and most people don’t notice the remote if I am at the podium so it looks really natural and a lot of people are impressed that I don’t use notecards.

433,"Well to your point about feeling mohr comfortable with a dog as opposed to a cane, I found myself wishing for the cane once I'd used a dog for a while. While nobody will ask for your cane's name, it won't poop on the floor either.
This is purely my subjective opinion, so take it with a whole shaker of salt, but if you're not comfortable in your own skin, a dog won't help much. The dog will be of little to no help without a foundation of good mobility skills, and there's a lot you can do with a cane. While a dog can find a door, it can't tell you what side the handle's on, nor can it tell you how high up the knob is.
Don't get me wrong, the dog can be great if you have the disposition for it, but it isn't a magic cure for the insecurity that blindness can bring. I'm not saying this to be a jerk, just relaying my own experience.
Also, prepare to be left behind by uber drivers a lot. Uber wasn't a thing when I was a handler, but my friends who have dogs have a lot of trouble because Uber drivers will see the dog and bail on them.
I really hope you make the right decision for yourself in regards to getting a dog. If you are an animal person, and if you have patience, you may have a good experience. Many people seem to love their dogs and do very well. My opinion is just the rantings of one random internet stranger, so like I said, take it with a grain of salt.

The other service animal was a pit bull who did nothing but back away from the guide dog.

The guide dog likely came from a school while the pit bull was handler trained, mind you the handler had years of dog training experience.

I agree that there has been a lot of abuse, but I also see the value in guide dogs. I still have some usable vision and am considering a guide dog because I think I would be more comfortable in new experiences if I had a guide. I also think I’d feel more comfortable going out with my sighted friends if I had a guide dog. This way my friends don’t have the responsibility of checking in on me.

473,"I think this is a legitimate question, but don't be surprised if you get negative responses. After all, this is a place where blind people congregate. An uncharitable interpretation of your question could be, ""Hey, you blind people! Why don't you all just kill yourselves?""

Well, why don't we just kill ourselves? The short answer is that life continues to be worth living after blindness. Of course, some people do respond as you're suggesting, not seeing past the immediate difficulties of dealing with blindness. Think about the stories you've heard of people who end their lives after breaking up with their romantic partner in their teens. They don't have the experience or the breadth of perspective to put life after that dramatic incident into context. Because life is now unimaginable, they find it not worth living. There is also an element of revenge or anger at the world or at the reality they face. Because reality has dealt them an existential blow, they attack reality by ending it, at least as far as they are concerned.

Don't end your reality. Give yourself time to develop the perspective you need to find enjoyment in life after blindness. Blind people, as we will be happy to tell you whereever you go, lead full lives. It's not always easy, I'm not promising you that. You'll experience grief at the loss of your sight and probably also discrimination from others. You are, after all, discriminating against people with the condition of blindness through the subtext of your question. But if you give it a chance to, that will pass, and you will realize that the unimaginable is imaginable, and in fact is your life.

I'm here for you if you want to send me a message. There are also many people who would likely be willing to provide support in your community. Your stance is not an unreasonable one given the shock and loss you must be feeling. For now, you might just have to take it on faith that life will be worth living after the this happens. But, if you open to it, you will find it worth living on the other side.

475,"The empathy and curiosity in your question is great; the concern would be that you would project your temporary blindness onto others who have it permanently: ""I felt helpless and disoriented, so imagine how awful someone must feel who is blind all the time!"" For this reason, some blindness advocates are against this practice as it risks misrepresenting the community, and /u/Uatu71 is right to advise a lot of caution in equating blindfolds or special glasses with the lived experience of visual impairment.

Their brains are often adapted to process sounds and touch in ways that brief deprivation can't duplicate.

Anyway, give yourself some time. You can always kill yourself later, after all. (Though I recommend against doing that.) And keep a lookout for a purpose. If you can develop a sense of humor and a lot of perspective, that's even better.

487,"Yeah, it's looking like a combination of the aria alert role and aria-live region might be enough for an activity stream.

My original thought was to just flat out give some kind of dom representation of the room.

    &lt;div tabindex=""0"" data-type=""room"" id=""room-a""&gt;
        &lt;!--actual coordinates might not matter--&gt;
        &lt;!--since I'd have some kind of targeting shortcut--&gt;
        &lt;div tabindex=""0"" data-type=""guard"" id=""guard-a""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div tabindex=""0"" data-type=""door"" to=""room-b"" id=""door-a""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

But while that might work well for a static layout, or just allowing you to see the map in general, that's probably not going to be a great experience during play if a guard is running into and out of a room and keeps interrupting your focus.

Probably in that case I want something closer to a regular activity stream, or maybe even just a set of really quick audio queues for something entering/leaving the room and a shortcut to say ""focus me on whatever element just changed.""

What I'm thinking is that if you're blind, the experience I'm shooting for should be a bit like playing those old-school text adventures. You'll have a description of whatever room you're in, and shortcuts to take common actions or target actors in the room. The big difference of course being that Reset Hard is a real time game, so I won't know until I start testing how chaotic things are going to get.

People may think less of you if you're blind, or disabled in general, that's just how our world is.

The thing that's worked for me is to prove them wrong, consistently.

I've lost out on a few chances due to being blind, but I also snuck it in to the first conversation I had with my fiance, and 18 months later we've pushed eachother past any limits we thought we may have.

I didn't do this by being typical though. Between an average guy, and an average guy that is blind, you're a few points behind. Between an average guy, and a guy that's blind and loves to hike, skydive, go white water rafting, rock climbing, and traveling, you're going to be miles ahead, and not being able to drive won't be nearly as big of a factor.

For the first year of our relationship, neither one of us drove, we just Ubered everywhere. She's not from my area and doesn't have a car in the area.

Well, my family had a spair truck, so we gave her the keys to that, and now she's our DD. Also recently got her a Mini Cooper, a convertible like I love, and a small car like she loves. Best of both worlds, for both of us.

I get her thinking but as someone with generations of experience. I don't agree.   I will note that my refusal to use makeup is more about skin issues than my vision though it's easier to explain that way.     I've never used Be My Eyes for example though my clients swear by it.   We have far more resources to get around these stereotypes than we used to.

My own take on fashion just for the fun of it.
My closet has very little solid colors in it.   When the cataract was 'inoperable' I made sure I had the full range of tie dye, vivid colors and my trademark retina-damaging patterns so I'd have at least some sense that my clothes matched me for a few years after I could no longer see them.

I did, finally get the surgery.  I have a reprieve of unknown duration.   I'm gently phasing out the rest of the monocolor items or pairing them with appropriate torment for my own gleeful pleasure.   I've been designing and installing tattoos, too.

523,"If you feel safer with your cane,use it.   If you're our and shout with your cane you're already defying the stereotype that blind folks stay in because they have no jobs or family or social lives.    The sooner you're comfortable with your cane, the better.   Further vision loss will have less impact. 

On the job part, I grew up with tech minded blind folks who did exactly what you're doing as a career path.   We're in our late 40's to early 60's, now.    Tech was primitive and assistive tech was infantile.   In the early 80's, one friend told a story about needing a hardware upgrade assist and having a colleague come over to his house to help out.    Helper was shocked to discover that my friend's system had no monitor.   Why should it?    

Take a deep breath and consider that what you're doing is a lot easier to adapt than many other careers.   You still have time to experiment and find the right tech fits for your needs.   Even if you wait, the solutions are out there and more are coming out.     The advantage to starting now is that any issues you discover can be worked on before you absolutely need them to work.

Consider that your expertise base might put you in a place that would be beneficial to many other users without your skills or even colleagues who unexpectedly find themselves in your shoes.   We never know how much we help others just by solving our own problems. 

On the social thing.   I was a lot less secure when I was younger. I used to get really scared in large groups or loud places.  I waa clingy with friends and it made us all uncomfortable.     

I've worked on those issues and found solutions but found its more stereotype than just my personal situation that caused problems.   So, I've given up trying to reassure others that I can keep up.   I make sure I have supports in place so a concert or street fair is possible whether my friends want to go or not or if I get separated from them, for example.   

Friendship shouldn't have to include resumes.   Few of my friends know how to use a cane or arrange my art supplies or how to assess a medical crisis all of which are essential skills I have which I've adapted to suit my vision limits.  Focus on commonalities and when accessibility issues come up, handle them with dignity and honesty.  Some people handle this better than others.   You will find true friends you never  imagined and maybe lose someone you thought would be a bff.    Welcome people into your life who don't try to kill you (out of carelessness or intentionally) and offer them the same thoughtfulness in return.   The rest will work out.   

This is definitely not the end of your life.   Just a change in how you live it.

537,"Working with the state or Vocational Rehabilitation depends on state, county, or maybe individual city. Sometimes individual counselors. Some experience is very bad, some of them very good. Some of them somewhere in the middle.

Goal setting is important and accomplishable goals is necessary. What you don’t want to do is set a goal like study to be a police officer. I saw a post on here a while back. You’ll be disappointed, you won’t ever do that. It just, isn’t feasible! I am training to be a pilot! That’s absurd but okay. Be ready to be disappointed and don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. Hahahaha! Setting goals that you can work on checking off is important. And in education having a bigger goal this can go towards is super important. Not expecting others to direct your step for you is useful. Go in ready to do what you need to do. Too many students expect people to guide and spoon feed them, and have no idea. Some expect others to make up their mind for them. Yeah, don’t be one of those people. People don’t actually like it or find you easy to work with. You need to understand what you want or don’t expect people to, I think people expect others to understand what they need when they don’t know themselves.

Be assertive, even if you’re naturally just not assertive. Communication is so important. Learning to speak up for your needs, and how necessary it is is essential. You can not be ashamed of asking for help. I think advocating and learning how to express polite of how abled and capable and communicate how this is possible for us is important. Most people except for some people are actually open to learn about you, but there is actually so little understanding about blindness. Be ready to education and watch them be absorb the information. Push for what you need, sometimes pressure is important here.

Make friends and have fun. You’d be surprised just how far a few connections and friendships can get you. Take the time to say hi, stand at the counter and take time to get to know someone. It will help. May get you somewhere.

It is my opinion that emotional support animals should be welcomed on planes, if they can exhibit excellent behavior.

He kind of ignored me so I went to gather my things and put on my shoes.

I thanked him for his apology and that was that.

My current thinking is that credentials should be given to animals that graduate from an accredited school. And anyone with a self trained service animal or ESA should have to pass a field test, in which a field agent (trained in animal behavior) comes out to the individual to observe the animals interactions in public settings. Based on that observation the agent grants or denies the credentials. This way we can help mitigate the safety risk these animals pose. 

One issue with my solution is where will the money come from for such a program. The ESA and self trained service animal handlers? This could help fund the program and deter pet owners who don’t think their pets will pass.

At first it was completely dehabilitating, but I wasn’t focusing on it as much due to my physical health problems.  Once I began feeling better physically, it hit me like a ton of bricks.  It will take time and effort for your father to settle into the new normal of his life.  

First of all, make sure your father has access to mental health care if he needs it, because I grieved the loss of my vision almost like losing a loved one—I was angry, afraid, unrealistic, but I grew to accept it over time.  
Next, get him in to see a neuro-ophthalmologist for a second opinion and a low vision specialist to help learn how to accommodate his disability with technology and other aids.  Connect him with resources.  He will likely be referred to orientation and mobility training, which will help him regain a lot of his mobility and capability to navigate in unfamiliar environments.  The Library of Congress offers free audio books and magazines to the visually impaired.  There are tax breaks for the blind and I'm not sure of his age, but blindness qualifies you for Social Security Disability automatically.

The troublesome bits are things like narrow targets (my driveway ends some distance from my house, and there's a wheelchair ramp that covers most of the distance, and it's easy to miss, especially if I've got a brush pile at the end of the driveway), the fact that shorelining freaks sighted people out more than just seeing a blind person usually does, and if the sun's harder to feel then that's a navigation aid that's missing. And if there is less traffic, there are situations where that would mean a loss of another orientation aid.

606,"I’ve been in that same place. Several times! The fear and anxiety and questions are the same each time. 

I was declared legally blind in my mid-20’s, used a cane for a little while because I thought it was what I was supposed to do, but then I put it away because I “didn’t need it.” That was fine, until my vision started getting worse again, so I pulled it out &amp; started using it. It’s been necessary for a while now, and even though I know I need it and feel safer when I do, I still question. 

There are people out there who will be jerks because of your vision loss, as indicated by your cane. There will be a lot of people who don’t care. There will be people who want to help you. Sure, there might be times that you don’t get invited or don’t get the promotion because people think being blind means you’re not fun or can’t do things, but there’s going to be times when you prove them all wrong. 

Technology has come a long way, and adaptive software is much more common, so you shouldn’t have trouble doing your job/classes. It takes a bit of adjustment, but so does any new task. 

And, really, do you want friends who won’t include you because of your cane? They sound ignorant and like not good friends. 

I’m 40 now, have been legally blind for over 15 years, have gone through several experiences of vision loss. I have a full-time job, a house, a family, and a bunch of friends, sighted and not. You’ll do fine!

And like you said no more awkward explanations about why you bumped into someone or knocked something down. No one is going to cus out the guy with the white cane for knocking down a display lol More likely than not they’ll apologize to you for placing that darn display in the wrong place.

Some people will still be weird about it, but that’s them and not you. There are definitely a couple people that stopped hanging out with me because I started using my cane. That was rough, but I realized that I’d rather surround myself with cool, strong, people that accept me than with people that are so concerned with conforming they would rather lose an awesome friend like me.

679,"TLDR: Turn off sleep-on-close, plugin keyboard, close laptop lid, give laptop airflow, enjoy.

Reposted from /r/windows10 in case someone comes across this sub later or uses Reddit without cross-posting support.

I've taken to carrying an external keyboard around, connected to a laptop via USB. The laptop goes onto a table, or leans against the side of the chair I'm in. This typically provides adequate airflow. To let this work, you have to turn off the sleep-on-lid-close feature in the power section of the windows control panel. You could also use a wireless keyboard if that's your thing.
Edit: While the lid is closed, the screen is disabled, from what I understand. I failed to explain that crucial point earlier.

I have yet to find any feature in Windows to continuously disable the monitor.
There is an internal programming function to disable the screen when there's no activity, but obviously that won't work for your use-case (or mine).
This includes programming and Windows's internal API's.
That being said, I would love if anyone could offer another suggestion.

711,"&gt; When you say follow head to tail is that literal?

Trail riding horses will follow each other at a distance that they feel comfortable, and I'd guess it's very rare that they'd literally be touching head to tail. The rides I've been on the horses are usually about 10-20 feet apart -- less if they're going slow, more if they're going fast. Some horses are slow or lazy and will hold back 100 feet if you let them. I'm no equestrian, but I don't think you could convince a horse to gallop if they don't have enough space in front of them to stop safely. They don't want to crash into another horse any more than you do.

&gt;  I’d love to try horseback riding, but I’d definitely want to gallop.

Horseback riding is really great, and even though I'm fully sighted it's definitely an experience for touch, sound, and smell. I'd advise against tasting, but to each his own!

You may have trouble finding a riding stable that will let you gallop the horse, since it's more dangerous, especially for inexperienced riders. Their insurance may not allow them to, and if you're blind they'll likely be even more hesitant to allow it. You may have better luck if you find a farmer with horses who will let you ride in an enclosed area until both you are comfortable enough to gallop. If there's an equestrian club in your area they might be able to help you find something.

If you go to a riding stable, you should definitely let the stable know when you make your appointment that you're blind and have not ridden before, so they can pick a horse suited to you. They'll have a guide riding a horse in front of you, holding a long rope attached to your horse, so that your horse can be controlled by the guide. That's how they do it for young riders.

As far as I know, horses aren't trained to turn left or right by voice command. You get them to turn by gently pulling their reins to the left or right. You can also get the horse to stop or even walk backward by sitting back in the saddle a bit.

&gt; Lol I just try to ignore it.

Yeah, people can be inconsiderate, but I think that's mostly just their inexperience. If they're not used to working with blind people, or really anything different from what they're used to, there's a good chance they'll speak before they think through what they're saying. I've heard of deaf people being handed braille menus at restaurants, for example. I don't even know what those people think you would have to gain by faking blindness anyway.

&gt; I would worry about showing people that I am blind in a third world country though. Primarily if I was alone.

That's a good point.

Practically though, if you don't know it's visual and have no way to describe it or distinguish then is it really visual?

756,"Blindisms can vary greatly, depending on amount of residual vision, other conditions, cognitive ability and stress. I had an ex-girlfriend who would rock, but she would rock a LOT when she was excited or otherwise stressed (She rocked a lot during exams).

For some people with residual visual, they may like looking at sparkly things and lights (I've had a few clients who stare at the sun, something we strongly suggest again). In some cases, those with very low vision may also poke themselves in in the eyes. The pressure causes the nerves in the eyes to fire, and the brain receives some stimulation from it. Long term, it often causes eye damage and a sunken in look for the eyes.

Some younger children also like swings (the ones that swing back and forth, as well as the ones that spin around), because it stimulates the vestibular system. I've literally seen children spend their entire lunchtime on a swing.
