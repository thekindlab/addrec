80,"I apparently look about half my age, so on the occasion when I'm, say, on a plane or in a city halfway across the country from home, I get asked if my parents are OK with this.

I was once in a hotel lobby with two other blind people, both with sleepshades, and both lagging behind me quite a bit. The people at the desk were perplexed as to what to do, and assumed I must have some usable vision, what with not wearing shades and all.

There was once a hotel clerk who insisted that the driver of the cab that I arrived in take me to my room. It's not the insistence, though, but the way she was clearly straining not to start shrieking in horror when I suggested I could handle it.

And of course, there was the guy who came up to me and another blind person on the street, saying ""bus stop? Bus stop?"" as though we were incapable of understanding sentences. We were actually trying to reach a coffee shop that was, like, half a block away. He shows no signs of understanding this explanation, and it goes on long enough that another guy pulls up and asks what's going on. The first guy declares that we're looking for the bus stop. We try to clarify again, and the new guy seems to get it a bit better. At this point, I try to clarify that we're going the right way by pointing with my cane. The first guy, for a reason I have yet to discern, starts walking backward while saying something, and runs into it. ... at chest height. The second guy has parked his truck at this point, and I get the impression he might possibly recognize the other guy. At some point, the other blind person tries to defuse the situation by gently pointing out that we would be fine traveling half a block, as we had gotten that far on our own.

... The first guy starts cussing defiantly, and the second guy is kinda taken aback, and the other blind person bursts into stress-laughter. I maybe shouldn't have exercised my middle finger at that point, but I don't think anyone noticed. Then I just silently turn to leave, and the second guy politely warns me that his truck is in the road where I'm about to cross. I said thank you but I'm not sure he heard because my instincts were very opposed to speaking loudly given the circumstances. By the time I'm across the street, the truck guy tries telling the first guy (hereafter ""the jerk"") to leave us alone, but it had no effect. The jerk is leading the other blind person—who is pausing to catch their breath before trying to talk him down again—at this point. The jerk just replies to the continued protestations with more profanity, and a matter-of-fact declaration that ""being blind's the next worst thing t' bein' dead"", and adds that he'd rather be dead. The other blind person gives up on dialogue at this point, and I make a point of passing the jerk and reaching our destination first, but he still showed no signs of getting the message (I only just now realized he might have been pulling a the first hotel and assumed I had some vision, although that seems ... almost well-reasoned compared to his demonstrated thinking on the subject).

If the main benefit of your idea is something to do with how one holds devices, keep this in mind. Any wearable tech product is a very hard thing to get people on board with, because something has to be extremely useful to justify wearing it on your body. I personally use apps like Seeing A I, perhaps, a few times a week; there are people who use such apps more often, but I would think the average would be something like once or twice a day. I can't imagine someone walking around with some band on if they are only going to use it a few times a day. I also can't imagine someone keeping track of, putting on, and taking off something if they can pull out their phone and get the same utility.

1&amp;2. The character is a soldier and as it is currently written, he lost his sight from shrapnel to his eye. I have read that could result in complete blindness but as I learn and rewrite, I may change my mind. I'm sorry if I sound ignorant but could you elaborate on some specific examples of levels of vision? I have heard of light perception from watching Molly Burke's youtube channel but I am curious about other types. 

3. This is an area where I am struggling. He lost his vision at 17 and when the story starts, he is 22. I have no idea if four years later he would be very well adjusted or still struggling in some aspects. I would love to hear someone's thoughts who has experienced going blind (your suggestion about reading memoirs was excellent by the way, I would love some recommendations if you have a book that you feel was very well done). 

4. He is a high ranking military officer. The character has continued to be promoted in the military because he can still use his knowledge of strategy and textured maps to plan.  I wanted to emphasize that he is just as capable at his job because he has learned to adapt. I recently read that it is difficult for a lot of deaf and blind individuals to find employment because sighted people underestimate their abilities, which is what inspired me to make his character blind in the first place. I really wanted to show that he, like all blind people, has learned to be independent and just as capable as anyone else.

5. He has two best friends as a support group. We can call them X and Y. X is available to help him constantly. I would love your advice on how X could provide assistance to him without being overbearing. As you said, ""folks who are blind can do just about everything a sighted person can do"" and I really want to make that apparent in his portrayal.

The story is science fiction so if it seems a little bizarre, that's why lol. I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

1&amp;2. The character is a soldier and as it is currently written, he lost his sight from shrapnel to his eye. I have read that could result in complete blindness but as I learn and rewrite, I may change my mind. I'm sorry if I sound ignorant but could you elaborate on some specific examples of levels of vision? I have heard of light perception from watching <PERSON> youtube channel but I am curious about other types. 

3. This is an area where I am struggling. He lost his vision at 17 and when the story starts, he is 22. I have no idea if four years later he would be very well adjusted or still struggling in some aspects. I would love to hear someone's thoughts who has experienced going blind (your suggestion about reading memoirs was excellent by the way, I would love some recommendations if you have a book that you feel was very well done).

230,I agree. If you have a basis of what type of blindness you’re going for it can help. I have albinism so I really only go 50%+ (depending on sunlight and if it’s night then it’s 50%) when I’m outside or there are car lights because I’m light sensitive. So that generally means I’m low vision until I’m outside or it’s bright in the room. Depending on the type of storyline you could use a situation like mine to your advantage where they get bullied and people shove lights in their eyes (sorry flashback moment haha) or it could be romantic where a person takes them out on dates to the forest so it’s low light and is helpful with their cane and everything.

Human corneas have been 3D printed for the first time by scientists at Newcastle University.

The researchers mixed stem cells from a healthy donor cornea with alginate, a gel derived from seaweed, and collagen to create a “bio-ink” solution that can be printed.

Using a 3D printer, this bio-ink was extruded into concentric circles to form an artificial cornea, according to a paper published in Experimental Eye Research.

“What we have shows is that it is feasible to print corneas using co-ordinates taken from a patient’s eye,” said Che Connon, Professor of Tissue Engineering at Newcastle University, who led the work.

He added that the research could help with the worldwide shortage of corneas for transplant. The cornea, the outermost layer of the human eye, has an important role in focusing vision.

Currently around 10m people worldwide each year require surgery to prevent corneal blindness as a result of diseases such as trachoma. Around 5m people annually lose their sight in both eyes due to corneal dysfunction caused by disease or accident.

Professor Connon said many teams across the world have been chasing the ideal bio-ink to make the process feasible. Flat tissue has previously been created but, he said, this was the first time shaped corneas had been produced.

“Our unique bio-gel — a combination of alginate and collagen — keeps the stem cells alive while producing a material which is stiff enough to hold its shape but soft enough to be squeezed out the nozzle of a 3D printer,” he said.

The 3D printed corneas produced at the University’s Institute of Genetic Medicine will now have to undergo further testing but it is hoped the technique could be in regular use within five years.

The shortfall in corneas available from organ donors has been compounded by the popularity of laser eye surgery, since corneas cannot be donated following this procedure.

He added that the research could help with the worldwide shortage of corneas for transplant. The cornea, the outermost layer of the human eye, has an important role in focusing vision.

Currently around 10m people worldwide each year require surgery to prevent corneal blindness as a result of diseases such as trachoma. Around 5m people annually lose their sight in both eyes due to corneal dysfunction caused by disease or accident.

Professor <PERSON> said many teams across the world have been chasing the ideal bio-ink to make the process feasible. Flat tissue has previously been created but, he said, this was the first time shaped corneas had been produced.

“Our unique bio-gel — a combination of alginate and collagen — keeps the stem cells alive while producing a material which is stiff enough to hold its shape but soft enough to be squeezed out the nozzle of a 3D printer,” he said.

The 3D printed corneas produced at the University’s Institute of Genetic Medicine will now have to undergo further testing but it is hoped the technique could be in regular use within five years.

The shortfall in corneas available from organ donors has been compounded by the popularity of laser eye surgery, since corneas cannot be donated following this procedure.

I was waiting with my mate outside Hungry Jack's (Burger King) somewhere between midnight and 1am for dad to come and give us a lift home. I'm holding my ID cane and we're talking and this bloke walks past looking at us. The movement catches my eye and I look at him straight in the eye and he exclaims ""Your not fucking blind!"" and keeps walking a few steps to the traffic lights. My mate and I look at each other and just burst out laughing, and then the guy comes back to us. ""Sorry mate,"" he says ""that was a pretty stupid of me, I don't actually know how much you can see or whatever"". So then we had a chat to him for a short while and I explained I was night blind and lacked periperhal vision by central was still quite good. Funny bloke, good times.

A bonus story, also with a good ending:

Sitting on the train two years back, I had my Vision Impaired Person badge on and I was reading a book. A rougher sort of couple sit across from me and the guy says ""How is he blind? He's reading"" or words to that effect, plenty loud enough for me to hear. Without missing a beat, his partner explained ""He could just have no peripheral vision, or otherwise still have enough sight to see nearer objects well enough to read"".

281,"As everyone is saying, try and get some O and M lessons. There are several ways to tell a street from a drive way. A street is made of asphalt, while sidewalks and residential drive ways are made out of concrete. With experience you can normally feel a difference in the texture of these two materials with your cane. Some canes are better made for feeling these textures than others. Someone mentioned the NFB, look into their free white cane program; you will be able to order the type of cane that is better at picking up these texture differences and the cane will not cost you anything. You may be using a folding cane, lots of people use those canes, but they are heavier and less sensitive then the NFB long white canes. Roads also have what’s called crowning; this basically means the middle of the road is slightly higher than the edges, which slope down like an upside\-down print U. Roads are built this way, so water runs into gutters, but it is also a way of distinguishing streets from sidewalks, because with practice you can feel crowning, while a drive way will be flat if you’re walking across it. Speaking of gutters, streets often have gutters and or concrete curbs that elevate the side walk from the street. This is especially true in cities, where the absence of such curbs is a good indicator of sidewalks. However, some business drive ways will be made of asphalt, and could also have curbs elevating the grass around the parking lot.

This is the thing: I am not searching for ""creative"" solutions. I am searching for **rules**. Just like your point about giving texts a gap of two borders on each side :) This has nothing to with creativity, but everything with readability. And in text, readablity should be the main focus. For example, there are a couple of fonts out there for braille. Some are... certainly not meant to be read, I hope, while others (for example on pharmaceutical products) have to be easily identifyable. 

Maybe to make it a bit clearer: For normal text in print, there is a rule that it shouldn't be smaller than 6pt, or else people will need a magnifyer to read it. 8-10 pts is kind of the norm for a lot of things, while everything bigger tends to be used in headlines. 

I *could* write Braille in 6 pt, sure. But... I don't think that would be very readable over any stretch of time. There has to be a reason why braille in books tends to be on the larger side. But too large, and the letters wouldn't ""fit"" on a fingertip, would they?

What makes our band different from a mobile app is the intuitive spacial sense the user has of the arm. Correct us if we're wrong, but people have more spacial awareness of where their arm is pointed or reaching for, rather than where a camera is pointed at.

To answer your question about pointing the band, our camera has a wide field of vision. A normal smartphone camera has a field of view of 65 degrees, whereas our camera has a field of view of 160 degrees. As long as you point the band in the general direction, our camera should capture it. So yes, you can ask it to find the box and read it to you.

To answer your question about pricing, our prototype currently costs $100 to produce. The entire package, including app and band, should be around $200-500.

338,Good Afternoon like others I would need a little more information. However I will take a stab  in the dark no pun intended. I am an Adaptive Technology Instructor for the Blind. I myself am low vision with a much lower eye acuity. I am going to make an assumption here and say that due to the drastic difference in focal points on each eye your brain has not adjusted to compensate. You are actively attempting to focus how you used to in the past and straining your vision to accomplish it.

Reduced amounts of pigment can be a sign of macular degeneration. Most macular degeneration is related to age and UV damage, although there is a form that comes up younger (Stargardts'). It isn't a guarantee of vision loss, though. Most of the vision loss from macular degeneration comes from drusden build up. 

Macular degeneration generally causes central vision loss, so your central vision would be blurry, possibly have dark spots, and straight lines may appear wavy.

Two things you can do right away. One is to print out an Amsler grid (https://www.aao.org/image.axd?id=4a0d828b-c698-47cf-9455-e265332e7968&amp;t=635998033438800000). Here is one you can use. You post it somewhere and look at it once a day, at roughly the same distance. You look at the center, and note what areas the lines are distorted, wavy or otherwise abnormal. Some people also take a marker to mark those areas, and to track if they get larger.

Another (possible) thing you can do is start taking ocular vitamins. They are over the counter and they can be helpful. Definitely talk to your doctor to find out if that is a good course of action, though.

As for how sighted people react, like everything, it varies. Some people freak out, some get overprotective to the point of preventing the blind person from doing mundane things independently, others despair, or get paranoid but try to hang back, some are encouraging, and some are downright mean about it. You can get a mix within one group. For instance, I have one cousin who will insist on trying to guide me if he sees me going anywhere alone, while his brother is the exact opposite and tries to tell people to not do that. There was a time I was staying somewhere overnight with my stepmom, and I was planning to visit someone early the next morning, and she wasn't awake for me to tell her I was leaving. She just texted after she got up, and seemed fine with the whole thing, even though it involved going over a mile down a very busy highway.

1.  Is your character totally blind or do they have some usable sight? (Blindness is a spectrum and there are people will all different levels of vision who are considered blind.) 

2. Have they been blind since birth, or did something happen to them or did they develop an illness? If an illness, how long ago was the diagnosis and how has their vision changed? 

3. What’s their feelings about being blind? If it’s a newer state for them, there could be anger, depression, helplessness, anxiety, fear, among others. 

4. What do they do for work? Some jobs are more easily adapted to someone with a visual impairment. 

5. What are there family and social supports? 

6. Where do they live? A lot about their lives will be easier if they’re in a city, in terms of access to public transportation or paratransit services. 

Remember, folks who are blind can do just about everything a sighted person can do, with the proper accommodations. Those might take money, and more time than it would for a sighted person, but aside from driving a car or flying a plane, there are ways to make it happen.

I also play with the cat, cook dinner, get myself placed on my own and just about everything else I want to do.

475,"I think you're onto something, but I'd like to add an idea that might help with the camera having problems because of patterns on the flooring and the shadows. 

A great LPT that the sighted use to find small objects that fall on the floor is to put your cheek to the ground and watch across the surface while shining a flashlight that is lying on the floor next to your head and sweeping it back and forth.

This would be easy to mimic with a smart phone by having you place the phone's edge against the ground and having you sweep the camera's view across the top of the ground while the LED flashlight is on. It would use a very similar principle as that  explained above.

Since your camera is looking across the floor, any patterns visible from above are effectively erased. Tiny objects become much more pronounced. As long as you don't have deep or medium pile carpet, the object could still very well be identifiable even on carpet. 

Once a lost-object candidate is found, a hotter/colder hum or tone could start playing that  gets most distinctive when the object is centered in the camera as you sweep. 

Then you start sliding the camera in the indicated direction of the object. If you start to stray from keeping the object centered, the continuous hum will guide you back on course. Keep sliding toward the object with the object centered until the camera perceives that the object is within a couple inches (maybe when it suddenly disappears under the camera's view because the camera window is actually a few millimeters above the edge that is sliding along the floor) and you hear a distinctive beep.

Then you just tap a few inches in front of the camera with your hand to see if you found what you are looking for.

Edit: Also, I just remembered that you could point your camera down at the ground while sweeping a shining a flashlight across the floor and the camera will eventually see an extended shadow created by the object. 

Just my two cents. Best of luck on eventually finding a solution!",False,False,,somewhoever,,,1529655605,t5_2qpec,t3_8rk3zq,t1_e0tcohl,3,1532811926,0,0,e13japd,Blind,,,,,

People seem to act like my situation is partly my fault because of how large my library is. As a former podcaster I knew that a huge majority of podcast listening is done on Apple's platform, but I did not fully appreciate the sparseness of the non\-apple side of podcast consumption , at least for us blind users. I may try and contact the makers of Pocket cast to see if they are interested in working on the accessibility of their desktop situation, maybe they will be more eager since they were just purchased by a bunch of public radio giants; I'm not hoeful though, most of those giants do not have good track records with the accessibility of their previous apps and services. Someone on Apple Vis suggested that I bug Overcast about adding search functions to the app, which I might try, but it's such a rudimentary feature I have to believe they have chosen not to add it for some silly reason.

It looks like I'm stuck with iTunes and the official iOS podcast app for now. I hate the whole situation on principle. I have been considering moving to Android, when my current phone dies, for a while now, and I have been feeling more and more willing to make the change; however, if I can't sink podcast across an Android phone and windows computer that alone makes the decision for me.

A lot of my friends and i use words like “blindys” and “sighties” for comedic affect. Tread carefully though, because as previously mentioned not everyone is comfortable with this and i wouldnt want to say this type of language is acceptable in every situation. 

Also, i noticed a few other things in your comments that i figure i’d reply to here to avoid making multiple comments. Depending on your character’s personality, four years is a decent amount of time to adapt quite a bit, especially if he is a military man. By that point in time he could realistically live independantly with the right resources and support structure. 

He most likely would have underwent O&amp;M (orientation and mobility) training (independant travel, cane skills etc). Even though those silent traffic lights are annoying, they’re still crossable. He would just wait to listen for parallel traffic to cross. 

On your question about different types of visual impairment, here is some additional info. Some folks are “high partial” meaning that they are blind but they still have a decent amount of remaining vision. I am one of those folks. I have a juvenile form of macular degeneration, meaning that my center field of vision is blurry. I also constantly see neon lights that aren’t actually there. I have enough remaining sight to read large print, and i find myself using digital magnifiers more than screenreaders (though i do use both). Another one of my high partial friends has RP, and since her center field hasn’t been affected, she has enough remaining vision to read small print without assistance. She also has basically no night vision. Since your character lost his vision from an accident, he probably will have more severe loss

521,"Here's a few thoughts, feel free to ask me to clarify if something doesn't make sense.

You need to use ARIA to let screen readers know that there's a part of your page that updates.  The most simple, and less optimal thing to do is mark the divs of your output with the correct attributes (see below).  The problem with this approach is a screen reader will get very spammy output.  Given how your page is structured right now, the output will read something like ""Roll number colon 4. Medium, Standard, 1, colon Failure.""  This may be what you want, depending if you want the user to hear the settings of the roll every time they press the Butten.

A better thing to do is create a separate div, mark it up with both ARIA attributes and set it's display attribute to none.  This allows you to write a custom message to screen readers, which can be more informationally dense, while not disrupting your visual flow.  For this div, every time you update the information, you can write a shorter message such as ""Roll 5: success.""  This will allow the user to hear ""Roll five colon, success"" as soon as they activate the roll button, while allowing them to review the existing on-screen message manually if they want to check the roll settings.

As for which ARIA attributes to use, this gets annoying.  To hit most of the major screen reader and browser combinations, you want to add the following attributes to one of the divs mentioned above:

*  aria-live = ""polite"".  This tells a screen reader that it should pay attention to this div for updates, and it should not interrupt what the user is doing.
*  role = ""status"". This tells the screen reader that this is the important status on the page (mainly here for compatibility reasons).
*  aria-atomic = ""true"". This tells the screen reader to read the entire message again, not only the things that have changed.

The above will work with pretty much all screen readers, with the exception of the combination of VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader on Macs, and the Chrome browser.  That particular screen reader is obnoxiously difficult to get working exactly how you want it.  I can explain if you want, but what I've already given will work well enough.

538,"I'm going to disagree with /u/rogueCandyCane's assessment a bit. The huge negative comment about ""the blind"" and ""the disabled"" surprised me.

Most blind people I've interacted with go with the term ""blind people"". Some foreigners use blind as a countable noun (ex, referring to multiple blind people as ""blinds""), but native English speakers consistently dislike it (but rarely in a very vocal way). I hear ""blink"" and ""blindy"" used ironically as if they're common slurs, but I don't know if I've ever heard them used unironically. Still, avoid those.

The blind vs visually impaired thing comes down to personal preference, generally speaking. If you'll recall how there was a period where the mainstream consensus was that ""African American"" was the preferred terminology, but it didn't stick and people today just go with either ""black people"" or ""people of color"", and the latter almost exclusively in a political context... there are some who see many of these supposed-to-be-inoffensive alternatives to ""blind"" in a similar light, while others find blindness sufficiently negative that they'll insist on visually impaired (especially if they have partial vision remaining).

When I was in school, the terms I heard were ""legally blind"", ""visually impaired"", ""the x for the blind and visually impaired"", and ""blind"" on its own was used mostly as a convenient short form. I took it as meaning I was legally blind, but technically visually impaired, since, at the time, I had some remaining vision in one eye. It wasn't the kind of distinction where I ever felt the need to ""well, technically"" anyone over it. I guess ""blind"" was an umbrella term of sorts, kinda like ""see"" is often used as an umbrella term for observation in general.

After my vision got bad enough that it was effectively gone, I sorta started to prefer ""visually impaired"" for my own usage, on the grounds that it felt like giving up on fixing it to use ""blind"", but I knew I was being kinda paranoid about it, and had no problems with other people just saying ""blind"". Actually, it was kinda cringy encountering alternatives in the wild.

These days, ""visually impaired"" feels kinda like trying to hide from reality behind words, outside of the medical context where it conveys useful information. (I don't think most people would pick up on the total vs partial distinction in an everyday context.) There are some who would see insisting on ""visually impaired"" as a lack of ""accepting one's blindness"", although that concept is confusing to me and I've mostly heard it associated with advocacy organizations such as the NFB.

But I've never heard anyone who was so intent on people-first language that they don't find ""people with blindness"" or ""people with visual impairement"" cringe-inducing.

565,"After updating to NVDA 2018.2 I decided to retest reddit's new design and whatever was causing it to hang seems to be fixed.

The site is accessible for the most part, however there are a few things that need fixing:

* Some elements like the My Communities text as well as the user profile and preference links are described as menus without acting like real menus;
* There is a button before the link with the number of comments for each headline which is not labeled and I have absolutely no clue about its function;
* There is a button after each community that is also unlabeled which I believe to be the unsubscribe button;
* The upvote and downvote buttons, while labeled, don't offer a different label when they're pressed thus making it impossible for screen-reader users to tell whether they have upvoted or downvoted a post or comment;
* There are absolutely no landmarks which are useful for screen-reader users to quickly jump from section to section in the page;
* The popup frames aren't obvious to screen-reader users, and they make the rest of the page unresponsive until closed, so consider moving the whats new, user preferences, submit to reddit, and any other popup frames to their own pages at least for screen-reader users;
* The comment trees are not being semantically described to the browser thus making it impossible for screen-reader users to understand the comment structure, so consider using unordered lists to display comments;
* Whatever is being used to mark settings as either enabled or disabled in the preferences frame is not mentioned by screen-readers, so consider using good old check boxes;
* In the submit to reddit frame all the text formatting buttons are unlabeled, and there is a button between Flare and Post that is unlabeled as well.

If there was also upper body hazard detection that would be cool.  Hey in an ideal world add gps for outdoor nav and beacon detection for indoor nav.  Blindsquare is an app that most of this but a dedicated device might be good.  Imagine if your university building had beacons describing the surroundings.  They could be used by blind and partially sighted people but may also be used by visitors and conference goers to find their way around an unfamiliar space by advertising a specific app to download on their iPhone or Android phone.

Here is one article about beacons.

I agree with what everyone has said here. Sometimes I get really down because of what I can no longer do. It is frustrating and it can be infuriating. Depending on others is one of the most difficult things for me. It makes me feel like a burden. I tell myself that I am not a burden, I am doing other people a favor by depending on them. By helping me they have the opportunity to shine and be a better person than they might be normally and shame on them if they squander that opportunity. Lol

Being accepting and kind to yourself, learning how to advocate for yourself, reaching out for help, and finding the humor in your situation have been the things that have helped me most. I’ll give you an example.

I was in a college class and all the classrooms look the same. I went to the restroom and came back. When I walked in it seemed like the professor had started a powerpoint, but the room wasn’t dark, just quiet. I started down the aisle to my seat and when i turned to enter my row there was a persn in it!! I was in the wrong classroom!!! Before anyone said anything I called out, “Hello, is there anyone in here?” Lol not really. I just turned around and walked out, but when i tell the story to my friends i called out. Funnier that way lol in actuality no one said anything. I had my cane with me so they knew i was visually impaired. In the past I would have beat myself up about making that mistake and creating a spectacle. Now I can find the humor in it. When I share the story my friends come back with their own stories about mistaken classrooms and I realized that sighted people make their own stupid mistakes, it’s not a blind thing it’s a human thing.

Just be patient and more than anything kind to yourself. Try not to compare yourself to your old sighted self it’s completely new terrain and there’s a learning curve.

The vibrations take an extra half second, but for me it is much more accurate then a braille watch. However, the method for getting the Apple watch to vibrate is not perfect and it will sometimes cause the watch to start yelling at you. If I was going to where the Apple watch and use it as a watch I might either turn Voice over all the way down, or just turn it off and use a third-party app called time buzz.

I learnt how to write and read braille, grade 1 and a little of grade 2, but I had to teach myself how to use screen reading software and got bullied quite a lot.
