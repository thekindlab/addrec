So after pairing is first set up, and the battery is charged, you don‘t even need to use the button. I almost never do. As soon as I open it up it connects to my phone automatically fairly reliably.

My vision isn't as bad as your student, but I hope I can be of help. 

The other posters have covered the stimuli used in the curriculum, but do you know what assistive technology your school has access to? If she isn't completely blind, would using a device known as a CCTV to enlarge text and images help? Contact the publisher of the textbook you use and ask them if they can convert/have a copy in braille.

My history teacher liked to put walls of microscopic text on her lecture slides that I couldn't see despite sitting in the front row. But it wasn't a problem for me because she read everything out loud. I resorted to listening to the lecture and writing down everything she spoke out loud instead of trying to read the lecture slide. Please be very descriptive about everything. 

I used a large print copy of the American Pageant textbook. It was the bane of my existence and took up the entire bottom row on my history teacher's bookshelf since it was bound into 8 separate volumes.

Is this the student's first time taking an AP class? You didn't say what grade she is in. 

I would also keep in mind having to arrange testing accommodations for the AP exam, if she hasn't done so already. There are detailed instructions on the College Board's Services For Students With Disabilities website. Keep in mind that you have to request accommodations at least 6 weeks in advance of the exam, and that's if everything goes smoothly. The AP exam, if ordered in an alternate format (mine was large print and I had a large block answer sheet, for example) has to be ordered separately from the rest of the school's shipment and also comes in a separate box. If testing accommodations are required, please remind whomever it may concern that a Nonstandard Administration Report (NAR) has to be filled out for every SAT and AP exam taken. The special education director at my high school did not know he had to do that and so my AP exam scores were delayed for a month one year. 

If she hasn't taken the SAT yet, I'd suggest getting accommodations for that ASAP because once granted, accommodations can be used on all College Board tests (PSAT, SAT, AP). I applied for accommodations through the College Board before I took the SAT, and I was given an ID number that I simply entered each time I signed up to take the the SAT, as well as when I registered for AP exams in the future.

Whoever is in charge of services for students with disabilities at your school should know how to request accommodations through the College Board (unfortunately I had to walk the special education director at my high school through what to do). And whoever is in charge of coordinating testing needs to know about the AP exams that need to be ordered in an alternate format well in advance of the ordering deadline so they arrive in time (my high school's testing coordinator was very familiar with me by senior year).

My heart goes out to you. I took 7 AP classes and 10 AP exams (self studied 3 classes) and many of my AP teachers were...taken aback, I suppose. 

They accommodated my needs well and enlarged my papers and read aloud or handwrote things down that I couldn't see for myself and were always more than willing to help me.

However, I was always surprised by how many of my teachers admitted that they never had ever had a visually impaired student in their AP class before. I vividly remember when I asked my AP Biology teacher if she knew anything about getting testing accommodation on the AP exam, she told me that in her 20 years of teaching AP Biology, I was her first visually impaired student and apologized for not being able to help me much.

I was very surprised and slightly put off by those comments. Not that it's a negative thing, but I was simply surprised by the fact that more visually impaired students do not take AP classes. Everyone praises me for it, but sometimes I wish I wasn't so alone. 

Best of luck to you. I know things are stressful with AP World History, especially given the course redesign this year, but I believe in you.

Practice it until you can walk yourself through the steps front and back in your head. Internalize a rhythm for it.

The big difference is that you don't need any web connection to use Orcam, you can use it everywhere my father reads books while traveling overseas or even on the plain. Secondly, it is much more comfortable, it operates by simple hand gestures, think about how easy it is to read the book when the only thing you need to do is point at the page you want to read.

As parents have to fight the school for materials, and keep on top of them, but it'<REDDIT_NAME> doable and I think it'<REDDIT_NAME> important. You can not ignore reality and hide amongst the blind. Kids can be mean, they don't understand, but adults don't either.  By shunning the issue it'<REDDIT_NAME> not going to help. You have to be assertive (not aggressive) as a  a blind person if you want to get anywhere. Help her understand advocating for herself. Regular school is absolutely possible, there is so much tech. Everything from audio equipment to braille screens to braille materials. I whent through public school, and am studying for a political science degree some say it'<REDDIT_NAME> one of the hardest. I am doing fine. I've done a lot of  school and it'<REDDIT_NAME> absolutely possible. Yes, have her learn braille and a screen reader.

Fearless is good. So was I, I was featureed in the blind organization magazine because I was unafraid to go surf. They asked to wanted to go  surf. None of us had, everyone took two steps back and didn't go. I said that I would. I've done many things that people are shocked by. I've been called brave and courageous. I travel around the two counties where I live <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> and have crafted a foursquare page of good places. I know <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> well.

I am blind and have done everything from living alone, to that surfing trip, to water skiing, to running and winnning student body president, to getting a aa degree in creative writing, !running around as a student journalist interviewing people and then to passing out the papers it was my idea to the site students just put it on the racks and gave it to their friends, to traveling around many counties and cities, to many many other interesting things including getting on the computer and leading and forming a writing workshop and running it. Yeah, you try telling me to stop. I'll sho you by the grace of God I can achieve and do anything.  I may be blind but I don't act disabled. I absolutely dislike acting that way.

As to your phone voiceover works phenomenally if you can learn how to use it, mostly of course, I’ve found a few minor hiccups, but nothing to effect daily use unless you were a student trying to. Sight out of ibooks. Or something like this. You don’t even have to work off of a screen, but for this to work you’ll have to learn some extra stuff. I work a lot off of a bluetooth keyboard with the phone, especially typing long explanations like this. The keyboard and iphone screen. Itself are both excellently accessible. I say the iphone is much more accessible than the android. Apple has done such a great job at designing this screen reader and it cost just about zilch dollars after you buy the unit. In my experience apple devices last a while. The mac is a good choice. I have a 4 years old computer and it is like I just purchased it yesterday. I mean the screen is a bit dusty the unit has been here but the workings is still great. My friend has my 6 years old or nearly that macbook pro I bought for 1500 I believe but it’s 2018 and the mid 2012 model still works like it was new!

What I suggest is to have her learn adapting strategies and be quick on her feet to change. Have her brainstorm creative and interest adaptations with you will be helpful. Something I've always  been able to do. Let her try different experiences without holding back, even things you think a blind person couldn't do. If it directly requires vision, maybe not, but we can do most anything. Be positive and don't give up. Have her be able to be open and verbally  able to share her perspectives on things, and be open to questions about her blindness. Do not be sensitive about this. The more open the better. As a blind person you are always the teacher about what blindness is. Teach her to be open to asking for help and there is nothing wrong with it if appropriate.

Just maybe? Maybe that’s logical? I felt sorry for the kid, but I also needed to talk to her mother, my professor. I was also younger and didn’t know how to mediate the situation. I was 19 I think? Maybe 20. The kid wanted the candy bar badly. Hahaha! She also once showed up late. About half an hour. After 15 minutes all the students left. I was actually late that day slowly lugging up my breakfast. I had woken up and got breakfast and it was a full lowed. I did this just to get to class. I wasn’t going to lug it back down, no sir.

I enjoy learning alright. I call myself nerdy/academic. I would stay and teach but you need a doctorate or masters at least for teaching post-secondary here. At a two year community college you need at least a masters but a four year unless you were some sort of low level lecturer which is a bit difficult to find work for academia is hard to get in to under a doctorate. Master seems fine but I hope I have the money and stuff or aptitude scores. I have a good mind, but for apptitude testing, I am quite horrible at. Normally tests are fine but those state apptitude tests are not my thing. I also have a feeling I wouldn’t score all that well on an IQ test. I am just not a good test taker in that regard. Normal testing as mentioned from courses are fine.

Yeah, Plato is fun, I prefer socratic stuff or aristotle. I like the enlightenement philosophers though. I also like people like scenica. Boetheus is fine. Kant is interesting. Plato is good, I just don’t agree. I like philosophy in general. I don’t agree with confucius but I believe I’ve read the entire analects and those are interesting. Haven’t gotten around to read mencius though. You give me anything with theory or requiring thinking and I am interested as long as it’s not mystical, I’ve been in to a bit of this until I realized I was in to it and in the wrong thing. I am a Christian and don’t agree with spiritual mystical teachings that’s not Christian. I was in to Jungian theory for a bit. In Jung I am an NT ENTJ as my name says. I score pretty high on proper big five tests when it comes to openness. I may not agree but I’ll give your idea a listen. No guarantee of no argument against your ideas if my own views don’t match. But something people don’t understand with me, argument or disagreement does not mean not open to it.

442,"Cheers! Glad there's more of us, I think you're the first blind player that has personally shared the games they've played / like playing. I've mostly been seeing comments like ""I have a blind friend and we play X'. 

I agree, cooperative games with open information are great for blind players. I'm currently trying to decide what my next game is going to be, so many good choices out there. I'm torn between **Burgle Bros**, a coop heist game, and **Dice Forge**, a competitive dice game where you can upgrade your dice faces as you play to win more resources/victory points. 

As for bluffing games, yes, you are at a disadvantage by not seeing their facial expressions, but I've found that I can pick up someone is lying by the changes in their voice :) But, in games like Secret Hitler or Resistance: Avalon, it doesn't matter too much that you can't see their face, you get a lot of information about other players from the moves they make in the game. 

I read that Power Grid can also be plpayed by blind players, and I really wanted to buy that game, but I'm not sure the people I play with would be into it as they are mostly casual gamers. But it might be something that your family/friends might be interested in, so check it out. The game is 'algorithmic' and it has no hidden information, so should be playable once you understand the rules. 

As for card games, those are usually a bit harad for blind players. I know there are people that use braille labels on the cards, but that's not an option for us who don't know braille. I've been thinking of a solution with QR codes, and a smartphone app that will read the cards for you through headphones, but I havaen't tested that out yet.

You can choose pink for the grip, the tip and even the shaft if you so wish. Many people are surprised to find the colours don't mean as much as people think. There actually is no standard for white canes around the world (in Russian, they are usually black. In poorer countries, they take what gets donated, which leads to an interesting mish-mash). While white is the most recognizable, you can pick whatever you want that gets the job done (for safety to prevent impacts). Using a non-standard colour would make people less likely to recognize it, though.

There are two primary reasons why people have trouble seeing at night (although there can be many more). The most common one is the pupil has trouble regulating how much light goes into the eye, and the retina doesn't get enough (or too much, which can be why some lights are blinding at night). The other is the rods in the eye are damaged, and they are more sensitive to lower light conditions. When that happens, the retina itself isn't able to receive the light. 

You should talk to your doctor about the night blindness issue, they would have more knowledge of your medical history and (hopefully) explain it a little more.

http://www.secondsight.com/g-the-argus-ii-prosthesis-system-pf-en.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_retinal_prosthesis

The system implants 60 electrodes into the eye, which connect to the retina. The camera is mounted onto a pair of glasses, which sends the picture to a processing unit (larger than a cell phone, but not too much), which send the signal back to the glasses. The glasses has a transmitter mounted to the side, which sends the signal to the implant in the eye.

For someone who is blind their entire life, it is hard to describe how low resolution those 60 electrodes are. When I described it to a family member for someone who was getting it, I described it like an old TV from the 30s... but much worse. 

No options for the glasses as far as I know.

It is now more openly available, if you have the money. Last I heard, it cost $150,000 USD, including the surgery. Not sure if the price has gone down. As far as I know, no medical benefit program covers it, it is still considered too experimental. I remind my clients who are thinking about it, that they are literally guinea pigs for this kind of thing.

For reading.... Of the two clients I've worked with who have had it, none of them were able to read. In theory, it is a possibility, but maybe two or three letters at a time. They were more able to see strong contrast (white sidewalk against darker grass background) and follow the line.

The Argus II is the first step in bionic replacements for eyes... but in terms of functionality, it is like a hook hand from the 1400's. It can do SOME things, but there is a lot it can't do.

I've been very part-time with them since February of 2016 and am potentially going full-time with them in the next few months as their Accessibility Specialist, making the app and site work for us and people with other disabilities, advocating and evangelizing for accessibility across all aspects of the company, and attending trade shows like NFB. I also contract with the Internet Archive and with Center for Accessible Technology for website testing. 

I learned a lot doing research studies and attending focus groups at the Lighthouse, networking with all the companies coming in with their apps for testing and drew back to my 4 years of product QA and tech support to help communicate clearly with their dev teams. It'<REDDIT_NAME> one thing to say something is broken, and another entirely when you can explain how it'<REDDIT_NAME> broken and how to fix it. 

This has been a major 180 degree life change for me as I used to be an animator and VFX artist before losing my sight. The QA I used to do was for animation and graphics technology, but those testing procedures carried over to the testing I do now.  Join meetup groups, attend conferences, learn all you can about accessibility, learn how to speak out and up when advocating, and be persistent. You have to make your own jobs and make companies know that they need help in that sphere when it comes to what I do, so take that into consideration if you decide to go the tech route.

I am biased, but I'll always take Lyft over uber any day. I cannot support uber in any way due to their horrible business practices and the way they treat their drivers.

- It's free

- It's on every Windows PC by default. This is very important for me as I can invariably end up using anywhere between 2 and 5 different computers a day (personal laptop, personal PC and when I was working I would use a couple of different machines depending on the task). I know ZT has a USB version (it's the one I had when I was using it) but even with this it's less than convenient if you're regularly switching machine.

- Windows Magnifier is a lightweight program. I found ZT to be a bit of a resource hog. It may have improved in recent years (last version I had was 9) but Windows Magnifier sits nicely in the background and doesn't require any startup time.

- ZT 9 didn't support multiple monitors. You could only magnify your main display. Secondary displays were left unusable. Windows Mag's support for multiple monitors isn't ideal either, and maybe ZT has added support now, I don't know.

- Finally, I think the main thing I like (or at least *liked* before Microsoft made a mess of it) is that it literally has the two features I need, nothing more, nothing less. Zooming in and out and inverting colours is all I need really. It's hard to justify the price of ZT for me because I know I won't use most of the features. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure ZT's features are invaluable to some people, I'd never say ZT is bad software or anything. It's just my use case means Windows Mag is more suitable.

Anyway, as way of a wrap up. I've actually found a work around for the broken invert colours shortcut a few days ago while digging through settings. Windows has an option to overlay a filter on the screen that you can activate with a shortcut. There's an inverted colours filter. So now I can just toggle the filter on and off for inverted colours. It's still immensely aggravating that I'm resorting to a workaround rather than the designed functionality, but for now at least I can go back to using Windows Mag.

- Windows Magnifier is a lightweight program. I found ZT to be a bit of a resource hog. It may have improved in recent years (last version I had was 9) but Windows Magnifier sits nicely in the background and doesn't require any startup time.

- ZT 9 didn't support multiple monitors. You could only magnify your main display. Secondary displays were left unusable. Windows Mag'<REDDIT_NAME> support for multiple monitors isn't ideal either, and maybe <PERSON> has added support now, I don't know.

- Finally, I think the main thing I like (or at least *liked* before Microsoft made a mess of it) is that it literally has the two features I need, nothing more, nothing less. Zooming in and out and inverting colours is all I need really. It'<REDDIT_NAME> hard to justify the price of ZT for me because I know I won't use most of the features. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure <PERSON>'<REDDIT_NAME> features are invaluable to some people, I'd never say <PERSON> is bad software or anything. It'<REDDIT_NAME> just my use case means Windows Mag is more suitable.

Anyway, as way of a wrap up. I've actually found a work around for the broken invert colours shortcut a few days ago while digging through settings. Windows has an option to overlay a filter on the screen that you can activate with a shortcut. There'<REDDIT_NAME> an inverted colours filter. So now I can just toggle the filter on and off for inverted colours. It'<REDDIT_NAME> still immensely aggravating that I'm resorting to a workaround rather than the designed functionality, but for now at least I can go back to using Windows Mag.

The Bionic eyes in pre-clinical trials now are already outdated, it is not going to be a situation where we slowly progress to better models.

&amp;#x200B;

What's going to happen is that in 2025, Bionic eyes that are able to resolve at a much higher resolution that humanly possible are going to reach the market and immediately render the Diamond Eye outdated on arrival.

At that point it's going to be another 5 years until the average/fortunate person can get true acuity bionics.

The more damaged an organ is, the harder it will be to regenerate and in the case of the Eye we want it as close to undamaged as possible, if regions of the retina have died but are relatively undamaged regenerating it with basic regenerative therapy will be possible earlier than healing something that has been deeply sliced for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone junk an eye with prototype technology?

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the eye is useless it may still be salvaged as an interface, but to do this repeatedly is a no-go for a lot of reasons it should be something that happens just ONE time.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, you're right I do have a clearly defined preference because doing it this way with an algorithm is equivalent to using a 2000-5000 electrode implant.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone use a 240 electrode implant that will junk an eye and then make them ineligible for the massive upgrades we will see within the next 10 years as well as the complications that may come with needing regenerative procedures as we still can't make an optic nerve and if that's damaged then all retinal implants are for the people who are afflicted by this condition, for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all electrodes may connect and the surface area may change over time too, so you will ALWAYS end up with a much lower number of electrodes than the device actually has.

&amp;#x200B;

Bionics cannot advance until restorative technology does in some sense.

&amp;#x200B;

An advert would be if I linked to Argus 2 and then how to find a place to have it installed, you're aware it costs $150,000 right?

&amp;#x200B;

This low-resolution piece of shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be bias if I only linked to Argus 2 or would it just be the only thing I could talk about since it's the ONLY option in the US presently as far as retinal implants go.

&amp;#x200B;

Encoding visual data and relaying it through another sense absolutely destroys Argus 2 in every sense, it is not even a fucking competition and this is still in it's infancy, with refinement we will be able to induce HD hallucinations that perfectly correspond to the encoded image but this will take a lot longer if people aren't aware this is being done!

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone junk an eye with prototype technology?

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the eye is useless it may still be salvaged as an interface, but to do this repeatedly is a no-go for a lot of reasons it should be something that happens just ONE time.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, you're right I do have a clearly defined preference because doing it this way with an algorithm is equivalent to using a 2000-5000 electrode implant.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone use a 240 electrode implant that will junk an eye and then make them ineligible for the massive upgrades we will see within the next 10 years as well as the complications that may come with needing regenerative procedures as we still can't make an optic nerve and if that'<REDDIT_NAME> damaged then all retinal implants are for the people who are afflicted by this condition, for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all electrodes may connect and the surface area may change over time too, so you will ALWAYS end up with a much lower number of electrodes than the device actually has.

&amp;#x200B;

Bionics cannot advance until restorative technology does in some sense.

&amp;#x200B;

An advert would be if I linked to Argus 2 and then how to find a place to have it installed, you're aware it costs $150,000 right?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be bias if I only linked to Argus 2 or would it just be the only thing I could talk about since it'<REDDIT_NAME> the ONLY option in the <LOCATION> presently as far as retinal implants go.

&amp;#x200B;

Encoding visual data and relaying it through another sense absolutely destroys Argus 2 in every sense, it is not even a fucking competition and this is still in it'<REDDIT_NAME> infancy, with refinement we will be able to induce HD hallucinations that perfectly correspond to the encoded image but this will take a lot longer if people aren't aware this is being done!

&amp;#x200B;

What I want is for more people to understand this is possible, to attract people who may have the talent to create refinements to it and also to let people know there is actually other work being done in other directions should they have severed or damaged optic nerves.

&amp;#x200B;

For people to know that the prototype for this kind of technology exists right now and not in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

If we can determine better or more improved ways to encode visual information we can increase the visual resolution that this kind of technology can deliver to people.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, the resolution is very low but still usable in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of an improvement would be to determine tonal frequencies that are inaudible but will still be perceived by the brain, and how finely the brain can discriminate between frequencies barring pattern interference by other sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Can the brain use a frequency of 200.0-200.X to relay information or is the degree of difference too fine the brain to parse?

&amp;#x200B;

If we can determine this, we can ride the finest line, and reduce this interface to something barely worn.

&amp;#x200B;

If consciously hearing it isn't required as we expect, then it should be possible to transmit data at a much greater speed, determining the transmission speed as well as whether a conscious or subconscious implementation is most beneficial is also valuable data.

&amp;#x200B;

Things like this need to be explored so this can be streamlined, we have also understood humans can derive spatial awareness from the return of a fixed sound emanated at what we can call the center of perception.

I’d check out [AFB’s directory of services](http://www.afb.org/directory.aspx?action=browse) and see if she’s interested in engaging services in the blindness community. 

There are 4 types of certified therapists for adults with vision loss. Low Vision Therapist (help maximize use of functional vision), Vision Rehab Therapists (teach daily living skills), Orientation and Mobility Specialists (teach using long mobility cane and how to move safely and independently in familiar and unfamiliar environments), and Assistive Technology Instructional Specialists.

how do you think blind people who hear this feel? we're amazing just because we get up in the morning and live our lives? All most of us want is to be taken seriously and to live our lives. We're not amazing. we're not brave. we're not inspirational: we're just people.

Grief is understandable. It would be weird if you didn't have it after such a life change.

I myself am totally blind and have a good job, a wonderful wife, and an awesome child.
None of this stuff comes overnight, and you will face some challenges that are unique to you among your group of friends and family, but blindness is not a death sentence.
Now for some practical advice.
1: exercise. If you feel like you've lost confidence in your body or your ability to move, exercise can make this better. not only does it release feel good chemicals into your brain, it can give you a lot of confidence in your body and in your ability to physically affect the world around you.
2: learn braille! Audiobooks are great, but its really important to be able to read. Even if you only use it for signs on doors and the menu at cracker barrel, learn braille.
3: don't ever not do a thing because you're blind: DO chores, learn to cook if you can't already, and do all you can to be self-sufficient.
4: Even if its not in your nature right now, learn to say no. While its important to be able to ask for help, also know how to refuse it. You know your own abilities better than anyone else, and its ok to make that clear. If you need help, that is totally ok, but letting people know you don't want to be touched, guided, coddled, or overhelped is more than ok, its mandatory.
You are gonna do fine and you have a lot of good things ahead of you.

He had to have a breathing tube put in and the main focus was to get him stabilized. At this point the doctors didnt give a shit about his toe and his infection progressed. Once he was stable they decided to amputate half his foot (all his toes) but the infection was to far up and they amputated to below the knee. Now while all of this is going on(2 months total) he was supposed to be getting his functioning eye(1 eye was already a goner) cleaned by a specialist every other week to prevent his vision from getting worse but no matter how much we tried noone listened and it took a back seat. When he was released from the hospital they sent him to a rehab place for a week and then he was home. At the rehab center he was pumped with painkillers and he doesnt even remember that week he spent there or most of his hospital stay for that matter. This year he had to begin dyalisis for his kidneys which turned out to be a blessing in disguise because now he HAS to get out of the house 3 times a week for hours at a time and he is starting to make friends at the dyalisis center and it seems like he looks forward to it even though he feels like shit after.

If you mean purely tactile Morse feedback without a braille display or any audio, yes, currently it's just a vibrotactile ""bump"" when the finger encounters a target area. The question is what extra utility this would offer, given the reasons u/AllHarlowsEve mentioned in this thread that a combo of braille display and/or VoiceOver is richer, faster, and as externally quiet as you need it to be. If you could code up an extension to that OS behavior where each ""bump"" becomes a morse code character string, it might interest some users. Conceivably deaf-blind users could find utility in something like a [fancier version of this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wbouvy.vibrationcontrol&amp;hl=en_US), since VoiceOver is unavailable to people who can't her it. You would still have to make the case that the impoverished information stream is worth encoding in the tactile feedback. And because accessible design has a way of ultimately benefiting everyone, busy sighted phone users might like having more granular control over tactile feedback.

906,"So, this is something I have put a lot of thought into and had to deal with a lot back in the day. I went to a university in the deep south, and I was weekly approached on the streets by students who wanted to pray over me and heal me; no joke, I once had two separate students approach me during one 15-minute walk.

Before I get into my thoughts I just want to say that, for the most part, I am not talking about people who forcibly grab you. It is probably going to be best to just politely say no to such people and keep moving. Most of the faith healers who have approached me have been polite and have not touched me without asking. Also, what I’m about to suggest might not be an option for you, depending on your own religious background and what you’re comfortable with.

Now with all of that out of the way, here are my thoughts. For the longest time I responded with hostility and dismissiveness whenever people wanted to pray over me and “heal” my blindness. I do not believe in “faith healing” and I personally find the whole concept insulting and ableist. However, after one particularly nasty interaction I had with a well-meaning student, in which I know I hurt their feelings, I began to question my approach.

For one thing, I realized I was doing nothing to help explain to the faith healer how I felt about what they were trying to do. I don’t personally have an issue with someone praying for my general well-being, or for something other than blindness. For example, if I was working with a classmate on a group project and I complained about being overwhelmed with course work, I would not have a problem with that classmate saying they would say a prayer for me. When I stopped by the coffee house and chatted with the barista, complaining that I had a cold, I was fine if they said a quick prayer for my cold. Do I think these prayers do anything? I don’t know and that is beside the point. For me, the point is I personally have no moral objection to these kinds of prayers and in social situations I consider it a kind gesture when a Buddhist/Muslim/Christian/Hindu prays for me in an appropriate way; yes, I have received prayers from members of all of these faith groups, and for me it is pretty equivalent to when someone says they will be thinking about me. Of course, these kinds of exchanges normally happened with people I know, not total strangers on the street, but for me, it’s definitely the blindness healing aspect of the prayer that really bothers me. If a friend asked to pray about my blindness I would be hurt, but I would try to explain to them why.

So, I decided to try and make this delineation for faith healers I met on the street. I soon got my chance as I was rushing to a final exam that I was not feeling great about. A student came up behind me and started asking if he could say a prayer over me. I kept walking, annoyed for a moment, about the request and also that I was in a hurry, but then I remembered the new tact I wanted to try. So, without slowing down I began to ask him what specifically he wanted to pray about. He said he wanted to pray for me to be healed. I told him that I did not want him to pray about that, but I went on to explain that I was on my way to a test, that I was not feeling good about the test, and that if he wanted to pray about something that would help me I would appreciate his prayers for that. He started chuckling as he tried to keep up with me, at first taken aback, I think, but he said ok. So, when we got to a red light he said a quick prayer for me. When he was done I asked him what issue he had at the moment. He said something, I believe it was also school related, so I quickly said a prayer for him and his issue, and then I went on my way.

This experience was so much more positive then any I had previously had with faith healer types. I thought there was a small chance that the nuances of my issues and feelings about the topic may have come across better than when I had simply told people no. What is more, the interaction felt much more equitable then previous exchanges. When someone wants to “heal” you it implies that you’re the one with the issue and they are the one with the solution. As we were standing waiting for that red light we were both students, equals, worried about our course work, and we were both offering each other comfort.

I went on to use this approach for everyone who wanted to pray over me while I was at the university. I probably had the opportunity to do this at least six more times and every time the interaction went as well as the first one. Of course, this is just my own personal evolution on the topic. I don’t expect that everyone will be comfortable with this approach, especially praying for other people yourself. Maybe aspects of my experience will be helpful to others, maybe not. Whatever you decide to do I do firmly believe it is important for each of us to explore our reactions to things, and to consider when those reactions might not be appropriate. Above all, our default should always be politeness, weather or not our eye balls work.",,False,,EndlessReverberation,,,1534872224,t5_2qpec,t3_987587,t3_987587,1,1537778292,0,0,e4kyfg3,Blind,,,,"So, this is something I have put a lot of thought into and had to deal with a lot back in the day.

However, I'm always pulling out my phone and using it while I'm walking around, riding on the public bus, etc. and I would think the dummies that yelled at you may have said the same thing to me, especially if they were just quickly driving past. Most people are ignorant about blindness/low-vision which is understandable since we are a small minority and most people will have never had the chance to get to know someone with vision loss; however, most people realize they are ignorant  so they have enough since to learn and not yell out things like that.
