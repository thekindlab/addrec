8,"Very cool article. That has been an issue my coworkers and I have discussed a few times. While the remote assistance is great, we've found that some people become too reliant on it and start to lose basic skills. Instead of learning a good organization system for their canned soups (or whatever groceries), they get used to just FaceTiming their family members and have them look through the camera. That's all fine and good in an optimal situation, but that doesn't always work. What happens if you need to locate something at 3 AM? Call your family and wake them up?

The other issue is about privacy, which has become a big deal in light of what some organizations have been doing. Some people don't like using those systems to access their banking or taxes, but that may be the only choice they have.

9,"Thanks for the service! I'm in San Francisco and have been a really vocal supporter of Instacart along with giving you guys constant accessibility feedback. Had a pretty long thread going just a few years ago with some of your support personnel about it. Ultimately, the info pages for individual items could use some help as the information there is usually garbled when VoiceOver tries reading it back or is missing/consistent. Always seems like the touch areas for related items keeps trying to overtake attention from the item description and info, and the controls for adding the item to the cart is too small and sometimes hard to find with the rest of the interface fighting for attention. 

The chat and messaging interface works for the most part, but with the nature of having to listen to my screen reader in order to interact with the chat, a common occurrence is to have the shopper make a change, get the wrong thing, and by the time I've heard it and written a message, they are already in checkout and I get stuck working with support for the items I didn't want. This happens even with substitutions set. The best thing to do is to bring in an end-user and observe how we use the app first-hand. Writing out feedback is one thing, but if you have no one on your staff familiar with accessible technology, you won't be able to adequately test for accessibility and leave those bugs for us to find and struggle with in production. 

I would ask for more consistency with product labeling, as sometimes identical items show up in the browsing lists but worded in different ways making the shopping confusing.  Fixing the item descriptions would go a long way to solve this. O additional major problem is the way you handle the delivery scheduling time controls. It is Always a struggle to pick the correct date and time for delivery as it is a custom control. Changing that to a standard iOS control would be ideal rather than you trying to handle it programmatically with a custom control. Tapping on the time sometimes brings up the date, and vice-versa. Choosing a time that seems to be available results in the confirmation button remaining dim, making me go back to the scheduling pop-ups only to find that nothing I chose was actually set.

Individuals can be trained, but they can also just be busy or not paying attention. I've had people run into my clients because they were busy on their phone. 

Infrastructure can be improved to make traveling easier, but when a place is filled to max capacity, it doesn't matter if a person can't find the adapted sections. For example, the subway in Toronto has tactile markers that a cane user can use to follow to get to stairs, escalators, etc. But if people are standing on them and not moving, then that becomes much more difficult to use.

For technology, some locations are starting to use iBeacons now to help navigate. However, they are imprecise at best, and downright confusing at worst.

15,"I agree with everyone that you shouldn't give up on your dreams and that you should definitely continue to pursue a career that your passionate about. That being said, I think it's really smart that you're planning ahead for a career that could provide you with longevity and adapt to you as much as you will have to adapt to it given the eventual loss of both senses. 

The careers that you mentioned seem like great options because they'd allow you the flexibility to work with clients/ students and/ or focus on research while still getting to learn about things you're interested in! 

 As you're starting to choose your career one thing that might be helpful is to do some job shadowing for each of the feild you're interested in. That way you can experience what it would be like to have that job. and really see if its something you're interested in and and get a feel for which areas of the career you might need accommodations in and start to plan for that.  Another thing that might be helpful is reaching out to professors whose careers are similar to the ones you want, to talk about their experience in the field. You could also do some research on graduate programs as that can provide you withsome insight on what to expect from a career. Also consider talking to your campus disability centre and career center they might be good resources for talking about how you can make these careers work for you. 

It won't always be easy and sometimes you'll have to get creative but keep pursuing what you're passionate about! Good luck!

66,"Hi,

I test web accessibility for a university and I am also a screen reader user.
My observations are below; I'm sorry if these come off as a little brusk; I only had a few moments, during a break, to look at the site and write out my first thoughts.

You should make it clear that the user is looking for the “Found me” link. A screen reader user might not realize this link is at the bottom of the profile page; When I first found the proper profile page I did not read the contents of the page because I assumed I had found what I was looking for.
You should either not use the word “button” or change the web elements you’re talking about into buttons, instead of links. When using a screen reader, you can hit the “B” key to jump to each button on a web page; however, the elements you refer to as “buttons” show up as links, not buttons, so a screen reader user may hit “B” to go to the “buttons” in question, only to realize there are no buttons on the page.
To me, the process of having to click the “previous” and “next” links 13 times for “Website A - Version 2” is needlessly tedious, and does not represent many, if any, real-world situations; I got tired of hitting “next” very quickly and just started changing the number at the end of your URL, which I found to be the only reasonable method of completing the task; I do not expect too many users to use my method of reverse-engineering your URL, but I think many will get tired of hitting the “next” link.
For “Website C” it looks like you have both the “Male” and “Female” labels associated with the first radio button, and no label for the second button. The same issue is present with the “USA Canada Australia” question.

These are just my own observations, accessibility is not always black and white, some things are a matter of opinion, so do whatever you think is best with my observations.

Good luck with your study,",,,,EndlessReverberation,,,1520361373,t5_2qpec,t3_82ckl9,t3_82ckl9,1,1524882179,0,0,dva1kpa,Blind,,,,,

73,"I feel your pain. I also record every class with the intention of listening back to them to take notes on what's relevant. And I will also take notes during class, but this gets messy  because I don't listen as I am typing because it is distracting.  Ultimately, I would love to be able to record and type in keywords that are time stamped to the recording. The way I imagined this working is to develop an extension to an existing word processor such as Microsoft word or Google docs. When the extension would be turned on and recording,  the return key can have dual functions,  One will be The normal function of a new line, and the other function will be to make a timestamp to the recording. And to the left of each line there can be a play button to start the play back from that position in your notes.. this way all you need to do is type in a keyword and hit enter. Later you can search for those keywords to listen  back from there  obviously, this is easier said than done and I have zero programming experience, so it would be up to someone else or up to me learning how to program.. and if anyone out there would be into a project like this, I would love to collaborate and contribute what I can.

80,"I am fairly new here.   Regardless, I will give my opinion.  I do find the large number of surveys off putting. 

I don't think curiosity is a problem.  However, there do seem to be a lot of surveys.  Most of these surveys are not rigorous academic research that will lead to anything more than fulfilment of undergraduate course requirements.  I wish they would do a little more background research before they ask questions but that is just not going to happen.  Undergrad research is not about the quality of research but basic concepts of what research is and is not.  That’s okay too.  It may develop a long term interest in research that will lead to something valuable or at least break down stereotypes around blind people.

So far, it sounds like I am supportive of the surveys.  I am not.  I guess I am greedy.  I may not post but I do like to read discussions.  They may be from blind, partially-sighted, o&amp;m instructors, relatives or the general public.  When I read those discussions I get something out of it.  I might learn something.  I might be inspired.  I might laugh.  Regardless, I get something out of it.  I don’t get anything from completing an undergrad survey.  

Personally, I like the idea of placing them all within one thread.  It allows those who feel they want to contribute to a survey look through the possibilities.  It also allows others to avoid the threads if they wish to do so.  Most of the time I will probably avoid them.  There may also be times that I help out with a few.

100,"Yeah, I'm thinking very much in terms of immediate, on-the-spot remediation. Like, I hand someone the card and it helps them give me directions or interact with me _right now_.

So it'd need to be much more direct and pragmatic, and give explicit instructions. The other stuff about educating generally, talking about what it's like to be blind, answering the usual curiosities or misconceptions, etc., is designed to help _them_, not to help _me_, and takes longer both to understand and to internalize. 

If it takes longer than (say) 15 seconds for a sighted person with no prior knowledge to understand and act better as a result of that understanding, it doesn't belong here.

I 1000% agree with the ""approach, ask, assist _if you have consent_"" model. Lack of consent is the core behind pretty much all the sighted fails that feel intrusive or dangerous rather than just lulzworthy.

One of the things on the ""don't _ever_ fucking do this"" list would be e.g. grabbing my arm without my consent, whereas on the ""OK to do this _with my consent_"" list would be e.g. ""touch my forearm with the _back_ of your hand so I can hold on to _your_ arm"".

On a design perspective, I was thinking about having something like this on the back of the card:

* [left third] ""What you see"" [isometric drawing of a complex 2 by 3 block scene, including blind person facing sighted person and an X on the desired destination, omitting the things they don't usually notice, and highlighting &amp; labeling the things that sighted people use for navigation, e.g. street signs, store names, ""logical"" straight, visually striking buildings, the way the sighted person is pointing, etc]
* [middle third] ""What I perceive"" [drawing of the same, omitting sighted cues and highlighting blind-salient cues / waypoints / etc, e.g. curbs, posts, crossings, pavement types, curb cuts, cafe smell zone, tunnels, uncovered areas, grassy shorelines, etc]
* [right third] ""How to give good directions"" [fully written out ideal directions to give based on this scenario]

I think something along those lines might be the best way to give a lot of implicit information about what's useful in an ultra condensed form.

Again, the middle third of this example might not be totally true for everyone using the cards. E.g. someone might actually know the local street names, or that there's a FooMart on the corner, or advanced skills like how to diagonally cross an open plaza area, even though the blind-perspective drawing would indicate that they don't and one shouldn't give instructions based on that.

113,"The only issue I ever have is when I call them with a  problem. They often want details from my last statement for security reasons, before they'll help with anything. Of course, I don't have a paper statement. I could look it up on the phone or computer, but it's difficult to look up the exact amount of a transaction from some particular date, while on the phone with an agent.  It's especially fun if I'm calling because I'm having problems with online banking; then I can't get my statement at all!  This is just a silly and worthless ""security"" procedure.  If someone has stolen my identity, they probably already have access to my banking records anyway, so asking for details about my last statement won't prevent anything. I already have 10 different security questions, a password, and a pin number.  And I'm calling the bank from my registered phone number.  How much security do we need?  By the time I take 3 minutes to look up my last statement, assuming the agent has the patients to wait and doesn't just hang up and tell me I need to have the details for all previous transactions on hand when I call, and give my security answers and contact info and date of birth and other security info, we've spent 10 minutes on security alone! It then generally takes only one or two minutes to solve my actual problem!  

These days, if I need something, I don't bother calling the bank anymore. I just visit a branch in person.  The bank teller swipes my card, I enter my pin, and we're done with security for the entire visit.  If the teller needs to hand me over to a manager, we don't have to redo the entire security procedure again, like we would if I was transferred to a different person on the phone!

Personally speaking, I have a pretty rare (non-ocular) condition that makes me not fit the usual state law definitions very well, but I still need to use a cane. I was unable to get O&amp;M at all in the US. A blind friend of mine gave me a two-day crash course, but other than that I simply had to figure it out for myself.

There are lots of guides online about the general techniques - shorelining, echolocation, two-tap vs constant contact, listening for parallel vs perpendicular traffic, etc.

As someone w/ hearing issues, you'll probably want to focus more on the constant contact and tactile based techniques (e.g. wind, smell, vibration, foot feel, etc) rather than two-tap and sound (e.g. echolocation), especially if your hearing is worse for high pitch sounds.

You can try having a friend come with you while you're training, especially if you do it blindfolded (which I recommend), just to help ensure you don't hurt yourself.

Don't get me wrong; O&amp;M training is great, and you should do it ASAP if you have access. But don't think you have to wait for someone else to come help you. You don't. 

Get a damn cane, get out of the house, and try just walking down the street and back. When you're comfortable with that, figure out the next step you can do, etc.

FWIW, NFB will send you a cane for free if you're in the US. I had an NFB cane for a while. It's... okay. Super light, which is great, but _extremely_ springy, which means it keeps getting stuck in sidewalk cracks and whipping. But it's free and functional and you'll at least start getting a sense of what you want in a cane. 

(Mine is an Ambutech folding graphite, white/red, nose height, bungee hook type, with rolling mushroom tip normally and rolling puck for unpaved areas. I love it and use it every day. Your preferences will vary; there is no one best. Training on something generically workable like the NFB cane is good, so you don't waste money on something before you know what'll work best for you.

I've _very_ recently started getting O&amp;M training in the UK, after 2 years of paperwork / doctors here and with a different legal standard than in the US.

You may also want to experiment with different types of light- lighting your room with lamps instead of overhead lights, using less light, more light, etc.

And, you may want to have either transition lenses or some lenses that have permanent tints to give you some relief.",,,,jogajaja,Sighted- TVI,,1521698296,t5_2qpec,t3_85tuum,t3_85tuum,2,1525457761,0,0,dw3c4s2,Blind,,,blue2,,

150,"I usually don't like them. 

It isn't that I disagree with wanting to collect data from blind people. The primary issues from my perspective are: 

- People coming to the subreddit often see a front page of primarily survey requests, which may misrepresent our nature as primarily a subreddit for the blindness community and those interested. 

- Many ""surveys"" ask essentially the same questions over and over again, and that information is often readily available without a specific survey of our members. 

- Some surveys (or survey-like posts) seem to be posted by people with a commercial interest. That interest should be explicitly stated, but it's impossible for us to be certain in some cases. 

- Surveys almost never have any kind of compensation, and in some cases ask users personal details without the ""researcher"" being willing to provide identifying information about their identity and affiliations. 

- The ""undergraduate student design project"" or ""developer with an idea"" type surveys often seem unlikely to generate meaningful data for the ""researcher."" Often the questions, range of possible answers, and proposed ""solutions"" reflect a total lack of research or any basic understanding of the subject matter.

I think a reasonable compromise would be to automatically post and sticky a weekly survey thread. That way there's not a single megathread with 3000 posts. 

I don't even think it necessarily needs to be strictly moded. If users are given the opportunity and encouragement to use the weekly post, even if some slip through for a time, it should still cut down on them. 

I think that having fewer posts is a fine price if the quality of each post is higher as a result. Perhaps with less of the subreddit devoted to answering questions about revolutionary color identifiers and object detecting canes, people will also feel free to post more. 

I also think we could grow our daily and weekly participation by making themed posts that many subreddits do. Specific topics about blindness, maybe a weekly off topic thread, or themes that users vote on?

On top of the cane’s feedback, people use their hearing, kinesthetic sense, mental mapping, and a lot of concentration to navigate their environments.

172,"Deklevad1234, do you have to do something with a cane for your project? The reason I ask this is because I don't think there is anything useful or new you can do with canes that involves electronics. However, as some people have already mentioned, you might be able to come up with interesting iOS or Android app ideas.

If you are interested in really trying to improve canes for blind people, in a way that might actually help, this would be my only suggestion. Broadly speaking, there are two different styles of long white canes blind people use. The first style consist of one very light tube of fiber glass or other light material; these canes are sometimes called NFB style cains. The other style of cain is made of shorter, thicker tubes that fit together and are held in place by bunjies or some other method; these canes are called folding canes or telescoping canes. There are pros and cons for both of these styles of canes. The NFB canes are lighter, more sensitive, and less prone to cause repetitive stress injuries in the wrist. On the other hand, folding canes are much easier to store, because they fold up. It would be an interesting project to try and come up with a cane that is as light as an NFB style cane, but is able to be stored like a folding cane. One other thought, NFB style canes have tips that are very good for picking up texture changes and making crisp taps for eccho location; however, in my experience, these tips are the week point of NFB canes when it comes to durability. The tips ware out pretty quickly, and the screw piece that holds the tip on the cane has a tendency to fall off.

If some one worked on these problems they might come up with small improvements that could really make a difference, instead of just making some toy they think is interesting.

First, if you're on the checkout screen and you want to choose how to handle out of stock items, it's hard to choose the item to edit because VoiceOver identifies each item by saying the word ""button."" It works perfectly fine if you place the order and then choose replacements, but we aren't able to do it on the checkout screen.

Second, if you've placed an order and then decide that you no longer want an item and set the quantity picker to 0, VoiceOver says that the change quantity button cannot be clicked. Turning off VoiceOver, clicking the button and turning it back on works fine though, so I know that the button is clickable, it's just being incorrectly reported by VoiceOver.

Finally, using the VoiceOver rotor on the cart screen has very unpredictable behavior. For example, if I have an item selected and I swipe down to see what my options are, it may either say that ""remove"" is an option, or it may go ahead and remove the item even though I didn't want it to.

219,"I recorded all my lectures in university, with the best of intentions. Later in the week, I'd listen to them a second time, while transcribing them! It would be a good way to study, and to organize my recordings!  How many times do you think that ever happened?  Hint: if your guess is larger than ""zero"", you're wrong.

The problem with taking notes during the class itself is that keyboards are loud, and if you use speech, you need to have headphones on one ear, and that distracts you from actively listening to the lecture, or participating in the class.  Some universities offer paid note takers to help with this, but mine only offered them to students with physical challenges, not blind students.  

Transcription services are available today, but though I haven't used them much, I don't think they cut it.  What we need is something where we can search the auto generated text transcript, and then play the lecture audio starting from the word or phrase we found.  That way, a blind student while in the class, would only need to note down a list of unique sounding keywords. After class, the student could search for those keywords that seemed important, and make more complete notes from the recording. That would be much less work than having to listen to the entire lecture a second time, so it would be more reasonable to expect that students would actually do it. Also, if portions of the transcript were accurate enough, we could just copy those directly into our class notes.

230,"No problem. I do extremely well, usually in school, unless I am really not good at the subject or something. I know to ask for help when necessary. I think over using the office is a bad idea. When you go in know what you need, they like that, a lot! Don’t go in and say I need help, some help. I don’t know what I need, though. They don’t know either! Hahahaha! They’ll try to help you, but it may not ultimately be the right kind of help. Use the right offices. For example, don’t ask the disability office, hey what should I major in? 

Also, make friends even with staff. You would amazed what that means? Say hi, be friendly. Even if you’re not as social as I am, I feel like most isn’t. On most personality typing test I test high on extroversion. Fine, you aren’t. You could try to be friendly, nice and considerate though. Make good connection. Follow direction, act trust worthy. Stuff I would also advice a sighted student right? Be friendly, with your disability office. When you need to speak up, do so, but be assertive rather than aggressive. Be nice and reasonable when talking to people. Have a voice but don’t insult, demean, or have an attitude. Speak your needs and not wants. Use a ignorant moment to educate and not be flipant. Too many blind people have an attitude when things don’t go the way it’s supposed to or how they want it. I would advice being patient and kind. Just explain it gently. Such as “you may have this notion of things. The situation is such, and this or that method, won’t work because”

I also spend time in the disability office because I go in there semi-often, and just talk to them. Make connection, forge good friendships. I know the entire office. I could virtually walk in there and everyone knows me, and usually very glad to see me. I mean people have their bad/busy day right? So I am accounting for that.

I find that feedback really helps. Try to enumerate for them kindly this is working and this is not working. This is why? If they do something that doesn’t work, I’ve seen some people that just gets mad, turns and be rude, ETC.... Not helpful nor is it kind, and it won’t win you any support.

Learn that you are capable, and you don’t need to be needy. It’s okay to get lost! Be careful, yes. But you don’t need to fear every minute you may get hurt if you get up and try a little or a lot. Adapt and be innovative. For example, I am a student journalist. I work events fine I just need to quickly learn the area or wonder around the area and work it. Then I find a way to get out. I’ve also worked the cafeteria and student lounges. I passed out nearly 200 papers if not that or more. Be ready to make a little of a fool of yourself and don’t be ashamed about it. I have covered the same table twice, just to hear, “yes, you’ve already talked to us, given us the paper.” If I hear it too much maybe moot point, but if I hear once, appologize or explain and move on.

I’ve also worked club fair and shouted for our club and waved a flyer, it was my idea actually. No one thought to do it that way! I also shouted at people, or called out to them when they passed. “Hey, excuse me, are you interested? We are the school newspaper. It’s an interesting program.” Will you make a fool of yourself sometimes, but learn it’s okay. You don’t go the way I do, but my point is try be adaptable, think of your own way. In fact don’t do it my way. 

Be ready to improve and take suggestions. Maybe the disability office think you should do it b way and you’ve always done c way. Try to be considerate, think if you can do it their way, within reason of course, if they don’t want to provide even basic services then no. If it’s reasonable services then maybe the indivudal needs to grow a little. Be flexible, work with the office. Take responsibility for your education.

246,"I have an elderly, completely blind parent I live with, here's what I can suggest.

Victor Reader Stream by Humanware.  It allows access to internet radio (there are even channels for the blind).  It has podcast capability, great for listening to news shows.  It has a service that lets you read newspapers and magazines with a digital voice.  Most importantly, it allows access to NLS BARD -- free audio books for the blind.  Best of all, it does it all over WiFi -- for free.  You just need to get an NLS BARD account, they will help you get that verification of blind status and set you up if you ask.

Amazon Echo is great for playing games and music, if you add a Fire TV, it can serve up Netflix content.  Netflix has a growing library of content with descriptive audio for the blind.  In the future, a growing list of Android TV devices will have Google Assistant  which will quickly overshadow Alexa, hopefully.

Last but not least, an iPhone is essential.  It's ability to be navigated without eyesight is remarkable, although it needs to improve.  For example, it can be difficult to get Siri to read through your text messages.  It is surprisingly easy to read your email and you can do things like banking.  This is very important because having any control over your own life is very important to your well-being.  Just a simple thing like maintaining your contact list and being able to call people just by saying their name is very empowering.

My mother's biggest concerns are being able to feed herself and being able to match her own clothing.  There are iPhone apps that assist by having a person look through your camera and describe what you're looking at, even to the extent of reading labels for you.  I haven't explored them because my mother is not very adept with anything technological since she lost her eyesight before computerized life came along Circa 1990.

It is very important to introduce these things slowly and at a manageable pace, because feeling overwhelmed is something that comes easily when you're blind.  Frustration is an ever-present obstacle to mastering these devices.  By far the most engrossing thing is being able to read books cover to cover whenever you want on demand for free, it helps build an informed and thriving internal life.

250,"I really appreciate these responses - 
My initial aim for this question was just to get maybe some interesting feedback to help me approach my assignment, and understand the current market of study/notation tools available to blind students.

Hearing from you, I genuinely would love to develop a product that helps address these needs.

The needs that you're describing sound very similar to needs that I use software to meet in terms of note taking 
Typical lectures will be conveyed in series of slides, which I print out to my OneNote, and label, organize, and hierachize the slides so that I can find what I need more easily.

In my degree, a lecture might have 70 slides, and a slide might have a plethora of equations, points of information and diagrams- 
Retyping slide contents would be hell, so I tend to add brief annotations, and meaningful titles to the slides.

Am I right in thinking that your needs are analogous in the sense that you'd like to be able to link audio recordings, to section titles, and maybe just briefly take down some key-points within sections?

I have a few more questions, because at the moment, if you're interested in contributing, I'd love to start by understanding your needs.

What do you typically use to make your recordings?
Is it your smart-phone, or does that not cut the mustard and do you prefer speciality gear?

Wherabouts do you study? (Just out of curiousity)

269,"I hope you aren't going permanently blind, but in case you are, here are a few tips:

Allow yourself to grieve. I liken losing your sight to having a part of you die. You have to go through the same emotional roller coaster. Accept it for what it is, even though it will be painful at first. Once you're done grieving, you'll start to want to do the stuff you previously enjoyed. This is where things like vocational rehabilitation and blindness advocacy groups come in. There are varying levels of resources out there for blind job seekers depending on your career path, and if there aren't, try to blaze a trail for others. I'm pretty sure cooking is well covered, though.

Be prepared for people asking the same questions over and over again. Are you really blind? What's that stick for? Do you read braille? etc. These are annoying but well intentioned. you have to be ambassadors for the rest of the blind world. It's a cross we all must bear. 

Similar to the above, people will constantly ask you if you need help, sometimes violating your personal space in the process. The best cure for unwanted assistance, I think, is getting a guide dog. Most will think the dog's got you covered, and the rest will be afraid to approach you--even if you have a golden retriever or labrador. Don't be afraid to ask for or accept help if you really need it though. Everybody needs help from time to time.

It is a bit of an ... intrinsic part of life for a cane user that we routinely commit what would normally be assault, i.e. we hit other people with a stick. But it's kinda necessary to being able to walk around or know that they're there.

Now I'm curious whether this has ever been litigated, e.g. if someone was hurt by a guide cane and sued the cane user or if criminal assault/battery charges were filed. (For normal cane use, that is. If someone who happens to be blind deliberately uses their cane as a weapon, that's a totally different situation.)",,,,saizai,lightblind,,1521204146,t5_2qpec,t3_84h21i,t1_dvs36cz,1,1525229892,0,0,dvsjx6y,Blind,,,blue1,,

319,"To give a bit of background, I'm blind and have been to the programs you're describing. I've also known a few people with residual vision who've trained the NFB way and those who have not.

Quite frankly, those who have been allowed to use their residual vision during training tend to struggle later once they've completed their program. They're less efficient at traveling, reading, and working. They tend to use their vision in ways which may be detrimental to their eye health over time e.g., they'd rather strain their eyes to read a book than use a screen reader.

On a more philosophical level, they tend to struggle with their blindness beyond the usual stressors that all of us face. They either act as though they're in some sort of special club because they're high partials, or they'll dig in their heels and refuse to further their training.

On the other hand, those who've gone through the sleep shade training and happen to have partial vision are far more self-aware. They'll use their residual vision but know when their eyes have had enough. They're much more confident, efficient, and much less likely to look down on their peers who are totals.

But what they didnt see until after the surgery was other damage to her eyes. She also got diagnosed with sleep apnoea and she had a huge amount of carbon dioxide in her blood and spent a while on oxygen in the hospital. She has got a machine now but has panic attacks while trying to use it. Apparently sleep apnoea can cause damage to the eyes.

We were all told that the operation would mean that she wouldnt lose further sight. It was a huge shock that a fortnight later she was blind.

Grieving process makes a lot of sense. That absolutely is what is happening.  I will suggest again that she could talk to someone.  I got the eclo at the hospital to go to her last appt with her and my sister came out very upset because she said it made it seem real.

I suppose it is early days. We have to help her make this huge adjustment.

I don't think it's worth being overly reticent with stuff like ""VI"" etc. Blind isn't a dirty word.

I've found most people have switched to listening to books as opposed to braille for large amounts of material. Audio books is easier, and you can accelerate the reading time (a lot of JAWS/VoiceOver users increase the speed of the voice, up to 2 or 3 times). Additionally, phones and computers can easily play audio books, but getting computer braille equipment is a lot more specialized and more to carry around (but some people still do).

As for the college experience... it can vary greatly, depending on social support, circle of friends, etc. I've known some that had a great experience, others not as good.

One thing that happens for some people who were blind most of their lives is blind mannerisms (also called blindisms, although that can be considered derogatory). It can often be seen as rocking, flapping their hands, and other forms of stimming. If children aren't taught to notice and work on stopping that, they can carry through into adulthood. One lady I dated had a tendency to rock in university classes, and her professor would call her on that sometimes (she would rock when excited or anxious). One time, when I was leaning in for a kiss, she started to rock and head-butted me in the face, too. ;)

I remember those... My office was using that for quite a bit, until it caught on fire and we never got around to replacing it. 

I've found most people have switched to listening to books as opposed to braille for large amounts of material. Audio books is easier, and you can accelerate the reading time (a lot of JAWS/VoiceOver users increase the speed of the voice, up to 2 or 3 times). Additionally, phones and computers can easily play audio books, but getting computer braille equipment is a lot more specialized and more to carry around (but some people still do). 

It sounds like your character is completely blind. In terms of hiking over flat, level terrain, they are use a cane with a wheel tip (it looks like this  <URL> ). I should mention, this tip is fairly rare.... in 10 years as an O&amp;M instructor, I've never had a client who used that.

You can either keep it pointed in one direction to do something like count doorways, or you can make sweeping passes with it to find obstacles. It does not help find drop offs like curbs or stairs. So someone using this still needs to use a cane. 

There are a few GPS units. The Victor Reader Trek is brand new with a $700 price tag. There’s the Kapten, Sendero, and a few phone apps. Some apps are free, most are not. 

More people with vision impairments use iPhones because of the built in accessibility. They use Voice Over and/or the Zoom features. Some people like Android phones and use TalkBack.

Being registered blind will entitle her to a Blue Badge, this will help anyone giving her a lift to be closer to the destination for them to  guide them onward.

She's should be eligible for [attendance allowance](http://www.rnib.org.uk/information-everyday-living-benefits-and-concessions-benefits-older-people/attendance-allowance). Applying for attendance allowance is a pig of a job, 52 questions on 31 pages, but you could fill it in for her.
     

Other benefits like [pension credit](http://www.rnib.org.uk/information-everyday-living-benefits-and-concessions-benefits-older-people/pension-credit) may be available. 

With this extra money she could employ people to help her with tasks like cleaning the house (seeing dirt is difficult when your blind as is using cleaning products safely) and going through correspondence (you need someone very trustworthy for this) or just reading the local newspaper  to her. 

Employing people is challenging, from interviewing and selection to making sure they are paid along with their taxes, holiday pay and pensions. There may be a local organisation who can help with this payroll administration.

Getting an appointment with an [NHS low vision clinic](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Eyehealth/Pages/Livingwithlowvision.aspx) could get her illuminated magnifiers or monoculars or other aids to help her read things.

If she has an iPhone then [Microsoft's Seeing AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai/) app has great potential.

Help her get in touch with the local blind charity. They may do home visits, have examples of aids for blind people to try out, can give advice, offer a social centre where people can meet up in a blindness friendly environment.

Get her some [bump-ons](http://shop.rnib.org.uk/home-and-leisure/labelling/tactile-labelling/bumpons.html) so she can mark the preferred settings for toaster / cooker / washing machine.

Has a prototype of this device been made? I'm curious how the vibrations in the frames work out. In terms of comfort, and accuracy. What would the vibrations do when the LIDAR sensors scanned something like a chain link fence? How does the sensations differ between a lower obstacle vs a higher obstacle? How about a moving obstacle (a small child or a dog)?

While the speed of light for the LIDAR is faster than the speed of sound, the speed should be negligible. Both should be high enough that the client wouldn't be travelling faster than either signal.

Would there be an option to power the system while wearing glasses? Many people wear their glasses all day, and not wearing them for even an hour could be problematic, if they forgot to recharge them the night before. Something like a USB charger port for a portable battery? Or maybe some sort of quick charging technology?

In terms of the ad itself... in the second box, on the left hand side, it shows a person with an object falling onto their head.... Judging from where the sensors are positions, these glasses wouldn't prevent that anyways. And most people with regular eyesight wouldn't see an object falling from above them, either. 

While not explicitly stated, I would assume the lenses can have different types of shading put in, as well as prescriptions. 

I'm also curious, from your point of view, how would the LIDAR option for these glasses be superior to either the iGlasses or the Ultracane?

448,"Kinda hard to tell without more info. How are you holding your cane? What material is it? What muscles are you using to do the sweeping action? Constant contact or two-tap?

A few suggestions:

1. For training purposes: try keeping your wrist locked to your hip (at the level it hangs naturally), arm totally relaxed, wrist not moving much. Move the cane using the motion of your hip when walking. This is just a component of realistic full time use, but hip muscles are way stronger &amp; durable than your hand.
2. If doing two-tap, you might be arcing higher than necessary. It can be quite shallow, and that requires less power.
3. Try ""choking up"" on the cane - e.g. having a bit of the grip against your wrist. That shortens it (making for less leverage required), but also connects it more with your arm &amp; body and makes you less tempted to do it all with your wrist.
4. Do you have your index finger extended on the flat side of the grip? 
5. If you're doing constant contact and need more force (e.g. to hear detail of different pavement types), again try choking up and having more palm contact. Or if you don't need that detail, relax and let it just slide more. (And get a rolling tip.)
6. If you're trying to generate an echolocation ping, try using a more whip-like motion, fairly loose hand. Like a drumstick, not like a baseball bat.

Really though if you're literally just getting started, I think you're probably juggling too much mentally to be able to think about the ergonomics, and you're just going to have to deal with it for a little while. 

Once you're past the stage where things like foot synchronization are automatic, it'll be a lot easier to focus on what muscles you're using to power the swing, whether you're gripping too hard or light, etc. And as others have noted, your muscles will have gotten stronger anyway.

If it's still hurting after the first month or so, and you have the basics like foot synch automated, work on it like an ergonomics problem — and try out a lighter cane or a rolling tip.

For daily use, it should really not hurt at all. It'd really suck to be blind with RSI. ;-)",,,,saizai,lightblind,,1521046441,t5_2qpec,t3_83r1y8,t3_83r1y8,1,1525158615,0,0,dvoyohb,Blind,,,blue1,,

468,"Yeah, I hear you loud and clear. It really is a personal thing, for sure. The Vision Australia's page on helping blind people has a really neat way of putting it: ""Approach, Ask, Assist."" I like how they emphasize two distinct steps before actually doing anything to help... and in that ""Ask"" step, the person who might receive assistance has the opportunity to explain what they need or how they can best be helped -- or even to decline help entirely. This approach makes it personal right from the start, and yeah, it's way better than a more generic ""here's all of the stuff you can do"" type of guidance.

As you have me thinking about this now, I think the generic web advocacy thing actually does run counter to your goal of the direct personal interaction and point-in-time remediation that you're seeking to provide.

491,"right now the current state of screen-readers is pretty primitive. if a document doesn't have really good formatting it becomes inaccessible as screen readers wont be able to interpret the information properly. this causes a couple of problems.

1) it takes a reasonably high level of technical expertise to recognize and avoid accessibility issues when creating/updating documents. this means that a lot of people just can't make their docs accessible because they don't know where to start.

2) there is a huge backlog of older documents out there that are completely inaccessible because they were created before accessibility was something large organizations thought about. even now there are tons of documents being created that are not accessible. its nearly impossible for people to go back and correct all these files.

if a robust AI was created that could make sense of documents that were not formatted with accessibility in mind it would open up all sorts of new information to the blind. it would also be a very valuable technology since many governments have new accessibility laws in place. its going to cost billions to have humans make all these docs accessible but if an AI could do it, that would be a big time/money saver for them.

I think the aim with this is to only have that level of 'corridor-ing' when the user has a specific destination, but outside that also keep a more passive haptic awareness of the local area, so if the user felt like a bit of an explore it's easy to do so!

511,"I would personally never use a cane that talked to me or provided audio feedback. There is enough noise around me already, and traffic noises vary. It would have to be super loud to hear over the traffic but then it would be too loud in other situations. 

Combining a phone and cane seem like a hassle and not useful. Will i lift my cane to my face to talk on the phone? No. Will I use it to text while walking? No, I can text and walk with my existing cane.  It’s also important to note that many people who use a cane have some vision left and may use their phones for things other than audio. 

Building a gps into a cane is an obvious idea but I don’t think it would be practical, much for the same reasons as the audio thing. 

I use my cane for tactile feedback: is the ground in front of me smooth, is there someone or something in front of me, how many stairs are there, how deep/high are the stairs. There are canes that incorporate flashing lights and noise makers as a safety feature, and i like that there is that option for people. 

I have different cane tips I use in different environments. I use a marshmallow tip and the constant contact style (sweeping in front of me on the ground). I have a disk tip I use in sand, and a large ball tip I use for especially uneven sidewalk or ground.

538,"Awesome! I did a little searching and there are a few web pages out there that offer various tips for helping people with low vision and blindness navigate, but there doesn't appear to be a single standalone web resource for this -- so it's good to know that if we built one, we wouldn't be stepping on anyone's toes.

I'm thinking the site could have a broader name that allows for a wider variety of content at some point down the road, even though we'd be starting off with a focus on content related to navigating physical spaces.

Any thoughts on a name? Short and sweet is always best, but I know there's also a lot of sensitivity around terminology. It's tempting to focus on the word ""blind"" out of simplicity but would that be off-putting to people who have visual impairments other than blindness? Would ""VI"" need to be part of the domain name for true inclusion, or is this overthinking things?

With such a rapid development, you definitely need to speak with your doctor before learning how to use a long cane. 

If you're not comfortable driving, then definitely use an alternative form of transportation. 

Even if it is temporary, but reoccurring and or degenerative, you should speak to an orientation and mobilty specialist. There's a few on this forum that have a lot of good advice. They may be able to direct you to some resources in your area. An O&amp;M will evaluate your need for a long cane and fit and train you with a cane if needed. 

Most low vision resources aren't going to be able to help you or find funding for services unless you have an actual VI diagnosis, so there's no use stressing yourself out trying to get such services yet. Maybe compile a few local resources onto a Google doc just in case if it makes you feel better.

2.  Convert those pesky PowerPoint type presentations to PDF as well.  Most presentation software is compliant with screen readers but it is easier to deal with PDF.  Review the document after you export it.  Are notes still included?  Does it flow?
3.  When you are making notes in Word, Pages, etc. Plan to convert to PDF later.  Try never to use tables for text.  Tables can be navigable but they can also turn into a mess for a screen reader.  The simple solutions is do not use tables.
4.  Avoid adding text boxes.  Again, they are not always bad but can get screwed up for a screen reader and may not be read at the appropriate time in the document.
5.  If you add pictures make sure you provide descriptions that provide enough information.  A bad description would be  - This is a graph.  A good description - This is a graph showing the  consistent decline of the Canadian population in the last ten years from 32 million to 31 million.
6.  Don't use bold or italics.  Screen readers can pick this up but I don't have the verbosity level set that high.
6.  Put heading in documents to divide sections.  When I say heading I mean from Styles in Pages or Word.  Usually called Heading1.  These are not the same as bold or italics.  They can allow a screen reader user to more quickly navigate through a document.

People can add a lot more I am sure.  Don't shy away from text based.  It can often be easier than narrating.  It can allow for braille displays or daisy readers can generally read text if desired. Simple text based documents with headings are great and very flexible.  More flexible than audio files.

Someone else mentioned making sure the platform is accessible.  That seems to be a common problem.  Another is the layout of course material files.  Make sure files are named in a descriptive way.  If there is a logical flow to folders or documents then number them.

When under blindfold training, you may have a freakout. Might be early in the training, may be later. It's hard to tell. Not everyone has it, but a lot of people do. When that happens, you can ask the instructor to give you a few moments to calm yourself down. Take slow, deep breathes until you are back under control. You think more clearly afterwards, and can analyze what may have caused it.

Take some time to get to know the instructor. Building up trust helps, since they would be watching out for you. 

If you are learning how to eat under blindfold, you may want to start with someone simple. The first time my classmates and I had a meal under blindfold, my partner dumped a LOT of Parmesan cheese into my lap (for my spaghetti). I stuck to the garlic bread after that.

590,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense. To be less vague, I think that I can design a portable system that could effectively merge those categories of screen reader and navigator. Using multiple cameras it would be able to read any computer screen in front of you and guide you through the touch screen or keypad, and it would use those same cameras to orient the user once GPS routes you to within roughly 10 meters of the location. The system itself would be a PC with the processing power of a laptop and a touch interface. I know it all sounds rather fantastic, but I really think the hardware technology is there, the biggest issue is thoughtful implementation.

I'm trying to learn by using screen readers myself. I'm still very new to it, but I've noticed that even screen readers can't help when it comes to inaccessible web content, and I haven't tried yet, but I imagine certain things like spreadsheets are not fun to use. I think my project can add to this by turning the space in front of you into a virtual touch interface.  I know touch interfaces are tricky to get right, but the key is that users could parse content however they pleased using their hands and get audio feedback.

Am I understanding what makes web content inaccessible? I know things like not providing alt text are just designers being lazy and inconsiderate, but I'm trying to understand the fundamental issues that come from content relying too much on graphical intuition.

I find deafness to be pretty interesting though.I’ve met some successful deaf people, including a very good professor of mine and has a family. He’d probably tell you it’s not a big deal to him either. I know a few blind and deaf people, and some of them can be pretty successful. I know one who has implants and functions fairly ell, I believe he’s studying to be a systems admin.

It’s interesting, if you ask the federal government, which is a worse disability we supposedly are. Blind people are considered more disabled than any other disability, because people deem just that much of the world is dependent on sight. This is true and not true. I think with so much technology out there and other innovative solutions one can master life.

The horrible myth that once you lose your vision, you’re a piece of meat or something, completely useless, it’s a horrible existence, you become incapable, is just that! A myth. A pretty sad one, that which the blindness community sometimes encourages and does relative little to discourage. I think the issue is these communities focus too much on these issues honestly, and one that is encouraged by people who work with the blind or disabled. I’ve found more support honestly in the sighted community for my endeavors than the blind one. I tell people is a fact of life, it’s a new reality you have to face. The blindness community or some in in it can find solutions for you, but otherwise, it’s kind of unhealthy to suddenly join it and spend all day in it! I’ve seen that, and it’s really sad. I am blind but honestly outside the internet I spend a lot of my days just as a normal person, living in the normal sighted community. If you act normal, I find you get good reactions, and just as accepted. It’s okay to get some pointers from independence places how to adapt then go back to the world, the sighted world, and just live like the normal person. The only reason I hang out here occasionally, is to help people with stuff like this. I get a lot of flak for trying to just live my life as a normal person. I am not a blind person or sighted person, I say, I am just a normal person.. I’ve been called a super blink once, by this militant person for the blind, and her championed cause is blindness.

I honestly don’t see the difference, I don’t have vision, so what? I don’t know blindness has to do with anything. I have a odd sleeping schedule sometimes, like today. Okay... but I just met some artcy people who claimed they do too. They are sighted, one guy slept from 6 to 2 pm. Okay... I eat food, sleep, get up go to school, I might have taken 7 years, but still pretty normal lifestyle, studying to be a political scientist now, work in the political parties. I go out out to eat, sometimes. I take the buses obviously because I don’t have to drive, but everyone else on them is sighted so not only blind people thake buses. I’ve only met a few other blind people on the buses. I get online and talk to people like everyone else. Oh wait. I don’t see what stands out in my life. Like I said, pretty normal here.

I’ll list a few of my accomplishments for you so just that you know that it’s possible. I don’t want to brag but I’ll list them because it’s true, if you want it, you can do anything! You can be the most amazing person in general, or the least being the normal blind person, who some of them honestly I’ve seen a lot in these communities don’t do much, spends all day ripping in to each others, complains, not very independent, spends all day doing who know what. YOur choice.

In elementary school I ran for the ASB and won the presidency. I was totally blind by then. I used my blindness and some other stuff to win it. Since then there has been a movement at that school to beat my record amongst the visually impaired community there. There is a vision center there. I am honored by this, and it’s interesting. I certainly didn’t start this culture, but I think my success has stirred the pot to some extent.

In middle school I had a lot of extracurricular opportunities. I went surfing, I got a lot of help because I am not the most fit person in the world. My balance isn’t the most spot on on a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. I went deep sea fishing in high school, water skiing. I did other trips too, all through this blindness organization. I was their flier girl and appeared on the front of their magazine because I wasn’t afraid to try and volunteer to attempt anything. When asked I knew I could do it, and was not so locked in my fears and was willing to do it. Everyone took two steps back. I took no steps forwards for a moment to be considerate of others but I had no issues stepping forward and saying me, I’ll do it. I don’t think I am abnormal, honestly, not special. Just someone who can and will try. I say any blind person can do what I am doing and is in reason what I am doing. I did a lot of that stuff in middle school and really begun to speak up about just how capable blind people can be, and how normal we could be.

In high school, I did a little of that but I did other stuff too, and this extracurricular stuff began to fade. I read widely, became pretty in depth and informed.

I served on the journalism team for 3 years. I like anyone else, went out, navigated the school independently, got interviews, wrote the pieces and submitted them. I was widely read apparently after my publication. I was the political and opinion columnist for a long time. I never got the editorship or EIC position I wanted but it would probably not be my avenue either, and not because I was blind. It was relatively for high school a lot of work, but I got it done. The real stuff I am not as a fan of, but even for sighted people, you have better be a certain calabir and grade. Anyway, I won spirit of the paper award basically. I was an enthusiastic and ambitious member of the school newspaper. I was the only blind person the whole time I served. I was recommended to the paper at the end of my freshman year. I was nearly the youngest person on it. Not a lot of sophomores got on the paper.

I lead an online group in a writing workshop. That was really fun. Everyone besides me was sighted. I ran it for a year to a year and a half. I wrote most of the rules and structures of the group and the administration of it. I had to say it died a year and a half or two years after I left the leadership up to someone else. I was beloved as the leader, no one was going to forget my leadership, and I was an honored member of the community. I had to step down due to personal time management issues.

At this time, I began to travel the city, and gain a lot of mobility independence. By this point, I have traveled 3 counties, and many major metropolitan urban cities. I live in Los angeles, know Los angeles very well. I also have traveled a bit around Orange county, and San francisco. I know most of those counties very well. I know a bit of the inland empire. And could probably figure it out. I have also traveled around hong kong for 3 weeks and had little issues. This traveling is mostly post high school though.

I was at a normal school, in normal classes, and got A and b grades. I went to the school that the movie freedom writers happened at. Obvious it’s gotten a lot better. It’s a classical high school. Afterwards I went to a private Jesuit University, also very few blind and disabled people, but now back at a community college due to a lack of funds, but again, normal sighted people. I say, mostly I’ve gotten excellent grades. I was the top grade in the class last semester, and I was the only blind person in it. I have been for years generally known as the outspoken, smart, bright, and intelligent student. I was sort of the teachers favorite in sixth grade because I did so well in that class. I am sure at that age I was the most hardworking student, never missed an assignment.

At this point, I’ve also served on a more professional paper, but due to the stress I had to resign. You have to be super ready and super good at being in a really high stress environment though. I know and yesterday heard how how not special I was, because a lot of normal sighted people had to quit the school paper too. However, when I was on it for 6 weeks I wrote 5 stories, I did interviews for a few more. I worked the larger community college campus myself, interviewed people, made appointments. I interviewed without appointments too. On club day I promoted our paper and successfully passed out all our fliers. After the club day thing there was a few left so I wondered around and past out the few remaining ones, no more then 10. We had a large pile. I got the idea to call out for our paper, stop people when they walked by, and wave our flier around. again, I was the only blind person there. I thought up those strategies enumerated there..

I worked hard to promoted and handed out over 200 papers, I am sure I worked the hardest at this. I don’t think anyone passed out 200 copies like me. I worked the campus, walked around independently, worked the cafeteria a few times that week and an a half, worked the student union. I was told I was good at it by someone I knew and no one has passed out papers like that!

I am on this blind community, and I organized our first get together, which has become a tradition now, but I don’t think they are trying as much as I did, and it’s an easy, whoever wants to come kind of thing. We’re popular so if you know me and in the area let’s get together. I did extensive searching and organizing myself.

616,"I was hopeless when my sister gave me this book called Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. The book is a meditation on what the gruesome experience of Auschwitz taught Frankl about the primary purpose of life: the quest for meaning, which sustained those who survived. 

I read the book in one night and have since read / listened to it many times over. The book is still with me on a day-to-day basis. Frankl views suffering not as an obstacle to happiness but often the necessary means to it, less a pathology than a path. 

”If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. 

Such men are not only in concentration camps. Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering.”

As far as the blindfolded training - I've heard of it and it makes sense for progressive diseases. Think of retina pigmentosa. At the point where insurance and government assistance will pay for training and such, you still have usable sight.

Few months later you have less sight, have trouble getting financial assistance for more training, and have anxiety over not feeling independent. Even if another pass through training isn't expensive for you, it's a time waste and you'll persistently be wondering how well you'll do when your sight gets worse.

If you can be taught how to function in daily life fully blind, reading Braille properly with your fingertips and navigating city streets without being able to look - you can go on about your life without having to scramble for more training again and again as your disease progresses.

628,"How long to adjust: that's _very_ variable. Your sister will probably take longer than average; she's older, and lost her sight more or less suddenly. Not as easy as when you're younger or when you have time to gradually adapt.

Frankly, speaking from personal experience, it really fucking sucks to lose your sight. Don't shy away from it or from empathizing with her being in a really difficult place.

Don't neglect the doctors etc, and follow up with whatever diagnosis and treatment might be possible for her situation.

I'd say there are probably two different aspects of ""how long"".

1. Psychologically, how long will it take to come to terms with her ""new normal""? I think you're probably better placed to tell that than any of us.
2. Pragmatically, how long would it take to learn basic coping skills? If she starts O&amp;M etc now, and picks it up quickly, probably a month or so for the bare minimum - and at least a couple years before it's at the level where she's starting to be ""fluent"". 

But that's only if she's in the psychological place where she can do the work required to learn these new skills. It's not as impossible as it might seem, but it's also not easy, and most of the hard parts are things that you probably do not currently understand. E.g. for me, hard things: the amount of memory, concentration, &amp; mental mapping required to have object permanence for navigation; ingraining echolocation to be able to _feel_ my environment rather than explicitly listen for echo durations, noticing when I'm deviating from straight line walking, etc.

In short: it's completely understandable that she's scared. It's really fucking scary. That's true. Her life is going to have to change.

For this sort of project, the form-factor would want to be very small in order to be portable; combined with the data you'd need and pairing to a smart-phone seems pretty vital with current 2018 technology, then pushing the phone's data to the device. 
Does push a fair few people out of the market which I hate, but does create a benefit of having a location accuracy of 1 to 5 meters easily through the phone (rumours are circulating that they can get it to with 1ft by next year), even indoors.

It'd be a one-time setup to minimize the amount of interaction with the phone.

They're also very kind, supportive people, and the ones who are actually helping people in person.

As far as I know, you just sign up for a guest account, then can use the service for free at the airport on your personal smartphone.

757,"I echo a lot of the feedback given here, especially with regards to sparse information on product labeling (this has caused me to order the wrong item several times), the fact that chatting often takes me longer and then shoppers check out and it's super frustrating, and the delivery sliders issue.
