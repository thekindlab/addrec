16,"Painting description for the redditers of r/blind:  It is almost a black and white painting of mountains in a snow storm, very stark and expansive.The only color is a hint of blue in the billowing storm clouds and a dark black-green for the pine trees, but it is hard to see the green in the trees for the contrast of white snow they are covered in.The objects that are closer appear crisper and darker and with more color. The objects  fade the farther away they are, so that the mountains in the middle of the canvas, which appear to be the farthest away are little more than a swipe of crisp white paint against the billowing clouds. They are distinguishable  more for their texture than their color.

For those born blind, a description of distance as seen by the sighted (also this is for the sighted, as few but painters and photographers are aware of how this works)… On a clear day there is still air between you and everything.  Air, being mainly made up of nitrogen, scatters light in a blue range.  It actually scatters green, purple and blue, but the net effect is blue, which is why the sky appears blue. If you look directly up on a clear day, the sky is a darker blue at the apex and lighter around the horizon, this is due to the fact that when you look up on a clear day you are actually seeing the dark void of space beyond the reassuring haze of nitrogen blue, and the color combination is a deep blue color.  At sea level there is more nitrogen between you and space, so the color of the sky at sea level is much lighter blue than in the mountains.

Being from the mountains I prefer a high altitude blue sky.  It feels more vibrant, more alive and dangerous, because you can see just how precariously we sit, perched on this small speck of dust, floating in the infinite. A sea-level blue is like a blue for babies, the atmosphere thick and reassuring, like baby’s blanket.

Anyway, around the edges the of the horizon you are actually looking through more nitrogen than when you look up. When you look out across a vast landscape the things that are farther away will actually appear bluer than things that are closer, because there is more nitrogen between you and farther away objects.

However, nitrogen is not the only important gas to consider when painting distance. There is also water vapor. Water vapor scatters white, so in humid places, things in the distance appear whiter, more faded and hazy.

In the painting the subject is a series of mountains. At higher elevations the air is much thinner, so there is less blue fade, however there is also less water vapor, so things appear very crisp even at great distances.

I lived for many years in a very humid part of China. I always remember being shocked by the crispness of the mountains when I would come home. I never really thought about how amazingly crisp they are until I had lived away from them.

This painting is of a winter storm, so the main gas to think about is water vapor. In the painting white swirls across the canvas obscuring the distant range of maintains, making them fuzzy and soft and just barely there, while in the foreground ghostly white aspens throw up their thin branches against the stark contrast of the black-green pines. The overall effect is one of space and distance, as the closer land on each side of the canvas, crisp, and jagged, swoops down and away from you, into a  valley, made soft by its distance from us.  Beyond the valley, in the haze, is the softest whisper of a further range of mountains.

In addition to the impaired functionality, my left cornea has also been dystrophic since I was 8, which made my disability visible., so nobody could ignore it.

Being visually impaired didn't significantly affect my life.  I attended regular school (despite the fact that I couldn't read from the blackboard), dropped out of high school to work when I was 17, and moved out of my mother's house when I was 24.  The only thing that I couldn't do was drive, but I was lucky to be able to work from home, and at a later stage I did become a digital nomad.

All this to say that I've always been a fully functional member of society and that fortunately I've never been discriminated or treated differently due to my disability, and to me that was a good thing, because I hated to be reminded that I was disabled, something that I can't avoid now that I'm blind and have to come up with workarounds and strategies for everything.",,,,Vaelian,,,1464477455,t5_2qpec,t3_4lh59y,t3_4lh59y,3,1466164118,0,0,d3ng9fd,Blind,3,,,,

80,"Not blind yet... but I am a woman and I remember being that age. It was not always easy to distinguish between general wetness and blood. In the same way young men get random uncomfortable and unexpected boners, young women get random uncomfortable and unexpected wetness. So knowing if it is menses or vaginal discharge is unclear. However, if she is legally blind, that doesn't mean totally blind. She might be able to check in the bathroom  like anyone else that age.  However, if she is too blind to tell with a little bathroom check, I would probably go with a sniff test (also in the bathroom). Blood smells metallic. Vaginal discharge smells sort of salty, but not metallic. And with the sniff test I can not emphasize enough the importance of washing hands PRIOR to going to the bathroom, as well as afterward. Vaginas are moist places, that are highly prone infection.

Also, maybe get her and her girl friends to sort of look out for each other. Leaking through one's pants is something that could happen to anyone new to menstruating (or even not so new to it).

But in general if a girls face doesn't have big scars or burnmarks or some serious uncommon problem, I don't care about it. Body is all important. For example, I like tall girls. I do not like A-cup boobs, I like long hair. I like big butts but not fat women. I don't think we have to go any deeper into my preferences to give you the idea. The thing is people say, ""but how would you know she was fat or had A-cup boobs?"" and my answer is, the first time I make out with that girl and I run my hands down her back and there are roles on it is the moment I learn that she's fat if one of my buddies hasn't already told me, I can't forget that knowledge or change who I'm attracted to. Editted to mention that voice and smell are also important, I was trying to answer the physical part of the question",,,,laconicflow,,,1463544786,t5_2qpec,t3_4jm4g3,t3_4jm4g3,3,1465928868,0,0,d39tqdq,Blind,3,,,,

It also gets confusing for me when cars are waiting for us to go, also when trucks are idling at an intersection. If it's not lit, then I'll have no idea if that truck is waiting for me, or if it's just sitting there.

I'm not sure how it works on other screen readers or browsers, because I don't use them.  On IOS, it works almost perfectly, with two major issues.  The first issue is that it can't always scroll propperly through long lists of songs.  Lists of artists and albums, for example in your library or search results, work just fine.  But as soon as you get into a playlist, album, or anywhere else displaying a large list of songs, voiceover will scroll through the first 10 songs just fine, and then jump up to the top of the list.  To get around this, you're going to need to start the first song playing, and then use the next and previous buttons in the player to skip through the list.  The second issue...may not be an issue, per say.  What Google has done, in order to make the player more accessible, is whenever the player screen is open and it transitions to a new song, Google tells Voiceover to focus on the title and artist of the song and read it out.  Yeah, that's kind of a cool feature. But the problem is, if your focus was on, for example, the next button, after the song changes, Google Music has ""helpfully"" changed the item you're focused on back to the title and artist currently playing.  You're now going to need to swipe back over to the next button again.  If you have a headset, this won't bother you at all; just use the next and previous buttons on your headset.  If you don't have a headset with next and previous buttons, the best thing to do if you want to skip through songs quickly is to lock your phone, and then use the next and previous controls on the lock screen.  When you tap next on the lock screen, you stay focused on the next button, so can tap it multiple times quickly.  Useful if you need to play song 36 of an 80 song playlist.

There is one other issue that might affect you, but if you have sighted help for initial set-up, it won't be a problem at all after that.

In order to get it working, you'll need a sighted person to install the app, log you in, and point the app to a folder on your computer where you store your music.  But once that set-up has been done, Google Music Manager will watch the folder for any new music you add, and automaticly upload it.  The app even starts at boot.  So just get someone to set it and you can forget it.  If you want to check on how it's doing, you can find it in the system tray and click on it, and NVDA will read the progress (something like ""895 songs uploaded of 1426"").  It hasn't ever broken or had any issues since the first time I set it up, so it's never been touched.  It uploads automaticly, and keeps itself up to date, without needing any input from me.  

To tell you the truth, I actually did set Music Manager up without sighted help, just by randomly banging on it.  I think what I wound up doing was typing my email, pressing tab, pressing enter, typing my password, pressing tab, pressing enter, pressing tab a couple of times, then space, then an accessible ""brows for folder"" thing opened, and I pressed enter on the folder where I keep my music.  But it took me an hour or so of fiddling to get that figured out, because NVDA offers no feedback at all during the sign-in process.  Fortunately, the only thing Music Manager does is upload music.

118,"From what I've seen, it really depends on what the person favors. I personally use a screen-reader (jaws for windows), and I find that it works well for me. Obviously the mouse doesn't play a part in website navigation, hence where arrow keys, and keyboard commands/short cuts come in. This system is generally good for browsing, but there are obviously things that you miss out on: pictures with no description, mostly, though sometimes buttons on webpages are unlabeled as well, which can also provide a disadvantage (tumblr is the epitome of inaccessible and I hate it for that). Also, most people that use screen-readers tend to gradually speed up the speed of the speech so that browsing goes a lot faster than one would think.  

However, I do know some friends that use braille technology hooked up to computers via different formats (bluetooth, usb, etc), and they read webpages as opposed to listening to them. I believe that in cases like these, they use the braille device itself to input text via braille itself (so the idea of 'braille keyboards' themselves isn't really a thing since it's a completely different format), but I'm not entirely sure - as I said, I don't really use this way.  

Also, for people using keyboards in general: most people take it upon themselves to just remember where the keys for whichever letters are, and use touch-typing.  

And as for using things on the go, my screen-reading software is on my laptop, which goes most anywhere with me. However, I also have an iPhone, which - along with many smartphones nowadays - has screen-reading software automatically installed.

143,"Hey there! I also have RP and can somewhat understand what you are going through: most of the visually impaired community around me are elderly persons and I'm still somewhat young and haven't found a lot of common ground in the local visual impairment groups. There is a small group of younger people that meet the next town over but getting there can be problematic.  

Anyway, I personally wouldn't be upset if someone came up to me while I have my white cane out (was just at a weekend long festival and with drunk people it happened almost constantly!) but it can get weird if the person approaching me has little to say other than pointing out that I'm visually impaired. If you encounter a visually impaired person and think you might have something in common or something interesting to talk about (and you don't get the impression that you'd be bothering them: often times I put in ear buds to avoid people talking to me for example), go for it! Blind people are people too and people are social creatures. I personally love meeting new people. 

Apart from that, I don't know how far along your visual degeneration is or if you've sought out someone to help you get and learn to use a white cane, but I did just that a couple years ago and it was great! Well it's still scary/embarrassing to use my white cane but it's helped a bunch in crowded and dark places. As an added bonus, my orientation and mobility instructor took it upon herself to arrange a meeting between myself and 4-5 other visually impaired people in my area who are all between the ages of 23 and 32. Now we meet about once a month for drinks to see how everyone is doing. 

I'm rambling but: TL:DR - If you have more to say than just ""I noticed you're a blind guy or gal"" and are fairly sure you wouldn't be bothering them, normal people meeting rules should apply! Go meet that lady or gentleman! Also: while I'm sure it's not always the case, an O&amp;M instructor could be a resource for you meeting visually impaired people around your age from your area.

204,"To go into a little more detail about the 8-bit: Nowadays, indie developers are getting more into making games with engines that require a lot less time and expertise.  8-bit, 16-bit, side-scrollers, top-down, text-based, and point-and-click are rising in popularity.  This allows a small development team to focus their energy on story, characters, music, ambiance, game balance, and level design.  They can bring their vision to life without blowing their entire budget on textures and shaders.

A great example of this would be FTP, which is a top-down strategy game where the player controls a spaceship.  Visually, it's very underwhelming; it's low-resolution with almost no textures to speak of.  But its massive popularity comes from being very rewarding despite the difficulty and randomness of it, its excellent soundtrack, and how smoothly the combat flows.

&amp;nbsp;

* Catching cracks in the pavement and bending or otherwise damaging canes

* Missing down curbs because I'm trying to go too fast and tripping

* Running into hanging obstacles like branches or low hanging signs that my cane can't catch because it is at my hip

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; How often do you leave your known area?

&amp;nbsp;

Relatively often, I live in a large metropolitan area and have to do things all over the place, I also travel outside of my city multiple times a year.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Which barrier do you face when you want to explore unknown area's?

&amp;nbsp;

A lack of audible/ tactile, or in my case some larger more noticeable visible landmarks (if the lighting is conducive to the vision I do have) as well as a lack of knowledge when it comes to the street layouts.  Traveling in my home area is pretty easy, traveling in other areas requires a lot more planning which could include reviewing directions and using GPS either on my phone or through my Humanware Trekker Breeze Plus visually impaired GPS unit.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What kind of mobile phone do you use? Is it a regular cellphone or a smartphone?

&amp;nbsp;

I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, it's a smartphone, I will probably be changing it out for an iPhone this coming January when I am due for an upgrade because of accessibility issues.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What kind of traffic situations in your daily life frustrate you or do you try to avoid?

&amp;nbsp;

My biggest issue is people not following traffic laws.  I'm not just talking running lights or stop signs (although that is an issue that freaks me out), it's also people freezing up and not going when they are supposed to.  The cane puts drivers in a panic I guess but it ends up causing me a lot of confusion because I was trained to know when it is safe to go without having to depend on visual queues and when people don't do what they are supposed to do assuming that I am going to just walk out it causes much more confusion.  If everyone just stops and goes when they are supposed to it makes my life a lot easier.  I don't avoid anything though, if I want to go somewhere I try not to let things like traffic navigation get in the way, I have had the training I need to do it safely, it's just a matter of executing.

Like, it'd play an unidentified sound and give you the approximate location (maybe within a mile or two) it was recorded, and then you'd have to find a way to record the same sound.  It could use technology like shazam's music matching technology to tell if you got it right.  I think that'd be fun, in a kind of similar way.

252,I just wanted to say I had the same problem with my cane catching on cracks/between sidewalk slabs. Then the organization that got me the cane gave me one with a ball at the end. It's too big to catch in cracks and I can feel the texture of the ground through the vibrations. It really made getting around easier! It was a screw on to the end so you might not need to even replace the whole cane. I hope that makes things a little easier for you!,,,,noisycat,,,1462943841,t5_2qpec,t3_4iqvcc,t1_d30efv7,2,1465776245,0,0,d30ywx4,Blind,2,,,,

260,"1.What are three top struggle when you going outside (with a cane)? 

A) Drains sometimes give issues, but not that often.

B) When on the beach, in the woods, or on a worksite, it's difficult to catch every rock, branch, or piece of rebar / random saws lying around.

2.How often do you leave your known area?

What counts as a known area? I travel between WA and CA pretty often for work, and just starting exploring around where I stay in CA. Otherwise I stay to my few local towns.

3.Which barrier do you face when you want to explore unknown area's? 

Some things that always make me pause and reconsider entering a place are those removable lines, (the posts with the things that unwind and attach them), and large open areas populated with somewhat moving agro, such as chairs, people, or cars / equipment.

4.What kind of mobile phone do you use? Is it a regular cellphone or a smartphone? 

Isn't a smartphone the new regular type of phone? IPhone 6, 16 GB, need to upgrade to a 6S sometime soon though, mines starting to go.

5.What kind of traffic situations in your daily life frustrate you or do you try to avoid? 

I wish I can upload an image, but that would give away too much of where I live. Imagine a 4 way intersection. We come down from the north on the east side of the street, and cross to the south eastern corner. Going the other way, we just go the other way.

All of these streets are technically 2 lane, but the eastern street has a 3 lane ""parking lot"" exit, which makes that crossing 5 lanes wide.

The cars going south from north line up at the northern edge of the eastern street, even though the western street is only 2 lanes, so the corner is much further south.

There are no beepers, and the light is too far for me to see.

A car or two can be driving from south to north, and if I start crossing right as they hit the intersection, a car that's been waiting at the north to turn east may be waiting in the middle of the intersection by the time I hit the south eastern corner.

So, I'm almost certain people frequently run the lights, and the corners are so awkwardly set, it's a nightmare.

267,"Hi. RP here. I am just now looking into what I can do to start getting prepared. I am not legally blind (legally blind for visual field is 20 degrees) , though my visual field is constricted.  I was told I need to open a case or something to get independence training. If what you say is true I have to wait until I am totally unable to get around before I am allowed to start training to get around. That sounds like a rediculous waste of time. If I am going blind I want to arrive there already knowing how to cane my way around, navigate the internet and read with braille. I want to be prepared, that is why it is called PREpared. 

Man, that is disheartening. 

As to genetic trials and testing. I have not looked into the genetic testing, but I do have insurance. So I am going full throttle on that, if the insurance company decides later that it isn't covered then I will deal with it then I guess. How quickly did your vision go?
