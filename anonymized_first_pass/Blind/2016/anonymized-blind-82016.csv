If you know you're losing your sight, you can put effort into learning to do things without vision, for example for a child this could be making a drink, starting cane training etc. It will make the transition to blindness 100 times easier.

I also echo what others have said about ensuring he has positive blind role models. This will make a huge difference to both his life and the lives of the rest of the family.
Introduce him to the idea that blindness is not awful, it's not going to take his life away and it won't stop him doing the things he wants. He can still play sports, study stem fields, travel.

Why is it after all the doctors and all the testing not one doctor actually asked me to describe my vision to them? You would think someone would ask. Alas. 

You seem like a nice kid. The whole ""less of a person"" seems weirdly pervasive  in blind people... well actually those who went blind or are struggling with vision loss. When I went to open a case at voc rehab, the lady there talked about it. I was a bit caught off gaurd. I hadn't  brought it up, so her bringing it up was weird to me. I read some studies afterward and apparently a loss of self worth is a pretty common thing in people who have lost their vision and are having to adapt to being without sight.

While going through TSA, Maintain control of your dog at all times. At no time is it appropriate for TSA to take your dog.  Place your dog on a sit stay When wwalking through the scanner, , and grabb the TSA agent's hand through the scanner machine. The TSA agent will helpp you through the scanner, hopefully avoiding accidentally setting off the machine - you will set  off the alarm, if you bump in to eather side. Now that you are on the other side, with the leash passing through the scanner, call your dog. Your dog will set off the scanner because of the harness, but this is OK and expected.  The TSA agent will then pat down your dog.  Keep hold of the leash while the TSA agent is ppatting down your dog. Your dog will just think the TSA agent is giving him some friendly pets, and will love the extra attention.  
When it comes to where your dog will sit/lay while your flying, dogs can curl up in to a nice little compact ball when they need too.

46,"Hey, I don't know how quickly they will need assistance. But here are some options I could think of.

An Apple Store (if one is close to your boss) has several support options that might be useful. First; some Apple stores have accessibility workshops, which discuss accessibility features for Apple devices. Additionally, they have classes on how to use their devices in general, which I'm sure they would apply to your boss' needs as well (rather accommodating),

Alternatively, setting up a Genius Bar session (again assuming near a store) allots about 10ish minutes of one-on-one technical support which can include asking questions.

Best part is, all of this is free! 

If your boss is not near a store, it might not be a bad idea to check support.apple.com (on mobile so formatting is probably bad), and then look up accessibility features. It would get them started at least. 
They could also call 1-800-APL-CARE (275-2273), but I think the phone support has a fee (doesn't hurt to ask).

With regard to the Logitech keyboard for the iPad Pro, I own the Apple Smart Keyboard which works similar.  I don't think that would do quite what your boss is hoping for, hitting tab doesn't really move through click/button options. However, with the vision accessibility features, it possibly could. If you want to start somewhere. head to settings, accessibility features, and check out the vision options with them, I know voice over is a popular one.

There are also probably private parties that would teach these things too, but I don't have any to recommend.

76,"Just to give you a different perspective:  

Totally blind, but I use my laptop and occasionally my iPhone. It's to each their own, I suppose, but I personally don't like the idea of people catering to me just because I'm blind, you know? Generally if someone is going to gripe at you about using acronyms, it's just them being picky; it's not like any sort of text-to-speech has any problem with them. Sure, lol might be pronounced as ""loll"", but that doesn't change the meaning of the phrase any--we would all still know what it means. Similarly, :P is going to be read as colon P, but that doesn't mean that we don't know what it is (most of us, anyway).  

I'm also a bit of a grammar nazi, so I normally have most punctuation enabled (in the 'how much punctuation do you want read aloud' setting), but if there are people that would rather not hear quotation marks, or brackets and such, they can turn that off; you don't have to be conscious of not using those things.  

I realize that not everyone shares my opinion though, and that's absolutely fine! I just adore the fact that you even bother asking this kind of thing anyway. &lt;3  

P.S: We can't tell if something is WRITTEN LIKE THIS WHICH A CRAP TON OF PEOPLE USE ALL THE TIME. Heartbreaking for me, but I learn to deal.

I think another thing you can do is let him know that just because he is losing his vision does not mean he is losing his happiness, or the things he loves in life. He can still lead a very happy, independent, awesome life. It will be a tough adjustment, and he'll have to learn how to do things a bit differently than he did with sight, but it is all possible. 

Do you know if his parents have been given resources about their local division of services for the blind? Your cousin should start receiving services from a teacher for students with visual impairments (which is what I am studying to be) who will help him learn methods that will allow him to be successful in school as his visual impairment progresses. They will also have resources for your cousin and his parents to use for support from other families and kids who are affected by vision loss.

Unfortunately, a sighted programmer who writes a free app, even with the best intentions, will usually stop development when life gets busy, if no money is coming in.

The great thing about reddit is that it's generally pretty accessible with jaws. The only thing that I've found any sort of problem with is the spoiler tags (if you know what I'm talking about). Apparently, if someone were to put something in spoiler text, a sighted person wouldn't be able to read unless they mouse over it. However, with jaws, it will just automatically read out the text as you arrow down.  

Aside from that though, it's pretty user friendly. Depending on the version of jaws you use, these commands might work for you. If not though, just let me know, and I can dig up previous keyboard commands for previous versions for you.  

The main content of reddit (like the messages in your inbox, the posts on your front page, the actual stuff once you click on a post itself), is typically found in the region area. To quickly jump to that, you can hit q to take you to the main region. However, r will take you to any region, so you can use that as well.  

Due to the fact that each comment is proceeded by the upvote and downvote buttons, you can use b to quickly jump you around; that's the letter that jumps you to all of the buttons on a webpage. Also, e will take you to any edit fields on the page, so if you want to quickly jump to a comment box on a reddit post, hitting E three times from the top of the page should get you there.  

That's the main things I keep in mind while navigating reddit, but I'm sure that you will find other shortcuts the longer you use jaws and find what works for you. I have a friend that will just hit B a bunch of times from the top of the page and use that to jump him to the upvote and downvotes above the post, while I hit Q and then arrow from there. It's completely up to you what you find to be the most beneficial.  

Other things that might help though:

L will jump you to the next list on the page. For example, when people make lists in reddit comments/posts, or even the text that is next to the comment (reply, delete, jump to parent, etc etc).  


I'm not sure if you're transitioning to jaws from a different software, or if you're dealing with vision loss, but if it's the latter, just give yourself a bit of an opportunity to just go through a reddit page with only voice. If you're sighted (or were), it will make a difference, because things aren't going to be read the same way that you'd see them. I.E: things won't be right or left of each other, there won't be columns, so on and so forth. Just get used to how things show up, and learn to navigate from there.  

I hope that all of this helps! And of course if you have any other questions or need more help in general, please let me know! I love to help.  

P.S: The thing for sorting comments is above the comment edit field. It doesn't say anything about a link, but you can still click on the type of sorting, and new text will come up under that.",,,,DreamingTheMelody,,,1471550255,t5_2qpec,t3_4xgk61,t1_d6mcbc7,1,1473478775,0,0,d6n2do3,Blind,1,,,"Of course! Sorry that I'm just now getting back to you.  

The great thing about reddit is that it's generally pretty accessible with jaws. The only thing that I've found any sort of problem with is the spoiler tags (if you know what I'm talking about). Apparently, if someone were to put something in spoiler text, a sighted person wouldn't be able to read unless they mouse over it. However, with jaws, it will just automatically read out the text as you arrow down.  

Aside from that though, it's pretty user friendly. Depending on the version of jaws you use, these commands might work for you. If not though, just let me know, and I can dig up previous keyboard commands for previous versions for you.  

The main content of <PERSON> (like the messages in your inbox, the posts on your front page, the actual stuff once you click on a post itself), is typically found in the region area. To quickly jump to that, you can hit q to take you to the main region. However, r will take you to any region, so you can use that as well.  

Due to the fact that each comment is proceeded by the upvote and downvote buttons, you can use b to quickly jump you around; that's the letter that jumps you to all of the buttons on a webpage. Also, e will take you to any edit fields on the page, so if you want to quickly jump to a comment box on a reddit post, hitting E three times from the top of the page should get you there.  

That's the main things I keep in mind while navigating reddit, but I'm sure that you will find other shortcuts the longer you use jaws and find what works for you. I have a friend that will just hit B a bunch of times from the top of the page and use that to jump him to the upvote and downvotes above the post, while I hit Q and then arrow from there. It's completely up to you what you find to be the most beneficial.

3. whether or not that school has a good dog match for you (almost most important of all! you'll get nowhere if you say only a female German Shepherd pure bred with blue eyes. guaranteed)

Get your O&amp;M skills down pat and have at least 3-4 routes with meaning and purpose. You must have a NEED to work a young dog, not simply a desire for a companion to walk you to your mailbox and back. 

The dog will not keep you safe from scary people.

German Shepherds are not as easily bred with similar temperament and personalities as labs. Do not expect a school to have a huge supply of them (aside from Fidelco). Same goes for goldens. 

Stay in touch but don't annoy your admissions person by calling over and over and over and over again.  

Research and actually speak with working guide teams. This is critical to understanding the needs of a team and will better help you figure out if this is a good move for you. 

A dog is a lifestyle choice and you must be financially able to care for it. Lifestyle because dogs are dogs and need certain things, and money cause dogs can be expensive little buggers. But we still love them.

I have an eidetic and photographic memory, so I can easily move around my own space remembering where things are and how rooms are oriented from before I lost my vision.

When navigating to a new and unfamiliar place by myself, I have a set of Bluetooth headphones that I connect to my iPhone from which I use a GPS application like Google maps or blind square so I can hear which directions to go while walking around.

Two. I use a roller tip cane with a sweeping technique rather than tapping. Arm is down at my side, Cain is extended out in front of me, and as I move my left leg forward, I sweep the cane to the right to scan the ground ahead before I begin moving my right leg and planting my right foot.

229,"D'awww, this is just adorable!  

Anyway.  

Speaking from the perspective of a blind female, I think what comes to mind for me is the way that I go about flirting myself? I guess I do what I would expect (to an extent), if that makes sense, so keeping that in mind, here are some things that occur to me.  

Obviously a lot of it is going to be auditory. I don't know what kind of person you are in terms of facial expression, but the expression that you wear sometimes effects your sound--to put you under less pressure. It also depends on him, of course, but I know that I can personally tell when someone is smiling, I can hazard guesses to when they might be blushing, etc etc. And even if he can't see you looking coyly at him, doing that might put you in the right frame of mind to adopt a coy tone. If this is too much of a personality change for you, you definitely wouldn't have to do it, but it's something to keep in mind, I guess?  

Maybe to make up for body language, do a bit of physical things? Nothing too forward of course, especially if you're not comfortable with that, but little things. Brushing your fingertips over the back of his hand, sitting just a smidge closer to him than you otherwise might.  

I'm kind of just throwing out things here though. I personally have had all of my relationships progress from some sort of friendship though, so I wasn't trying to get their attention in an overly flirtatious manner, as it were. I wouldn't dream of stereotyping that all blind people are like me though, so maybe my word-vomit terrible tips will serve you for someone who isn't much like me. Haha.  

Don't worry about being yourself though. If he's the kind of person that would like to pursue you as you say, you shouldn't go out of your way to change your mannerisms for him--in fact, it would possibly give him a false perspective of you, so if being giggly and coy and blushy isn't really you, don't force it. I'm sure that a few signs would be enough to grab his attention, anyway.  

Unless he's just oblivious, but that's a whole other can of worms, isn't it? ;)
