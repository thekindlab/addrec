2,"You can get a non-folding aluminium cane, but there are a few issues with using it for self defence.

One, at 60 inches, you would be carrying around a 5 foot long pole, but that grade of aluminium is not particularly strong. I can bend it with my hands. It wouldn't particuarly work well as a weapon, and the other two materials are even weaker. If anything, a support cane would be the most suitable, as they use weight-bearing materials.

Two, if someone was to mug you, they may easily have a weapon. Something as simple as a knife can be quite dangerous, and a gun much more so. Is the prospect of being stabbed and killed worth the contents of your wallet? I have no idea how much you have in your wallet, but your life and safety would likely be more valuable.

Three, I had a client with a cane who had been attacked. He attempted to defend himself with his cane, which results in it being taken by the attacker, and then stabbed in the neck for his trouble (he survived, because he was able to get to a main street and get assistance). Even if you swung a non-folding cane against someone, it doesn't particularly do much damage.

The cane has speed, but low mass, and is designed for minimal damage. I had a client throw a folded up cane at me before, and it just bounced off my shoulder. It hurt a little, but wouldn't have really been able to stop me.

8,"It varies a lot from person to person, as well as material. Some materials are easier to read braille off than others. Older braille paper and some other forms are paper don't hold braille as well, so it gets flattened over time... especially when people scrub over it, which flattens it down more. A lot more braille books nowadays are printed on a plastic sheet, which is much firmer and resists deformation.

Oftentimes, beginners also push much harder, until they get used to a light touch. The cause of the vision loss can also play a factor, as well. Diabetes (a leading caught of vision loss in younger people) can causes loss of sensation in the fingertips (neuropathy), which mean people push harder to try to feel something. 

Also, for interpoint (braille embossed on both sides of a sheet), it can make it more difficult for some people to read, so they push harder to feel.

42,"Trekker, apologies. That is great to know that the accuracy of GPS is sufficient for most navigation. Hopefully other types of beacons such as Bluetooth beacons can one day be a more valuable tool for precise tasks like finding doorways.

""Help guide dogs, or guide dog users?""

This question is where I keep manage to confuse myself with my thinking. The end goal of my project is of course to help people with vision impairment have a better experience when navigating to a new location and I had identified the relationship with guide dogs as a possible area to target.

In essence, in the situation of traveling to an unknown location, I want to combine the main strengths of a guide dog (avoiding obstacles, staying on footpath &amp; following directions) with the strengths of a GPS (route planning, land marking &amp; providing directions at given points) in order to make the process more user friendly then using the two techniques in combination. The idea is that this would provide a more dynamic navigation system allowing a new route to be confidently traveled by the user while easily being able to concentrate on remembering the important details of the route. I intend it to be able to used only the first 2-3 times traveling a new route so that the user can maintain a higher level of independence if desired.

I have a few different thoughts about how to do this but it will take some time to refine the best system and to ensure it would not affect the dogs main duties in any way. Apologies if I am being somewhat vague, as this may form a larger project will withhold the specifics of designs being discussed for now.

As it is an area where you are knowledgeable and experienced as a provider of these services, I have one more general question for you if you wouldn't mind:

Would you say that your clients encounter enough issues while navigating with a guide dog/GPS/both that they would be interested in a system that could make this a smoother and more reliable method?

Your input has been truly valuable so far, much appreciated.

I complain endlessly about CNIB's employability stuff, and the ongoing Blind New Worlds disaster.  But recently, I've had to stop and ask myself: where are the equivalent campaigns that we blind and visually impaired people are running? I can't think of any!

Part of the time, I think awareness campaigns and advocacy organizations are run entirely by sighted people, because they're stepping in to fill the leadership vacuum that we've left!  I complain endlessly about <PERSON>'s employability stuff, and the ongoing Blind New Worlds disaster.  But recently, I've had to stop and ask myself: where are the equivalent campaigns that we blind and visually impaired people are running? I can't think of any!  Maybe these well intentioned sighted folks are just stepping in to do something that we apparently aren't.  That's not to say that there aren't many wonderful blind leaders, in multiple exciting and powerful organizations.  But maybe there aren't enough.  

OK, wow. That was a long rant that was only partially related to your post. I'm sorry.  Those are just some thoughts that I've been having over the last few days, that I needed to get off of my chest.  

To bring it back on topic: no, I don't think you're over reacting; I do see the problems with that.  My advice would be to contact the church leadership, and offer to work with them to improve this idea for next year.  They're well intentioned, and I know many blind Mormons.  I think this could easily be turned into something that actually is helpful.  

PS: I didn't intend any of this as a personal attack towards you or anyone else in particular, and I hope it' doesn't come off that way. This comment is just a collection of my general frustrations at the moment.  Please don't take offense.

68,"It depends on the venue and the type of concert. A symphony? They will have assigned seating and ushers to show you to your seat. A band at a pub? Same as finding a seat at a pub. Cochella? Probably a lot more difficult. Most venues are going to be somewhere in between. For example, at general seating shows there may still be reserved accessible seating. Another issue is restrooms and food/drinks. Locating and accessing these can be a challenge at some events.

I have friends who regularly go to live music shows independently without any assistance. The most important thing is that if you don't know the venue call them during the day usually a few days before. They will be able to tell you how the seating works, if they would be able to provide anyone to help your find your/a seat, if there are any particular obstacles for navigation, etc. Venues are generally extremely helpful and can be quite accommodating, but you have to call ahead of time to ask your questions. If you show up unannounced at an unfamiliar venue they will probably not be much help.

I would encourage you to go for it unless it is something really wild like an Insane Clown Posse show.

For low vision users the evaluation of suitability will be specific to your actual case and your mobility challenges and goals. Don't assume that it is only based on your vision in optimal conditions. If you situationally would get great benefit using a guide dog then you would be a candidate. Examples include narrow field of vision, loss of central vision, night blindness (rod-cone distrophy) and many other conditions. Also, if your eye condition is on a path of degeneration then you would also be considered to provide opportunity to train and practice while you have usable vision.

No, no they aren't. This comment pretty much proves you just don't know what you're talking about.  Like, have absolutely no clue.  You seem to think that just because we have healthcare in Canada it means our social programs are ""better"".  If that's so, why do unemployed blind people in the US get more government help per month, on average, than Canadian blind people do?  Why do they have tons and tons more rehabilitation centers than we do in Canada? Same goes for there guide dog schools: more of them, and they're better funded.  Same goes for large advocacy organizations: they have at least twice as many as we do, and again, all of them are better funded.  Compare the size of the CELA Library in Canada to the size of the NLS and Bookshare in the US.  How many more books do you think they get access to? We're not talking two or three times more: it's something in the range of hundreds to thousands of times more.

Of course, they did just elect Trump.  So the number of days blind people can continue to live in the US in safety, never mind employment, are strictly numbered.  

However, please stop actively harming those of us who are unemployed and desperate, by advocating against the only legal framework that has been proven to offer any help at all.

You will be able to do more than you think. Knitting is definitely  something you will be able to continue  to do! Blind people knit, cook, write computer code, teach, raise babies, woodwork, play video games, reddit.. among  other things. I like to chop veggies without looking to practice.. also learn to touch type now if you don't  already. And also just ask people here about anything you want to do. They will help you problem solve a way to do it.

Realizing that blindness will be a challenge, not the end of my life as I know it, has really helped me let go of my fear surrounding blindness. Blindness is the most feared disability by most people. Most people know very little about blindness or people who are blind. A large part of that fear comes from a lack of knowledge and exposure. Asking questions and doing research helps with that. 

Also, emotionally it helps to hear the stories of others who have experienced this. People to check out:

John Hull, the man whose audio diary became the soundtrack to the short film ""Notes on Blindness.""

Ryan Knighton, he is very funny. I just read his book about having a daughter. I was not terribly impressed with his strategies for adapting to parenting. He let his wife sort of take it over. He should have asked for baby specific training from his local resources.. but he is very funny. I like his talks on YouTube best. The book is like that, but is improved by his delivery. So I would youtube it. Also book is out of print :P

Molly Burke &amp;Tommy Edison XP are both blind youtubers. I like Molly for simple how to videos, like how she does technology and make up. She also tends to ramble so tje how to videos are best. Also she is adorable. I like Tommy cause he is just so happy and jokey. He is blind from birth and he is just such a happy guy.

Also, as someone losing their vision, I LOVE this discussion between John Hull and Zoltan about choosing to continue or stop seeing in their minds. It is really a unique question only people like us will have to find an answer for.

I am glad you have a support system pets and spouses are the best. Husband and a cat for me :)

Hi there!

Thank you so much for responding. Your experiences are really helpful to me gaining a better understanding.

If I had a guide dog he would also definitely know his way to the liquor store, I saw someone on another site saying their dog would often take them to the pub by mistake because they went there so often.

Going to a new place certainly seems like it would be a hassle sometimes so this is what I'm hoping to target with my project. I'm looking to create a system where you are able to enter a new destination and have your dog lead you there in order to learn the route more easily. The dog would be told whether to go left, right or straight by my product, but of course you would still instruct it when to cross a road. My thinking is that it would be used the first 1-3 times when travelling a new route in order to get confident. Does this sound like an easier way to learn how to get to new locations?

142,"This was an awesome response. Thank you! I've been trying to sort through it all so it helps to get insight. 

I have low vision and easily pass as sighted - I don't need a cane, I avoid wearing my sunglasses/purple lenses because I'm vain (and didn't get them until recently so I've already adapted enough as I just have increased loss of acuity outside not total acuity loss) - so I don't always feel fully in the Blind community and I really don't face a lot of the well intentioned but completely misguided service opportunities. Most people just assume I'm faking it or somehow not trying hard enough to see (which will never make sense to me... ) or completely forget I struggle (which is cool with me. I don't really like the idea of my vision defining me. I can make accommodations for myself easily enough after 23 years of vision loss). Because of all of this I still get a bit queasy and unsure when I see service activities like this and actually a bit frustrated because it reinforces traditional views of blindness.

No, the blind woman doesn't need you to read to her. She probably has a CCTV. But you know what she and other low vision individuals might really need? A ride to the damn grocery store, (and help reading labels sometimes). Uber changed my life. I didn't really have anyone in my life that I could easily catch rides to places from. In my last town I lived out of the way from everyone I knew (but right by the college campus so I could walk to class) and people made a big deal about being asked for a ride to the grocery store. And then since I don't appear visually impaired people will often keep forgetting I can't drive for a legitimate reason and treat me like I'm lazy, and the entire time I feel guilty for having asked in the first place. I really wish uber would offer a lower cost for riders with disabilities.

Free option: visit one of a dozen websites that convert text to braille. Print the braille onto thick paper, then hold it up to a light and poke holes from the back to the front. Kind of ghetto but totally works.

Better: order a braille slate and stylus. I just found one on Amazon Prime for $15. Now use the computer again to convert, but use the slate and stylus to make the braille instead of a pin.

There are definitely services but they tend to be pricey, like $20 per page. If you find someone with a braille embosser, though, they might be able to make you a deal. The reason the prices are so high is because it's a niche specialty and hard to make a living doing braille otherwise, and also a lot of work comes from businesses who need things in braille to comply with the law so they will pay whatever it costs.

152,"Oh goodness. Well, I totally understand about Facebook politics (yuck) but perhaps a vision only no friends type of a profile might be helpful, I know I've found the resources there invaluable. If not there are a few websites: national federation for the blind, Perkins school for the blind, and wonderbaby which has great articles. My son has cortical visual impairment (cvi) from brain bleeds and hydrocephalus caused by prematurity (cvi is when the brain doesn't process what the eyes see very well. He sees bright toys best when they are against a solid background and when there is some movement involved, if you think her blindness may be from cvi I highly recommend you look up Dr. Christine Roman in Pennsylvania, she is the leading expert in the US and cvi is still relatively unknown by some eye doctors. Also the fb groups for cvi are great and I am happy to help in any way I can. But I digress.) He also has optic nerve atrophy from hydrocephalus where the nerve appears pale. 

As my son is under three, we have early intervention helping us and they found us a TVI consultant from the local school for the blind who comes and works with us. You should look into finding a TVI or OM to come work with your daughter, perhaps by contacting the EI program nearest you and asking for resources even if they can't provide you services they should be able to direct you to help. If she is behind in motor skills you may also need to seek out physical or occupational therapy and finding one who is familiar with children who are blind would be a wonderful thing. (Edit: I just realized you're not in the US so....that may not work in your country, sorry!) An OM would help her with her cane, too, if she uses one. 

I believe there are annual conferences for families who have a child or parent who is blind...we have never been but it sounds great.   (Again, US) 

For us, we wanted toys that have good texture and sounds, light especially for his cvi.

Well, I totally understand about Facebook politics (yuck) but perhaps a vision only no friends type of a profile might be helpful, I know I've found the resources there invaluable. If not there are a few websites: national federation for the blind, <PERSON> school for the blind, and wonderbaby which has great articles. My son has cortical visual impairment (cvi) from brain bleeds and hydrocephalus caused by prematurity (cvi is when the brain doesn't process what the eyes see very well. He sees bright toys best when they are against a solid background and when there is some movement involved, if you think her blindness may be from cvi I highly recommend you look up Dr. <PERSON> in <LOCATION>, she is the leading expert in the <LOCATION> and cvi is still relatively unknown by some eye doctors. Also the fb groups for cvi are great and I am happy to help in any way I can. But I digress.) He also has optic nerve atrophy from hydrocephalus where the nerve appears pale. 

As my son is under three, we have early intervention helping us and they found us a TVI consultant from the local school for the blind who comes and works with us. You should look into finding a TVI or OM to come work with your daughter, perhaps by contacting the EI program nearest you and asking for resources even if they can't provide you services they should be able to direct you to help. If she is behind in motor skills you may also need to seek out physical or occupational therapy and finding one who is familiar with children who are blind would be a wonderful thing. (Edit: I just realized you're not in the <LOCATION> <URL>at may not work in your country, sorry!) An OM would help her with her cane, too, if she uses one. 

I believe there are annual conferences for families who have a child or parent who is blind...we have never been but it sounds great.   (Again, <LOCATION>)

167,"here is a quick update with some of the steps I done to increase the usability of OS X. Maybe someone will find this useful. 

1) I never managed to find a way to adjust the sensitivity so it would be the same with and without zoom. But I did find a ""workaround"". 
I installed a small tool called cursorsense. It allowed me to decrease the amount of acceleration AND increase the sensitivity. I have set it to max (1950) and now its ""usable"" while zoomed in. Just note that the mouse become highly sensitive while zoom is disabled. 

2) I  disable scroll acceleration using a tool called SmoothMouse. With this app I also configured a number of buttons on my Logitech MX master mouse to increase/decrease and toggle the magnification. 

3) I have configured BetterTouchTool to do a number of tasks. 
a) Toggle the magnifier on/off when clicking on the trackpad with 3 fingers. 
b) Show the current windows ""apple/window menu"" as a context menu. It allows me to access all the menu items without having to move the mouse to the upper left of the screen. 
c) I have been using OS X's text-to-speech feature to read selected text. I have set up a macro in BTT so a click with 4 fingers (in Safari) will load the page in reader mode, elect all text on the page and start reading.

168,"I briefly used an Ambutech but it didn't last long at all. It was brand new, fresh out of the box when I got it before the locking mechanisms gave out. My best friend's dad is a professor of engineering, and said that the cane was too heavy and long for the locking mechanisms. Needless to say, my school district's O&amp;M guy said that he'll be blacklisting their canes, as he's had this problem multiple times before. Luckily I keep a folding graphite cane in my band director's office just in case my cane breaks. It's a little short for me and very wobbly, but it makes an okay backup.

I'm relatively familiar with Krav Maga. I learned how to disarm people who have a knife or gun, which is handy. I do have an advantage in a fight, because people are scared of me for some reason. I'm the only blind guy most of them have ever met I guess, and the cane and sunglasses must scare  them. Most of the guys doing the jumping are medium to small sized. Like I said, high school punks. My intention isn't to fight them, just to keep them at bay until someone comes and helps out or I manage to hurt one of them so the others run. If I got in a fight with one of the football players I'd be screwed, but they're dumb and tend to do it in the middle of the halls, which historically never ends well for them. 

I would love a kubotan, but that is most definitely not kosher at school. They'd suspend me the second anyone saw it, or anything remotely similar. That's why I'd prefer to just have my cane be my weapon, as I always have that with me and in use. No need to reach for anything, just swing it as hard as I can at them and they're down. My biggest problem is that I really can't smuggle anything in that could help me. People have gotten in trouble just for having a tiny little pocket knife on them, and anything club-like would go over even worse. Looks like I may have to commission something special from a metal or wood shop, if there isn't something available for me mass market

182,"&gt; How big does your cane fold up to be? 

I'm using the [Ambutech slim-line folding graphite cane](https://ambutech.com/shop-online/folding-slim-line-graphite-cane). It's a light-duty mobility cane and mine folds up to be about 8.5in - making it super portable. I recently switched from a more heavy-duty one with fewer sections that was about 15in folded.  

&gt; If your taking your cane with you does that mean you have to take a bag with you too? 

Or, for this particular one, a large pocket works, too, but I usually carry a small bag anyway.

&gt; Does it fold out like a tent pole or more like a telescope?

Tent pole. I considered a telescoping one because of how compact it could get, but in the end, I decided against it because it would be slower to extend/collapse, and also because it's easy with a telescoping cane to end up with it not being quite the same length every time, which can be confusing when using it to do things like judge the distance of a step.

&gt; What sort of feed back does the cane give, do you think it varies from cane to cane?

I think the sensitivity varies a bit from cane to cane and tip to tip, and also technique, but in general, changes in texture and elevation, judging distance, changes to surface material based on both texture and sound, etc. There are caning techniques for finding doorways, door handles, and doing more complex things, but they're not typically ones I need due to the nature of my vision loss. My visual acuity is enough to see things like that, but I have no depth perception and no peripheral vision, the effects of both of which are made worse by bad lighting. 

&gt; What is the grip like on the cane? 

The slim-line cane that I have has a fairly lightweight foam grip. More heavy duty canes have a rubber grip that often more closely resembling a golf club grip. I think that would probably be more durable for everyday/long-term use. But for my needs, the foam grip is fine and comfortable. 

&gt; How long have you been using the cane?

This particular one, only a few weeks. Canes in general, periodically for the past 6yrs, and more consistently for the past maybe 6 months. No changes in my vision, just less desire to put myself in situations where I risk injury.

The closest thing I had to a relationship was an Internet thing with a 17 year old girl when I was 20, who proceeded to run away a year later after learning that I was visually impaired.  At the time I worked as a systems analyst for a big company and was fully independent, but I never told her about my visual impairment, because I didn't feel that it was a problem myself and didn't think it was important to her, so I guess I kind of defrauded her expectations.  She never told me why she ran away, not even 8 years later, when I contacted her again in hopes to actually meet her and discuss the subject to bring myself some closure, but when I noticed that things were going wrong she told me that she had radically changed her mind after learning something about me, and since my visual impairment was the only thing about which I wasn't straight forward with her, it could only be it.

So it was a challenge finding her a solution that allows her to call people without requiring her to understand much about technology. Someone got her a ""Vocally 3"" device, but managing the phonebook was cumbersome, recording names became increasingly frustrating as you added more (""this name sounds too similar to another recorded name""), and it eventually broke anyway.

I got her a pay-as-you-go cell phone (I only wanted WiFi capability, not actual cell service), and I got her a Google Voice number. I got her a Samsung phone, because it has a tactile button at the bottom, and that activates the ""OK, Google"" listener.

I found an app on the app store called ""Voice Plus"", and it allows someone with a Google Voice number to place a call through another phone. This is important, because she's used to her home phone and how it works.

So now, the Voice Plus app is configured so that she can use her Samsung phone to say, ""OK, Google, call John Smith"", then the Google Voice service calls her home number, and when she answers the call, it rings through to whatever number is stored in her contacts for John Smith.

Even that took her a couple weeks to get used to. But she seems to be doing well with it now. It's not 100%, but it's the best solution I've been able to find.

So now, the Voice Plus app is configured so that she can use her Samsung phone to say, ""OK, Google, call <PERSON>"", then the Google Voice service calls her home number, and when she answers the call, it rings through to whatever number is stored in her contacts for <PERSON>.

Even that took her a couple weeks to get used to. But she seems to be doing well with it now. It's not 100%, but it's the best solution I've been able to find. I can edit and add contacts from my computer, so there's nothing cumbersome about that, and in the instances where it has trouble understanding her, I can look up the number in her contacts and put the call through myself, regardless of where I am, as long as I have internet access.","[{'start': 1367, 'end': 1375, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1206, 'end': 1214, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

218,"&gt; If one wants an accessible society, doing it by force doesn't get the job done

That's hilarious.

Are you saying you seriously, honestly believe that every business would put up ramps and whatnot and consider the minute details of access voluntarily if it weren't the law? 

Do you *really* believe that schools, employers, etc would provide thousands of dollars of braille books, accessibility hardware and software, etc if it wasn't the law? 

Do you think businesses (which still often have to be legally battled to comply, see Uber) would widely embrace service dogs if they weren't forced to allow them there? 

It wasn't that long ago that it wasn't (and in many parts of the world it isn't) so you won't have to look too far back to get your answer. 

The law is good. It isn't ""abuse"" to file lawsuits when a legitimate access issue exists, even if you find 1,00 of them. It also isn't abuse to be compensated (and have your lawyer paid) for violations of the law. 

Are there some people who bring about unfounded lawsuits? Sure. Does that mean the system is broken, or that we should go to an ""ad hoc"" system of hoping for the good faith of businesses first? Hell no. ",,,,-shacklebolt-,,,1481235056,t5_2qpec,t3_5goxsw,t1_davxd3i,1,1483582920,0,0,dayj5xy,Blind,,,,,

Like others said, your going to have to be good about keeping stuff off the floor. More than you would expect most likely. Other things are if you're being very quiet and they don't already know youre there I tend to make some noise, say hi when they enter room, that sort of thing. Feel free to offer an elbow if youre headed to the same place. Try not to feel awkward about common phases, both of you know that ""did you see that movie"" isn't actually about seeing, and if you try to correct it, it makes something innocuous a little awkward. If youre going for a handshake or highfive etc, you gotta let them know. One of the ones I'm sure you already know but can take a little getting used to it that nodding and other visual queues that you dont even think about won't work, in general you're going to have to communicate verbally a bit more than you would with most other people. In the end of the day, I've never seen my dad be disabled in the sense that he is unable to do something, and while I can't speak for your roommate I imagine it will be similar.

edit: One other thing that I forgot that isn't mentioned here and it can be a biggie: Most blind people will look at you when they're talking to you, however obviously they won't make eye contact. I only mention this because it's such an important part of how sighted people interact with one another that we don't even really think about it.

Thank you so much for responding. Your experiences are really helpful to me gaining a better understanding. 

If I had a guide dog he would also definitely know his way to the liquor store, I saw someone on another site saying their dog would often take them to the pub by mistake because they went there so often.

Going to a new place certainly seems like it would be a hassle sometimes so this is what I'm hoping to target with my project. I'm looking to create a system where you are able to enter a new destination and have your dog lead you there in order to learn the route more easily. The dog would be told whether to go left, right or straight by my product, but of course you would still instruct it when to cross a road. My thinking is that it would be used the first 1-3 times when travelling a new route in order to get confident. Does this sound like an easier way to learn how to get to new locations?

That is kind of the point of VESA; endless options.

Go to your local computer store (in fact, go to several of them) or a home theatre store or a store for video/photo equipment and see what they can either bring from a shelf or get from their suppliers.(they all have equipment using VESA mounts, so they are likely to have a supplier for these things) 

Remember to decide on a monitor *first* so that you know what weight the stand must support before you go buy it. And overdo it a bit, the stand will likely survive a few of your monitors and it would be a shame if you had to replace it just because you can afford a larger and heavier monitor the next time.

265,"I mean, there's only so much you can improve on a stick, and we have some pretty high-tech sticks these days. Personally, I use a folding graphite cane with a metal tip. I only need it in low light, or when I'm in unfamiliar places.

Don't change the aesthetics - people get really confused when a white cane doesn't look like a white cane. It's a tool, not a fashion statement.

270,"Don't worry about it.  If she needs help, she'll probably ask.  If she seems to be struggling, it's OK to offer; but don't feel like you have to.  A blind person in college is likely to have it pretty together already, just to make it that far.

Other than that, Just try not to leave things where they could be tripped over or stepped on or sat on or whatever.  My rule is generally if I step on something someone living with me left on the floor, and it breaks, it's there own fault for leaving it there.  Pretty harsh, but I'm not going to walk gingerly around my own living room, or use a cane in my own house, in case someone left something out where it wasn't supposed to be.  It sounds like you're in a university dorm, so I doubt you're going to be randomly moving what little furniture you have, so that's not going to be an issue.  I have knocked over half-full drinks that people left unattended before, so I guess if you're in the habit of leaving half full cups of liquid sitting around, that might be something to be aware of.  But if your dorm is anything like the usual dorm room, you've probably got your own desk and maybe your own dresser, and there's no reason your roommate would be feeling around for stuff on your desk, so odds are you're drinks are safe anyway.  

The best advice in your case though is just to relax.  Blind people have lived with sighted people all of our lives; we're pretty used to the process of working through whatever accommodations are needed.  There might be a few awkward days as you adjust to one another, but it just isn't going to be that big of a deal.  And yes, the process of adjusting does go both ways.  If your blind roommate does things that drive you crazy, don't feel like you should hold it in, just because she's blind.  She might not even be aware of the problem; as an example, I have a habit of using my laptop at all hours of the night. When I first was living in close quarters with someone, I had no idea I had my screen brightness up as high as it would go, and the light was so bright it was keeping the other person awake.  I figured because I was being quiet, it was fine.  If they'd only spoken to me sooner, they could have saved themselves a few sleepless weeks.  I figured out where the brightness setting was, and actually got the screen to turn off completely. A win for them, because they could sleep soundly again, and a win for me, because my battery lasted like three times longer!  Communication really is the key.

279,"I've been a white cane user for over two years now, and I fully treat the white cane as a tool that is necessary for me to get around. I have a few different canes, primarily using a fully white foldable NFB cane with a metal tip. I sometimes swap this out for a graphite Revolution cane, also foldable and very sturdy, and that one has a red lower section. I also have an Ambutech aluminum folding cane with a large ball tip for hiking.

Here in the US, I've noticed that more people tend to run into or not immediately understand what my fully white NFB cane is being used for, despite me obviously using it in a sweeping and clearing pattern. The blind tend to be portrayed as always using a white cane with a red lower section in most forms of media, whether it is an illustrated book when in school, in TV shows, movies, and even in information pamphlets from the DMV/driver education booklets.

People tend to avoid my Revolution cane as it looks and feels a lot stronger than the fiberglass NFB cane.

Ultimately, the cane needs to be seen as a tool and communicate the fact that the person using it is visually impaired. The cane needs to come with an ability to easily interchange tips for various navigation types, whether for two-point touch or constant contact, and different terrain types. The grip needs to be comfortable for long periods of use; the NFB cane has a foam grip which works quite well. the Revolution cane has a solid rubber grip which is shaped to make the carrying hand position easier which makes quick manipulation a lot better, yet after a lot of use the rubber tends to start coming off. 

The use will vary from person to person, as will the weight and construction. I don't like using rigid canes since I like the versatility and portability of the folding canes, yet many of the blind people I know use both in various situations.

Ultimately, I think the only thing I would like at this point in regards to the canes is a tungsten carbide or strong metal tip to prolong the life of using it in a constant contact method.

I should also mention, trying to win a fight with one person is going to be hard enough... winning a fight with multiple people would be much, MUCH harder.

302,"There are, of course, civilian jobs in a police department too. Jobs that you are not the least bit better at just because you have trained as a police officer. And, frankly, jobs where policemens skills in firearms, tactical driving, situation assessment and whatnot would be a complete waste because your job takes place in an office.

You don't need to talk to a police officer to report your bike stolen. You need to talk to someone who works for the police department and knows the procedure and the forms to fill in. And that person can probably be visually impaired without it impacting the service given.

So, it kind of depends on if you live in a place big enough that they need to employ people specialising in helping the public fill out forms, or if that is a part-time duty of someone with a shield.

And, come to think of it, if you happen to have skills that would come in handy in a forensics lab, then you could very well work in one. You won't see much of the real world, but that is probably true in a lot of labs anyway.

311,"Hi goaway432. Me too. Well Retinitis Pigmentosa... not macula degeneration . Anyway, my advice is to keep coming here. This subreddit has been my greatest comfort. There are amazing, wonderful people here on the whole spectrum of vision from sighted friends to totally blind from birth. Their stories inspire me, their accomplishments humble me, and their kindness continually renews me when my grieving soul is desperately in need of renewal.

 In the months since receiving the news myself, I have somehow found a way to not be afraid and the people here are one of the primarily  reasons for that. These people here and my family and friends in my life. But it was here I learned about blindness, which I needed to do to let go of my fears.

For my own story. My advice with your doctors is be persistent. I waited months for an appointment  and months more for testing. Toward the end I got angry with the snails pace of the medical community and found a genetics lab and sent them my blood directly.

 If you have to cry at a FedEx employee to make them send your blood across the country, don't  worry. I'm  not saying that's normal. I'm saying there is no normal. Do whatever you have to and don't apologize for it. If you need those answers get them, come hell or high water. And if the doctors suck at following up or calling you or getting you the modicum of information you need to sort out your next move mentally or emotionaly, then fire them. 

Badger the hell out of whoever you need to. Cause you aren't dying. You will be back burnered. And that's kind of wonderful, because YOU ARE NOT DYING! Your life is just changing. 

Apart from that, there is eventually vocational rehabilitation and guide dogs to think of.  There is the basic problem solving that comes with adapting to a new life.. but that's for later.. that is for when you need it and this sub is great for giving you advice on that score. Any ""how to anything"" you need help with gets an immediate response around here.

But before that, I would recommend giving yourself the space to grieve. We, who lose our vision must, grieve. It is a very real loss. Talk it out, write it out. Don't  lose yourself in despair, but let yourself mourn.  We are here if you need that space. And I am personally here. I'll  keep an eye out for your posts.  It's a fairly small sub.

I have found that mobile applications seem to update and move faster with accessibility feedback rather than websites; hell, complaining about Lyft on Twitter got me my current job. :-)

Edit: wanted to add my experience with cards against humanity. I used to have no trouble ordering new updates from them through their website, but something happened recently where the shipment option was unable to be activated using voiceover either on mobile or with a computer. I was trying to order the geek pack, and when I was unable to complete my request, I sent them constructive feedback about the issue and asked if they could just send me one and use my currently existing payment information to buy it. They were extraordinarily apologetic and went absolutely above and beyond and ended up sending me every single expansion, the bigger blacker box, and the base set along with the pack I originally wanted. It was a tremendous care package that was unexpected. I put braille on all of those cards since I already owned them all and donated the set to the lighthouse here in <LOCATION>. I haven't had the need to order anything recently, so I am unsure if they have fixed this problem yet.","[{'start': 2742, 'end': 2752, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1092, 'end': 1100, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 150, 'end': 160, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Its a 32 inch 16:9 monitor and i love the size. It is mounted on an arm which is attached to the desk. My monitor arm uses a ""desk clamp"" so no drilling was needed. 
I bought it because of its size but it have a few unique features that I use every day. It has a ""low blue light mode"" and unlike most monitors it does not use pwm for backlight control. In other words it doesn't control the brightness by turning the LED's off and on, but instead by regulating the voltage to these. In my experience the combination reduces eye strain especially at night where I can reduce the brightness to minimum without the ""flickering"" often experienced on other monitors. 
The best thing is that the monitor is delivered with a small wired remote with three programmable buttons. I have them programmed with three different profiles. One with average brightness and accurate colours (I use this most of the day), one with max brightness and punchy colours used for videos/photos and my ""night mode"" which is lowest brightness and blue light filter enabled.

330,"For people new to vision loss, there can be a variety of reactions. Depends on many factors. So far, for my worst case scenarios, I've had someone throw a cane at me (they missed), I've had someone spit at me (also missed) and hospital staff saying I couldn't issue the client the cane because it could be used as a weapon (client was in the psych ward of a mental health hospital).

Most people, if they've come to accept their vision loss, usually pick up the basics right away. Some may need more coaxing than others. I find that cultural values also plays a large role. I am working with one young child, but the grandparents refuse to let the child use the cane, to the point where they hide the cane (the grandparents are old-country Chinese). 

For children, it depends on their age and their development. I've issued canes to children as young as 1.5 years old, but I know they wouldn't be using it formally, it is more to get them use to the cane. If it is something they do need, we usually start them with a tool called a pre-cane first (usually some PVC piping, arranged similiar to a broom or something) to get used to how it works. Generally, though, the youngest that get formal O&amp;M instruction is around 4-5ish, when they can understand commands and why we are teaching what we teach.

If you check out their website, they provide the option to change the handle colour, the shaft colour and the bottom colour. The colour change is a bit of a contentious topic, with some saying it should remain white and red, and others saying it doesn't matter. The handle colour is a minimal issue, though. I know most kids decorate parts of the handle and attack things to the loop (helps to differentiate between a dozen canes at camps and such). 

The cane height is usually measured to the sternum, modified by their walking speed. Some teachers prefer to measure the cane up the nose, for added length, but I personally find that a bit unweildy. 

Most people hold the cane ""wand"" style, but some hold it ""pencil"" style. I find holding it like a wand gives the maximium control, but it does depend on personal taste. The golf club style handle is pretty classic, but there are some other handle designs. Those are usually for a specifically medical reason, though. I just recently helped an OT on making a prosthetic brace for a client to hold a cane, because the client lost all their fingers in a fire.

351,"Alright, so I'll try to reply in parts as we break down the issue: 

**TRAVEL**

- Some cane travel instruction is probably not enough, and many people who are partially sighted benefit from sleepshade (or blindfold) instruction at least some of the time. Residual vision, as you know, can be *so* misleading. The step to take now is to start using your cane 100% of the time out of the house, no excuses. (One of the reasons I recommend looking into the residential type programs is because of the emphasis on quality, comprehensive independence skills including cane travel for every situation.) 

- I highly suggest getting the [NFB free cane]
(https://nfb.org/free-cane-program) or (if you have means and don't want it for free) [buying a fiberglass or carbon fiber cane from them instead.]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/prodtype.asp?prodtype=1&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) It is not often provided locally, it is lighter than the folding ambutech and revolution type cane you probably have, and if you don't like it stick it in your closet as a backup. 

**CLEANING**

- Which cleaning tasks are you struggling with? The base of ""cleaning"" is going to be ""keeping things neat."" If you can't see things, finding them again and keeping areas clean can be an issue if you don't become consistent with where you set things down or put them away. From there, you just have to be methodical with your cleaning tasks. I vacuum the whole carpet, row by row, because I can't tell where the ""dirty spots"" are easily. I wipe the whole bathroom mirror on a regular basis. I wipe down the stove top after use to make sure there is no mess, and so on. For dish washing by hand, just quickly run your hand over the entire dish! Then you can feel if it is gunky in any spots.

What cleaning things aren't going quite right for you? Let me know. 

**COOKING:**

How good of a cook were you to start with? What types of food are you cooking, and what sorts of issues are you encountering? 

- One tool I use all the time is my silicone-coated locking tongs [like these.]
(https://www.amazon.com/StarPack-Premium-Silicone-Kitchen-12-Inch/dp/B00KDV5RZY/) (and I want to get silicone spatulas.) I use it to ""feel"" around my nonstick pans safely, easily flip things, etc. 

- For measuring, there's [braille labeled]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=1137&amp;cat=19&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) measuring cups, or if you have color discrimination, [color coded ones.]
(https://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Measuring-Cups-Set-5/dp/B00I5PTBCA/r)  There's also [bright measuring spoons]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=968&amp;cat=19&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) that you can label as well. 

- A [talking food themometer]
(http://www.thermoworks.com/Talking-Thermometer) can help with tasks like ""how done is this meat"" and ""will that turkey send my family to the hospital"" lol. Very handy. 

- For chopping things, I use one hand to hold the knife and have the other one OVER the non-sharp part of the knife (if you need to hold food) so there is absolutely no risk of your fingers being in the knife zone. If in doubt, go slow and carefully. I personally always leave my used knives on one side of the cutting board with the tip facing the board, and then I put all dirty knives on one specific spot on the side of my sink with the handles facing me. Some also tuck knives under the cutting board when stepping away from it. 

- If you have trouble seeing liquids go into cups, a [liquid level indicator]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=1081&amp;cat=19&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) is good for hot cups, but just poke your finger over the rim for cold stuff.

- If you have trouble telling how done food is, FEEL, SMELL, and LISTEN to your food as it cooks often. Follow recipes until you're familiar with how long something will take. Use the thermometer if there is a safety concern. Crock pot recipes can be great because there are many easy ones to learn that have a huge window of forgiveness as far as cooking time, and a simple dial crock pot (off, low, high, warm) is very accessible. 

- Microwave, dishwasher, stove and oven, etc buttons can all be labeled with [stick on bumps.]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=605&amp;cat=111&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) For example, I put bumps on the numbers, power, add minute, start and stop button for my microwave. I also put a button where the ""light wash"" for my dishwasher is and know that one click further is regular and another is heavy. (You can also use this to label a bunch of types of washing machines. Some are more accessible than others unfortunately.) 

- Are you practiced with food shopping independently? Are you making plans for the week, grocery lists, etc? How do you manage knowing what is in your fridge, pantry, etc right now? 

So that's a start of things I can think off the top of my head, but there's probably a bunch more. If you give me more feedback I will try to be more specific. 

**Nail clipping** I haven't had an issue with. Just use the metal tip of the clipper to feel where your finger pad starts if you're not sure, pull AWAY from that area, and then clip. Then I file my nail with a filing board so they're round and even. 

**Fitness**

- If you can get a gym membership you can do pretty much everything, but you will need someone to show you how to use the electric machines the first time. Always take your cane to the gym for safety. Outside of the gym, depends on what you like! A local running or hiking group would be a great start if you want some outdoor recreation. Personally I love going out for long walks, and exploring my town. The ""care and feeding"" book I recommended (in conjunction with quality, sufficient O&amp;M instruction) will really help you build confidence in traveling independently with practice, and being outside and exercising is huge for your mental well being as well as physical. 

- (BTW, for said exploring, there's a lot of good GPS software out there for blind people. I use Nearby Explorer Online for Android, Blindspot is very popular for iOS, just to start.) 

- For **reading** tasks, [get KNFB reader.]
(http://www.knfbreader.com/) You might be able to get rehab to pay for it, although it is currently only $19.99 on android (the usual $99.99 on iOS.) It can read all sorts of printed text like mail, menus, etc. Great software for this job. 

- If you aren't learning braille, get started. [I love this free book.]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=758&amp;cat=50&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) It is grade 1 and grade 2 braille, NOT UEB, so you will eventually have to relearn some things (but a lot of material out there still exists in grade 2, and it is a good primer to technique, the alphabet, numbers, etc.) Some other [braille instruction books]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/prodtype.asp?prodtype=50&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) are in UEB. Sign up for local classes, too! 

- The NFB will send you a [free slate and stylus]
(https://nfb.org/free-slate-program) to write braille with. You can use braille to label all sorts of foods (spice jars, canned goods, bottles of sauces), cleaners and soaps and such, and items at home to start with! There is [stick on labeling tape]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=1045&amp;cat=128&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) [reusable labels with elastic]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=1048&amp;cat=128&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) and [reusable magnetic tape for cans.]
(https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/product.asp?product=1146&amp;cat=128&amp;ph=&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) So a lot of options. 

- If you haven't already, sign up for the [NLS]
(https://www.loc.gov/nls/) and [Bookshare]
(https://www.bookshare.org/cms/) if you can. Paper and digital braille, physical and digital audiobooks, etc are all freely available to blind people either as downloads or mailed for free to your home. Bookshare charges a yearly subscription, but not if you're a student. 

- Eventually you might want to look at ""big ticket"" purchases such as commercial accessibility software, braille displays, etc. But that is often through vocational rehabilitation so will come later.  Are you working or going to school right now? What is your plan with that? 

- **Emotionally,** the right therapist who understands vision problems can help a great deal. I know a few people who have greatly benefited from the counseling services offered by local blindness organizations. 

I've written about [losing my sight]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/5627a2/feeling_disheartened/) and how a lot of the process, for me, was emotionally coming to grips with the vastness of the change instead of trying to minimize it. Does that make sense? It's a big fucking deal in the beginning, and having what you need (practically and emotionally) makes all the difference. 

(And look, I know this is a lot of info, but I mean it when I say that I (and many others on this sub) want to help and want you to be able to succeed. If you want to ask more questions now, or you want to ask more questions next year, let us know.)",,,,-shacklebolt-,,,1481240188,t5_2qpec,t3_5h9gfk,t1_dayj2mg,2,1483584852,0,0,dayn48k,Blind,,,,"Alright, so I'll try to reply in parts as we break down the issue: 

**TRAVEL**

- Some cane travel instruction is probably not enough, and many people who are partially sighted benefit from sleepshade (or blindfold) instruction at least some of the time. Residual vision, as you know, can be *so* misleading. The step to take now is to start using your cane 100% of the time out of the house, no excuses. (One of the reasons I recommend looking into the residential type programs is because of the emphasis on quality, comprehensive independence skills including cane travel for every situation.) 

- I highly suggest getting the [NFB free cane]
(<URL>) or (if you have means and don't want it for free) [buying a fiberglass or carbon fiber cane from them instead.]
(<URL>) It is not often provided locally, it is lighter than the folding ambutech and revolution type cane you probably have, and if you don't like it stick it in your closet as a backup. 

**CLEANING**

- Which cleaning tasks are you struggling with? The base of ""cleaning"" is going to be ""keeping things neat."" If you can't see things, finding them again and keeping areas clean can be an issue if you don't become consistent with where you set things down or put them away. From there, you just have to be methodical with your cleaning tasks. I vacuum the whole carpet, row by row, because I can't tell where the ""dirty spots"" are easily. I wipe the whole bathroom mirror on a regular basis. I wipe down the stove top after use to make sure there is no mess, and so on. For dish washing by hand, just quickly run your hand over the entire dish! Then you can feel if it is gunky in any spots.

What cleaning things aren't going quite right for you? Let me know.

And this particular lock is actually pretty secure.  While it doesn't have nifty features like lock and unlock notifications, that's because it can't connect to wifi at all.  It just depends on the security of bluetooth pairing/cryptography.  The big weakness is that Kevo themselves control my private key (that I need to authorize new devices on the lock), so if someone hacks Kevo's servers, they could generate authorizations for any Kevo device.  But even if they do that, they still need to get within five feet of my actual lock to trigger it to unlock, as the lock itself has no network connection.  So I'm pretty OK with the security tradeoff.  Oh, and if the Kevo servers go away, I can't authorize new devices to unlock my lock. But the old devices would keep working.

362,"Howdy. I've leaked out of the /r/voip sub.

Anyway there's a wide range of ways to do this. They are as follows...

**1. Use a softphone on your PC as the phone.** Then you only need the computer headset. Not recommended by me as I am a big fan of separating the phone from the PC. Having worked in the telecoms industry for a while, I can tell you that softphones tend to get annoying when your trying to fluster about your desk during work.

**2. Use a multi adaptor or a multi audio compatible headset.** Plantronics will sell you a fair few devices that are multi device compatible. The ones that can multicast (I.e. play audio streams over each other) are expensive. The [Plantronics Savi series](http://www.plantronics.com/uk/product/savi-700) will allow you to connect PC audio, SIP phone audio and bluetooth audio together into the same headset and multicast them over each other. Like I said, it's expensive. You need the base station types such as the Savi 700 as the T21 is a very basic phone and doesn't offer any connection options outside the RJ9 connectors.

**3. Use an adaptor.** Use an adaptor that offers RJ9 to 3.5mm conversion and a pass through cable to the ""LINE IN"" port on your computers sound card. The downside to this method is the caller will hear the output as well.

**4. Upgrade your phone.** The Yealink T46 would be an ideal choice. It offers bluetooth connectivity which gives it multicast options.

**5. Double up.** Probably the easiest and cheapest method. Purchase a mono (As in one ear only) headset (Wireless or otherwise) for the phone.

I've leaked out of the /r/voip sub.

Anyway there's a wide range of ways to do this. They are as follows...

**1. Use a softphone on your PC as the phone.** Then you only need the computer headset. Not recommended by me as I am a big fan of separating the phone from the PC. Having worked in the telecoms industry for a while, I can tell you that softphones tend to get annoying when your trying to fluster about your desk during work.

**2. Use a multi adaptor or a multi audio compatible headset.** Plantronics will sell you a fair few devices that are multi device compatible. The ones that can multicast (I.e. play audio streams over each other) are expensive. The [Plantronics Savi series](<URL>) will allow you to connect PC audio, SIP phone audio and bluetooth audio together into the same headset and multicast them over each other. Like I said, it's expensive.

But in my view the magnifier in Android is far more useful than the zoom functionality in ios. I personally prefer using the magnifier to using speech so my Android phone is my daily driver while the iPhones rarely leaves my desk. But it all depends on the individual person I guess. 
If you decide on an iPhone I would advice you to buy the 7 plus and not the older models. The 7 plus is water resistent. It might sound like a gimmick but its not.

Why wouldn't they? People don't give a damn. We all still shop at walmart, even though they still sell products made in sweatshops by children.  The only way anyone can be compelled to do the right thing is by government requirement.  

&gt; injecting money into market would create accessible options.

Hahahahahaha no!  Injecting money into the market just creates terrible options.  Checked the price of Braille printers lately? Those companies know that the governments will fund blind people to purchase them, so they don't even try to make them cheaper.  If it was the law that businesses had to purchase Braille printers, and pay for them themselves, I bet we'd have four or five companies competing to make cheaper models.  Laws like the ADA do wind up injecting money into the market.  But instead of the government deciding who and what to fund, instead it just sets out the requirements. The free market gets to decide how to fill them.  ",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1481252441,t5_2qpec,t3_5goxsw,t1_dayvpgu,2,1483589255,0,0,dayw575,Blind,,,blue1,,

I've taught blind people how to knit (mostly casting on and garter stitch, I suck as purling and casting off), and have personally knitted a scarf myself from beginning to end blindfolded (it took a while, though... casting on 8 stitches took 20 minutes the first time). 

Definitely talk to your doctor to see what can be done. There may be two things that help slow down mac degen, though.

1) Amber coloured sunglasses, especially ones that have the top and side shields. Sunglasses in general will help, as they cut down UV radiation, which is the major cause of mac degen. However, amber specifically cuts out a lot of light closer to the blue end of the spectrum, which is closer to the UV side. The red sunglasses also help, but they often cause too much colour distortion. And yellow usually doesn't cut out enought light, although yellow is good for contrast (so may be better at night). See a Low Vision Specialist (which may or may not be your eye doctor. I'm not sure how they are set up in the US, but not all eye doctors are Low Vision Specialists) for specific recommendations. I personally use Solar Shields, but the Noir brand is also pretty good.

2) Talk to your eye doctor about ocular vitamins. Specifically ones that have Lutein and zeaxanthin. they may recommend you take it, they may not. It would depend on your medical situation. 

http://www.allaboutvision.com/nutrition/lutein.htm

Also, ask your doctor about Lucentis. You may not need it yet, as that is for treating specifically wet Mac Degen, and you likely have dry mac degen. It has been useful for many of my clients, but it is also fairly expensive.

I would also suggest that you check into something called ""Full Spectrum Lighting"". Those lights are designed to replicate natural sunlight, and that does help **some** people.
