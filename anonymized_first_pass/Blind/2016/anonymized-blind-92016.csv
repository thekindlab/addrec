In my right eye the pressure was controlled with medication and several surgeries until I was 29, at which point it started to peak at 30mmHg (normal values are 10-20mmHg) and I began to lose field of view and contrast perception.  All I can see now is the color of ambient light, and even that is slowly fading away since I stopped putting in eyedrops.

I am managing okay now, I use adaptive technology on the computer for my uni work (I do most of it online), and I'm managing okay. I'm on the waiting list for a guide dog to help me be more independent.
The big issue I've been facing is that the organization I was with was training me to use my hearing to cross roads etc, which I just found really unsafe because I can only hear what is directly in front of me with my hearingaids. I also relied heavily on lip reading, which is obviously a big problem now.
I never learned sign language, I have moderate to severe nerve deafness so with hearing aids and other technology I was able to manage throughout school etc.
I'm definitely going to learn braille after all the suggestions on here! I love reading and that is not a hobby I want to lose.

He has to decrease the font size to code efficiently so the magnifier is a must. The screen magnifier and/or screen readers are also so important for improving his sitting position. If he continue as now he will probably end up having some nasty neck/back problems when getting older.

100,"I work as a notetaker and tutor for the disabled at my college, and my specialization (read: who I work most with) is with the visually impaired. I have friends that are extremely (read: EXTREMELY) affluent. And I personally have dealt with bouts of manic depression that often resulted in thoughts of suicide.

From what I can tell, she's fairly right. Being able to support yourself without a college degree can be incredibly difficult (but it is not necessary). This is doubly so for the visually impaired. Yet all of my V.I. students have tons of mentors, most of whom are blind themselves, that are accountants, mathematicians, psychiatrists, you name it, and all are very much independent. Professionals. It CAN be done, though usually with the help of a support group. There are services and organizations that help the blind. One of my students lives in a shelter for the visually impaired and is part of a local charity that supports the blind for many of their academic needs. There are options out there, but I'm not sure how it is effected by the income of parents. This leads to my next point.

Being that her parents are affluent, unless she is 24 and is not being filed as a dependent on their tax return, she will have a hard time getting financial aid for school. Until then, she will have to find a way to pay for it. I would suggest starting with community college as it is much cheaper and easier to transition into a equally cheap senior college. If she is being filed as a dependent by her parents, you could have her file her own tax return (and NOT as your dependent) so that she will have the necessary status for financial aid. I don't work for the financial aid office and I hate personal tax, so you'll have to double check most of this. From what I gather from my friends who are very well off and have since cut ties with their parents, being labeled as a dependent on the books fucks you over for aid based on the provider's income.

Finally, if she is having suicidal thoughts, she needs to seek professional help OR (and I fucking hate saying this because everyone, even my loved ones said the same to me) she will have to deal with it on her own. I think (read: know) I dealt with it by self-medication and by doing things that i loved. Reading comics, drawing comics, writing comics, getting shit faced and having pre-marital sex. I dunno. I find I still deal with this every now and then, so that might be another way of saying that professional help is NECESSARY.

This is the only insight I can provide from personal experience. It is probably all far from correct, so take it all with a grain of salt.

184,"To me, the shittiest part isn't even encouraging people to put on blindfolds, giggle and fumble around for a minute, and feel like they understand what it must be like to be blind. Everyone here in /r/blind/ of course knows that playing ""pretend blind"" in no way simulates the skills and abilities that an experienced blind person with the right tools and training has. We know that blind people can competently ""eat a meal, make your bed,"" and ""get ready for the day."" (activities the campaign suggests for your challenge.) 

The worst part of the campaign in my opinion is the video on their site simulating blindness. 

If you go to the ""howeyeseeit"" site (I will not link to not promote them) there is a video link (not audio described) which reads ""See what it's like to lose your vision."" This leads to a youtube video which reads ""#howeyeseeit"" and ""foundation fighting blindness"" and then ""FOLLOW YOUR KID."" It is a park scene with kids in it, and your kid runs off in the video as your field of vision slowly decreases (simulating RP.) 

That is offensive and dangerous. We live in a time where blind parents still sometimes get their children taken away or unnecessary evaluations into their personal lives just because they're blind, and where every blind parent has stories of doctors, or social workers, or teachers who question their ability to parent. There are real life consequences to making people believe that a blind parent couldn't safely take their child to the park and supervise them there.

200,"&gt;  I don't see why you feel offended by me correcting your misconceptions and trying to give you hope.

Saying ""you haven't researched properly"" based on the fact that she quickly replied to your posts comes off as quite assumptive and insulting. Chances are, like all of us who have gone blind, she's done plenty of research and didn't need time to beef up on her facts before replying to you. She knows her condition, she has her doctors, and you're probably the 100th well meaning person to tell her about some ""cure"" that's out there for her. 

""Hope"" for many of us doesn't mean ""spending our lives yearning for the day our vision somehow returns."" Hope like that can be destructive and emotionally consuming (as you seem to be personally experiencing yourself, I might note), especially when faced with the reality of living as a blind person now, and some uncertain future where she may have a lesser degree of visual impairment after a transplant.

- Braille is relatively expensive to produce, requires relatively expensive equipment, and requires a teacher who is competent with braille (which there is a shortage of.) Schools have a financial incentive to discourage braille use.  

- Children who are ""just"" legally blind are often encouraged by schools and/or their parents to rely on their remaining vision under the (highly misguided, IMO) mindset that they aren't ""blind enough"" to need it. 

- Parents or teachers might fear stigma 
about braille reading, and parents can be in denial about the extent of their child's visual impairment. 

- For more severely blind children, ""text to speech is enough"" is an unfortunately common belief. 

- There are a lot of misconceptions about braille being very hard to learn or use, being impractical or too slow, or that children with even minor developmental disabilities couldn't possibly ever use braille. 

- Legally, schools [must]

- The cost of braille equipment, such as a refreshable braille display to use with a computer or phone, is cost prohibitive to many blind people (especially those who can't or don't want to receive devices through govt. rehab services.)

- Adults who have been blind many years may feel they've gotten along just fine without braille up until now, so why change things? 

- Adults who are newly blind, especially later in life, receive many messages that braille is difficult or impossible to learn as an adult, that it is cumbersome and outdated, and why should you bother when TTS is everywhere? 

- Adults often carry the same mental hangups about braille being for people who are ""more disabled"" than they are, that using braille will make them look strange, etc.

I'm going to be blunt, because I believe this is something you need to hear as people who love and care for her:

There's one option you seem to be completely ignoring here: helping her accept her blindness (by personally accepting it) and helping her get the resources that she needs to move on with her life. 

Being surrounded by family members who are treating blindness like some kind of terminal illness and shuffling her around to doctors desperately trying to cure it is not going to make her sight loss less ""incredibly hard to deal with."" Giving her the message that you're ""out of options"" if she doesn't regain some sight isn't going to help her. Giving her false hope or encouraging the fantasy that one day she might regain her sight will not help. 

If her doctors are saying that her sight cannot be recovered, that means her sight cannot be recovered. It's entirely possible that in 10 or 20 or 100 years there might be a cure for her condition, but encouraging her to hold out hope for that is going to be so harmful to her. It's no way to live, stopping your life waiting to ""get better"" or chasing cures. 

Look at the [NHS information about blindness]
(http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Visual-impairment/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and also get her in touch with the [RNIB]
(http://www.rnib.org.uk/) if she isn't already.

She's been hit with a terrible blow, and there's no doubt that she will benefit from some kind of professional or group support (or both) dealing with the emotional aftermath of developing a new disability. But she also needs you guys to get out of being surrounded by your own fear of blindness, to realize that she can do almost everything she used to with the right training and experience, and to help support and encourage her as she makes this adjustment. 

You aren't out of options here. You have a choice, but I strongly urge you to consider making the choice to learn more about blindness (and the many ways she can go about doing almost everything she used to) and to help her get what she needs to be able to do what she wants.

For Windows, they can use Eclipse. It's probably the most powerful IDE for Java out there, and it's totally accessible.

Aside from that, teacher can/should e-mail any piece of code they wrote during class. That will help student to have a better understanding of what teacher was talking about when working on that code.

308,"I'm going to offer a completely different perspective than /u/roozgirl/. My personal perspective and experience informs my answer, and your answer might end up being different than mine. 

&gt; I tried to use a cane. It didn't work for me. I get around ok with out it.

At 20/400 vision in my opinion you are putting your safety (and certainly your mobility and independence) at risk by not using a cane at least some of the time and not employing non-visual travel techniques along with your vision. ""Faking it"" can work a great deal with even a small amount of residual vision, right up until it doesn't (and then things can go terribly wrong.) For example, you describe becoming completely blinded at night for a while after a car's headlights hit your eyes. What would happen if this happened to you while crossing a street, and the cars don't know you're blind because you don't have a cane? 

I think you're totally on the right track to be questioning how your travel needs are going to change going from a small town to a university. You're going to encounter a lot of new places, new travel scenarios, and the need for skills you might not have fully developed at home. 

Any person of sufficient intellectual capacity and physical mobility can use a cane. Yes, in the beginning it is awkward and difficult and might seem useless when you can ""see enough."" Sometimes people, either because of a bad instructor or because of their own hangups about blindness, never really get out of that stage. I urge you to consider giving it another chance, and maybe to think about the things that might benefit you (like extra O&amp;M) in terms of not only being ready for a guide dog (as schools want you to have good cane travel skills before getting a dog) but also being ready to independently attend college regardless of if you decide to get a dog or not. 

The dog is a tool with many benefits but also some downsides. It will be completely useless to you if you don't have the travel skills required to work with it, or if you continue to try to rely exclusively on visual techniques. I know absolutely no blind people who have expressed regret in developing better cane travel skills. I've encountered a few who worked with a guide dog and discovered that it didn't work for them. One was a college student (who got the dog shortly before beginning college) that discovered that a dog didn't work with their busy lifestyle or make them feel as secure as traveling with a cane did when encountering challenging terrain. (But I also know plenty who say that a dog really improved their confidence and mobility and they're never going back.) 

If I were in your shoes, I would work on getting my cane travel skills up to a level where I would feel confident traveling a college campus (going to and from dorms, finding classes, the dining hall, and so on) and the nearby community without assistance. Having then developed those skills and started college, I would personally look at my needs and desires when actually in that situation and consider a guide dog at that time. 

&gt; Some people tell me that they are surprised to find out that I have a visual impairment because I get around so well.

I've had people tell me that when I'm carrying my cane! I know completely blind people (or those damn close) who have been told that. The general public's image of what a blind person ""should look like"" is often of someone who is poorly dressed, disoriented, with ""blind eyes"" or sunglasses, etc. When you do not fit into this mold it is very surprising to a lot of people. 

The issue is it's not that you aren't visually impaired ""enough"" to need those things, or that you wouldn't benefit from using non-visual skills. Their perception of blindness has no impact on your real needs or what will help you do the things you want to do. 

I've personally struggled with the trap of feeling not ""blind enough"" quite a lot. When I first started using a cane I had a little folding cane and more often than not that was exactly what it was, folded away in my bag like a secret. When I started learning braille I felt a bit like I was ""playing really blind"" because I can read very large print. When I started using a screenreader instead of magnifier, it felt silly learning all the keyboard commands when I could just turn zoomtext back on and find the thing ""faster"" using a mouse or so I thought. Every ""but you don't look blind"" and ""you're looking right at me"" and ""how could you see this, but not that?"" chipped away at my confidence. 

I am now incredibly thankful to the people in my life who encouraged me to give blindness skills a real try and to stick to them. 

With a cane, I walk quickly and confidently. I don't have to worry about how changing light conditions will impact my ability to travel. I no longer walk slowly and cautiously, or have frequent ""oh, I'm just clumsy!"" accidents. I have the skills to cross streets no matter the conditions or how complex, and the knowledge that cars can see that I am blind. Because of the travel skills I've developed using the cane, I know that I can go just about anywhere on my own. I don't think ""oh, I'll just wait for someone to give me a ride"" like I used to. Sure the cane has saved my skin plenty of times (something I only realize in retrospect) but the bigger effect was expanding my world and giving me the confidence to explore new places, to travel alone, etc. (And drawing parallels, because of braille and speech, I can read so much more than I thought was enough. I read much faster non-visually. I don't deal with eye strain or headaches or missing out on half of what I was supposed to read, or the discomfort of broadcasting the contents of my screen across a mile when using zoomtext in public! Reading became one of my favorite hobbies. Through this, the world that I previously thought was ""big enough"" grew even further.) 

Especially at a time when your world is going to be rapidly expanding anyways (going to college) I really encourage you to give blindness skills another chance. If that's through a cane or a dog or something else entirely, sometimes you don't figure out what you were missing until you have it.

I urge you to consider giving it another chance, and maybe to think about the things that might benefit you (like extra O&amp;M) in terms of not only being ready for a guide dog (as schools want you to have good cane travel skills before getting a dog) but also being ready to independently attend college regardless of if you decide to get a dog or not. 

The dog is a tool with many benefits but also some downsides. It will be completely useless to you if you don't have the travel skills required to work with it, or if you continue to try to rely exclusively on visual techniques. I know absolutely no blind people who have expressed regret in developing better cane travel skills. I've encountered a few who worked with a guide dog and discovered that it didn't work for them. One was a college student (who got the dog shortly before beginning college) that discovered that a dog didn't work with their busy lifestyle or make them feel as secure as traveling with a cane did when encountering challenging terrain. (But I also know plenty who say that a dog really improved their confidence and mobility and they're never going back.) 

If I were in your shoes, I would work on getting my cane travel skills up to a level where I would feel confident traveling a college campus (going to and from dorms, finding classes, the dining hall, and so on) and the nearby community without assistance. Having then developed those skills and started college, I would personally look at my needs and desires when actually in that situation and consider a guide dog at that time. 

&gt; Some people tell me that they are surprised to find out that I have a visual impairment because I get around so well.

I've had people tell me that when I'm carrying my cane! I know completely blind people (or those damn close) who have been told that. The general public's image of what a blind person ""should look like"" is often of someone who is poorly dressed, disoriented, with ""blind eyes"" or sunglasses, etc. When you do not fit into this mold it is very surprising to a lot of people. 

The issue is it's not that you aren't visually impaired ""enough"" to need those things, or that you wouldn't benefit from using non-visual skills. Their perception of blindness has no impact on your real needs or what will help you do the things you want to do. 

I've personally struggled with the trap of feeling not ""blind enough"" quite a lot. When I first started using a cane I had a little folding cane and more often than not that was exactly what it was, folded away in my bag like a secret. When I started learning braille I felt a bit like I was ""playing really blind"" because I can read very large print. When I started using a screenreader instead of magnifier, it felt silly learning all the keyboard commands when I could just turn zoomtext back on and find the thing ""faster"" using a mouse or so I thought. Every ""but you don't look blind"" and ""you're looking right at me"" and ""how could you see this, but not that?"" chipped away at my confidence. 

I am now incredibly thankful to the people in my life who encouraged me to give blindness skills a real try and to stick to them. 

With a cane, I walk quickly and confidently. I don't have to worry about how changing light conditions will impact my ability to travel. I no longer walk slowly and cautiously, or have frequent ""oh, I'm just clumsy!"" accidents. I have the skills to cross streets no matter the conditions or how complex, and the knowledge that cars can see that I am blind. Because of the travel skills I've developed using the cane, I know that I can go just about anywhere on my own. I don't think ""oh, I'll just wait for someone to give me a ride"" like I used to. Sure the cane has saved my skin plenty of times (something I only realize in retrospect) but the bigger effect was expanding my world and giving me the confidence to explore new places, to travel alone, etc. (And drawing parallels, because of braille and speech, I can read so much more than I thought was enough. I read much faster non-visually. I don't deal with eye strain or headaches or missing out on half of what I was supposed to read, or the discomfort of broadcasting the contents of my screen across a mile when using zoomtext in public! Reading became one of my favorite hobbies. Through this, the world that I previously thought was ""big enough"" grew even further.) 

Especially at a time when your world is going to be rapidly expanding anyways (going to college) I really encourage you to give blindness skills another chance. If that's through a cane or a dog or something else entirely, sometimes you don't figure out what you were missing until you have it.

How would the transplant work? I haven't heard of a full eye transplant yet, only bits and pieces of the eye and some bionic things.

330,"Well, I don't really have any useful advice for you, but man can I empathize with your GF.  I went through high school believing university was the only path to success for a blind person.  I wanted to do computer science, but thanks to a few terrible math teachers, I couldn't get the math marks required for any computer science university in the country.  What I should have done was graduate high school, do MCSE, CCNA, and perhaps work towards math in night school or something.  But instead, I was so convinced that university straight out of high school was the *only* path to success because I was blind, that I wasted thousands of dollars and years of my life doing a different degree I didn't care about and hating every minute.  Also, turns out I don't actually enjoy programming!  The aspects of computers I enjoy tend towards server administration and software deployment.  And you don't need a degree for those things!  So even if I *had* gotten into computer science, my focus on university to the exclusion of everything else would have lead me to spend the rest of my life not enjoying myself.  

Anyway, to make a long story short, university or college are just not required to be successful as a blind person.  To be successful, as a blind person or anyone else, you need to be doing what you love and are passionate about.  Hopefully you can offer your GF some encouragement not to swallow the ""college or failure"" BS.  What does she actually want to do with her life?  Does that thing really need a degree?  College isn't some magical cheat code for life that will bring success or happiness.  I bet that unless she wants to do something super technical (doctor, lawyer, etc) she can do it without the degree.  Also, when she thinks about what she wants to do with her life, it's so important not to fall into the trap of thinking ""Well, I want a job, and these are the sort of jobs blind people usually get"".  Often those of us born blind tend to look to what other blind people have done before us, and think that if they can do it, so can we, so we'd better do one of those things, like it or not!  What we forget is those other blind people were able to do what they did because they loved doing it.  If she's doing what she loves, odds are she'll make it eventually.  Speaking from personal experience, if she just tries to be ""successful"" as a blind person, without regard to her personal feelings, she never will be.

I still have some vision. It's blurry and there are duplicated of everything. Colors have started to blend together but I think that's just because the distinct borders aren't there anymore. 

I still struggle with calling myself blind since I do have some vision, but people don't seem to get being visually impaired and it's just easier to say blind or partially blind. Although I did deadpan and tell a women I was blind when she got exasperated when I asked for help and asked me why I didn't read the sign on the bulletin board. 

I actually get hallucinations if I take ambien, like crazy bad hallucinations. But in real life I don't. The lack of depth perception makes everything weird, but it's not a hallucination as much as it just is nothing being where t looks like it is. 

Sometimes my dreams are super vivid and clear. Sometimes my dreams are like my current vision or worse. And my least favorite is when I have a super clear dream and wake up realizing my vision will never be like that again.

As part of the kickstarter, they were also making tactile grids, for maps I suppose. I've never played D&amp;D, so I'm speculating based off videos I've watched. Anyway, maybe they'll be selling those too.

421,"Some general questions: 

- How are you getting along right now?  Are you getting along alright at school and home? How do you usually communicate? How do you read? Do you travel alone, go grocery shopping, etc? What are you struggling with? I'm asking to get a better idea of where you're at in terms of adjusting to your recent vision loss. 

- What are your hobbies and interests?

Some thoughts:

- Looking at your post history, you talk about how your O&amp;M instructors ""teach you routes you have to take"" and that you feel very uncomfortable in unfamiliar environments. Are you also being taught how to plan trips, orient yourself, gather information, and make corrections when traveling to new places? Do you have a smartphone with GPS that can help you? Are you able to effectively use it with speech, large print, or a braille display? Are you able to ordinarily communicate with people you encounter on the street for directions using speech, a communication device, or a print-braille communication card? Can you work with another O&amp;M instructor if you're not getting all the tools you need or aren't being encouraged with the mindset that with the right skills and training you can live and travel independently?

- Do you sign? If not, there's [groups]
(http://www.ableaustralia.org.au/what-we-do/deafblind-services) that can help you learn Auslan as a deafblind person. Depending on your vision, you might be able to view it normally, view it closer than usual, use a hand to track the other signer, or use fully tactile (hand over hand) sign. I'm not going to lie, there's a pretty big bridge of misinformation to cross with the Deaf community and blindness, but it's only going to happen if people are out there and doing it. There are many Deafness-specific events that would be pretty accessible to you, such as Deaf coffee chats that tend to have a lot of one on one or small group conversations. Since you're a uni student, there might also be a Deaf or Auslan club at your uni with regular social events. Reach out to them and see how you feel about it, if it's not something you've already been involved with. 

- Regarding blind people, the bridge of misinformation goes both ways unfortunately. A lot of blind people view the world as extremely dependent on auditory cues and struggle to relate to those who do not. But this is certainly not all blind people, and it can be overcome. Be assertive about what you need (such as interpreters at events) and be creative about how you accomplish tasks. Do you have an amplifier system that connects to your hearing aids you can use with events or one on one conversations where you give the mic to the speaker? If speech is still difficult, you can use your own phone or laptop (with speech and large print or a braille display) or a braille notetaker to allow a blind person to type to you (using the TTS) and you to be able to read it (using large print, or braille) and reply. 

- Do you read braille? If you haven't, why not? Braille can open up a lot of opportunities not only for in-person communication, but online communication as well, and it'll work for you no matter what your vision or hearing is now and in the future. A braille display can be used for in person communication, for text relay phone calls or TTY calls, reading and writing, and accessing a great deal of the internet (including communities for just about any interest you might have.) 

- Braille also makes a *lot* of games accessible, if you're interested. http://www.64ouncegames.com/ makes a lot of accessibility kits for a ton of different mainstream board and card games, and ships free worldwide. [There's also a braille-adapted scrabble board and tactile chess sets.]
(http://shop.rnib.org.uk/home-and-leisure/leisure/board-games-and-dice.html) There's probably many existing tabletop gaming groups in your area that you could join and bring your own games to, and I find that gaming can really break the ice because you all have something you're there to do together. 

- Braille also makes books accessible, which can also be an ice-breaker for socialization through joining a book club if you like to read. 

- There's an [annual deafblind camp]
(http://www.deafblind2016.com.au/deafblind-camp) in Australia you could use to meet (and make friends with) deafblind people throughout the country. 

- The NFB here in the US has a deafblind mailing list. The [site]

Regarding reading, a [video magnifier]
(http://shop.rnib.org.uk/magnification/video-magnifiers/desktop-video-magnifiers.html) may make text easier to read. The RNIB library offers giant print books as well as audio books (and easy beginners braille books, if she is interested in learning.) She can also use a computer, tablet, and so on to read with either large print, text to speech, or audiobooks. Reading is a very easy hobby to get back into after sight loss, and there's likely local book clubs she can attend for a chance to get out as well.

If she likes to watch TV, [audio description]
(http://www.rnib.org.uk/information-everyday-living-home-and-leisure-television-radio-and-film/audio-description) can help.  

Technology wise, an iphone or ipad can be readily used by blind people. If she has trouble with fine control or wishes to see things zoomed up, the ipad or the larger iphone is definitely the way to go. http://www.applevis.com/new-to-ios If you have a device already, you can look up tutorials and get her started using it just by enabling voiceover. 

Some apps that people find especially helpful are: 

[Blindsquare]
(http://blindsquare.com/) which helps you know what you are nearby, look for places, get GPS directions to those places, and so on. 

[Voice Dream Reader]
(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader-text-to/id496177674?ign-mpt=uo%3D8) Very accessible reader of ebooks. Can't be used with DRM books, but good for everything else. 

[KNFB reader.]
(http://www.knfbreader.com/) This product is nearly a must have if you have trouble reading print. It can be used to read books, mail, signs, menus, so many things. It will read out loud all the text to you and present it in large print. It has features to help guide you to taking a full picture of the text, so you can use it independently. 

On the computer, screenreaders such as [NVDA]
(http://www.nvaccess.org/) (for windows) or [Voiceover]
(http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/) (for mac) can also be used for speech. [Zoomtext]
(http://www.zoomtext.com/products/) is in my opinion the best computer magnifier (windows and mac.) It is simple to get started with. It has very clear text compared to the built in free magnifiers, focus and color enhancements, as well as (in the Reader and Fusion versions) options to read out loud and view at the same time web pages, documents, everything.

Is the reason she is not working purely her sight loss, or the other issues due to the stroke? If she does not have the stamina for full time work now, can she get part time employment? Why not help arrange for some volunteer opportunities for her? There are many things she could do to feel more fulfilled and productive outside the home. If she likes to cook she could help prepare meals for needy people, for example. If she is good with people, she could work at a front desk or answer telephone calls for a nonprofit. 

If she is struggling with depression and with the emotions of having suffered a stroke, therapy and group support can be absolutely life changing. Reach out and help her get those services if she isn't already. 

There are really so many hobbies, activities, and paid or voluntary work that she can still be fully engaged in. It is just a matter of getting the right adaptive skills or tools, addressing her limitations in terms of fatigue, and deciding what she wants to do with her time now.

(<URL>) cane, a [guide cane]
(<URL>) used for light mobility only, or a small folding [symbol/identification]
(<URL>) cane) might help her travel safely, keeps other pedestrians and cars more cautious of her, and makes it easier to ask for and get help when needed. Good training can help her travel longer distances and complex scenarios (like street crossings) with more confidence and safety. [This text]
(<URL>) is also a helpful guide to start.

Regarding reading, a [video magnifier]
(<URL>) may make text easier to read. The RNIB library offers giant print books as well as audio books (and easy beginners braille books, if she is interested in learning.) She can also use a computer, tablet, and so on to read with either large print, text to speech, or audiobooks. Reading is a very easy hobby to get back into after sight loss, and there's likely local book clubs she can attend for a chance to get out as well.

If she likes to watch TV, [audio description]
(<URL>) can help.  

Technology wise, an iphone or ipad can be readily used by blind people. If she has trouble with fine control or wishes to see things zoomed up, the ipad or the larger iphone is definitely the way to go. <URL> If you have a device already, you can look up tutorials and get her started using it just by enabling voiceover. 

Some apps that people find especially helpful are: 

[Blindsquare]
(<URL>) which helps you know what you are nearby, look for places, get GPS directions to those places, and so on. 

[Voice Dream Reader]
(<URL>) Very accessible reader of ebooks. Can't be used with DRM books, but good for everything else. 

[KNFB reader.]
(<URL>) This product is nearly a must have if you have trouble reading print. It can be used to read books, mail, signs, menus, so many things. It will read out loud all the text to you and present it in large print. It has features to help guide you to taking a full picture of the text, so you can use it independently. 

On the computer, screenreaders such as [NVDA]
(<URL>) (for windows) or [Voiceover]
(<URL>) (for mac) can also be used for speech. [Zoomtext]
(<URL>) is in my opinion the best computer magnifier (windows and mac.) It is simple to get started with. It has very clear text compared to the built in free magnifiers, focus and color enhancements, as well as (in the Reader and Fusion versions) options to read out loud and view at the same time web pages, documents, everything. 

It is possible for her to continue [sewing]
(<URL>) using some adaptive techniques. [Here is a resource on sewing, knitting, and quilting.]
(<URL>) 

Amazon and many other booksellers have a large selection of large print word find puzzles, sudoku, and other types of entertainment. Many [board games]
(<URL>) can be played with little or no sight, or can be [adapted]
(<URL>) to be playable. 

Is the reason she is not working purely her sight loss, or the other issues due to the stroke? If she does not have the stamina for full time work now, can she get part time employment? Why not help arrange for some volunteer opportunities for her? There are many things she could do to feel more fulfilled and productive outside the home. If she likes to cook she could help prepare meals for needy people, for example. If she is good with people, she could work at a front desk or answer telephone calls for a nonprofit. 

If she is struggling with depression and with the emotions of having suffered a stroke, therapy and group support can be absolutely life changing. Reach out and help her get those services if she isn't already. 

There are really so many hobbies, activities, and paid or voluntary work that she can still be fully engaged in. It is just a matter of getting the right adaptive skills or tools, addressing her limitations in terms of fatigue, and deciding what she wants to do with her time now.

That is a rough outline. If you have any specific questions or issues I would be happy to try to help.

448,"For me, it's more about time of day than anything. I don't feel safe on any street at 2 in the morning, no matter how nice it is during the day.  

Other than that, I mostly judge by the type of people out and about.  If it's a crowded area with lots of families (mixed gender, young children, etc), tourists, and people going about daily life, I feel pretty safe.  If it's a totally quiet area, with absolutely nobody out on the street, I feel slightly less safe, but not really ""in danger"" or anything.  If it's mostly adult people, who seem as though they've been drinking/smoking, or are just hanging around for no reason I can tell, and there's lots of loud music around (especially when it's just blasting from random parked cars), that's when I want out.  To be fair, that last perfectly describes a lot of nightclub districts, block parties, and college towns, that are generally perfectly safe!  However, they're generally places I'd rather not be alone.  In that type of environment, people often don't pay attention to where they're going, making it harder for me to avoid them. Also, the car traffic is generally harder to deal with, because the foot traffic might not be following the street lights (if any), and the general noise in that type of environment can make it hard for me to hear the traffic flow.  So even if I'm in a totally safe college town, I am less safe traveling there. Plus, it can be hard, just by hearing alone, to tell when things get unsafe in that type of environment (bar fights spilling out into the street, etc).  But if I'm with someone, I'm perfectly OK.
