Since he is not understanding what he is seeing, he can still be retrained to do something, which will empower him and be almost like training someone that is profoundly blind. 

DOR has been wonderful for me. They referred me to all kinds of training programs that provided orientation, mobility and travel training along with technology.

I got life skills training training and it's been invaluable. Since I am in their retraining program, they provide a lot of the equipment that I needed to get up to speed. 

New Jersey has a Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired. That and the Braille Institute are your shoehorns to get into the programs. Even if you do not think you want to work (which will limit what they will provide), there is a lot of training for life skills available. How to get around, how to cook, how to clean. 

What getting into a program will do for your dad, is show him that there is not only hope, but support. A lot of the places offer group discussions weekly, so that he knows that there are other people going through the same thing. I went from being suicidal to adapting reasonably well (I am still pissed off). 

All of my trainers have been visually impaired and super inspirational to me with regards to the effort that I put into learning new skills. 

You can get different sized silicone buttons to attach to remotes (or in my case, your home keys). There is a fabulous Infila needle threader. I have braille and audible kitchen tools. 

I would take a look at [MaxiAids website](https://www.maxiaids.com/). You will find a lot of cheap and simple products that are super helpful there. Talking watches, silicone bumps, writing guides, canes. You don't have to buy them, you can just figure out what they do and compare it with what you might need. 

I can't recommend cane/mobility/orientation/travel training highly enough. Realizing that you can be independent will be a revelation to him. It will lift his level of frustration and buoy his mood. 

I made a call to my tech trainers at Blindness Support Services to get info on what readers are best for the less tech savvy among us. Since they see a variety of clients, they will know. They will give me a call back later and I can tell you what the recommend.

A lot of the places offer group discussions weekly, so that he knows that there are other people going through the same thing. I went from being suicidal to adapting reasonably well (I am still pissed off). 

All of my trainers have been visually impaired and super inspirational to me with regards to the effort that I put into learning new skills. 

You can get different sized silicone buttons to attach to remotes (or in my case, your home keys). There is a fabulous <PERSON> needle threader. I have braille and audible kitchen tools. 

I would take a look at [MaxiAids website](<URL>). You will find a lot of cheap and simple products that are super helpful there. Talking watches, silicone bumps, writing guides, canes. You don't have to buy them, you can just figure out what they do and compare it with what you might need. 

I can't recommend cane/mobility/orientation/travel training highly enough. Realizing that you can be independent will be a revelation to him. It will lift his level of frustration and buoy his mood. 

I made a call to my tech trainers at Blindness Support Services to get info on what readers are best for the less tech savvy among us. Since they see a variety of clients, they will know. They will give me a call back later and I can tell you what the recommend.

You could do something like this with [iBeacons](http://www.ibeacon.com/what-is-ibeacon-a-guide-to-beacons/) and a custom mobile app with info about what's around campus.

Many other countries do this a lot more extensively than we tend to in the United Sates, but to an extent in the US, it's [required by law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving#United_States) so your campus should already have some tactile pavement in areas where warning people with visual impairments is particularly important. If they don't, then this is certainly something they need to work on in order to be compliant with the ADA. 

&gt; The last idea I have is install something like haptic vibration machines in certain places, like coming up to a sidewalk. This one hasn't been thought out as much.

I don't think this is as practical/useful, particularly in crowded areas. An alternative may be to use the iBeacons mentioned above and have the app vibrate the user's mobile device, so it's available if people want it and individual to them. 

My biggest problem as someone who's visually impaired with low visual acuity, no depth perception, and a very limited visual field is walking into things like low-hanging street signs that stick out over a sidewalk, low hanging branches, etc. Canes are great for finding obstacles low to the ground, but obstacles at head height can be problematic. 

I also see (or, you know... don't see, because blind) a lot of steps along sidewalks, particularly on our college campus, that could really use some contrasting/textured strip along the front edge of the step.

It is good to see that they are trying to make information more accessible for the blind even if they may have a while to go. It's nice to see progress!! 

Thank you for the excellent feedback! I think I am going to explore different ideas for a Haptic time device for the blind. It is evident that there is lack of innovation in this area.

I will be posting a survey sometime in the near future to try and gather a range of thoughts on what people living with sight loss would like from a wearable device. Hopefully be designing this wearable with the blind in mind It crossover as a useful device for the fully sighted also. The idea of checking the time discreetly in meetings is the exact type of thing I'm thinking of.

Where do I even start? 

- Doom and gloom music

- Assuming blind people ""see black"" (no, completely blind people see nothing. Most blind people are not completely blind.) 

- Blind people are parents, sports fans, superhero geeks, and car enthusiasts too. Just because you can't understand how these things can be full experiences for us doesn't mean they aren't. 

- No, you can't ""feel like it feels like to be blind"" in a two minute pity-provoking video. You cannot live someone's whole life through a two minute glimpse clouded by your own false assumptions.

I disagree! While reading by sight may be faster for sighted people, there's nothing about being blind that makes you more ""touch sensitive."" It's just a matter of practice. 

Some low vision learners blindfold themselves while studying (or take off their glasses or shut their eyes) to avoid ""cheating"" while reading. This might help you practice reading braille the same way your daughter will be learning to read it (by touch) if you're interested.

216,"I went to vote at the registrars office and it was packed. I had tried to go and early vote at the mall with a group from Blindness Support Services, but the group voting never materialized. I will be on that organizing next time to make sure that it goes off without a hitch. 

I had to vote early at the main office, because the local precinct is not available by public transport and it an hour and 15 minute walk each way in areas with no sidewalks. This is something that I complained about vociferously since before the primary to the registrar's office. To my state representatives, my county supervisors and my congressman and my senator. To no avail. 

The location had really bothered me when I had gone before, because there are a lot of disabled people riding the busses from the downtown terminal here. This location makes it difficult for everyone in a rather large downtown area to vote on election day. 

The registrar's office, they finally added a bus stop reasonably close to it after my literally months of bitching. I only had to walk 1/4 mile each way from the stop to the office. Not ideal, but manageable. The bus ride was about an hour and 15 minutes each way but the bus drivers here are sort of awesome and the driver pointed me in the right direction. Nice, nice drivers here... most of them. 

The security force in the parking area was great and led me politely to the line. There were a lot of workers around to help direct me places and the people in line are always helpful.

However, the sorting rubric inside was not particularly fabulous. I had to check in at a series of windows that were hard to hear through. They gave me a queue number that they didn't bother to tell me what it actually was, and a slip of paper to fill out that I couldn't see to fill out. No large print options or anyone to help me fill it out. I had to drag out my Smartlux magnifier to do it. 

Luckily for me, I get handicapped access for the speaking machines to vote so I didn't have to wait all that long. The people working the machines were super helpful about directing me in and out of the area. They were happy to hook up my earphones for the audible and explain how they worked. 

My bigger problem was in actually getting to the precinct from the bus. 

As I was walking towards the precinct with my *white cane,* some strange man grabs me by the sweater and starts yelling at me to take a flyer from him. I repeat... **I am walking with a white cane.** When I begin to consider whacking him with the cane, because frankly I was freaked out, I pointed out that the flyers would need to be in braille.

He would not let go of me. He was trying to put a flyer into my sweater pockets, shove it into my purse, and actually yelling at me. 

He actually frightened the nice Hispanic man that was walking with me while chatting with me and patiently tolerating my abominable, broken Spanish and making sure that I got to the actual office. 

He was trying to get the man to let go of me and was polite to a fault. He ran and got two of the parking security people. It took 2 security workers to get him to leave me alone, who called the sheriff and the cops hauled him away shortly thereafter, while I was waiting in line outside the building to the cheering joy of others in line that had witnessed it.

He was yelling ""Vote for Trump.""

When I began mobility and orientation training, I had more vision and I spent a lot of time blindfolded with my travel trainer. I still find the way people leap out of the way of the cane when I am walking sort of startling, because I can't see them until they hit the periphery.  

I went back for a refresher recently... and found out that I wasn't sweeping far enough over the the right, which explains why I have walked into so many poles. I leave my cane lower now, so I do not have obstacles which turned out to be my breasts.

227,"Here are some additional notes for version 1.5:

Nothing in the interface is telling me which camera I have turn on or if the flash is on or off. The controls you exposed are just buttons with no VoiceOver toggle states telling me what I have selected.

The text and overall presentation of the image scan is all one chunk of text. This should be broken up so it's easier to navigate with the line Road or selection. There currently doesn't seem to be a way to save the results, meaning I have to use another charge and take another picture if I need to go back to something I've done previously.

One definite problem with the function of the charges is that since I am blind, I will be prone to making photographic mistakes and may end up wasting a bunch trying to get the information I'm looking for. Perhaps I forgot that I don't have a light on and struggle wasting charges in the dark. If possible, exposing more of the iOS camera description features that happen while you are pointing and aiming your camera would be nice.

Anyway, the people I have found (I mean apart from everyone on this awesome sub) have been John Hull and Ryan Knighton. John Hull is very somber and thoughtful.

depends on how you define reasonably priced.  I'm just not feeling the need for something like this in my life right now.

I figure we are on the low end of vision loss but we still have the right to feel anxious/sad/isolated sometimes since our vision definitely isn't ""normal"".

I agree with you on having more features for the camera. I have a personal belief that less is more when it comes to making a product so I take all the considerations about a feature very carefully. This is also v1. With your guys' feedback, I'll build a v2.

I'm definitely thinking about removing the object recognition out or at least make it toggle-able, so that people don't have to hear unnecessary information all the time. However, the technology will improve over time, hence the term 'machine learning'.

I wanted to ask you about the text interaction. Like Marconius said, do you also think it would be useful to have an interactive text box with all the text in it?

280,"My grandfather got something similar too in the mid-80's, and there are a few things you can do to help him.

The general idea is that he should be able to, within his ability, do things he enjoy doing. Otherwise he will probably accept that his body is failing him, accept defeat and sit down and wait for his life to run out.

They all depend on his interests and his ability, of course. He is probably pretty used to be able to do things on his own and it's possible that he is a tiny bit to proud to ask for help with everything. (And it also means a partial admitting that age is winning over stubbornness.)

* is he reading a lot of books? Audio books are nearly as good. At the very least they offer the same ability to flee into the authors fantasy.

* is he keen on keeping track of time? Make sure that there is at least one chiming clock in the house so that he can somewhat keep track himself.

* newspapers are often available as audio files as a special subscription. If he usually spends an hour and a half in the morning reading the paper, he can just as well spend an hour and a half listening to the news.

* if he enjoys gardening, he still can. Within reason, of course. It's hard when you can't *see* the result but have to *feel* it instead. The trick is to find the plants that offer a rewarding smell from the blossoms, or the berries that he will pursue for the taste. Or apple trees. Because, hey, apple pie.

* if he is embracing technology it's probably a lot easier. There is screen reading software for both smartphones and computers, and if he is somewhat familiar with either already it's a lot easier to start there and let him adapt to the new way to use it than if he is to start from nothing and make use of the new technology.

* some sports are so much about technique that you can still do them despite not seeing a thing. Golf and boule comes to mind; if you have a pretty flawless technique and a sighted partner able to tell you what to do, you can probably get by anyway.

* some sports, like airgun target shooting, instead offer a special technical aid so that you depend on your hearing instead of your eyes.

* most of the classical board games like chess and so can be played just as well despite not seeing the board. If he is already good enough at it to enjoy playing, he might also enjoy the challenge of memorising the board and all the pieces.


My point is that the first question you should ask yourself is what he is usually doing during the day, and the second thing you should ask is *""alright, how can he still do that in the same or a similar way so that he is not forced to forfeit a hobby he enjoys?""*",,,,enjoyoutdoors,,,1478025476,t5_2qpec,t3_5a8r8h,t3_5a8r8h,2,1481122581,0,0,d9h6fex,Blind,,,,,

1) Find a good glaucoma Specialist.  We mean a really good one.  You want to build a relationship with this doctor because you will be seeing this person much in the future.  If you don't feel comfortable with this doctor we recommend finding another.  This doctor will be the person that you trust with your sight for now on.  You need to be able to trust them.  

2) Take your meds.  You're aiming to preserve as much vision as you can.  You'll most likely be on a few eyedrops and a pill.  Take these on a religious-like schedule.  Don't skip, but if you do forget (we all do from time to time) then just make sure to pick it back up on your next time that you're supposed to take them.  

3) Connect with your state agencies.  It depends on your state though.  Some states will have more resources that can help you with your disability.  We moved to Washington a year and a half ago and it's better compared to where we used to live back down in Tennessee.  Most states will have the services for the blind under a larger service, such as DHS (Department of Human Services), while Washington has its own department known as DSB, the Department of Services for the Blind.  Depending on the state once again, they can potentially also help you learn how to maneuver with a cane and even teach you how to cook.  

4) Try to connect to other people that are going through similar situations.  Not everyone has the same level of vision loss, but we can all relate to not recognizing a face, but you can hear a familiar voice.  This will help you gain more advice, tips, potential resources, and the best thing yet... friends.  Just like any other person, we need other people in our lives.  There's the National Federation for the Blind and the American Federation for the Blind if you want additional tips and potential help.  We're not too familiar on those two though to be honest.  

5) If you're in school then get in contact with your college's disability service.  They will provide you with accommodations and assistance.   

6) This is important.  Don't let people coddle you.  Don't let people get you down.  People will underestimate you.  People will discourage you from doing things in life, but don't let them get you down.

316,"This afternoon I spent my 10 free shots evaluating this app, as compared to The KNFB Reader. I didn't compare it with TapTapSee, because I don't use that app; I'm not comfortable with pictures I take getting sent to random humans to be described.  While the results may be better, I value my privacy more than I value the best results.  

First off, two features that The KNFB Reader (KNFB for short) has that Eye of Providence (EoP for short) does not are tilt guidance and field of view report.  In order to keep the evaluation fair, I turned off these features most of the time while comparing KNFB and EoP.  This is a huge deal because, for whatever reason, I am the worlds worst photographer.  I find it challenging to hold my phone straight and steady, and other than ""kinda...hold the phone a little bit above the thingy..."" I really have no concept of what gets in any given photo, or how focus works, or anything like that.  When using KNFB, I generally just press field of view while moving the phone vaguely at random, until it tells me all four edges are visible.  With EoP, I can't do that, and I really expected this to be a huge issue.  But read on!  

I started by taking pictures in low light conditions.  Well...that's a really fancy way of saying ""I was in a dark room and forgot to turn the light on before starting this review.""  I did warn you that I'm pretty terrible at all things camera related!  KNFB was able to recognize some text anyway, though it was less accurate than if I'd had the light on.  EoP, on the other hand, just said all my photos were about ""lense flare"".  I had the flash in KNFB set to ""auto"", so I assume that's why.  It would be nice if EoP could detect low light conditions and use flash as well, or if not, at least notify me if the photos were too dark to be useful.  Especially when each shot I take costs money, though an admittedly tiny amount, it'd be nice if at least some sanity checking could be done on the device, to make sure what's about to be sent to the API actually might contain something useful.  I also need to note that in order to get text that was accurate enough to be helpful with KNFB, I had to re-enable tilt guidance and field of view report.  In low light conditions with these features off, I couldn't get KNFB to detect any text at all.  

But it's when I turned the light on that the counter-intuitive magic began happening!  I started off by taking a picture of a warranty card for some turtle beach wireless headphones.  On my first shot, EoP recognized all the text, including the web address required to register the product, nearly perfectly.  In KNFB, without tilt guidance and field of view reports, I was able to get some mangled text, but even after multiple tries, I couldn't get accurate enough recognition to be used if I had actually wanted to register my product.  Once I re-enabled those features in KNFB, I was able to get accuracy that matched EoP.  But of course, this meant my usual method of taking 2 or 3 shots to get field of view right, and being extremely delicate in keeping the phone perfectly level.  This already makes EoP an order of magnitude faster for recognizing text, for me.  However, to add to that, EoP is quicker at uploading the photo and getting the results back from Google, than KNFB is at doing OCR directly on my IPhone6.  This might not be the case for newer phones, though.  

Another object I tried was the back of one of those small, slightly rounded containers that water flavouring additives come in. The idea is you squeeze it once into your bottle of water, for flavour.  This has always been a weakness of KNFB, at least for me. I have huge problems getting it to recognize small print, on rounded or curved surfaces.  EoP was able to read most of the nutritional information, on the first shot.  No matter what I did, tilt guidance and field of view or not, I couldn't get KNFB to recognize any text at all.  It's a really tiny bottle, about half the size of my palm, so it could be that I wasn't getting it framed properly.  But that didn't seem to matter to EoP.  

Lastly, I compared results on a plaque for an award that I won years ago.  Again, EoP got all of the text, on the first try.  KNFB without tilt guidance or field of view reports, was able to get quite a bit of the text, but with several mistakes.  Using those features, of course, I was able to get equivalent results. Though again, the fiddling meant it took much longer to get usable results with KNFB.

The next surprising thing was object identification.  Based on Google's tech demos, I expected that this would be really impressive, and a major win for EoP, seeing as KNFB doesn't have this feature at all.  However, disappointingly, it wasn't.  It was completely useless.  It identified a can of deodorant as a computer mouse.  When I took a picture of my bluetooth keyboard, it read back the text on it (""Logitech K-10 Wireless Keyboard""), and then proceeded to identify it as a laptop.  Even though it could read the nutritional information of the flavouring bottle, it still thought the important thing in that picture was my floor.  Apparently most people just have random information about calorie and fat content written on the floor, I dunno.  Sadly, this feature could be removed entirely, without making the app any less useful.  If this would make the text recognition cheaper, I'd be all for it.  As it is, might as well leave it in if we're already paying for it.  But it really is useless.  

Unlike what /u/Marconius said, though, I did find the colour recognition useful.  I know the colour of my floor and bed, and it was right about both of those things. I've tried colour identification apps in the past that can't even manage that much!  

However, all of the other issues /u/Marconius mentioned are right on the nose.  In the case of the warranty card example from above, if I'd wanted to register my product, I'd have had to replay the text multiple times, until I'd typed the included web address into my computer.  What I'd like is the text displayed on-screen, so I can review parts of it character by character with VoiceOver, or copy it to the clipboard.  What would also be nice is a ""share"" button that would open up the share sheet, and let me send the recognized text to other apps.  That way, I could email the recognized text to myself, and open the email on the computer to click the link.  

TL;DR: EoP is faster and more accurate at text recognition if you find KNFB fussy about not tilting your phone, and you need to try multiple times to get the object you want to recognize perfectly in frame.  If that isn't an issue for you, they're equally good.  The other features the app offers aren't compelling enough to make it ""better"" than KNFB.  I might be switching to EoP myself, but YMMV.",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1478047985,t5_2qpec,t3_5ai8gp,t3_5ai8gp,1,1481136772,0,0,d9hoyyy,Blind,,,blue1,"This afternoon I spent my 10 free shots evaluating this app, as compared to The KNFB Reader.

I also need to note that in order to get text that was accurate enough to be helpful with <PERSON>, I had to re-enable tilt guidance and field of view report.  In low light conditions with these features off, I couldn't get <PERSON> to detect any text at all.  

But it's when I turned the light on that the counter-intuitive magic began happening!  I started off by taking a picture of a warranty card for some turtle beach wireless headphones.  On my first shot, EoP recognized all the text, including the web address required to register the product, nearly perfectly.  In KNFB, without tilt guidance and field of view reports, I was able to get some mangled text, but even after multiple tries, I couldn't get accurate enough recognition to be used if I had actually wanted to register my product.  Once I re-enabled those features in <LOCATION>, I was able to get accuracy that matched <PERSON>  But of course, this meant my usual method of taking 2 or 3 shots to get field of view right, and being extremely delicate in keeping the phone perfectly level.  This already makes EoP an order of magnitude faster for recognizing text, for me.  However, to add to that, EoP is quicker at uploading the photo and getting the results back from Google, than <PERSON> is at doing OCR directly on my IPhone6.  This might not be the case for newer phones, though.  

Another object I tried was the back of one of those small, slightly rounded containers that water flavouring additives come in. The idea is you squeeze it once into your bottle of water, for flavour.  This has always been a weakness of KNFB, at least for me. I have huge problems getting it to recognize small print, on rounded or curved surfaces.  EoP was able to read most of the nutritional information, on the first shot.  No matter what I did, tilt guidance and field of view or not, I couldn't get <PERSON> to recognize any text at all.  It's a really tiny bottle, about half the size of my palm, so it could be that I wasn't getting it framed properly.  But that didn't seem to matter to EoP.  

Lastly, I compared results on a plaque for an award that I won years ago.  Again, EoP got all of the text, on the first try.  KNFB without tilt guidance or field of view reports, was able to get quite a bit of the text, but with several mistakes.  Using those features, of course, I was able to get equivalent results. Though again, the fiddling meant it took much longer to get usable results with KNFB.

The next surprising thing was object identification.  Based on Google's tech demos, I expected that this would be really impressive, and a major win for EoP, seeing as <PERSON> doesn't have this feature at all.  However, disappointingly, it wasn't.  It was completely useless.  It identified a can of deodorant as a computer mouse.  When I took a picture of my bluetooth keyboard, it read back the text on it (""Logitech K-10 Wireless Keyboard""), and then proceeded to identify it as a laptop.  Even though it could read the nutritional information of the flavouring bottle, it still thought the important thing in that picture was my floor.  Apparently most people just have random information about calorie and fat content written on the floor, I dunno.  Sadly, this feature could be removed entirely, without making the app any less useful.  If this would make the text recognition cheaper, I'd be all for it.  As it is, might as well leave it in if we're already paying for it.  But it really is useless.  

Unlike what <USER> said, though, I did find the colour recognition useful.  I know the colour of my floor and bed, and it was right about both of those things. I've tried colour identification apps in the past that can't even manage that much!  

However, all of the other issues <USER> mentioned are right on the nose.  In the case of the warranty card example from above, if I'd wanted to register my product, I'd have had to replay the text multiple times, until I'd typed the included web address into my computer.  What I'd like is the text displayed on-screen, so I can review parts of it character by character with VoiceOver, or copy it to the clipboard.  What would also be nice is a ""share"" button that would open up the share sheet, and let me send the recognized text to other apps.  That way, I could email the recognized text to myself, and open the email on the computer to click the link.  

TL;DR: EoP is faster and more accurate at text recognition if you find <PERSON> fussy about not tilting your phone, and you need to try multiple times to get the object you want to recognize perfectly in frame.  If that isn't an issue for you, they're equally good.  The other features the app offers aren't compelling enough to make it ""better"" than <PERSON>.  I might be switching to EoP myself, but YMMV.","[{'start': 6824, 'end': 6832, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 6544, 'end': 6552, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 5845, 'end': 5851, 'entity_type': 'USER', 'text': '<USER>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 5577, 'end': 5583, 'entity_type': 'USER', 'text': '<USER>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 4722, 'end': 4730, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3949, 'end': 3957, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3339, 'end': 3347, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2975, 'end': 2983, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2923, 'end': 2933, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2308, 'end': 2316, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2174, 'end': 2182, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1636, 'end': 1644, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1434, 'end': 1442, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1239, 'end': 1244, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 957, 'end': 965, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 614, 'end': 622, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 601, 'end': 609, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 385, 'end': 393, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I know the roads around where i live, and remember things where i've been to before. So how to find a bus stop, where to get off, which floor something is, and have sort of mental map of things that rely less and less on visual landmarks.
On a bad weather or in dark i can get lost very easily. Nighttime is just light perception, sound, and being scared of attracting unsavory crowds.
I miss all the details in people's appearances so I can't tell if someone is 9 months pregnant unless i remember them telling it before. Or if someone is a bus driver, but i sort of assume the person sitting on the driver's seat is the driver. I have no clue what my neighbors look like, especially if they don't have dogs. Recognizing anyone out of usual context? Not a chance. Facial expressions are another nightmare, and so are occasions where there's some stupid dresscode against dark shades, my eyes hurt, and darkness feels better.
I read a lot of audiobooks and set to pretty fast. Music, occasional tv or movies (i miss most jokes anyway). I love braille but don't have a display so it's all audio and keyboard.

357,"Hey Marconius,

Thanks for the review. I worked on a couple things today:

1. Better button state notification with VoiceOver. When you 'hover' with VoiceOver, it should tell you the flash mode and what camera you are using.
2. I split out the text with breaks.
3. I put a brightness detector on the app. So when it's too dark and user takes a photo, it will now prevent you from taking a photo until luminosity levels are at a good point.

In regards to camera blur, the app does the job of focusing for you. It will not take a photo until focus is at a good point for most cases. But if you are intentionally making it blurry by, for instance, shaking the phone, it will take a photo after a second or so when it gives up on focus. Unfortunately, users will have to trust that this is the case and that the app is doing what it can to control focus and blur. Of course, users will have to do their best to keep their cameras still.

The update should be out in a couple days (smiley face)

I have no real vision at all, ie real no external sensory input. Sometimes it is pitch black and sometimes it is very bright and other times its somewhere inbetween.  This is NOT at all related to the external ambient light level, this is just my brain turning the gain all the way up and all the way down. At the moment I am sitting here with a 30% light level and can see my arms, legs and fingers which I can see moving.  This is a completely false vision just my brain working out where things are and drawing the pictures.  If I have a cigarette in my mouth I can ""see"" it move, however my brain does not decide to draw in the glowing tip, I have not done LSD since I went blind nor in the decade and a half before but I keep meaning to try that particular experiment.  When I say I can see my fingers I mean I can see them drum on my knee or other surface they are on, the images appear stronger in the peripheral rather than the central areas, I would be interested in hearing from others with this pseudo vision.

404,"&gt; this lets them get more customers, and it doesn't require that much more work.

Voice actors are unionized.  I would be extremely surprised if the subscriptions from all Netflix blind customers, combined, are even enough to pay the voice actors who read the audio description scripts.  Never mind pay the producer who has to edit the description into the original audio, and whoever writes the scripts in the first place.  Unfortunately, the reason closed captioning always comes before audio description, is because it's much much much cheaper.  The only hope I can see for audio description is if it's included as some kind of subtitle system that TTS systems can read out, to eliminate the cost of voice acting, and the AD lines themselves are written by whoever does the captions, to save on the cost of writers.  Government requirements are nice while they last, but governments aren't going to keep requiring every production in the world to effectively higher an extra actor and writer for every production.

Otherwise, I am pretty open to topics just for something to listen to, but where tech and some other things are concerned I'd likely have to start at kindergarten level haha.

418,"The contacts do make a noticeable difference. They do work well under flourencent lighting conditions. Putting lenses in and taking them out is not hard, but you need to carry the case, your glasses and saline with you.     
     
Have you checked out a company called NoIR? They make amazing polorized lenses of all different colors and darknesses. I wear a number 80 plum colored lens. It sounds like our visual preferences are fairly similar!     
     
The contact lenses cannot be polorized, but they do work well in tandem with other sunglasses. They are not dark enough for me to go outside without sunglasses, but they do work well with off-the-shelf sunglasses which gives you a wider variety of styles to choose from.      
     
For me, the biggest challenge was having to break from my natural tendencies. I keep my phone dim, I keep my shades drawn at home, almost everything is about keeping the light out and with the lenses in I had to keep the lights on, increase the brightness of everything only to turn everything back down again when I took the lenses out.

420,"Sorry to hear about your condition. Ushers is not an easy diagnosis, unfortunately.

Have you contacted your local agency to start training on skills you would need as your vision loss advances? Things like Daily Living Skills, Orientation and Mobilty, Technology, etc. 

Sometimes, the tools you need to do what you want don't exist. You need to evaluate what your skills are, and how to build those tools to allow you to do what you want to do. I saw a TED Talk earlier this year of a blind astronomer. Most people will think, ""Wait, don't you need to see the stars to do astronomy?"" Well, her speciality was gamma-ray bursts... which are not visible anyways. She worked with some colleagues to develop software that allowed the light curves to be translated into sound.

In a similiar manner, infectious diseases are usually small enough to be not visible. You need tools to magnify them and some of those tools can be adapted. If I'm not mistaken, they already have microscopes that can automatically count stuff they are looking at. Instead of a visible display, you need something that can auditorily read it out for you. I know someone with RP that works in the field of research, and he was able to get some stuff adapted (although I think he did a lot of computer stuff).

One of the biggest things that will help you will be to find a mentor. Someone to help guide you through the path, and knows what things are coming up that could be a problem for you. With that heads-up, your responsibility would be to figure out how to adapt your equipment and prepare your skills for that inevitable challenge. It might be as simple as learning to use adaptive technology to read off numbers, or as difficult as memorizing stacks and stacks of legal briefs.

Also, if you enjoy science fiction, I'd strongly advise you to check out [Big Finish](https://www.bigfinish.com).  While they do have a podcast, it's usually actor interviews and so-on.  However, the audio dramas they offer for purchase, while they're quite expensive, are some of the best acted and produced science fiction audio being made today.  If you enjoy DR Who, the monthly series is worth the money.

I'd say go with a hat with a wide brim to warn him of low-hanging branches, so he doesn't hit his head on stuff. He may also want a pair of protective glasses, or sunglasses if bright light makes his vision worse. 

Also, he should take a trekking pole he can use for support/probing. It'll be better on the rough terrain than a travel cane and he can use it to quickly put some weight on if he stumbles and needs support. If you're guiding him the whole time he should use one. Otherwise he should get and use two. 

Also, he should wear hiking boots with great ankle support, since he could be prone to stepping wrong and getting a sprain if he can't see the terrain that well.

People often give completely useless help. ""Over there"" is not a direction that works for me and is generally the directions people give you on a bus. 

""Five feet to your left"" or a clock direction is better. We know the clock, because we sweep 10 to 2 with our canes. 

One of the tech trainers that works at my local center, I knew from riding the bus to and from school. I had a car, but parking at the school was ridiculous and they offered free bus passes. He is completely blind since birth, as is his wife. I used to offer them rides when I would see them at the store and they never wanted to take them. 

I have come to respect him immensely, he is awesome. He can use echo location indoors. But now that he knows me better, and knows that I have peripheral vision, he will happily put his hand on my shoulder outdoors to be led somewhere. 

When you see someone that is blind, you don't know how blind they are and you have no idea what their level of independence is. Asking is fine, we won't take offense. Don't be pushy. Blind people are just like regular people, some of us are happy to accept help and some of us want to be left alone. Sometimes, it just depends on the situation.

442,I use to have a galaxy s4. If your mother in law is not a big phone user she might be OK with the Samsung. There are a few apps that are in the Google play store that might help.

469,"I looked at the Braille Watch (the dot, I believe it's called) and it's about three hundred dollars last I checked. The other watches are similarly priced and haven't impressed me. Ideally I would like something that I can use very quickly. 

The Apple Watch voice over was impressive, I had no idea it could do so much. My main problem was that the haptic time only worked when voiceover was on, and half the time it spoke the time instead. If my Bluetooth headphones were paired then this was a problem. 

But that leads to my biggest issue: Bluetooth pairing. I listen to mainly podcasts, live radio, and audio books, NONE of which can be downloaded onto the watch. Only two gigs of iTunes music can be downloaded onto the watch. If the audio is not downloaded onto the watch itself then the watch only controls the music playing from the phone. However, if my headphones are paired to the phone to listen to music then they can't be paired with the watch to control it. If my phone is close enough to me that i can listen to the audio without headphones then it is close enough to touch and i have no need of the watch to control it. 

Basically, the Apple Watch is pretty cool, but for the way I wanted to use it the price was way to high. If someone made a watch app that would tell the time haptically without voice over having to be on then I might buy an older version of the watch. But currently I've returned the watch. 

I would love a simple haptic watch that used long and short pulses. Something like a bracelet or a charm.

(Sorry, I'm a sighted programmer so I'm extremely familiar with how difficult it can be to parse text on the web, unfortunately I'm not familiar with many of the existing products to do it for users. The ones I've seen are terrible.)

I've written my own simple, interactive fiction frameworks in Ruby and Python in the past but I'd recommend using a more mature framework like PyF or others that let you enter the gameplay in simple markup like XML, YAML or Json.

Have you always had a visual impairment? Do you know what causes yours? Do you get frustrated when you can't see things that fully sighted people can see but feel like you don't totally fit into the blind community either? 

It's rare that I find other people so close to in the same shoes as me. 

It seems silly but sometimes it feels isolating. I'm sighted enough even close family forget but not sighted enough to go through life without making adjustments and trying to figure out skills to see things. 

How do you explain your vision to people? People in my life don't seem to understand that you can have a visual impairment that can't be corrected but isn't total blindness (or passed the 20/200 threshold at least). 

Do you use any tools to make day to day life easier like bioptics or a monocular? Maybe purple sunglasses or zoomtext/accessibility features on your computer? 

How do you watch tv? Do you ever add descriptive audio? I have a normal smart tv which is great but if I really want to keep up with a new show or movie i either pull out a folding camping chair i own and place it directly in front of the tv or I just use my phone. When I'm tired even if I don't really care about the show I use my phone because it's just easier. 

Is your close vision (like reading distance) fairly unaffected? 

What other tools do you use to more seamlessly blend in as a fully sighted member of society? Do you ever get frustrated when you can't see things that you feel like you should be able to see?
