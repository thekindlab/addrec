Otherwise the body load and psychedelic mental acceleration and abstract thought would obviously still be present.

56,"I've seen a lot of floor markings around here that are intended for people with vision impairment to be able to find their way around in bus terminals and such. There are markings in the floor (basically different tiles with different markings in them) for paths, markings for the path intersections, stairs, obstacles, traffic crossings and such so that you are able to find your way around sofas, trash cans, sales stands and plants and such through a predetermined path.

We have those at all the outdoor bus stops that has been rebuilt in the past 15 years too, so I pretty much assumed that there is an international standard for it - it seemed pretty dumb if every country would make up their own system for the tiles when they could rather agree on something together and go with it. (the markings at a bus stop is pretty simple though, it marks a straight line forward a meter or two from the wind shelter towards the roadside platform and end with a marking right next to where the bus driver aims with the door.)

EDIT: I just read up on it, the tactile tilings are a requirement for all bus stops that average 100 passengers or more per day, but I'm pretty sure that I've seen it on a lot of places where there are a lot less passengers than that, so there is a discretion element in the decision making as well.

EDIT2: Oh, when I say ""requirement"" I mean that the local bus transit company here has come to the conclusion that it's reasonable that bus stops with a specific amount of passengers are available for as many disabled people as possible, so the tactile tilings is a part of what they require to be allowed to build if they are even to consider building a bus stop at a specific address.",,,,enjoyoutdoors,,,1476282765,t5_2qpec,t3_56t9lg,t1_d8oewr4,1,1478546942,0,0,d8osvy6,Blind,,,,,

We are Masters students, and the survey results will not be shared with anyone outside the course (40 students) and our supervisor (3 people).

However, a decent proportion of products from the course are often carried to full term products (I believe last year around 30% attained patents and are currently looking for startup funding).

79,"No worries buddy, its helping me out too. Like I said, I still remind myself this shit daily.

Still working on distinguishing ""laziness"" too. It's obvious if it was something I wanted to do that I can't face. The best I can do is look at why I'm avoiding it case by case.

Sometimes it really is because I just don't want to do something - and I have to be honest with myself and either suck it up and do it or accept the consequences.

But if it's a lack of focus, then I know its because I'm not producing enough dopamine from stimulation (at least, that's my understanding of it) and is seeking more. 

That's completely out of my conscious control, and trying to fight it is like trying to stop myself sweating when I'm warm through sheer willpower. It's futile to fight it without some kind of assistance, and that's why it's such a sure shot to depression. You're fighting against your fundamental nature. And if you're anything like me, you know there is no one more stubborn than yourself. There are no winners in that war.

On the other hand, if I can't *motivate* myself, it's usually from fear of failing, or of letting someone dowm, or of feeling inadequate, or even because I deliberately want to sabotage and hurt myself (it happens). That's when I know it's coming from the anxiety or depression: and now I know that I *learned* those bad habits (from parents, friends, school, bullying, relationships, wherever..) and that they *can* be talked down when I have the strength.

Of course, sometimes I can't. Sometimes I just sleep away a day. Sometimes I get lost reliving each of my life failures item by item. Sometimes I have a little cry and hug my dogs. But I try my best not to beat myself up over it when it happens.

Sometimes I do succeed, though. Sometimes it does get through that ""this is just my brain being dumb"", ""this isn't me"". 

And every time I do, it gets a little easier, my brain starts laying new pathways and connections that don't death spirals. And every time I stop myself circling in, I weaken the existing dark paths and help make breaking out of them easier the next time. It's taking advantage of that same mental snowballing that got us in this mess in the first place.

It sounds stupid that we have to re-learn to be happy, but that's pretty much what it is. The old way didn't work, and just got us a lot of practice at being depressed. ",,,,Akujinnoninjin,,,1475952404,t5_2qpec,t3_5627a2,t1_d8jd5ha,2,1478454489,0,0,d8jhmvx,Blind,,,,,

I've taken a shower to relax in the morning, and put back on the same underwear I wore during the night though (because I took a shower the night before). I consciously broke the habit of changing my underwear just because I wanted to relax in the shower. Those panties are still clean! 

What are people's feelings about not taking a shower in the morning? Someone told me that was gross once. I was raised to take showers at night. But his argument was even just laying in bed for 7 hours called for a shower. Really??

How often do people change their underwear?

I am not so bothered about the voice sounding natural as I want it to sound uniform, and to be understandable when it speaks very quickly.

- are all you text books at school in Braille and if so was this something the school provided for you or did you have to source external help to convert type based books to Braille?

- how do you transport your Braille around with you? From what I have seen Braille books can be huge and I can remember my school books being fairly big in type format. 

- are you educated in an environment with fully sighted individuals? If yes do you find other student having an interest in your Braille books or learning tools?

- do you ever find yourself using audio feedback from a device in the classroom environment? Do you wear headphones or does it come out of a speaker?

- there are lots of educational tools on the market to aid the visually impaired. Is the material choice and tactile feedback something that you would consider when purchasing one of these devices? Or is it purely function based and a nice to hold/feel product is a bonus? 

Would love to hear your thoughts on theses questions and if anything else springs to your mind let me know :)

My immediate thought to solve that issue would be authenticated printing (or so-called ""follow me printing""), so that the print job is sent, but not actually printed until you go up to the device and authenticate yourself by card or similar.

164,"Right now I'm just trying to get my room clean because I feel like at the very least I should do that but every time I go to do it I just feel how fucking exhausted I am and suddenly demotivate myself.

It's hard to push yourself to do something you don't expect to get anything out if other than more tiredness. I guess I need to change my expectations but it's hard when literally every past result points towards activity = more tired. 

Part of it I think is that I need to be able to intrinsically motivate myself -- I'm great at doing errands and small chores for everyone around the house, but not so much something that benefits me and me only. Cooking for the family? Meal will be done in 30 minutes. Cooking for just myself? Never happening, I can just eat a microwaved chicken patty and be done with it.

So that's been super difficult because everything that makes MY life better doesn't directly benefit anyone other than myself at this juncture. There's a solution somewhere it's just been a hell of a time finding it. Bright side, there's an ADHD counseling center about an hour away I found and I'm gonna call them on Monday and see if I can't get help there, and then maybe I can share with you whatever they tell me. 

Starting new habits is so hard, like you said. The first few days of forcing myself to exercise have been horrible but once it's routine it's routine and it's no longer an effort, it's just what you do. I assume it's like that with thoughts, but that's a little less quantifiable.",,,,Nibiria,,,1475954192,t5_2qpec,t3_5627a2,t1_d8jhmvx,2,1478455072,0,0,d8jiuds,Blind,,,,,
165,"Yeah, shit like cleaning is a big roadblock for me. That's where the techniques to work around the ADHD'll come in handy. 

&gt;every time I go to do it I just feel how fucking exhausted I am and suddenly demotivate myself.

If you were a ""normal"" person, that surge of energy to ""fix things"" would be all it took - you'd start cleaning, and you'd keep cleaning, and you'd feel accomplished, and gradually you'd snowball and everything would eventually get rosy. That's just how the brain is ""supposed"" to deal with sadness.

The mechanism doesn't quite work the same in us, because the ADHD means we can't keep ourselves distracted on a single thing, so we inevitably get frustrated or feel like failures when we try; reinforcing the depression.

It's very common for people suffering both to do this - it's called ""Cycling"". Basically, it's turning our efforts to fight the depression into reinforcements for it, and you end up chronically depressed. 

The trick, I was told, is the whole ""work with it, not against it"" attitude that I've started to take. 

So, for the cleaning, at this point I'm guessing it's probably because it got forgotten so long during the depressive periods that you can't face it. So try breaking it down: make your goal to clean the room, but your objective for right now/today is to just clear the floor, or your desk. Then tomorrow (or whenever you feel up to it, earlier or later), you quickly check the bits you already did and then do the next bit. And you keep snowballing like that, and the habits form. I found making a heap somewhere in the room of ""shit that belongs elsewhere"" helps me to stop wandering off and getting distracted mid clean, and then I grab things and put them away as I go past it or as an urge takes me. Just trying to take advantage of how my brain works.

It sounds really dumb, like we're having to learn basic life skills again. But to a large degree, we actually are. I've been finding it a pretty good general technique for life too - break the problem into little steps. In your case, the ADHD counselor sounds like a really solid next step. 

&gt;I'm great at doing errands and small chores for everyone around the house, but not so much something that benefits me and me only.

Ugh, I hear that. And that's the low self worth talking: you're not seeing yourself as worth the effort. You can see with how it comes and goes with your mood. You might find some use in rephrasing your tasks to be for other people's benefit at first - that's how I got into the habit of doing the dishes and laundry reliably - but you have to be careful and set targets you know you can clear early on. A setback when you're working on someone else's behalf is gonna wreck you or leave you resentful, at least until you're strong enough to cope with them.

&gt;So that's been super difficult because everything that makes MY life better doesn't directly benefit anyone other than myself at this juncture. There's a solution somewhere it's just been a hell of a time finding it.

Learning to see yourself as worth a damn will be a start. But like I said, that'll come back with the mood. It's surprised me how fast things started to gather momentum: because the depression makes *everything* harder, relieving it even slightly has a huge knock on effect. 

Good luck, and go easy on yourself.",,,,Akujinnoninjin,,,1475958067,t5_2qpec,t3_5627a2,t1_d8jiuds,2,1478456327,0,0,d8jlg7e,Blind,,,,,

169,"This is really shocking to me that your mother is so seemingly ambivalent when it comes to your safety in this matter. The white cane is designed to be very visible to sighted persons and when using either the two tap or the constant contact method your cane makes plenty of sound for others to hear as well. 

You should just tell your mom exactly what you've written here, definitely include the past issues with her as your sided guide. Or just link her this topic and let her read it. 

Some of the wording in your post makes it seem like there's some resentment and/or hesitation to communicate between you and your mom (she never ""bothered"" to learn sided guide, she mentions safety of others in a situation where the white cane would greatly increase your own safety).

184,"Simply bend a little and pour the water from the bottle slowly with one hand in between your butt cheeks from the bottle above. Directly onto yourself so that the water flows over your skin and gets where it needs to be. With your other hand wipe away under the water flow until it feels clean.

No extra rag because that would only complicate things. You don't always have a rag or several and you somehow would have to dispose it. Toilet paper is no option because is useless when wet. Also the friction from toilet paper and rags can be unpleasant. Your hand is much softer and more exact for the job.

You can use the toilet paper to dry your butt a bit if you want.

One hand stays clean and the other doesn't so use the clean hand to pull up your pants and touch whatever you need until you can wash your hands and refill the bottle.

I use a short one liter bottle that can easily be placed under the tap in the sink to be refilled. 0.75 liter is also enough but sometimes a little bit more is nice/useful. Instead of transporting the bottle just leave a filled up bottle everywhere you need it (at home, work, ...).

For the first few days you will feel/be very clumsy and it will feel very unusual so that you maybe think that you can't live like this.

207,"For me, at least, that tiredness and need to not do anything turned out to not be what I thought. When I really looked at it I found it wasn't that I wanted to sleep so much as I wanted to not be awake - I was trying to avoid life.

I found other avoidance symptoms would spike with me too - I got lost in World of Warcraft or in Reddit. 

Two things have helped me with that. The first is medication: I eventually cycled around to one that seems to knock most of my anxieties on the head, and that raises my baseline enough that i have the will to push myself again.

The second was diagnosis (and acceptance) of ADHD. I needed to adjust my response to my depression to take into account that - to ELI5 - my brain needs constant stimulation or it gets sad and wants to sleep until life is more interesting. This explained one of the major mechanisms in my brain that was nuking my mood.

I don't know if I have advice - I honestly don't think I'm qualified. But I hope my thought processes will help. And let you know you aren't alone feeling like this.

I'm wondering if you have a reference for the way people dress and what's considered trashy/nice/odd. If you don't have a reference, how did you define these things for yourself?

If someone describes a feeling they get from a color, does that trigger a color or something else in your mind? Are you able to see color in your mind, and just have no reference for which colors are which, or do you not see color in your mind at all?",,,,EffYourUpvotes,,,1477063226,t5_2qpec,t3_58kjqd,t1_d91nia7,2,1478776212,0,0,d91u6qw,Blind,,,,,

252,"Thank you for your answer - just the kind of insight I was looking for.


Yes, many things would definitely have to be learned, but the actual seeing might not take as long as you fear. Babies can see from birth, but they are not really able to interpret what they see. Their vision is fully developed within a year. Of course, baby-brains undergo much more drastic changes in their first year of life than is possible for adult brains, but we still maintain a certain degree of neuronal plasticity. 


Reading and understanding words is an almost entirely different cognitive function and that might turn out to be more difficult, but a very good point nonetheless. 


Your points about government support are very interesting and not something I had considered previously. 


&gt; So saying you can restore sight without cost just isn't true.

My apologies, but that was not what I intended to say. I was attempting to create a fictional situation where concerns of the cost of the operation in terms of money and fear of pain were eliminated in order to let more interesting points come forth.

You belong to a patient group that I had not previously considered. As you mention yourself, the fact that you are missing a good portion of your visual cortex complicates things because of the advanced state of the processing occurring at this stage. We do not yet fully understand how visual information is treated within the various visual areas of the cortex, and not knowing what to replace and replicate, makes the task daunting. 


However, we do know that there are two major ""processing streams"" that perform different operations and we are slowly piecing together what these operations are specifically. It is therefore not unthinkable that we would one day be able to create an implant capable of performing the task of the missing region. The most challenging aspect of this is how to ""connect"" to the brain in a manner that makes sense to the brain, so to speak.

262,"From a physical point of view, that seems difficult. ""One-way"" mirrors still work by letting through only approximately half of the light, with one side coated sparsely with a reflective material. In order for the eyes to be obfuscated, the area behind the glass also has to be significantly darker than the other side. And, of course, the whole thing would darken your vision by only letting about half of the light through. It's not much, if any, better than normal sunglasses, really.

I thought about a polarising filter, like it's used on privacy-protecting screens, but people who are looking straight towards your glasses in an orthogonal angle to the glasses would still see your eyes perfectly, which is exactly what you'd like to avoid. Additionally, such filters tend to produce a darker image, too. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a viable solution for glasses, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. I hope that you'll find a solution to that specific problem.",,,,an_whitehead,,,1476929839,t5_2qpec,t3_58e7zj,t3_58e7zj,4,1478739586,0,0,d8zqmb2,Blind,,,,,

Note that the underlying reason is different from when most people rub their eyes due to irritation (for example, many people will rub their eyes after staring at a computer screen for hours).  oculodigital stimulation is mainly because it ""feels good,"" and can be habitual.

There are far more efficient ways of dealing with things like signs, particularly with the benefit of new apps. Indeed, I would say this is far easier than having to search for the sign which is often placed in odd locations or at strange heights.

Finally, saying that modifications of the alphabet and it's further integration into different countries is innovation seems weak to me. This is simply a modification, rather than any kind of substantive change. It is also the outer limit of what can be done with Braille. Whereas screen readers are built into technologies that can change in practically every direction, Braille lacks any form of cohesive mechanism for change.

343,"Oh dear. I had a very long argument with several VI teachers about two days ago on just this topic. I wish I had kept the whole conversation. Copy and paste!

anyway, I'll keep this brief if I can.


 First, as everyone will default to, Braille is inefficient to Kerry, expensive to produce and, as of yet, impractical on the technological level. I'm sure you've heard all this before, so I won't bother reiterating all of that.


Second, Braille and its potential evolution is currently stalled, due to the fact that it is entrenched within a predominately sighted teaching culture which says that it is the only form of literacy. You will encounter a great deal of resistance to Braille and its use because of this predilection, particularly as it is widely held that literacy and other skills cannot be learned through an audio format, meaning that Braille is the only viable option taught within current schools. This is blatantly false for many, many reasons… Fuck it. I will copy and paste this part. ""This is where we disagree. Your definition of literacy is entirely a contrivance. The actual definition has absolutely no references to tactility. Your co-opting the visual usage of the definition to explain why Braille is good, but that doesn't change the fact that you are redefining literacy as much as I am when I say audio fits the definition of literacy as well. For that matter, you're also redefining reading as something that is done either visually or in a tactile form, despite the fact that the tactile and visual parts of the brain are completely separate things. If you're going to argue from the perspective of neurology, then you're already on a very slippery slope for a number of reasons. First, as I've already said, tactility and visual input are very separate things. Secondly, as you well know, someone who has lost a sense has a high probability of their brain adapting and repurposing unused portions to augment other sensory areas of the brain. Therefore, literacy comprehension is most likely a composite of different sensory areas of the brain that have been repurposed. Thirdly, language comprehension and verbosity are both controlled in roughly the same area, which would be Broca's and Wernicke's. This is where the majority of literacy comes from, as it represents the ability to understand, interpret and use language in an understandable fashion. These are auditory parts of the brain though, right next to the ear in fact. The only thing that viewing something by touch gives you that is more difficult from an audio perspective is spatial layout, such as seeing a page wholistically. But even this fails to take into account the fact that with consistent audio usage, people develop a spacial recognition of how text would be laid out anyway. If I am listening to a webpage, I don't imagine each line of text in a vacuum. I construct an image of that screen's layout, and it's very easy to write software that allows us to identify precisely where on the screen text is. This is not a failing of the audio input, just a failing of how much we care.

Finally, the ability to learn proper spelling, layout, grammar and punctuation hasn't been proved to be linked to Braille. I think you would need to conduct some kind of case study in which there is a control group and a group who uses only audio. By no means do I think that the conclusion will be that you cannot learn correct language usage through audio, particularly with increased technological development like AutoCorrect, textual suggestions and more comprehensive screen reader software that can annunciate, provide fast textual recall and other methods that are being increasingly integrated into iPhones and other, mainstream technologies.""


Third. Braille is by definition difficult to evolve and difficult to imagine in any other form. It is trapped within the parameters of being a tactile alphabet, which means that it cannot respond easily to change. This is one of the crucial problems I think you'll face. For example, it may be possible to present things that can be learned via Braille, but not via audio. The response to this is that those who develop screen readers will search and find an option that solves this problem. This is contingent upon the speed of screen reader and audio text to speech development, which evolves as any Technology does: namely, rapidly and exponentially. Additionally, screen reader and other audio forms of literacy are being adopted by mainstream companies such as Apple, as represented by voice over. This promotes rapid change. In contrast, because Braille is limited to a very small subset of the population, and because it is very much curtailed by its own format, it cannot evolve similarly. A problem that braille cannot solve that audio can cannot be responded to by Braille, as it's capacity has already been established for the last 30 or 40 years.


Fourth. Braille requires the active usage of the hands. This means that while reading, a blind person is simultaneously unable to perform other tasks. On the other hand, an audio format can be listened to with one headphone, leaving a blind person relatively unencumbered. This means that Braille is much more difficult to use in a fast paced mobile environment.

So my current plan to combat that is hobbies that make me feel like I'm ""accomplishing"" something - I've started an indoor greenhouse for vegetables (building something, lowering the grocery bills, something I can check on regularly - all good things).

Interestingly, I found myself nodding in agreement to it with regards to how I approached my *mental* health problems: I had the exact same experience where there was a frustrating ""inbetween"" period where I knew I had PTSD and yet I was still trying to force myself to act like nothing was wrong, exacerbating everything. 

I think that's the real killer - you need to force yourself to accept that, on a deep level, *Things Have Changed Now*. It's incredibly hard, but makes such a huge difference to your ongoing mental health. 

You stop looking at yourself as a failure, listing all the things you ""used to"" - or worse: ""ought to"" - be able to do, and start looking at what you're *going* to do. Constantly beating yourself up over your perceived inadequacies is a straight shot to depression

366,"I don't think you need to make the question this complicated.

Do you gain something from using the cane? (pause.) There you go. Use it.

The cane helps you avoid stumbling into things by mistake. The cane signals to other people that you might need some extra space and that you sometimes would appreciate getting a helping hand finding your way around.

It is as you say, you need to practice using the cane so that you can become more independent. Practicing in familiar environments with familiar people is a lot easier than practicing where you have no previous knowledge. You will eventually have to throw yourself out in the world and try unfamiliar places, but before you do you need the practice.

Your future ability to function independently is more important than what anyone thinks of you when you use it. Besides, you can't really change that you need the cane, so there is little use of being worried about it being awkward. Accepting and owning your disability is the first step into a fulfilling life with it.

Somebody who doesn't understand the tools available for a blind person immediately gets a ""um.... are you sure that they can even do the job?"" response, which is totally incorrect because by every single metric he was the best candidate, and it'd require only minimal amount of effort for the organization to support them (basically would just need someone else to help them review the training documentation which was all scanned PDFs)",,,,mirhagk,,,1475595272,t5_2qpec,t3_55shic,t1_d8dfgnn,4,1478352382,0,0,d8dmv2j,Blind,,,,,

I had high interocular pressure due to thick corneas, it was like that for years. The first I exam I had after starting to take marijuana edibles for sleep showed my intraocular pressure in the normal range. My blood pressure, which was always normal, fell to low normal.

If it's support you are trying to gather, maybe remake this post on a sister-sub to the one you were banned from.

I find it's more about finding novel ways of making the brain work, constructing great meaning out of little bits in ways that my English-speaking brain has to train and maybe break a little in order to do. Existing languages do this as well, and I like studying those, but not really learning to speak them. There's just so much investment. I don't even plan on becoming fluent in my own languages.

When I was a kid, I basically read whatever was around.

As far as the job, it's entry-level. I spent the last year working as a software engineer through my university, but I can't go back for financial reasons, so I lost the job. I need something to do for the next few years just to get on my feet. Mostly, it's just going into the bathroom with a bunch of dudes to make sure they don't cheat on their urine tests.

393,"&gt;how can I get my mom to see this is serious?

This seems to be your most important hurdle.  Getting your mom to see the issue will allow her to be on your side and advocate for what you need.

Looking at your other posts, it seems as if you already have an IEP, so what has her involvement been so far?  Has she always acted in a similar fashion or is this new behavior for her?

Is there any other adult that you can get on your side (teacher, counselor, pastor, family member) who will be able to get through to your mother?

Edit: OP deleted account while I was posting the following reply, just in case OP comes back to read the thread:

Then I'm more inclined to agree with /u/CrashGordon94. I wouldn't necessarily advise going straight to CPS for child abuse, but it is clear that your mother is a detriment to you.  No it is not normal that you are treated this way and I'm sorry that every adult in your life appears to be a terrible person.

Speaking from personal experience, it is a terrible thing to be told that your child will be blind.  However, it is absolutely no excuse for your mother's behavior.

You need to get a responsible adult to help you.  I recommend a counselor or teacher that you trust and tell them everything that is going on including your mother's behavior.

If not you are forced to deal with her on your own.  The best strategy is might be to agree with her that it might go away (even if you don't think this is true).

399,"It's all about finding balance just like it is with pharmaceuticals. Finding the lowest effective dose that shit. The only way to know for sure is do some research on the best strains for lowering intraocular pressure. It may be that you don't need a high level of THC to do that. THC is psychoactive but how much it impacts you depends on what the percentages and how much you consume. It may take you some time to figure out what best works for you and it's not fast acting so it may take a little while to see results. That said if it's your only option…

I only use edibles at night because my primary use is for sleep. The lowered pressures are just a bonus. I take an edible about an hour before bedtime, I sleep through the high and the munchies, and by the time I wake up in the morning my head is clear.  That may be something that works for you.

My name is Jonathon. I do… Well, even I don't really know that. I am completely blind with double prosthetics and have been since I was about two years old. I recently returned to my former home state of Texas after having spent three years backpacking across North and South America. That, and the advocacy work that I did with children regarding the ability to travel independently as a blind person in non-traditional fashions, has been my focus for quite some time. I am now taking a bit of time to pursue an interest in biochemistry, at which point I intend to resume my travels, most likely in Northern Africa, while interacting with the open source chemistry scenen. Not too sure on that time frame though; I imagine those plans will come to fruition within the next year or so.


Other than that… I'm not really sure. I read prolifically, performed stand-up comedy to make money while travelling, love gambling and worked as a brewer and distiller for awhile, so have a deep and probably unhealthy love of alcohol.

417,"Wow!!!!! I'm overwhelmed this is awesome haha! Brilliant information lots to digest and review. 

From what I have observed Braille book are enormous and must be a nightmare to carry around, they don't seem very practical. Simple task that non-blind user take for granted must be hard for a visually impaired user. E.g getting your favourite novel out on the train... how do people genuinely carry this resource around and what's it like using it in a public space...?

I can see why people prefer audio simply because of it accessibility and convenience. I have read that a there are a percentage of blind individuals that are solely reliant on Braille as a means of communication and education. Personally I feel there is a sense of fun when reading a book over audio book, it's almost therapeutic and a way to winding down, personally I don't know if visually impaired people feel the same?... 

To me Braille is a beautiful resource, it's form and the way people interact with is almost like a super power and it always fascinates me. 

Have you experienced using Braille in a classroom e.g at school? And also are visually impaired individuals segregated from other people in the classroom because of their impairment? 

Really appreciate you response! Fantastic source of insights.

466,"  I'm a sighted person who goes to a university with a lot of blind people (every day I see around 10 people with canes and or service dogs). No one says anything to them or does anything mean or rude to them as far as I can tell. If anything I whistle or walk a little bit louder if they are walking really close to me so they know I am there haha. So maybe you'll hear people suddenly be louder when you walk past but that should be it, maybe even one of them will be me haha. There are so many people at my university that I never see the same person twice, so honestly no one should care. 

  Maybe some immature people will care and get upset, but you can't limit yourself on what they might do, they're cowards who live in fear and the sight of a person who lacks an ability they have but is still able to pursue their goals triggers them. If you need the cane to travel freely then I encourage you to use it, if these kind of people get upset, then you've already won by educating yourself and by pushing your own boundaries and making yourself stronger than they could ever be as they are controlled by their weaknesses and you are not.

472,"&gt; It's actually really interesting that you say that. Because on my first play of lifeline, I got to the best ending, right off. Whereas I've died multiple times in timecrest, and gave up before actually finishing it.

Great feedback. Most of our players have not been frustrated by the choices, but you had a negative experience and we'll review the paths as a result. What chapter did you get stuck on? This would help us take a look.

One of the points we could improve upon, is the idea that death &amp; Turn Back Time are an essential part of the store, not an ending. We might make it confusing with the ""you have reached and ending, but it is not the true ending"" text as part of the fake-out, and we can revisit how we present it. For example, there is an unavoidable death that occurs in one of the later chapters that is an essential part of the storyline moving forward, as Ash is dangerously experimenting with magic &amp; death. 

Long story short, many deaths are supposed to move the story forward, not push the player to restart the game. So we'll evaluate how to keep players from feeling frustrated but rather feel like they should push forward in these instances.

&gt; You know what might actually help here? An in-game item for, say, $4.99 that, when activated, would disable the ability to use time crystals at all, until the game has been completed at least once without them.

This is an interesting idea for sure, and we'll continue to evaluate options like this in the future. We have to definitely balance a few factors here, for example that we don't want to devalue players who have already purchased Time Crystals in the past, and also trying to create a business model where while most can play free, others can support the viability for Timecrest.

Ultimately, we're still eating ramen and hoping that eventually we'll earn enough money to keep writing Timecrest without having to go back to our old day-jobs. So we're trying out best to make a fair and fun business model while trying to make our company sustainable, which I hope you can understand.

We have the most fun writing Timecrest, and adding features that benefit blind and low-vision players, and business models just isn't our favorite part of this. At the same time, we're fighting for the ability to keep writing more stories for you, and it's tough just starting out in this industry.",,,,jplus,,,1475889039,t5_2qpec,t3_56e7bt,t1_d8io1ce,2,1478440471,0,0,d8iojt0,Blind,,,,,

483,"Fastfinge, thanks for your feedback! We really appreciate your thoughts.

None of it came off as insulting. We have done many passes on our timers to make them realistic and satisfying. The ultimate goal is to increase immersion, not take you out of the game. In fact, our most recent update decreased most of the timers from chapters 1 through 3 as we continued to apply feedback from our players.

A lot of how you're feeling, we addressed in a letter to Interactive Fiction guru Emily Short, in her post [here](https://emshort.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/october-mailbag-new-game-versions/#more-25186). Let me post some of the relevant sections of our letter:

**About In-App Purchase and Business Models**

&gt; You also commented about free-to-play, and I wanted to discuss this with you. We wanted the game to be accessible to as many people as possible. We’re just a 2 person, independent game studio, without a huge marketing budget, nor connections to Apple, to build out our brand. Without a budget, it is much easier to get people to try a free game than a paid app.

&gt; After having worked in the mobile games industry for many years, we began with some design principles to ensure that f2p did not detract from the overall quality and experience of the game. The game is never pay-to-win, and you are never blocked from progress as a free user. All timers are designed to enhance the immersion and realism of the story, that you feel this other world is moving forward and things are happening in real time. We actually believe that the free users get the best experience of the story, and we test our game balance and pacing as free users to ensure it plays smoothly without use of premium currency. 

**About Interactive Fiction/Comparing to Other Games** 

&gt; We developed these writing principles as we learned the craft of writing interactive fiction:

&gt; * Choices should feel as though they impact the story. We worked hard to create different paths and interesting choices for the characters.
&gt; * Choices affect the story, but no path is the “wrong” path. A lot of the stories we see right now are a single character trying to survive a single scenario. It’s entertaining, but we were looking for something deeper. We wanted each choice to create a different journey through the game, where decisions you make in early chapters can dramatically change what happens in future chapters. A whole city may be destroyed, some characters may live or die early on, and this completely changes some scenes late in the story.
There should be conflict, with a clear beginning, middle and end. Story structure still matters, even if your choices are changing the story.
&gt; * Character relationships matter. On our whiteboard we wrote, “Break a promise to save the world, and that character may betray you later. Follow through on that promise, and lose an opportunity, but make a new friend.” 

We don't say any of the above to discount what you're saying or feeling, fastfinge. How you feel is valid and we take it to heart. 

We wanted to explain how we thought about the problem and what principles we use as we continue to update the game. Our first version of the game had 20,000 words, and now we have 10x the content with 200,000 words, so believe us when we're prepared to keep listening to feedback and making the game better.

485,"I'm not blind, but I do know that if a person was born blind, and research suggests that this might also be true of those who become blind at a very young age, the part of the brain used for vision gets taken over and used for other things. This means that they wouldn't be able to see even with LSD or stimulation of the brain.

People who become blind later in life certainly build up mental images and stuff, but people who are born blind can't really build mental pictures or anything because they don't know what seeing or images are like. It's like when you ask a blind person if they see blackness. If they were born completely blind, they just aren't aware of any vision input at all, even blackness, whereas someone who lost vision is still looking for visual input, and because they aren't getting any they see blackness.

502,"On the mobile, so forgive typos.

I hear you on wanting to be able to watch a whole movie - I hate looking rude, and I can't force the girlfriend to watch movies in 30-45 minute bites. Honestly I don't have a solution to it yet. (And a small part of me doesn't want to try to - accepting what I am, not what I *ought to be* and all that.)

Given that we sound like we're on very similar pages, here's some more specific advice I've found useful.

Analyze your mood constantly. Figure out why you feel like you do minute by minute - you can't fight the enemy you don't know. Recognise what's causing the mood swing - the depression is a symptom. Is it unfulfilled ADHD? The anxiety? Tiredness? Hunger?

Analyze your behavior too. Watch for coping mechanisms as a sign you're not doing so well. Endorphin cravings from depression can manifest as anything from increased masturbation, to sugar binging or increased risk taking. 

Watch your avoidance habits - binge gaming or RPG playing were my bugbears. Avoidance is useful, but I let it get destructive by playing WoW in favor of life.

Watch your thoughts. Recognise when you're replaying embarrassing memories in your mind, or rewatching a failure - spot when your brain is in a death spiral and put a conscious effort in to cut it out. If it helps, analyze the scene clinically, and figure out what you learned from it - focus always on the next time and not on the failures.

Watch when you're thinking ""I ought to be"" or ""I should be"". They're almost never followed by something helpful. Think of what you ARE. You're not any less smart than you were before. You're not any less capable. So use those smarts and learn to read and use your emotions. 

Remember that the brain learns by repetition and by association. The more you try and push yourself in ways you can't, the more you're going to associate those things with depression and the easier and deeper you get depressed. You have to break that cycle. Do the things you CAN do, and try and figure out alternate ways to do the things you can't. Something as simple as remembering to break tasks into smaller chunks (that i cam switch between or abandon) has really been helping me. ADHD specialist life coaches would have additional techniques.

Try and get your baseline mood up. Pick up those hobbies again, and do the things you love. Make it easier for your brain to be happy. Keep taking your meds and change them up till they work (shout out to Effexor/Venlafaxine as what finally worked for me). Exercise. Eat well. Shower. But don't beat yourself up if you can't do those things either - the motivation comes back with the mood, and is a good symptom you're on the road to recovery. 

Do your best to eat enough though, and if I can preach a little, try and avoid sugars and processed carbs to avoid the blood sugar related mood fluctuations. I could also harp on about the benefits of /r/keto and specifically Keto Chow for taking the effort out of forcing myself to eat right.

Work with yourself, instead of fighting it. Your brain chemistry wants to be happy just as much as you do.

And in the end, it, comes back to the fact that *Things Are Different Now* - you need to learn how it's different, and you need to learn how to work with that difference not against it.

It isn't losing and giving in.
It doesn't make you weaker, or lesser, or smaller.
it doesn't make you a quitter or any less of a fighter.

If this was a physical ailment we'd see how absurd that kind of self criticism is - things have fundamentally changed. We aren't ""average"" or ""normal"", and not even in the special snowflake kind of way. 

But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing either. Like anything else it can be a tool. 

With repetition we'll master it. In theory, we'll even learn to appreciate it...

The more you try and push yourself in ways you can't, the more you're going to associate those things with depression and the easier and deeper you get depressed. You have to break that cycle. Do the things you CAN do, and try and figure out alternate ways to do the things you can't. Something as simple as remembering to break tasks into smaller chunks (that i cam switch between or abandon) has really been helping me. ADHD specialist life coaches would have additional techniques.

Try and get your baseline mood up. Pick up those hobbies again, and do the things you love. Make it easier for your brain to be happy. Keep taking your meds and change them up till they work (shout out to Effexor/Venlafaxine as what finally worked for me). Exercise. Eat well. Shower. But don't beat yourself up if you can't do those things either - the motivation comes back with the mood, and is a good symptom you're on the road to recovery. 

Do your best to eat enough though, and if I can preach a little, try and avoid sugars and processed carbs to avoid the blood sugar related mood fluctuations. I could also harp on about the benefits of /r/keto and specifically <PERSON> for taking the effort out of forcing myself to eat right.

Work with yourself, instead of fighting it. Your brain chemistry wants to be happy just as much as you do.

And in the end, it, comes back to the fact that *Things Are Different Now* - you need to learn how it's different, and you need to learn how to work with that difference not against it.

It isn't losing and giving in.
It doesn't make you weaker, or lesser, or smaller.
it doesn't make you a quitter or any less of a fighter.

If this was a physical ailment we'd see how absurd that kind of self criticism is - things have fundamentally changed. We aren't ""average"" or ""normal"", and not even in the special snowflake kind of way. 

But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing either. Like anything else it can be a tool. 

With repetition we'll master it. In theory, we'll even learn to appreciate it...

Also, there are some primitive hacks that let formerly sighted people see, at low resolution.

512,"That's probably because eyesight is the most important factor of orientation. A healthy eye can see structures and spot precise details around you. And so the average human doesn't know how to orientate with the other senses, because they don't need to. Losing sight would render them helpless and almost unable to orientate at all. 

I for my part don't have any disabilities, and I can hardly imagine how it must be when you can't rely on sight at all. When I go to bed in the late night, I usually go my way from the computer to my bed without light. My orientation sense is actually pretty good and I do this to train my mental map of my home. But even after doing it hundreds of times, my rotation still gets slightly messed up after a few turns, which leads to me running into a wall. When I see the faint glimpse of light from the street, it usually self-corrects instantly, but without the help of that, I can rarely manage to get to my room without running into a wall. Well, maybe I'm not good enough with this because I'm not forced to do this all the time.

But back to topic: My worst fear would probably be deafness instead of blindness. Hearing is the most important sense for social life and communication, and it strongly affects emotions. Good music can cheer you up easily and studies have shown that deafness and depression often go hand-in-hand. Not being able to hear music anymore would be devastating for me.

But it's great to see how technology can even make the text based parts of the internet easily accessible for blind people. We live in a fantastic time right now.",,,,TeraFlint,not blind,,1477112193,t5_2qpec,t3_55wzgp,t1_d8kmvzf,4,1478791776,0,0,d92qdz6,Blind,,,blue2,,

I can use it because you can still see the display even if you don't have the app pulled up, but he can use the app to monitor temperatures and to know when something needs to be pulled or when more wood needs to be added if we're smoking something.

548,"There are...let's call them 'technical aids'.

Computers and smartphones are capable of reading text that is presented on the screen. They don't read it perfectly, or even near-perfectly, but they read it close enough that the technology is actually useful and provide aid that can be used. If you are blind, you will make use of not only the ability to have the computer reading information on the screen, but you also make use of the computers ability to vocally read back to you what you just wrote on the screen. If the computer can't pronounce the word, you probably typed it in wrong to begin with.

This voice-technology is pretty new, if has been refined over the last decade or so, and before that everyone used a Braille-monitor to read text of the computer screen. Braille monitors are still the only useful work tool you have if you want to work quietly and sensibly fast, so a lot of people still use them.

Braille itself was made up by a french guy somewhere in the early 1800's. It consists of pictured dots on a plastic film that can be read by drawing a finger across the dots. (I sincerely want to practice reading Braille one day, just because it seems a bit lacking that I can't even acceptably recognize my own name.)

Once computers came around, someone figured that it would be a neat idea to have about a screen-rows worth of electrically controlled dots that could be changed with magnets, and that's a Braille display. A technical aid that transforms a tiny part of the screen into dots so that they can be read with the help of a finger.

Most computers and phones nowadays cater to these users pretty well. You can pretty much use a computer fully without ever seeing the information on the monitor. It's not as fast as seeing things and clicking on them, but with practice it's more than well useable.

If you are not blind, but rather visually impaired, you make full use of the computers ability to show the text in a larger font than it actually is. Pretty much like any one of us would rather have a large television screen because you can see much more detail on it, it's the same if you can't see well on the computer - get a larger screen, and then activate the assistive software that has a digital ""magnifying glass"" that follows the cursor around.
If that is not enough, the computer can be told to only use colours that contrast each other a lot. The make the entire screen look like shit and all that, but it makes the visual information less clogged so that the screen is easier to read if you can't see well. Adding to that, a web browser can be told to never show or download images, so that a blind reader don't have to figure out how to work around them.

So, the blind people who use this sub either have their computer read out what you write, or they read it themselves using their fingers instead of reading it on a computer monitor.

It all boils down to accepting that you have to wear headphones when you use the computer and telling the computer beforehand that it has to behave in a very predictive manner so that it's easier for the text-reading software (both for the Braille Display and the text2voice-software) to find what it is that you want to read.

For the rest of us, having our car read our text messages for us while we are leaving the parking garage is just a neat feature that we appreciate a bit. If you are illiterate or blind, it's a necessity. The software is developed for them, adapted by us and as a result improved for them.

At least I hope it has been improved over the years. People who are actually blind, how do you feel about it? Has technology become more useful of the last decade or is it getting more troublesome to set up a good working environment nowadays?",,,,enjoyoutdoors,,,1475331618,t5_2qpec,t3_55afg6,t3_55afg6,6,1478235836,0,0,d89ki6j,Blind,,,,,

599,WOW! Never knew such a site existed for DV content. Thanks for sharing this gem.,,,,kwizrr,,,1475823196,t5_2qpec,t3_565557,t1_d8h9xan,1,1478421604,0,0,d8hlh6l,Blind,,,,,
600,"I'm sorry, but having described video commentary with the movie does nothing but enhances the experience for me. Before I would listen to a movie, once done go to Wikipedia to review the film's plot summary to learn what really happened. Once I discovered DV content, I can get the same shock factor someone with vision experiences when watching the movie for the first time.

The only time DV commentary becomes annoying is when they enable an audio ducking effect. Meaning the volume of the movie decreases during the playing of described audio. NetFlix seems to be the only company that doesn't adjusts the volume of the actual movie during described video commentary. They do it the right way. Just listened to season one of Marvel's Luke Cage and it is absolutely fantastic!

Yes, I do want to hear the description of what is taking place. I also want to hear the sounds happening in the background too. Just keep the volume of both at the same level. Hopefully there will be improvements made in this technology, which will allow us to control how loud we want the described audio track to be played in comparison with the movie.

And yes, described video have become like a high-tech audio book somewhat, but what exactly is wrong with that? Audio books become very very boring to listen too after a while, without some extra sound effects to enhance chapters being read. DV movies and TV shows are far from boring to follow in my opinion.

Just listen to the 2014 Densel Washington movie The Equalizer without described video first. Then listen to it again with described video. You can't honestly tell me you didn't enjoy it 500% more with described video?

The only TV show I can truly enjoy without described video is Little House on the Prairie. Most Black and white movies I can pretty much follow along without description.

Everyone completed the run and it was exhausting but also empowering.

681,"1) It depends on where the person is getting their rehabilitation. Some places have the rehab intergrated into health care, while others are seperate. Also, some hospitals and nurses are better at assisting those with vision loss than others. For example, a veteran's hospital or a hospital with a lot of elderly get more people with vision loss, and are usually more understanding and can get them access to better resources.

There are usually three aspects of rehabilitation that come into play. Independent Living Skills (ILS), Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) and tech (some places had different names for that). ILS is learning the skills that you need on a day to day basis to live (money ID, cleaning, cooking, dressing, etc). O&amp;M is learning how to get around (around your home, your neighbourhood, using public transportation, etc). Tech is learning how to use adaptive technology (VoiceOver for Apple products, JAWS, etc). Once again, how a client would access those services is highly dependent on where they are physically located and the resources that are available. 

3) For learning Braille, it depends on how motivated someone is. I've seen someone learn Grade 1 Braille in less than two weeks, but they were highly motivated. (Grade 1 Braille is the basic letters and some punctuation, essentialy). Grade 2 is usually significantly harder due to the contractions and such.

I find it just isn't helpful.  At least in Canada, it only gives directions accurate to 20 feet or so.

&gt; Does BlindSquare offer sufficient aid in new environments where you are unfamiliar with the landmarks? 

Generally, yes.  It starts announcing a landmark when I'm a configurable distance away, so when I'm walking, I can hear it gradually getting closer and closer, and tell what direction it is from me.  Even though it's not completely accurate, it at least gives me a good idea where I am, and if I'm going the right direction.

They're so rare that the only experience I have with them is listening to recordings of other people using them.  I've never been in a place that had any.  However, based on the recordings, they sound really helpful.  But I can't really give detailed feedback on them, as I've never gotten any hands on experience using them.  But based on the recordings I've heard, they sound much more accurate than even outdoor GPS, and like they'd be the missing link in getting right to where I want to go.

778,"Sure, I just didn't want to derail your thread!  

My main problem with Timecrest is that I feel like the game kind of works against itself.  For me, a game that already involves time travel, and let's you skip the time delays through in-app purchases, has removed most of the suspense that comes from having to wait through those time delays.  When I played lifeline, for example, I always felt the tension of never knowing if the advice I gave tailor was correct.  So I sat tensely for 8 hours while she slept, wondering if she'd even wake up in the morning, or would just die in the night from radiation poison.  It felt real to me, because time travel wasn't a thing, and Lifeline offered me absolutely no way of skipping over the waiting.  In timecrest, I'm always aware that just for a bit of money, I could skip the ""realtime"" gimmick.  So whenever I had to wait in Lifeline, it built up the tension higher and higher. But when I had to wait in timecrest, I was so aware of the gimmick as a gimmick, that mostly what the waiting did was build the irritation higher and higher.  Because in a game where I've already got time travel powers, having to wait through delays just felt, to me, like an arbitrary limitation to encourage in-app purchases, rather than something that contributed to the plot.  

See, now that probably came off as insulting.  I realize you've gotta make a living, and I realize you can't ""fix"" the ""problem"" I have with the game without, like, rewriting it entirely.  And timecrest seems to have a good, interesting story to tell.  I just don't feel like it uses the ""things take place in real time"" aspect of itself well at all, and even works to undermine that in some ways.  

I think if I could pay a one-time upfront fee, and have the ability to skip all delays, I'd be OK with it.  The Lifeline games aren't free, and I have no problem paying up-front for them.  But in Timecrest I feel like the in-app purchases and the plot are working at cross purposes.  Thinking ""You know, I could pay and skip this delay"" constantly just ruins immersion for me.

790,"Yeah, people weren't finding and reading the FAQ in the sidebar.  The reason it isn't all that detailed is because it needs to be a general answer to ""how do blind people use computers/reddit?""  The answers to a lot of the questions your asking tend to be ""it depends"".  

&gt; Are things that don't work a minor inconvenience

In the case of online chat, yes.  The only thing to be aware of is not to send images.  Other than that, if the person you're chatting with missed something, he can ask.  The only time it was ever a problem for me is when someone bolded a word to indicate sarcastic emphasis, and I had my screen-reader set not to notify me of bold words.  It was obvious I'd missed the bolded word from the next message I sent, and the person I was chatting with clarified her feelings, and we moved on.  

In the case of developing websites and programs, things that don't work can be a huge problem, preventing screen-readers from clicking buttons, activating controls, and so-on.  However, each platform and screen-reader are so different that the best thing a developer can do is follow the applicable accessibility guidelines, and do user testing to make sure it all works on the platforms that must be supported.  These days, the guidelines are good enough that if they're followed correctly, 9 times out of 10 things will work just fine.  

I'm now going to go into detail about how screen-readers work, to demonstrate why none of this is in the FAQ.  If you don't want massive details, stop reading now!  :-)

&gt; any special considerations when having an online chat

At the moment, the only software that can reliably read Emoji is the VoiceOver screen-reader on IPhones and mac computers.  There are add-ons for the Windows screen-reader [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org) to enable Emoji support, but just like a browser add-on, you can't depend on everyone having downloaded and installed that plugin.  None of the other 3 major screen-readers on Windows support Emoji.  So I couldn't write something like ""blind people can't read Emoji"" in an FAQ, because that's not always true.  Also, I haven't used an Android phone in 3 years, so it's possible Google added Emoji support to the TalkBack screen-reader and I don't know about it.  Providing no information in an FAQ is better than providing wrong information, IMHO.  

As for Emoticons, that's even more complicated!  When a screen-reader wants to speak text, it uses a separate 3rd party module, called a synthesizer.  Most screen-readers (accept for the one on IPhones) support a large number of different synthesizers, and the user can choose whatever she likes best.  Each synthesizer will usually provide multiple voices (male, female, etc) and multiple languages that it can speak in.  Each synthesizer has different rules to decide how to handle punctuation, how words should be pronounced, and what to do about emoticons.  I know of a forum that actually had to ban people from debating about what synthesizer is ""best"", because people feel so strongly about the issue that the discussion will sometimes devolve into flaming and name-calling.  The synthesizer is the voice that reads everything on the computer to a screen-reader user, so of course they're going to feel extremely strongly about how it should sound and what it should do.  But it gets even more complicated!  For various reasons, screen-readers themselves will usually modify the text, before they send it to the synthesizer.  So that means that the exact same synthesizer, when used in two different screen-reading programs, will sometimes pronounce things differently!  So depending on how the user has things set up, :-) might be read as ""colon dash right paren"", ""smiley"", nothing at all, ""colon dash right parenthesis"", or a hundred other ways.  I remember the first time I used Linux, and was surprised to hear that the default screen-reader with the default settings at the time always read the exclamation mark as ""bang"".  

&gt; Does punctuation work well?

The screen-reader user gets to decide exactly how much punctuation she wants read, and when.  For example, I have NVDA set to not read any punctuation when I'm in read all mode, but when I'm just cursoring up and down, I have it set to read ""most punctuation"".  What punctuation marks are considered part of ""most punctuation"" is user configurable on a symbol by symbol basis, with a list of 130 symbols to configure.  Most synthesizers will also let the user change a setting called ""intonation"", that controls how punctuation affects the synthesizer, even when it's not reading the symbols directly.  For example, a high intonation will usually pause longer at the ends of sentences, go up higher at a questionmark, and so on.  

&gt; Does formatting work?

Depends.  In software like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Word, formatting information is given to the screen-reader.  The user then gets to turn on and off announcement of different types of formatting (bold text, italics, font name, colour, block quote, links, tables, etc).  But not all software supports this.  And all screen-readers handle it differently.  If you're making a website, just follow the W3C and other guidelines.  If you're chatting with a blind user, she may or may not notice if you wrote a particular word in bold, depending on how she's got things configured.  

&gt; Do common acronyms work?  

It depends on the screen-reader and synthesizer used.  However, it doesn't really matter.  Hearing ""lol"" pronounced to rhyme with bowl, or having the letters ""L O L"" spelled out, or having LOL pronounced as ""laughing out loud"" is a matter of user preference.  Assuming a user knows what an acronym means, she'll be used to how her particular configuration pronounces that acronym.  

&gt; How does a screenreader handle misspelled words?

Depends on the synthesizer in use.  Synthesizers use phonetic rules to decide how to pronounce words, rather than having a pre-defined pronunciation for every English word.  Each synthesizer has different rules, so each one will pronounce misspellings differently.   However, all screen-readers will let the user review words character by character if she's confused, so it's usually possible to figure out what terrible spellers are trying to write.

The reason it isn't all that detailed is because it needs to be a general answer to ""how do blind people use computers/reddit?""  The answers to a lot of the questions your asking tend to be ""it depends"".  

&gt; Are things that don't work a minor inconvenience

In the case of online chat, yes.  The only thing to be aware of is not to send images.  Other than that, if the person you're chatting with missed something, he can ask.  The only time it was ever a problem for me is when someone bolded a word to indicate sarcastic emphasis, and I had my screen-reader set not to notify me of bold words.  It was obvious I'd missed the bolded word from the next message I sent, and the person I was chatting with clarified her feelings, and we moved on.  

In the case of developing websites and programs, things that don't work can be a huge problem, preventing screen-readers from clicking buttons, activating controls, and so-on.  However, each platform and screen-reader are so different that the best thing a developer can do is follow the applicable accessibility guidelines, and do user testing to make sure it all works on the platforms that must be supported.  These days, the guidelines are good enough that if they're followed correctly, 9 times out of 10 things will work just fine.  

I'm now going to go into detail about how screen-readers work, to demonstrate why none of this is in the FAQ.  If you don't want massive details, stop reading now!  :-)

&gt; any special considerations when having an online chat

At the moment, the only software that can reliably read <PERSON> is the VoiceOver screen-reader on IPhones and mac computers.  There are add-ons for the Windows screen-reader [NVDA](<URL>) to enable Emoji support, but just like a browser add-on, you can't depend on everyone having downloaded and installed that plugin.  None of the other 3 major screen-readers on Windows support Emoji.  So I couldn't write something like ""blind people can't read <PERSON>"" in an FAQ, because that's not always true.  Also, I haven't used an Android phone in 3 years, so it's possible Google added Emoji support to the TalkBack screen-reader and I don't know about it.  Providing no information in an FAQ is better than providing wrong information, IMHO.  

As for Emoticons, that's even more complicated!  When a screen-reader wants to speak text, it uses a separate 3rd party module, called a synthesizer.  Most screen-readers (accept for the one on IPhones) support a large number of different synthesizers, and the user can choose whatever she likes best.  Each synthesizer will usually provide multiple voices (male, female, etc) and multiple languages that it can speak in.  Each synthesizer has different rules to decide how to handle punctuation, how words should be pronounced, and what to do about emoticons.  I know of a forum that actually had to ban people from debating about what synthesizer is ""best"", because people feel so strongly about the issue that the discussion will sometimes devolve into flaming and name-calling.  The synthesizer is the voice that reads everything on the computer to a screen-reader user, so of course they're going to feel extremely strongly about how it should sound and what it should do.  But it gets even more complicated!  For various reasons, screen-readers themselves will usually modify the text, before they send it to the synthesizer.  So that means that the exact same synthesizer, when used in two different screen-reading programs, will sometimes pronounce things differently!  So depending on how the user has things set up, :-) might be read as ""colon dash right paren"", ""smiley"", nothing at all, ""colon dash right parenthesis"", or a hundred other ways.  I remember the first time I used Linux, and was surprised to hear that the default screen-reader with the default settings at the time always read the exclamation mark as ""bang"".  

&gt; Does punctuation work well?

The screen-reader user gets to decide exactly how much punctuation she wants read, and when.  For example, I have NVDA set to not read any punctuation when I'm in read all mode, but when I'm just cursoring up and down, I have it set to read ""most punctuation"".  What punctuation marks are considered part of ""most punctuation"" is user configurable on a symbol by symbol basis, with a list of 130 symbols to configure.  Most synthesizers will also let the user change a setting called ""intonation"", that controls how punctuation affects the synthesizer, even when it's not reading the symbols directly.  For example, a high intonation will usually pause longer at the ends of sentences, go up higher at a questionmark, and so on.  

&gt; Does formatting work?

Depends.  In software like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Word, formatting information is given to the screen-reader.  The user then gets to turn on and off announcement of different types of formatting (bold text, italics, font name, colour, block quote, links, tables, etc).  But not all software supports this.  And all screen-readers handle it differently.  If you're making a website, just follow the W3C and other guidelines.

No, not really.  In this case, there is no way for a blind person to do it ourselves.  Sometimes it can be a deterrent, but only if there was something easy the manufacturer should have done to make the product useful without sighted help.

How hard would it have been to include a CD with a txt file containing the manual?  Or at least put the manual online?  That put me right off.

Yes, please.  I'm not sure how I feel about information about every page I visit getting sent somewhere, though. Plus this sounds expensive.

&gt; Memes! For something that's as simple as text on top of an image it's absurd to me how there hasn't been good software designed to make memes accessible to the visually impaired. 

Usually, once I have the caption from a particular meme, I can find information about it on websites like know your meme.  Getting the caption can be quite a painful process, though.  So even if you could just get a reliable transcription of the text, that'd be enough for me to search Google and get the context.

While the rules are always changing, and different government employees will tell you contradictory things, this is my most recent understanding of what the rules are in Ontario right now.  In Ontario, a blind person will receive anywhere from $500 to $1000 per month depending on circumstance.  To get the highest amount possible, you must live alone, pay $600 in rent per month (the average rent in Toronto is $1,461 for a one bedroom apartment), and have a doctor certify that you have special dietary needs.  Then you can get $1000.  Of course, rent alone is usually more than $1000.  If you work, you can make up to $500 per month, and continue getting benefits.  If you make anything more than that, what you make will be taken off of your monthly check.

832,"&gt; Do support people/cited guides need a card from the Canadian government designating them as such?

The way support discounts work in Ontario is a little backwards.  You, as the blind person, need a card documenting your blindness.  If you are bringing a support person with you in many places, the way it works is that you must pay full price.  Once you show your card to prove your blindness, your support person will get to ride either completely free, or with a major discount.  I say ""most places"" because the list of places where that's not true is vast.  In order to have proof of blindness in Toronto, you will need a CNIB Card, a TTC bus pass (also provided by the CNIB), an Ontario photo card, and an Access 2 card (provided by the easter seals).  The TTC only accepts the bus pass, most theatres and entertainment places only take the Access 2 card, anywhere that requires a drivers license as ID (bars, etc) will only take the Ontario photo card, and the public library and all public transit that isn't the TTC only take the CNIB card.  Your support person doesn't need any documentation, other than you saying that they're your support person.  Well, unless you're voting with a support person; then it gets complicated and stupid.  

&gt; Are there good resources for orientation and mobility instructor's in Toronto?

Last time I had O&amp;M in Toronto a few years ago, I went through [Balance](http://balancefba.org/services/oandm.html).  At the time, they were the best.  But I moved to Ottawa 2 years ago, so I can't speak to the quality of instruction now.  

&gt; I didn't notice a lot of crossing beacons at intersections

There aren't many.  To travel around Toronto effectively, you need to be able to cross major intersections without audible lights.  Did you get to experience the [Yonge and Dundas square](https://audioboom.com/posts/1357257-walking-around-yonge-and-dundas-described-for-asilapple) scramble?  I went to university right there; the words ""Walk sign is on for all crossings. Walk sign is on for all crossings."" are still etched directly into my brain.  

&gt; Are there any transit discounts for the disabled? 

Yup. Once you have your CNIB card and bus pass, you get to ride most public transit for free.  And the parts that aren't free are discounted either for you for your support person.  Note that your support person never gets to ride the TTC for free.  

&gt; What were some of your favorite places to go and hang out around the city?

Well, I was a student, so never did much touring.  Johnny Rockets had the best milkshakes in the city.  Unfortunately, when I went back earlier this year, they were closed!  No idea if they're just gone, or what.  When I could afford it, [The Granite Brewery](http://www.granitebrewery.ca) was where I did most of my drinking.  Braille menus, good food, and better beer.  I also used to enjoy Puck 'N Wings, on Yonge, just a short walk from Finch station.  I used to watch movies at the Yonge-Dundas AMC, because it was walking distance from class, and the audio description always worked once I trained the staff by demanding it regularly.  However, because it was downtown, the ticket prices were twice what they are in North York.  If you're not as lazy as I was and move to Toronto, take the subway to Eglinton or somewhere and save money.  

Other than maybe once or twice as a kid, I never bothered visiting harborfront at all.  

The one difference you're going to notice is that Canada has nothing like the ADA.  While the city is quite accessible for touring, a lack of an ADA type law really makes the job hunt difficult.  Also, the price of houses in Toronto is [absolutely insane](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-real-estate-1.3750933).  1.2 million for a detached house, and the average price is now $710,410.  That means rent isn't cheap, either.

The way support discounts work in <LOCATION> is a little backwards.  You, as the blind person, need a card documenting your blindness.  If you are bringing a support person with you in many places, the way it works is that you must pay full price.  Once you show your card to prove your blindness, your support person will get to ride either completely free, or with a major discount.  I say ""most places"" because the list of places where that's not true is vast.  In order to have proof of blindness in <LOCATION>, you will need a CNIB Card, a TTC bus pass (also provided by the CNIB), an <LOCATION> photo card, and an Access 2 card (provided by the easter seals).  The TTC only accepts the bus pass, most theatres and entertainment places only take the Access 2 card, anywhere that requires a drivers license as ID (bars, etc) will only take the <LOCATION> photo card, and the public library and all public transit that isn't the TTC only take the CNIB card.  Your support person doesn't need any documentation, other than you saying that they're your support person.  Well, unless you're voting with a support person; then it gets complicated and stupid.  

&gt; Are there good resources for orientation and mobility instructor's in <LOCATION>?

Last time I had O&amp;M in <LOCATION> a few years ago, I went through [Balance](<URL>).  At the time, they were the best.  But I moved to <LOCATION> 2 years ago, so I can't speak to the quality of instruction now.  

&gt; I didn't notice a lot of crossing beacons at intersections

There aren't many.  To travel around <LOCATION> effectively, you need to be able to cross major intersections without audible lights.  Did you get to experience the [Yonge and Dundas square](<URL>) scramble?  I went to university right there; the words ""Walk sign is on for all crossings. Walk sign is on for all crossings."" are still etched directly into my brain.  

&gt; Are there any transit discounts for the disabled? 

Yup. Once you have your CNIB card and bus pass, you get to ride most public transit for free.  And the parts that aren't free are discounted either for you for your support person.  Note that your support person never gets to ride the TTC for free.  

&gt; What were some of your favorite places to go and hang out around the city?

Well, I was a student, so never did much touring.  Johnny Rockets had the best milkshakes in the city.  Unfortunately, when I went back earlier this year, they were closed!  No idea if they're just gone, or what.  When I could afford it, [The Granite Brewery](<URL>) was where I did most of my drinking.  Braille menus, good food, and better beer.  I also used to enjoy Puck 'N Wings, on <LOCATION>, just a short walk from <PERSON> station.  I used to watch movies at the Yonge-Dundas AMC, because it was walking distance from class, and the audio description always worked once I trained the staff by demanding it regularly.  However, because it was downtown, the ticket prices were twice what they are in <LOCATION>.  If you're not as lazy as I was and move to <LOCATION>, take the subway to <LOCATION> or somewhere and save money.  

Other than maybe once or twice as a kid, I never bothered visiting harborfront at all.  

The one difference you're going to notice is that <LOCATION> has nothing like the ADA.  While the city is quite accessible for touring, a lack of an ADA type law really makes the job hunt difficult.  Also, the price of houses in <LOCATION> is [absolutely insane](<URL><PHONE_NUMBER> million for a detached house, and the average price is now $710,410.  That means rent isn't cheap, either.

There's a blond joke here, and I'm not going to make it.  No need to thank me!  :-)

&gt; The only other community I know of like this is the deaf community and, at least in my area, it's very well advertised and pretty well integrated.

Well, I'm not sure that the two communities can be compared effectively.  Deaf people have challenges communicating that blind people just don't experience.  Sure, 80% of in-person communication is via body language.  But never the less, blind people don't need an interpreter just to order fast food, for example.  I don't know much about deaf people, admittedly.  But I feel like the blind community exists, online at least, as a thing that blind people can choose to join or ignore.  Whereas the deaf community is a thing that all deaf people are more or less forced into, just by the nature of the way they communicate.  Braille is not a different language; it's just another way of representing the letters A through Z.  But sign language is basically a community speaking another language, and thus it develops another culture.  I don't think we really have a ""blind culture"" to that extent.

&gt; The Terry Brooks books are awesome,

I'll recommend you some of the fics I liked best, but I have really strange taste. The bit in the sidebar that calls me a ""fanfic fanatic"" is telling the absolute truth!  Odds are you won't enjoy any of these:

* [The Wheel And The Butterfly](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9665238/1/The-Wheel-and-the-Butterfly-A-Dan-X-Pinkie-Pie-Saga): You need to be familiar with either Dan Vs. or My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic to enjoy this.  You also need enough time to read something that's almost a million words of thinly justified cartoonish violence.  It manages to make me laugh out loud at least once per chapter though, so it's earned it's place on my list of most loved fics.  

* [Browncoat, Green Eyes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes): this was the fanfic that got me interested in Firefly.  If you're familiar with Harry Potter, you might enjoy this; knowing things about Firefly isn't a requirement.  

* [Slipping Between Worlds](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6159511/1/Slipping-Between-Worlds): It's a Discworld and Johnny Maxwell trilogy crossover.  If neither of those names mean anything to you, neither will this.  

* [Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com): It's a Twilight fanfic.  NO, COME BACK!  It's also a good story.  It's almost good enough that I can forgive the Twilight novels for existing.  But...not quite.  Even if you haven't read Twilight, you can still enjoy this.  

* [Reaping the Whirlwind](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9981228/1/Reaping-the-Whirlwind-The-Boom-Boom-Boom-Ba-Remix): A Dead Like Me and Buffy The Vampire Slayer crossover.  You need to love Dead Like Me, Buffy is optional.  It's also the best Dead Like Me fic ever written; it's the only one where I can hear the main characters voice in my head as I'm reading.

845,"Yup.  That and online petitions are super effective for us, especially in the case of apps and websites.  It might cost a developer $500 to make his app accessible, and when he sees a petition with 900 signatures of people who all want to use his $2.99 IOS app, it just makes sense for him to do the right thing.

Thinking about this, I think what we could do is require this style of post to specify exactly what the poster wants to happen.  Is there a petition to sign?  Is it just to raise awareness of a bad business?  Is there an on-going legal case to follow? Is it fundraising to help fix a problem somehow?  Does the poster just want help knowing what to do next?  I'd be OK with posts asking for any of those things.  On the other hand, a post or comment that wanted everyone to help launch a denial of service, or show up at the business and threaten the owners, would not be at all OK.  A post where it was unclear what the OP wanted could be removed until the OP clarified exactly what outcome he wants.  That would have gotten this thread taken down, because what OP wants is extremely unclear.  My guess is he wants...the admins to...ban you from being a mod of your sub, I guess?  That's just not going to happen based on this post.  If we'd taken this post down and messaged the poster, asking him exactly what outcome he wants, I wonder how he would have responded?  Threats and abuse would have meant this never saw the light of day.  If he'd rewritten the post with a clear objective, I think you might have been less upset about it. It would have given you a chance to explain why the OP isn't going to get what he wants. Then other users could have discussed that, instead of discussing how ""obviously abusive"" you are.  Though I do realize having to justify why you won't unban someone might be a little irritating for you, I think it would give a framework for the discussion that might have kept it more positive.

On the other hand, a post or comment that wanted everyone to help launch a denial of service, or show up at the business and threaten the owners, would not be at all OK.  A post where it was unclear what the OP wanted could be removed until the OP clarified exactly what outcome he wants.  That would have gotten this thread taken down, because what OP wants is extremely unclear.  My guess is he <URL>e admins <URL>n you from being a mod of your sub, I guess?  That's just not going to happen based on this post.  If we'd taken this post down and messaged the poster, asking him exactly what outcome he wants, I wonder how he would have responded?  Threats and abuse would have meant this never saw the light of day.  If he'd rewritten the post with a clear objective, I think you might have been less upset about it. It would have given you a chance to explain why the OP isn't going to get what he wants. Then other users could have discussed that, instead of discussing how ""obviously abusive"" you are.  Though I do realize having to justify why you won't unban someone might be a little irritating for you, I think it would give a framework for the discussion that might have kept it more positive.

Hello! I am looking for a raid group or guild raiding group that is going to be running Heroic Emerald Nightmare 
Cenarius &amp; Xavius tonight. 
I'm looking for a guild or group that has ALREADY completed 7/7H and is not progressing. I've completed 7/7 heroic 
each week it's been out but, this was the first week where I fell short. 
I'm turning to reddit to hopefully find some potential people to raid with on a consistent basis that only usually need a 
few spots filled each week to get the job done. 
Already apart of a guild with real life friends that I'm not willing to leave. Just looking for a serious group without 
having to change my guild name. 
No Loot Councile I work 60 hours a week and manage to maintain a high level of raid. Someone who just logs onto 
WOW for loot to just log off after doesn't deserve the same chance at loot. There's reasons blizzard created systems to 
reward loot personally. 
If your guild is using loot councile and still can't clear H 7/7 Nightmare you've the wrong people in your guild. Thank 
you, LoadsofDots

Hey man, c:Reckless Honor:"" on Sen'jin is looking for more DPS. We're 7/7H and there's a few of us who like to run M+ 
dungeons. We usually end up short a DPS so you'd fit in there. You're welcome to come to our heroic clear tonight if 
you wanna check us out. After that, if you decide you wanna stick around casually you can keep doing so. 
or if you want to join us for mythic (and we like you), we can pay for your server transfer. We are pretty laid back 
about progression in the sense that we accommodate people's schedules, consistently end on time, and don't demand 
that players do anything substantial outside of raiding. But when we show up for raid we work hard and get shit done. 
We have a lot of players who are new to raiding and we work to help them improve.

860,"Hmmm.  First thing that comes to mind: does the user have admin access on the machine?  Changing the narrator or JAWS settings to make them start up on the login screen should be popping up a UAC prompt requiring you to allow admin access.  If it's not doing that, there might be some kind of domain policy getting in the way.  Unfortunately, my only real familiarity with corporate Windows administration involves maintaining exchange servers way back in 2003, so I have no real idea how corporate deployment works these days.

As for just switching the user to NVDA: it's not that hard to learn; I switched years and years ago, and it only took me a day or two to learn the new commands.  However, JAWS still works better in a few corporate applications (especially Lotus Notes and various terminal programs).  Can you give me a list of the applications your user needs for his/her job?

And Twilight is exactly the same.  Or can you explain why, after casting the want it need it spell, she said, and I quote: ""The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time.""

Enough to call it ""every time"", not just ""like last time"" or ""like I thought it would"".

This brings to mind something I read about the advantages of undirected evolution ages and ages ago (I wish I could remember exactly what it was or where).  The basic point was that if you asked a gorilla what he wanted, he'd want to be much bigger and stronger.  He'd never ask for the changes in brain structure required to build and use advanced tools, because that's not important to him.  But as humans, we know tool use will bring a better life than even the largest possible increase in muscle mass could ever allow.  Similarly, if you ask me what I want, I want to drive.  I've never scene a sunset or a painting, so I really don't care about any of that.  Yet people who have scene sunsets and paintings could argue that those might bring me much more pleasure in the long run than driving would.

Well, her motivations were much better than ""Oh no! I might be late with a report to the princess that didn't even have a deadline in the first place!""  And you're not telling me that a giant ball of brawling ponies didn't result in at least some permanent physical injury. Especially not one involving big mac.  

&gt; Information should be free, 

No it shouldn't, and in general, it isn't.  Books about hangings are not as bad as a book that gives you the exact instructions needed for mind control.  You won't find LSD and meth recipes in your public library, and that's a good thing.  That's the closest real world comparison I can come up with. But even if you gave 3 10-year-old human girls exact instructions for cooking meth, they couldn't actually do it.  Apparently children can make love potions if they just read how.  That means the information needs to be even more closely restricted...or else everypony will do it.  Equestria seems like it's about 80 percent female.  I sure wouldn't wanna be a stallion in a world where anypony can learn to make love potions from the public library, and it's so easy even children can do it!  

&gt; If I went to Equestria, my first priority would be finding magical artefacts I can use to be worth a damn in that world, followed by becoming a writer.

If I went to Equestria, assuming there was no chance of me getting home, I think I'd suicide.  I have absolutely no skills that would be useful to an Equestrian, and I have no interest in being the target of love potions, want it need it spells, Starlight's plans, whatever mind control thing Fluttershy does to make animals obey her, and the latest monster.  Equestria is really fun to watch on TV, and a wonderful place to read about.  But I couldn't live there.  If I could get home within a few months/years, I'd stick as close to Applejack and Rainbow Dash as I could.  That's quite interesting, as they're the ponies I have the least in common with.  But they're the ponies I think I could trust to not do anything terrible.  I mean, Rainbow Dash does some pretty awful things, but they're awful in ways I can understand and deal with; they aren't mind control.

893,"&gt; Twilight was young

Oh boy, this opens up another fun debate.  How old is Twilight, exactly?  She has to be a qualified librarian, whatever that means in Equestria.  Celestia isn't going to risk the education and access to information of an entire town, by putting someone unqualified for the job in charge of Ponyville's only public library.  However, degrees in library science might not be a thing in Equestria.  From what I can tell, Twilight doesn't have or use card catalogs, so that makes it unlikely Equestria has anything like the Dewey Decimal System.  However, Pinkies ""It was under E!"" in the first episode implies that Twilight doesn't assume books are just organized alphabetically, either.  But I think it's safe to assume that Twilight has the Equestrian equivalent of a university degree.  So that means she's probably at least 22 when the show opens, more likely 24 or 25.  The sound of her voice matches that guess pretty well.  I wouldn't call her ""young"".  She's certainly old enough to know the true consequences of failure.  

&gt; and in the middle of a psychotic break

Well, yes. But based on her dialogue, she's used that same spell before; I'm still not convinced otherwise.  So that means Twilight is so unstable she needs to be hospitalized for the safety of those around her.  Starlight does terrible things, but never-the-less, she is sane.  It is possible to reason with her.  Her actions can be predicted.  In the case of Twilight, that's not true.  She could go off at any time, for any reason, real or imagined.  And that makes her far more terrifying, and in my mind ""worse"", than Starlight.  At least Starlight's motivations are external and based in reality, so it's possible to discuss them with her.  Twilight's psychosis was so deep that her friends couldn't even understand where she was coming from, and thus couldn't talk her down.  

Compare Twilight to Pinkie, another Pony who has had a psychotic break.  In her case, she never mind controled anyone, and other than being kind of scarry, didn't harm anyone other than herself.  Also, based on the real things that Pinkie was seeing and hearing, she had a lot more reason for her thoughts than Twilight did.  

&gt; anyone can write.

Assuming Equestrians speak English.  I think that's a safe assumption myself, as Pinkie regularly makes jokes that depend on her speaking English to be funny.  But then, some people have made convincing arguments for Equestrians having a different language.  

Also, well...no.  Not everyone can write.  I agree with you that becoming a writer would work well for most people.  But I was talking personally about myself, and I can't.  It seems vanishingly unlikely that Equestrian's have Braille.  You need fingers to read it, and fingers to write it.  Mouth writing just couldn't work for Braille at all.  And Equestria has no Internet, and personal computers aren't a thing there.  So I'd be reduced to dictation, assuming I could find anyone interested in writing down what I had to dictate.  That...would probably turn out to be Twilight or Lyra.  At least Lyra is less terrifying than Twilight, I guess.

921,"&gt; Oh, and MLP... It has its own fanfic site, and it's terrible. 

I don't actually know much about the internal politics of fimfiction.net.  I get all my pony fiction recs from reviewers like [One Man's Pony Ramblings](http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.ca).  The few times I did venture down into the comments, because I wanted clarification on some story aspect or something, I didn't notice anything wrong with them.  Also, fimfiction offers epub downloads by default, so fimfiction.net is best fanfic site.  Oh, and the little ""also liked/similar"" thing on each story page is nice; I've found a few gems through that.  I'd never post a comment there, though; they require a profile avatar before even allowing you to post comments.  I'm not creating a pony OC, and then commissioning someone to draw it, just to post on a website; GTFO!  

&gt; assholes will run up to you and insult you

fanfiction.net reviewers are just as bad.  If it were up to me, making any comment about the author in a review, good or bad, would be an instant ban.  I highly enjoy making fun of badfic; but making any comment about the authors of the fics I'm mocking is way out of bounds.  

&gt; wasn't there a MLP animation starring an original character named Snowblind?

I wouldn't know. The only MLP art I pay attention to is fanfic, music, and radio dramas.  I can follow the show because of the high quality transcripts, but fan animation isn't going to be described at all, so I'm not interested.  

&gt; ...in a more metaphorical sense...

The only time I've ever heard someone described as having a ""dark heart"" it was because they're evil.  To me, that reads like she's calling her Sue evil, because she's blind.  It makes me giggle.  

&gt; on why HPMOR is the worst work of fiction on the planet, 

It's really not that bad, though!  I mean, it isn't good, I grant you.  But the things you're complaining about are all things other fics have done, and done much worse.  Sure, it's obviously an AU. But thousands of fanfic authors change the rules of the universe to fit the plot.  The ones who make me crazy are the ones who aren't familiar enough with the original work to even know they're getting the rules wrong!  HPMOR knows it's making changes, and tries to justify them, at least.  

&gt; Remember when events conspired to force Hermione into an unbreakable vow that made her Harryzer's slave?

Well, at least HPMOR never did anything objectionable with it. Have you ever read [The Harem War](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5639518/1/The-Harem-War)?  In that fic, events conspire to force every female character in Hogwarts (including the teachers), plus some OCs, to be Harry's sex slave.  He has so many sex slaves the author has to put a scorecard in every chapter to help readers keep track of them all!  Oh, and I should warn you: that has graphic non-consensual sex in it.  You can skip all of those bits without missing any of the ""plot"", though.  I'm sorry, but HPMOR just can't compare.  It doesn't even rate a place in the top 50 of badness.  It's just a mediocre adventure comedy. It's mediocre because the comedy isn't funny, and the adventure isn't that interesting.

If HPMOR is your yardstick of Sueishness, you ain't read nothin'.  For what it is, HPMOR is pretty good.  The real problem is it lies to the reader, and tries to pretend to be something it's not.  It's not a scientific exploration of the HP universe, no matter what it claims.  It's an adventure comedy, mixed with a rationalist anti-death tract.

What would be ideal is some kind of rough paint I could paint on top of the burner, that would give it a rough texture that I could feel while sliding the pot back and forth.  The problem, of course, is the paint would need to not block any heat, it would need to stand up to the high temperatures on top of the burner, and it would need to not rub off on whatever was cooking on top of it.

956,"&gt; Choices affect the story, but no path is the “wrong” path.

It's actually really interesting that you say that.  Because on my first play of lifeline, I got to the best ending, right off.  Whereas I've died multiple times in timecrest, and gave up before actually finishing it.  And yet, everyone I've talked to about both games tells me they found Timecrest far easier and more forgiving than Lifeline!  So I really don't know.  Perhaps it's because me and Tailor live in the same world, so my knowledge and skills can be applied to helping her.  Whereas in Timecrest I sometimes feel like I'm choosing randomly, or at least like I don't have all the information I need to make the ""best"" choice.  Sure, next time I play timecrest, I know not to do the thing that got me killed last time. But I don't find learning from previous plays nearly as satisfying as thinking through someone's situation, and being able to think it through and pick the best option available the first time.  

&gt; We actually believe that the free users get the best experience of the story,

You know what might actually help here?  An in-game item for, say, $4.99 that, when activated, would disable the ability to use time crystals at all, until the game has been completed at least once without them.  I know that sounds a little odd!  I mean, an in-app purchase to *remove* features?  But it would show you're serious about making the game fun without the in-app purchases, it would let those of us who just don't like purchasing in-game currency support you, and it would help players feel more immersed in the game, because we wouldn't constantly have the ""purchase or don't purchase"" decision in our minds.

Aside from that, imagine it this way. If you want to describe things to a blind person, tell them things they could learn for themselves if they just went around touching everything. While colors mean nothing, your saying ""there's a really tall very old looking tree to our left"" does mean something to me. If you talk about how people are dressed, that's interesting. Like nice or trashy or oddly.
 Also interesting are little visual things that I'll miss, like person A was shooting me or you or whomever a mean look from across the room, or general visual observations made while people watching. 
Picking interesting details is nice, describing a person as 'hot' means something, but its vague, going into detail about why is more helpful.

I have no personal reference for what's trashy,  outside of things like wearing a teashirt and jeans to a wedding, things like that. But I don't really care about clothes, other blind people might have their own standards. A lot of fashion is visual, so when I buy clothes, I'm just going with the flow, based on what other people tell me it is.
I have no concept of color that isn't intillectual. Imagine if everyone around you could read minds and there was a vocabulary for discussing it, you could infir things from the vocabulary while still having no viseral understanding of what they were talking about. So, for example, while I know the sunset is 'pretty to watch' I will often forget that people find it beautiful and will watch it for that reason. The reason I'd mentioned you should link colors to feelings is because otherwise your just saying that apple is red, that plant is green, but this means nothing to me.

&gt; ""We’re a startup with limited resources, and I’m not exactly sure what timetable they would rather have us on but it is something that we plan to do. It calls into question what their real goal here is in filing their lawsuit,"" <PERSON> told me on Monday. ""Their allegation that this is some super easy just-follow-a-cookbook kind of thing is just wrong. It’s going to cost some money and take some time to get done. We're sensitive to the needs of all people with disabilities, not just blind people.""

&gt; In an August letter to the National Federation of the Blind, Get Me's attorneys rejected the federation's allegations, but said the company plans to release disability access features for its app early next year. It said it will cost approximately $500,000 to add these features.

Oh spare us all. ""Well, we don't think we *have* to go to the special expense to accommodate you, but we'll eventually get around to it and claim that it was a gigantic hassle and expense on your behalf because we *care*."" 

Glad to hear that RideFare is doing the decent thing (or at least the smart thing) and fixing the problem. 

It is unfortunate how often blind people do have to resort to litigation to have even basic access to the things we need, but I'm glad that there's people with the minds and resources that are needed for the job.

Many universities have individual buildings within the campus labeled on google maps. I can pull up the building I would like to go to on my phone using any of a variety of navigation apps, some designed for blind users. If it is not clear where a given building is (say it is unlabeled on Maps, or incorrectly labeled) once on campus, I will ask someone where that building is once. 

From there on, I can walk around and explore the nearby buildings, the walkways leading up to that building, landmarks around the building or on the path from my dorm to that building, and so on to be certain of how to get there in the future. I can also easily tag its location with my phone's GPS, and use that as a reference to return if needed. This gives me the ability to find the place coming from multiple directions, to recognize and reorient myself if I've fallen off course, and to be able to go back to the building even if for some reason I cannot use my usual path. 

With repeated visits to campus, and after perhaps taking a tour and traveling around myself several times finding buildings and walkways, I will probably have a pretty good mental map of the place and know where many things are in relation to other things. (Just like sighted people.) By asking questions and gathering information, I can then add new things and extra details to the map over time.

What a blind student needs to be able to independently navigate a university campus is good travel training and proper braille signage everywhere it should be.

&gt; if I do go blind

Most people with RP will become legally blind by middle age. The question is ""when"" not ""if."" 

&gt; What will life be like? 

That's an excellent question to ask, and there are a lot of blind people around who can answer it for you. It's not as scary or as difficult as you seem to be imagining right now. 

&gt; I've always been very independent, the the outdoors and it's many beautiful landscapes are something I feel like I cannot stand losing.

There is absolutely no reason why you must lose your independence, sense of wonder at the world, or your ability to travel if you are blind. Hiking, camping, and traveling the world are all completely possible if you are blind. 

&gt; and be okay with what it will be like if I do go blind. 
 
Part of that comes from a totally understandable place of being angry and scared at losing something that you have. But part of it is also probably a product of fear and misinformation about what life as a blind person will actually be like. 

&gt; I don't want to be a burden to anybody else

I am not a burden on anyone. Many blind people are not burdens on anyone. When they are, it is often due to either that person (or their family) not being educated on the real potential of a blind person and that person not being given the training they need to be independent, or because the blind person is very depressed and not ready to be independent. 

&gt; I don't want to lose my independence

You don't have to! At every step in this transition there are new skills you can learn to keep working, continue enjoying an active life, enjoy recreational activities, have relationships, start a family, and most other things you might want to do. 

And if that seems impossible or scary, now's the time you can look into the independence training available to blind people, the adaptive skills we use, and the lives we lead. 

&gt; I hope one day you can get your vision back.

I don't. The depression that you're feeling? It's way fucking more crippling than blindness. Some blind people (especially those who lose their sight beyond childhood) become consumed with the idea that life's over if there's no cure. They can tell you every bit of relevant research for their condition, they're holding out all sorts of hope that the cure is going to come soon, and in the mean time they've completely convinced themselves that there's no possible life worth living as a blind person. They just stop, mope around, and wait for things to ""go back"" to the way they were with ""the cure."" 

It ruins lives. Sometimes they get past this, and sadly sometimes they don't. ""Hope"" can be this deeply destructive thing when what you're hoping for is something entirely out of your control.

Yes, I hope the cure one day comes for you. But I also hope that if it doesn't, or if it isn't here for a decade or two or five, you get the help that you need to be lifted out of your depression. I hope that your life doesn't stop in the mean time because you're convinced you'll be cured soon, or that there's no other way to carry on if you aren't. I hope that you get the help and tools you need to live as a confident and capable blind person and that you aren't paralyzed by the reality you live in now (where there is no cure.)

You can also purchase a variety of different canes and independent living products [at the NFB store.]
(<URL>) (Some people prefer [Ambutech]
(<URL>) canes as well. Go with the graphite one if so, as it is the lightest.) 

There is also a simple [at home book, which is free]
(<URL>) with accompanying tape or CD to begin to learn braille independently as an adult. Again, she should also seek the instruction of a qualified instructor, but there is no reason not to begin learning in the mean time if she is able. 

Well that's a couple of things, but if there's specific issues she's having or resources you're looking for I would be happy to try to help further or point you in the right direction.

1133,"&gt; A strange phenomenon that occurs for me every so often is when I am walking around or sitting in a familiar place and just taking in my surroundings, my prain will occassionally attempt to fill in the blank spaces of my visual field. 

I get this sometimes. Like if I am looking at a road with grass in the background, the part that sits in my blind spots might seem vaguely gray and green instead of just not existing at all. But later I move or pay attention to other input and realize there was a car or a great big orange sign or something entirely different in that space! Usually though, whatever's in the spots just doesn't exist, and there's maybe a little bit of static, but I tune it out most of the time.

I am not at all opposed to people being given the tools of low vision or the training on how to use them. But I do feel that these tools are often times suggested when a non-visual alternative would be more efficient, that patients are often encouraged to rely on them beyond a reasonable scope of their usefulness, and that many patients receiving low vision services do not get (or are sometimes even discouraged from getting) independence training such as cane travel because of often flawed assumptions about what constitutes ""visually impaired enough"" to benefit from it. 

I'm absolutely not saying you're guilty of any of this, just speaking in general terms. To me, ""effective"" low vision services means they are administered by a provider who understands the skills people of all vision levels may use, understands the benefits to those skills at various levels of vision, and makes recommendations based on what will best help that person efficiently and effectively accomplish tasks now and in the future. It also means a better transition between the ""low vision"" provider and the ""blindness"" provider and a lack of stigma (or the idea that the person has ""progressed"" and is ""worse off"") when a non-visual technique is apparently the better option now, or will probably soon be for that person. 

You're right, it's complex and difficult. As someone who is legally blind (and who previously had low vision better than the ""legal blindness"" criteria) I'm not sure how I feel about the extent of low vision services for legally blind (or nearly so) people as it stands now. It's much less ambiguous with someone who has stable 20/80 vision versus someone who has fluctuating 20/200.

&gt; Do blind people actually browse the same websites as non-blind people do?

We sure do. I know blind people who are very into watching and reading about all sorts of things online that you might think are ""entirely visual"" such as NASCAR, athletic sports, and so on. There's also blind people who are photographers who want to post their own works and discuss photography with others, blind people who like to play video games that are in some way accessible, and really all sorts of things like that you might not expect. It is common for blind people to be on average about as interested in TV shows and movies as sighted people, too. 

Also, IMO accessible web standards should be, well, the standard. Part of the issue with web accessibility is that making the site text and keyboard usable (which benefits people with low vision, mobility impairments, mobile devices, and many other people aside from blind people) is viewed as a ""special extra"" rather than the bare minimum. 

&gt;  how obstructive are ads for you?

Aside from the usual objections to ads (excessive, intrusive, and sometimes malware-laden), blind users have their own set of issues: a lot of these ads can break screen reader functionality on web pages. They can be very difficult to move past or click out of, interfere with the page being displayed correctly, and so on.

1158,"Going blind was easily the worst part about being blind to me. I'll share some of my experience in a way that I hope might help you. 

The actual process of losing your sight is kind of terrible, or at least it was in my experience. You know what's happening, but maybe not when and not how bad it might end up. What if you're one of the lucky cases right? Or what if it happens soon and you're not ready? 

You find out you're losing your sight, and it's gotten to the point where you can't do things exactly the way you used to. You get a low vision evaluation and start to use low vision tools. You start to integrate these ""low vision"" things into your life. High contrast and magnification for everything! They become less and less useful, and you try to upgrade to more expensive and fancy gadgets in the hope it'll give you a little more time, and you're left going ""fuck, I don't actually know how to be blind."" Meanwhile the (well intentioned, but  misguided) people around you will probably be encouraging you to ""make the most of your remaining sight."" 

You become a little (or a lot) convinced that at some point, if these tools fail you, you're not going to be able to keep doing the things you love.

You start to fall out of love with reading because it's hard to keep up (but maybe at the same time convince yourself that you aren't ""blind enough"" to read braille yet,) you go out less and less because you aren't confident traveling when it's dark or bright or new places. You start to visit friends less and less, because they don't really know what to do with you (and more so since in your case (not mine) you're deaf because shit is there a cultural barrier to cross between blind communities that involve a lot of sound, and Deaf communities that involve a lot of sight.) 

You're so angry about it all because it feels like everything about the only world you've ever known, an intensely visual world, is being torn from you in piece by piece and you don't feel like you have any control over the process. 

You lose the sky and the grass and the trees, the beautiful details on your loved one's faces, the special looks that were just for you, mundane normal things like being able to read a menu or a street sign, and you can see just enough and are still so attached to the visual world that what you can't see tempts you all the time. 

I don't know where you are in your process, but maybe one day you realize that the zoomtext and the CCTV and the monocular and all those things are really doing sweet fuck all for you and that perhaps one day you're going to turn them off for the last time and never turn them back on again (if you haven't already.) You start to learn braille and make a commitment to studying every day, use a screen reader, maybe get more lessons on actually using your cane properly (from an instructor who isn't a middle aged sighted woman trying to spend an excessive amount of time teaching you sighted guide and ""self protective"" techniques before giving you a heavy folding monstrosity of a cane that is so short you're terrified of walking too quickly with it, and many of you all in /r/blind/ know exactly the sort of instructor I'm talking about) instead of the half-hearted ""only sometimes"" you've been giving it before. You learn how to cook, clean, and change diapers with the lights off. You probably get yourself some therapy or support because you need help digging yourself out of the emotional hole you were stuck in where it felt like nothing would ever get better and life would never be normal. (And since you're deaf, you maybe start using tactile sign language instead of visual, or learning sign language in the first place.) And if you get the right tools and training, suddenly you like to read again, and traveling isn't scary anymore, and keeping a job doesn't seem impossible, and you start to want to be around people again (and maybe they're different people because some people in your life just won't get it.) 

It stops feeling like losing more vision is a hammer that's hanging over your head all the time. It stops feeling like life's going to just stop when you reach the point of being ""too blind."" You stop feeling like you're not ""blind enough,"" stuck in between. (This has little to do with your actual remaining amount of vision. It's a matter of adaptation.)

And maybe you lose more vision quickly, or maybe it happens slowly, but something really remarkable happens over time: you start to forget some of the visual details, sometimes a lot of them. That's terrifying and triggers it's own crisis at first, because you don't want to forget the way your husband looks at you or your child (or loved one's) smile or the way the Grand Canyon looks, right? You don't want to be THAT blind! You want to remember all those beautiful details!

But more and more as time passes, thinking about your husband draws up details like the way he smells when he's relaxed (and that's your favorite, although you know what stressed and sick and tired smell like too), his skin (the practical parts you touch all the time like his hands and elbows, and the parts that you love like the wrinkles on his face) and the way his breathing feels, his heartbeat, the way he walks, the way he talks to you, the way it feels to hold him. 

And you start to build these new pictures of the world with everyone and everything around you, and your loved ones are going to be this great big picture of touch and smell and sound and experiences, and sure you will always want to see them but it doesn't fucking matter because you will still have them and love them. 

And in increments that are sometimes very small and sometimes very large, if you get what you need to carry on with your life, you stop mourning the sight you had. You stop mourning the person that you were. It's hard to describe. 

To me, going blind was a process with somewhat distinct stages: Before, when I was sighted. During, when I was partially sighted and stuck in between clinging to the sighted parts and mourning and scared. After, where I am now (which is independent of where you are on the vision loss spectrum or where you might end up.)

I'm not sure that the person I was ""before"" and ""during"" is exactly the same person I am now. The things that I thought would always matter so much to me barely even register. 

If I close my eyes and imagine I can see the Grand Canyon in my head. It isn't vivid (and probably not accurate) anymore. If I went back there I could still see some, as I still have some usable vision. But the details? They're already gone, and in their place with every new place I visit and every new adventure I go on is a whole maze of other sensory inputs and emotions and experiences. 

It did suck. It sucked for a long time, and for me it sucking less involved ""deciding"" to let go the emotional baggage that came with having ""low vision"" and that damn it all, I was going to figure out being blind. At the end of the bucket list of beautiful things I wanted to see one last time came the realization that one day it wouldn't hurt me to not see those things. 

Sometimes it still sucks. Sometimes you hit enough roadblocks in a world that's built for sighted people that you hate it. But mostly it doesn't, and mostly you're okay. (And really, were it not for my involvement with the blind community, I don't actually think about being blind all that often in my day to day life. It registers closer to ""mildly inconvenient trait"" than ""tragedy."") 

I'm not saying that your experiences will be like mine at all! What I am  trying to say is that your perspective shifts with time and experience and distance, and what you're feeling about being blind now probably isn't going to be what you're feeling about being blind in five years or ten years.

- I keep my pantry organized. Home canned foods have their own section (and get labeled all before going into the pantry when they've cooled down and popped.) Grains and jars of beans and legumes sit together. Canned goods are somewhat sorted by type (fruit, vegetables, and soups mostly.) Many things don't really need labels. If you reached into your pantry and tried to find a can of tomato paste, you'd be able to do it with your eyes shut right? 

- Many containers of things are pretty distinct from others. Olive oil comes in the rectangular jars, sesame oil in hourglass shaped jars, coconut oil in cans with screw-on lids, etc. Many sauces I buy one brand I like and the containers are easily identifiable without even needing to open it or shake it to try to identify it. You don't need to label that stuff. 

- Leftovers that go into the fridge don't get labeled. I only keep them there for a few days at most so it is easy enough to tell apart by different containers, and opening the container if needed. Leftovers that go into the freezer (or meat I am splitting up and freezing in bulk) get labeled with plastic non-adhesive sheets.

Anyways, the gist of it as much as I remember was the experiences of someone who worked in blindness research and tech and who recounts being regularly approached by inventors with ideas they were sure would revolutionize blindness. 

These ideas were often, of course, things that already existed, things that were impossible, or things that we simply do not want or need. Time and resources were then spent convincing (or at least trying to) the inventor of this. But many of these inventors remained just as convinced as ever that their ideas were great, and they just needed help or money or resources to make it happen. Most of the time they had nothing but good intentions, and were just trying to help, but they just didn't understand the problem or the solutions. They were people who might have otherwise been able to positively contribute to things that blind people actually want or need done, but did not go on to do those things. 


In my personal experience with these sorts of things (especially as far as software and computer hardware goes) I have seen enough vaporware, half-baked products, and abandoned projects to find the situation frustrating. But I have never been able to gently dissuade a person from their invention, nor point them in the direction of work that actually needs to be done. Often times the person will double down as to why their product is necessary, that I don't understand and they're just trying to help, or will insist that it might be for a different ""type"" of blind person (for example, someone with less vision, because they perceive this to mean less function, or someone with poor blindness skills.) 

I'm not at all saying this is or might be the case with the person you are referring to who deleted their post, but there is certainly no denying an undercurrent of many of these projects: to help blind people, but only in a way that is their idea, with them getting the recognition (or the cash) for a singular revolutionary thing they have done. There is also often a severe underestimation of the technical challenges of their project, no real capacity for good follow through, and yet there is a little bit of expectation that they're doing something good and praiseworthy by ""helping the blind"" or even just trying to. 

I will note that in the case of the actual deleted post, nobody was at any point rude to them as far as I can tell. But I hoped to be able to (with a back and forth dialog that never happened) give the OP an opportunity to research and think about the limits of their own knowledge and abilities, and the real feasibility of and justification for the project they were proposing. But their answer was that they could literally note no differences whatsoever between the product they wanted to develop and existing screen readers, that there was not one function or feature that they could name that they planned to implement. They understood their own limitations, and said they had a lot to learn, and deferred to their advisor several times. But this did not change the fact that they believed that what they were doing was not only possible, but potentially useful enough to pursue graduate studies on.

- Claiming that ""braille is the only viable option being taught in schools"" is clearly false when only a minority of blind children (around 10% here in the US) are taught to be braille literate. There is a very, very high degree of reliance on text to speech and magnification technologies in schools because they are cheaper to produce and require less qualified instructors and are perceived as ""more normal.""  

- You claim that audio is an equal path to spelling and literacy yet personally made a good example of the kind of spelling errors speech users tend to produce: ""kerry"" versus ""carry."" That may be fine on Reddit, but it wouldn't be fine for school papers or professional work and in my experience is very common among blind people. 

- Braille can be used for many things that speech is less (or not at all) useful for, such as reading signs, labeling items, accessible card or board games, math and programming for some people, being able to read and simultaneously listen to something else, and so on. It is also often the most suitable option for deaf-blind people. 

- Claiming that there has not been ""rapid change"" in braille technologies is just false too.

Call a delivery guy or go with a friend or go to another resturant. Of course you should be able to take your dog on the bus because you need to and it's already cleared with the owner.

Now substitute ""blind people who use guide dogs"" with ""people of a certain race, gender, or sexual orientation"" because discriminating against disabled people (and the tools they use for their disability) is somewhere in that ballpark. The fact that it makes Pete uncomfortable isn't the point.

1202,"I think this is honestly something that would have more appeal to sighted people who like audio books (or human-speech podfics) than it would to blind people. 

I read a lot, including quite a lot of fanfiction. The reasons why audiobooks produced with TTS don't appeal to me: 

- I already have software all set up with my preferences (including preferred engine, voice, etc) for reading any text (and a custom dictionary (like ""Hermione"" pronounced correctly) set up on all my devices.)

- I don't often find myself confused about who is speaking (or if speech is occurring) while reading fanfiction. 

- I listen to text to speech much faster than most sighted people. The recording you linked is painfully slow to my perception, even though it may sound normal to people who don't use a lot of text to speech. (Plus, the pitch changes and long pauses disrupt the flow to me. After all, when you are reading print, you don't assign ""voices"" to every character all the time, do you?)

- Because I prefer my books very fast, I'm already mostly not a big consumer of human-speech audio books. I would rather get a text copy and be able to play it at my own pace. I wouldn't look for a ""human like"" recording for that reason. 

If I were a sighted person (who probably doesn't have any sort of text to speech software set up on their phone or computer, isn't familiar with using it, etc) who likes audio books and podfics, your type of stories would definitely appeal to me.

At my school only my maths and science textbooks have been translated into braille and they are usually not the newest edition. My current maths book was published in 2005. To my understanding the other classes might not have textbooks in general. I do have some other books to help aid me but those were sourced by my family. The school library has also picked up some other non-course related books for me. At the start of a term I receive a physical braille summary of a class outline and have assignments explained to me during my one on one session.

The text books provided by the school are stored in the classroom so I don’t really need to transport them. I keep my additional books mostly at home as they are quite large. I honestly do not use physical braille books very often anymore as I have been using the computers and a refreshable braille display for a couple of years now. I have only recently been able to access the internet, but before that I mostly used the Vision Australia library.

I am in the same classroom as my peers but I feel it is an attempt of maintaining normality. In a typical day I will go to homeroom in the morning and follow a normal schedule in different classes throughout the day with different teachers. During elementary school I was able to listen and learn without much trouble, but as my hearing has mostly deteriorated I work mostly independently during class hours and receive one on one support weekly while my other classmates do sport. I am unsure about the interest of the other students as I do not have much interaction with them, but they were curious about my hearing aid in elementary school. My experience with the other students is neither positive nor negative.

I temporarily had audio aid in primary school but I no longer use it. I am lucky enough to have learnt braille sufficiently and also the Tadoma method in this time. I can thank my brother for helping me the most with my education as he is always helping me figure out things. It has been a bit harder since he graduated but I am coping well.

I have not tried a wide variety of what is available but I do prefer heavy keys with resistance.

1227,"I think it is important to inform people that the word blind is often used as a catch-all word to describe all people experiencing vision loss and vision impairment. Like most things in this world, there is a spectrum to visual-impairment and blindness. 
Some people have no perception of light at all, while others may not be able to see shapes, distance, or color but can still detect light sources. Some conditions gradually reduce the level of sight a person has, such as myself. Personally, I meet all legal definitions of being blind, I identify as blind, I use a guide dog to get around. But I still have a tiny bit of centralized vision left. The field of vision could be compared to looking through a pinhole punched into a playing card. 
That bit of central vision is terrible by the standards of what many sighted people experience, but it does allow me the opportunity (for now) to see my phone and computer screen with extensive screen enhancements and optimal lighting conditions. 
A strange phenomenon that occurs for me every so often is when I am walking around or sitting in a familiar place and just taking in my surroundings, my prain will occassionally attempt to fill in the blank spaces of my visual field. The illusion is akin to blurry vision, but I think its just my brain using a combo of memory, imagination, and other sensory input to create a composite mental image.

Many people who are blind or visually-impaired may see, but in a way that is different than people who are not blind. Sound, touch, smell, and imagination can contribute more than enough external information to the brain and enable a person who is blind or bisually impaired to see in their unique way.

1262,"Dear r/blind,

It has been so long!  
Since last we spoke, I got  very well cacquainted with the anger stage of grief.  The genetics lab that had told me they would hopefully have a spot for me in September, told me, at the end of August, that I would not be able to get in until next year. I, admittedly, went a little ape shit. 

I broke up with my former wizard of eyes (retina specialist) after he failed to call me back amidst my growing wrath and panic. 

I found a new doctor. Just an opthamologist. He was recommended by a friend as the best in the city and while he is not a retina specialist, what he is AMAZING at is doggedly perusing a thing and making the connections with the various people in the field to get it done. He made a connection with the best genetics lab for RP in the country. It is in Oregon. When the results are in, the director of that lab will go over the results with me personally.

The only snag... we had to get the blood to them, and as a normal sort of eye doctor, we found ourselves without the means to draw the blood.

 So I went to a random blood testing place that draws for outside labs. Perfect I think. I give my doctor their fax and head over. When I arrive the receptionist is all ""Oh! You are the person that belongs to this weird fax!"" The instructions for the draw and where to ship it were hand written on his letterhead. 

The lab wanted to know where the requisition form was. When I stared at them blankly, they showed me one. It was a very. Complicated form, filled with little boxes to check off which things you wanted to test for. I told them a form like that for the thing I need tested does not exist. So they shrugged, drew two vials of blood and then handed my own blood back to me!

They would not ship it to the lab. They would not give me a box to ship it in. They suggested FedEx. And they said to send it priority over night.

I walked out of the lab with two vials of my own blood in a zip lock baggie with a hazardous label on it.

At FedEx, I grabbed the smallest box they had and stood awkwardly in line with my box and ziplock trying to look normal, while the woman at the counter struggled mightily  to get the address of the man standing at the head of the line, correct. It took a long time. And she was very frazzled. It was my intention to be very nice to her in the first instant of our interaction so that she would want to help me figure this out.

To be fair, I was nice to her for about a couple seconds before her face started looking all alarmed and she repeatedly told me no this could not happen, no I could not use that box, no she could not sell me a box for shipping blood and by the way where I had even gotten the blood?! To this I motioned at my bandaid. 

It was about this time that I rejected everything she was saying and told her ""no, they sent me here, you need to help me make this happen."" This did not work either.

So, feeling as though I had hit a wall I told her I had a rare genetic condition and that this blood needed to get shipped overnight to the one, and only, lab in the country that tests for this condition. And during saying that fairly complex sentence I began to cry, a lot. That sentence was largely broken up into blubber bits of itself and strung back together sloppily with the snot, mucus and tears leaking out of my face.
The two other people behind me in line stood silently, valiantly engaging in the culturally normative behavior  of ignoring uncomfortable things, like weeping young ladies in a FedEx. 
The stupid cow clerk went off to find someone else, someone less stupid and cowish than herself. 

My rescuer was a trundle-ee sort of fellow, with the Chinese characters for strange brother on his wrists. The characters wouldn't  really be put together like that in Chinese. It would sound weird, but individually their meaning was correct, even if the character used for brother was weird and archaic.

It has been so long!  
Since last we spoke, I got  very well cacquainted with the anger stage of grief.  The genetics lab that had told me they would hopefully have a spot for me in September, told me, at the end of August, that I would not be able to get in until next year. I, admittedly, went a little ape shit. 

I broke up with my former wizard of eyes (retina specialist) after he failed to call me back amidst my growing wrath and panic. 

I found a new doctor. Just an opthamologist. He was recommended by a friend as the best in the city and while he is not a retina specialist, what he is AMAZING at is doggedly perusing a thing and making the connections with the various people in the field to get it done. He made a connection with the best genetics lab for RP in the country. It is in <LOCATION>. When the results are in, the director of that lab will go over the results with me personally.

The only snag... we had to get the blood to them, and as a normal sort of eye doctor, we found ourselves without the means to draw the blood.

 So I went to a random blood testing place that draws for outside labs. Perfect I think. I give my doctor their fax and head over. When I arrive the receptionist is all ""Oh! You are the person that belongs to this weird fax!"" The instructions for the draw and where to ship it were hand written on his letterhead. 

The lab wanted to know where the requisition form was. When I stared at them blankly, they showed me one. It was a very. Complicated form, filled with little boxes to check off which things you wanted to test for. I told them a form like that for the thing I need tested does not exist. So they shrugged, drew two vials of blood and then handed my own blood back to me!

They would not ship it to the lab. They would not give me a box to ship it in. They suggested FedEx. And they said to send it priority over night.

I walked out of the lab with two vials of my own blood in a zip lock baggie with a hazardous label on it.

At <LOCATION>, I grabbed the smallest box they had and stood awkwardly in line with my box and ziplock trying to look normal, while the woman at the counter struggled mightily  to get the address of the man standing at the head of the line, correct. It took a long time. And she was very frazzled. It was my intention to be very nice to her in the first instant of our interaction so that she would want to help me figure this out.

To be fair, I was nice to her for about a couple seconds before her face started looking all alarmed and she repeatedly told me no this could not happen, no I could not use that box, no she could not sell me a box for shipping blood and by the way where I had even gotten the blood?! To this I motioned at my bandaid. 

It was about this time that I rejected everything she was saying and told her ""no, they sent me here, you need to help me make this happen."" This did not work either.

So, feeling as though I had hit a wall I told her I had a rare genetic condition and that this blood needed to get shipped overnight to the one, and only, lab in the country that tests for this condition. And during saying that fairly complex sentence I began to cry, a lot. That sentence was largely broken up into blubber bits of itself and strung back together sloppily with the snot, mucus and tears leaking out of my face.
The two other people behind me in line stood silently, valiantly engaging in the culturally normative behavior  of ignoring uncomfortable things, like weeping young ladies in a <LOCATION>. 
The stupid cow clerk went off to find someone else, someone less stupid and cowish than herself. 

My rescuer was a trundle-ee sort of fellow, with the Chinese characters for strange brother on his wrists. The characters wouldn't  really be put together like that in Chinese. It would sound weird, but individually their meaning was correct, even if the character used for brother was weird and archaic. 

The point is, the strange brother was a gem. He found me a box and packaged the vials in crumpled up papertowel. He assured me that this was not his first rodea, and that there was always a way. He didn't  even charge me for the box. He then took the funny hand written note and entered in the addresses correctly the first time. I was so grateful.

1309,"I got this tip from Molly Burke. When you greet him say his name and identify yourself like you would if you were using a telephone from way back in the 90s, before caller id. That way he knows you are saying hello to him and he can start to associate your name with your voice. Also, when you see him outside the normal time or circumstance that you normally see him, doing this is especially helpful, as he may not simply be associating your name and voice but your name to your voice AND the normal circumstances in which you interact. So in a different situation, even after getting to know you for a while, he may not recognize you by your voice.

When you greet him say his name and identify yourself like you would if you were using a telephone from way back in the 90s, before caller id. That way he knows you are saying hello to him and he can start to associate your name with your voice. Also, when you see him outside the normal time or circumstance that you normally see him, doing this is especially helpful, as he may not simply be associating your name and voice but your name to your voice AND the normal circumstances in which you interact. So in a different situation, even after getting to know you for a while, he may not recognize you by your voice.

Homonymous Hemianopsia

Complete lack of left visual field.  Also missing some top &amp; bottom.  Also completely blind in low light levels.

I also have little wormholes (as I call them).  Very small areas of blindness on my 'good' side, that make reading text on food packets, books, etc very hard.  It basically interfered with anything requiring detail. 

Was fully sighted until 2 yrs ago when i had a stroke during a heart procedure (rotablation angioplasty)

&gt;as a visually impaired or blind person, if you could have your sight restored to normal for free and without pain, would you choose to do so?

In a heartbeat.

Don't know if it's even possible since a good portion of my visual cortex is now basically dead tissue.  But if it were possible, I'd be 100% in favour of it.

&gt;what kind of visual information is most important to you?

If it was only possible to restore one aspect of my missing sight, then I would say the ability to detect objects in my missing visual field. 

It would enable me to navigate much more safely.  I'm constantly walking into things on my 'bad' side, or hitting my head on things I don't realise are there.

One night I particularily remember. We all ordered various dishes and I was listening in on this conversation this blind guy was having with someone. He has field eyesight, but limited central so he uses a cane. He was talking about hot girls and such. Just like any pther guy.
Meanwhile, this other guy (born blind) was just going around and talking to everyone at the tables. His name was Clem and super friendly. It was kinda cute, he had his shirt backwards and had a big goofy grin on his face. A lot of sighted people, including me, are self concious of our smiles. Whether we have a piece of food in our teeth, our teeth aren't white, etc, we can be shy when it comes to smiles. But I've noticed blind people, particularily ones born blind, smile more naturally because they tend to not be self conscious. Not all the time, though. 
But I'll get back to that later.
Anyway, me and Clem talked about awkward times he had walked in to the girls' washroom and laughed about it. We're both Chrostians (he's a big Christian person while I haven't gone to church in years) so we talked about faith and such. He grew up with the belief that being blind was a sin so he had to overcome it. He's also in a band and plays guitar. 
After we finished talking he headd back ot his table. Most of us had ordered way too much food (the guy talking about hot girls had ordered a giant pizza) so we all gave our unwanted food to Clem. We called him our ""human trash can"". :) 
Aa for the others, one girl is very shy and doesn't talk much. She has a cane ans such. Another girl, who got a stroke and became blind very suddenly, uses a cane and is very outgoinging and friendly. 
The guy talking-about-hot-girls became blind almost out of the blue. He woke up one morning, couldn't read his text book, and had to get tested something like 20 times before he was diagnosed with a mitochondria condition. He mostly sees in the corner of his eyes. Prior to being blind, he made fun of blind and disabled people. Now that he's blind himself, he's more understanding. To get over his loss of eye sight and feel better, instead of feeling sorry for himself, he began hitting the GYM ans now competes in bodybuilding competitions. 
As for blind people, particularily ones born blind,  this one girl I met is self concious of what she looks like. Before her friends upload a picture of herself to FaceBook she says: ""Wait! don't post it yet! Do I look good? Is my hair fine?"" Etc. Just because she can't see doesn't mean she doesn't want to look good. 

The bottom line: Every blind person is different because every person in general is different. Some people let their blindness impact their personalities, some people, like firendly Clem, don't. 
As for life in general, sighted and blind people all have their ambitions. Clem plays the guitar while another guy I met began competing in body building competitions to recover mentally from being blind all of a sudden. We all have our dreams whether we see them or not.

Bonus: Some of the blind people I've met have a tendency to have their heads bobble down somewhat, even the ones who had sight before. Some of the blind people I've met have their eyes closed.
