I am not sure how the idea of a sub-culture makes me feel. It deffinotly doesn't help the preconceived notions people have. It doesn't help with integration in to the work place, if one is fortunate enough to obtain employment. It brings another question to mind, do blind people prefer others who are blind as a partner?

12,"I have one.  If all you ever want to do is browse the web, it's mostly fine.  The chromevox screen-reader is not the best thing in the world, but once you learn to deal with it, it works OK.  The main problem with Chromevox is that it isn't user friendly, and the way it's designed everything takes two or three times longer than it would with any other screen-reader.  But it all does work, where work is defined as you can get everything done eventually without sighted help.  Unfortunately, the documentation isn't the best, either; the shortcut keys you need are spread out over two or three different places, so it's a bit tricky to learn them all.  The most important two that aren't listed in the chromevox documentation are search+f2 to toggle between the tray with wifi etc, and the app launcher, and search+f6 to toggle between parts of the browser window (the main content, the address bar, and so-on).  

How old is your brother?  If he's in middle school or junior high, a chromebook would be absolutely perfect to take to school and use as a note-taker, assuming the school has wifi.  The battery lasts forever, it boots up and down extremely quickly, and Google Docs would be just right for taking notes and completing assignments.  Also, it's small and light, so it can be easily carried on the walk to school, or on the bus.  Plus, it's cheap enough that if it gets stolen, it sucks, but it isn't absolutely the end of the world.  

However, come high school, he might take a programming course, a science course, or any other course that requires some desktop app.  And then he's going to need Windows anyway.  

If your brother is an adult, looking to get into, or stay in, the working world, then a chromebook makes a nice back-up computer.  But it's just not capable enough to be a main computer.  That's how I use it, in fact.  The chromebook goes anywhere I don't want to carry a full sized laptop, or anywhere I want long battery life.  It's perfect for writing emails outside!

16,"I'm a sighted guy, and have been dating a blind woman for about six months.  She's the best, and looking back, I would have really missed out on a lot if I had decided not to date her, just because she's blind.  (I never considered not dating her because of her blindness.)

There are practical things to consider, of course. There are some experiences that you won't be able to share, and others that you can share with a little extra time or creativeness. But there are so many possible things to do in this world, that no person (whether sighted or blind) could ever do any significant fraction of them. So her blindness just pushes us in certain directions -- we focus on the things that we can share together.

I was surprised by how quick and easy it was to adapt to her blindness.  It's a fact about her, like many other facts, and it isn't awkward or anything like that. It took a little time to get to know each other (and to build a little bit of trust), but once that happened she really came alive.  She's confident and funny (sassy, really), and flirty and adventurous and out-going -- and introspective and sad, and all the usual things a person is.  And she's also casual and easy-going about her blindness.  It's really important that she never treats it like she's ashamed of it -- she just owns it, it's just a fact of her daily life.  Sometimes it's relevant, such as when we're navigating a new place that is unfamiliar to us both (where she relies on me a bit for moving through crowds, etc.).  Usually it's either not relevant, or is just one background fact among many others.  Sometimes she gets sort of goofy and playful about it, which is adorable.  I mean, it's a fact about her, not something to be ashamed of.

You should definitely be thoughtful and considerate, when getting to know her and when learning how to interact with her. Try to think of things from her perspective. At first it takes some mental effort, but soon it will become very natural. For example, generally don't move her stuff, especially not tools like a cane. If you have to move something, let her know quickly and casually, like ""Hey, I put your backpack on the sofa."" Also, I've developed the habit of making just a bit of noise, when I'm moving through the house, so that she knows where I am. That way, she doesn't start a conversation with an empty room, etc. Over time, she'll let you know how much of that kind of thing is needed / wanted. But again, it all becomes natural very quickly.

One super-important thing: If she uses a guide dog, absolutely follow her lead on what to do with the dog. There are plenty of articles out there on how to interact with guide dogs, and the number one rule is generally -- don't.  Don't make eye contact, absolutely do not pet them, don't feed them, etc.  I can't exaggerate how important this is.  You wouldn't believe the stories I've heard from her, about inconsiderate and rude things that people have done with her guide dog.  And even if you're dating her, that doesn't make you an exception, with respect to the guide dog.  At some point she may tell you ""Ok, now you can play with the pup"" or some such (when the dog is out of harness / not working), but you should always take your cues from her about when and what is OK.

With just a little bit of effort, you can do some homework on the experiences of blind people, and maybe avoid a few things that are consistently annoying or awkward for blind folks.  There are some excellent blogs and such out there.  One of them is Fashioneyesta on YouTube.  She mainly blogs about fashion, but she has also done a lot of videos on frustrations, guide dog etiquette, etc.  Listen through the things she complains about, and you'll probably avoid a few common mistakes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeWRBmmDqGA

Also, if you do decide to date this woman, consider that this relationship will unfold like any other. You'll get to know each other, maybe things will go great and maybe not. Maybe you spend the rest of your lives together, but maybe (like many, many relationships) it runs its course and ends at some point. There's nothing in there that is different, just because she's blind. If you get on great, I can almost guarantee that her blindness will be the last thing you're worried about.  And if things don't go well, one or both of you will probably end the relationship, and -- shocker, here -- it will probably have very little to do with her blindness.

Best wishes.

I went to several blind Summer camps, which always had some kind of climbing activity, weather it be hiking up to the top of a water fall or just climbing a large rock wall, as I recall, only one person out of the 20 or so of us was nervous about the heights.

I went to a blind training program for adults that sometimes did group activities, one of which was rock climbing. I actually missed out on it, but from what I hear, only one person was too nervous to climb, and that was partly due to unrelated health issues.

About the ID cane, have you used a standard length mobility cane in the past?  I am a mobility cane user and have never used an ID because since I've needed a cane I've needed it to be full length because I need obstacle detection.  If you need obstacle detection it may be worth looking into getting some orientation and mobility training and working with a longer cane, but that is entirely personal preference and depends on your situation.  I know one person that uses an ID cane and he mostly caries it in his hand in front of him, it seems to work for what he needs.

&amp;nbsp;

As for public perception/ taking advantage/ whatever else.  It is certainly not a silly thing to ask about but it's going to depend.  I have had people be super great to me while carrying a cane, and I've been taken advantage of a couple of times that are super memorable and resulted in me having to call the police.  When you start traveling with a cane you need to be aware of your surroundings and the people around you, even if you are just carrying one for ID, be sure to maintain situational awareness.  I have never had a problem with change, but I am careful about the places where I pay cash, and I mostly stick with my debit card because there is no change at all to worry about.  I also know there was a discussion about ID canes in 2015, if you search the sub you will probably find it, but I believe the person inquiring actually started using one and liked it.

31,"For me it's mostly tactile, I use it for obstacle detection, avoidance, and navigation.  The way I was trained to use it is I cross the cane to the opposite side of the foot that is taking a step and I always keep in step.  Basically one step, one sweep and the next step is always clear because I cleared it one step ahead of time.  I also refitted two of my canes with ceramic tips, and another one has a metal tip, those allow me to get more tactile feedback on the surface and they also make more distinct sounds so I know if I'm about to step off concrete and onto asphalt which can be useful if there isn't a super distinct curb for me to detect on.

I have a friend who is very high low vision, but still falls under legally blind. She was pushed so hard to integrate in to mainstream schooling that she has no knowledge of assistive technology. She constantly suffered from migraines and fell behind, as a result her confidence suffered. It became more of a problem with post secondary. She pushed away from me to hang with sighted preppies, the agony! She was in my wedding party. It was and still is very hard to watch. There is nothing wrong with having life goals but I think someone should have been real with her.

I'm still keeping them and I use them all the time but I'd like something more convenient hence the Wayfarers.  I have two other pairs of ""sunglasses"" but they are just yellow and red tinted glasses in my prescription.  I don't really like the different color tints and prefer to get things as dark as possible because the sun can really bother my eyes.","[{'start': 326, 'end': 345, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 187, 'end': 206, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

62,"Yes, I definitely agree that browsing on Windows with NVDA and Firefox is superior to any other option out there.  When I suggested Linux, I thought he wanted a familiar environment to do the same things he's already doing.  If he's willing to re-learn everything anyway, Windows is a better solution in the end.  

As for a mouse, does he have enough vision to use it?  I don't have one at all, myself.  If he has no vision at all, the only place a mouse will do anything for him is in some relatively obscure audio games.

For a headset, I'm using the Turtle Beach Z300.  However, this is probably way overkill!  I use it because it can pair with my phone via bluetooth, and my computer via USB, and play the audio from both devices at the same time.  This is so useful when I'm on a phone call and need to check something quickly on the computer.  However, I do recommend Turtle Beach products.  They're usually pretty accessible, with voice prompts when they're paired, when the battery is low or charged, and audio feedback when the mic is muted and unmuted.  You might look into one of their cheaper wireless options.  When you're blind, wireless is even more useful than it is to sighted people!  I can start my screen-reader reading a long email or web page, and get up and go do something else; I don't need to be anywhere near the screen.  In fact, if you get him a good wireless keyboard too, he gets some of the advantages of a laptop, with all the advantages of a desktop!  Most wireless keyboards and headsets have a range of two or three hundred feet, making using the computer in another room perfectly possible when you don't need to see the monitor.  I'd recommend one of the various Logitech wireless keyboards, as they seem to have the least lag.

Your point about a wireless headset and keyboard makes a lot of sense, so I will make sure that is what he gets.

Do you have any recommendation on antivirus software and firefox plugins?  My biggest concerns with having him on Windows are viruses and spyware.  I personally use firefox with noscript, privacy badger, and ublock origin.  I'm always leery to setup noscipt for anyone but myself as it is a constant challenge to get new sites to run properly, but I figure an adblocker is a minimum security requirement seeing as there are so many malicious ads out there.

Right now he mostly uses word perfect 5.1; where he keeps phone numbers, addresses, notes, and various other documents.  Do you have any recommendations on software to replace that functionality?  It would be nice if google's web software would work for him, such as google docs and sheets--but if something like Microsoft office is more accessible that would probably be the way to go.  Since everything is going to be new to him he might as well start with whatever is best in the end.

80,"Lot of blind people use screenreaders. Macs and ios devices come with VoiceOver; Windows comes with Narrator, but you can also install NVDA (free) or Jaws (expensive) on Windows. Whatever you get comfortable with - I'm effective with VoiceOver.
The app will read your screen and also wjat you type. Wjochever screenreader you use it can take a while to get fluent with it.

Also not all blind people are totally blind. Some have a bit of usable vision left, whole you still are considered legally blind. So other options may include zoom in browser (you can make the letters as big  as a cat if it helps). Then you can also use reallly high contrast or inverted colors if you are able to see something.

Reddit has also many ways to browse it.
Right now I'm using an app on my iPad. It kind of works - I know how to use it and where my controls are. But I don't know for instance if I'm replying to a pm or a thread because I can't tell. 
On iPhone I often find links to intereeting topics via a twitter app where I follow a few subreddit bots. So I click on the link, follow thru to read it... Sometimes open it on safari too. Any text gets then read by voiceover. Pictures are pretty useless, and I don't bother reading long threads of comments because that takes forever.

The app will read your screen and also wjat you type. Wjochever screenreader you use it can take a while to get fluent with it.

Also not all blind people are totally blind. Some have a bit of usable vision left, whole you still are considered legally blind. So other options may include zoom in browser (you can make the letters as big  as a cat if it helps). Then you can also use reallly high contrast or inverted colors if you are able to see something.

Reddit has also many ways to browse it.
Right now I'm using an app on my iPad. It kind of works - I know how to use it and where my controls are. But I don't know for instance if I'm replying to a pm or a thread because I can't tell. 
On iPhone I often find links to intereeting topics via a twitter app where I follow a few subreddit bots. So I click on the link, follow thru to read it... Sometimes open it on safari too. Any text gets then read by voiceover. Pictures are pretty useless, and I don't bother reading long threads of comments because that takes forever.

88,"Tl;dr version: you can have only the senses you have had during this lifetime. If you've never seen then your dreams will be blind. Nothing to see, but all other senses work perfectly (like in real life).

But if you were sighted before then most likely your dreams will have things to see (on top of other senses). Many do, even if in awake life they now see nothing.

Then there are the exceptions I guess. I should see in my dreams. Typically I don't.
For instance a night or two ago I met one of my previous cats in a dream. It was in a dark room that I couldn't recognize. He was a black cat (could see him when he was alive). I recognized him from voice, the touch of his fur and his scent.

Other blind dream types: getting lost inside buildings. Crossing a road. Variations of the dreams where you are naked or dressed weird. Dreams where everyhting is completely dark but very vivid and you think you're awake - for instance dreaming of sleeping in a different bed when it feels completely like sleeping on a specific other mattress, in a different room. Or are in a plane and know what kind of plane and what seat, just no visuals.

The game says I don't have any items when I press x, even though the item description says I have two swords.  

Things that are needed: footstep sounds on movement, so I know that's actually working.  Either that or a unique description that could be printed on every tile.  A way to get NVDA to read back the text properly.  A fix for the weapon bug.  Environment descriptions just say ""can't do that"", so that needs fixing as well.  Combine the game into one Window; I'm not even sure what the other Window is for.  Though I suspect most of the interface strangeness is because the game is in Java.  

The grammar template engine looks like an interesting idea, I guess.  Though if you really must do it in Java, why not make it part of CoffeeMud (<URL>)?

She was verbally abused and harassed by a woman she met on there because she didn't have her character in a wheelchair.  This persons whole identity was her disability and what she couldn't do, it was impossible to work, and how society was shit because it didn't bend to her every need.

The cons are that it is fragile, the battery life is not so great, and everyone I know who has used one (2 other people + myself) has had the battery completely die requiring an RMA to get a replacement which makes me think it's a flaw in the design, not just a fluke.  It usually happens six months to a year after you start using it regularly.  I'm currently trying to get my hands on a Freedom Scientific Ruby XL which I have used and absolutely love.

124,"I use hotkeys constantly.  The problem with using tab is that often, site authors don't label form controls properly, so when you tab to them you just hear something unhelpful like ""edit"". Also, many website authors do strange things with the tab order on a page, so you can never trust that you've been through the entire page while tabbing.  However, on pages I trust to be correct (GMail, for example) I do use the tab key all the time.  Also, Google has created many custom hotkeys that work in GMail, and seeing as I use GMail every day, I use Google's recommended hotkeys over the ones NVDA provides.  I only use the arrow keys the first time I'm exploring a website, and often not even then.  For example, if I'm reading a news article, the first thing I'll try is h to jump to the next heading, in hopes the author has made the headline a heading of some kind.  Arrowing through everything on a web page is just far too clunky and slow.  

I'm really not generally aware of what websites use bootstrap, so I couldn't really answer that question.  The only JavaScript library that is annoying enough that I'm aware of it is CKEditor.  I always turn off rich text editors in every website that lets me, because I find the hundreds of formatting buttons just get in the way.  Plus, NVDA used to have problems reading back any text typed into JavaScript edit fields.  However, over the past year, I haven't noticed the problem as frequently.  Either sites are using different controls these days, or CKEditor has been fixed, or I just turn off fancy editors so reflexively I don't even remember doing it.  

Yup. Apparently CKEditor 4 fixed all of the accessibility problems.  I'll leave the last paragraph in tact, though.  It highlights one of the problems with making accessibility fixes: if a user tried something 2 years ago and it didn't work, the user is going to assume it still doesn't work.  Websites are good at promoting there own fixes to users, but if a library developer fixes something, I'm not sure how we'd ever find out.

143,"Your response is super interesting to me.  I am about to start my Freshman year of undergraduate education as a Mechanical Engineering major in the Fall a couple thousand miles away from home.  I grew up with parents that were insistent that I needed to be independent, they avoided the school for the blind in my area like the plague (on the advice of others) and put me through mainstream school all the way through and I'm about to graduate in a couple of weeks having completed K-12 in a regular school system.  My dad has been actively encouraging me to get as far away as I can so that I can figure out life for myself, and as a result of all of this I am fiercely independent and I feel like I've got a really good handle on how to go through life with this particular disability.

&amp;nbsp;

Through work and some programs with a local non-profit I've been put in contact with some people around my age who went to the school for the blind and visually impaired who are just not independent in the slightest.  Your comment about not liking most blind and visually impaired people you meet was also interesting because I've joked with sighted friends that I really haven't been too fond of many of the blind and visually impaired people I've met IRL.  There are a few notable exceptions but most are just not people that are fun to be around.  The people I've been put in contact with in my area often have no independent spirit and want everything done for them.  It's not the fact that they are blind or visually impaired that bothers me, I mean I am in the exact same boat, but it's a trend of lacking any kind of initiative or motivation that baffles me.  I kind of thought that was just a thing in my area though and it sounds like this might be more common. Has that been your experience?  I think the demographic that frequents this sub is more independent and looking for ways to make the best of life and that's why I'm so drawn to it, but I have experienced so many people IRL that just don't care enough.

152,"&gt; There are a few notable exceptions but most are just not people that are fun to be around. The people I've been put in contact with in my area often have no independent spirit and want everything done for them.

When I first lost most of my sight about 18 months ago, I went to a local Blind club/support group, on the advice of someone from a local charity who was supposed to give me cane training (which lasted about 2 mins, but that's another story).

Everyone there seemed to spend the whole time just whining about sighted people and 'woe is me' kind of attitude.

Instead of finding a little moral support from people in the same boat as me,  when I was trying to come to terms with my sight loss and learn how to adapt to it - it was like a Blind pissing contest as to who had it worse or had a better story about how society hates the blind.  Probably the most depressing 2hrs I'd spent in anyones company for a long time.

Even the local blind charity was pretty crap.  I was seeking info on what suitable employment I would be able to do and where to get relevant training, etc.  Most of the members seemed to think the visually impaired could only do simple menial jobs and you just had to put up with your lot in life.

This charity was actually the official arm of the local Council, thankfully they lost the contract and it was awarded to a company who are leaps and bounds better it terms of support and actually providing useful advice.",,,,impablomations,Homonymous Hemianopsia,,1460646682,t5_2qpec,t3_4e6lvo,t1_d1xhygy,1,1463438584,0,0,d22naji,Blind,1,,blue1,,

It is difficult to follow the thread of a conversation between hearing people, as the conversation jumps around.  It is hard to know where it jumped to in time to read what was said on the person's lips.  So, it becomes easier to socialize within a deaf community, thus fostering a unique sense of a deaf community.

I am a painter. I am not blind yet, I am going blind. When I was younger I remember playing ""Would you rather"" and the choice was deaf or blind.

Whatever reasons you've had to call police for are what really worries me about using a cane. I'm thinking it's probably not going to be worth it.i only fell from tripping once on a particularly gnarly section of sidewalk by my apartment. I've since memorized where it's uneven and the city or someone marked it with bright paint, so it won't happen again, at least not there .


I have never used a cane of any kind, no. At first I was given the impression that my vision impairment was temporary. Then at my first ophthalmologist appointment last February they told me it would never improve- and that was when I still had diplopia. So I was never really in the position to try a cane out. For the short time I thought it would never improve I was too devastated to seek accommodations. And when I thought it was temporary I figured there was no point in getting used to it.

248,"this is a great question!
my mom (who is blind) has told me before that she thinks that deaf culture is so strong because they have their ""own language"" to communicate with whereas blind people do not have something similar to keep a sense of closeness or community (if that makes sense)
my mom also went through mainstream schooling but slowly lost her vision as she was growing up. 
it's a shame that there isn't such a sense of community among blind people. sharing technologies and the sort would be amazing if it happened on a more frequent basis- right now it's mostly research i do to find what's out there. also, sharing similar experiences among the blind community would be great too. my mom is always saying she wishes she knew more people in the same boat she is in to share experiences and whatnot and see how people handle different things (like if other people have drivers?). i don't know, i think my mom just feels isolated and like she is ""different"" (btw- this is coming from her. i always tell her that she's not but it doesn't matter how much i tell her, at the end of the day she has to feel it for herself unfortunately :(  ). i wish she knew more blind people so she can share her thoughts and feelings with people who might be having similar experiences :/",,,,throwitawayyy1234,,,1460342645,t5_2qpec,t3_4e6lvo,t3_4e6lvo,3,1463358829,0,0,d1y0olx,Blind,3,,,,

If you live in a place with good public transit, that might not be a huge deal.  But especially in North America, public transit is poor enough in most cities that it can make everything from shopping for groceries to getting a job much harder.

The second thing to keep in mind is that it's going to be ten times harder for her to find work.  Unemployment is, I would say, the largest issue effecting blind people right now.  So counting on her to bring in half of your combined income is probably not reasonable.  

However, those things aside, blind people can do pretty much anything we want.  If she lives on her own, you can assume that she can do everything associated with that without a lot of help: cooking, cleaning, etc.  If you move in together, the only changes in your life that you'll probably need to make is that you'll have to make sure and put things back where they go when you're done with them.

There are two windows because in one of them it shows the UI (so visually unimpaired can still enjoy the game) and the other is the one that generates the sentences and read them out loud. I'm also using NVDA and it works fine to me (the sentences are being read okay), so probably it has to do the Java Access Bridge not being activated or an incompatible version being installed (I had to install both the 34 and 64 bit version to make it work).

Pressing the button ""x"" allows you to attack. You can't attack if you don't have a weapon equipped. If you press the button ""i"" it will read out what you have in the inventory and if you press the numeric numbers you'll be able to equip them.
Pressing other buttons like ""b"" or ""n"" will give you information about the environment around you, so you can see where to go.

The idea of adding footsteps whenever you move is a great idea, as well as naming the second window.

Most of those with little to no vision were very sheltered and as a result had a pretty weird mentality. There was a lot of childlike behavior; I often witnessed 14-16-year-olds who had no issues besides blindness behaving as if they were 10 (banging on tables, making weird noises etc). Surprisingly I did make a few friends while I was there, all but one of whom were also new and attending due to inadequate accommodations from their schools. Of the 3 I still talk to only one is totally blind. I've tried to bury that part of my past but have gotten curious once or twice and looked at the Facebook posts of people whose names I knew there.

276,"It's a little bit of everything. Echo location to some digree from the sound feedback you get while tapping the cane on the ground as you pass by objects. As for texture differences lots are determined from the vibrations traveling up the cane.

277,"It's probably a 70/30 split for me between tactile feedback and echolocation. I learned oh &amp; M using a sweeping technique with the roller tip on my cane, so it keeps in constant contact with the ground and gets me full feedback of what surfaces I'm on. From the sound the cane makes, I can generally get some spatial reasoning of obstacles in front and around me, like shorelining walls or if I'm about to walk into a parked car, etc. I can generally hear the sound reflected before my cane hits an object.",,,,Marconius,Blind from sudden RAO,,1460271522,t5_2qpec,t3_4e342p,t3_4e342p,2,1463342337,0,0,d1x25i6,Blind,2,,blue1,,

279,"I deeply disagree.  I never liked custom platforms like blinknation, Klango, The Zone, and so-on.  I find my most valuable interactions tend to come from places not meant specifically for the blind, but where blind people developed groups and a large population anyway.  Audioboo, before they turned it into audioboom and ruined everything forever, was one of those places.  Something about being on a popular, well maintained platform, where sighted people could pop in if they liked, or ignore us if they wanted, seems to promote much more value in my mind.  Maybe it's because these places tend to draw in blind people from outside the blind subculture, so we get more of a variety of people.  If I can toot our own horn for a minute, I find /r/blind is a near perfect platform for exactly the kind of interaction I want.  Most of the people who post here are involved in other subs on Reddit, not just this one.  We get interested sighted folk popping in and out regularly.  So we have a huge variety of topics here, with input from people in all walks of blindness, and all walks of life.  The sort of people who go out of there way to sign up for Klango or Blinknation tend, honestly, to be the kind of people I don't find particularly interesting.  I'm not insulting you or anything, I'm sure you're an interesting person.  I'm just speaking on average.  And anyway, you're here, aren't you?  And even people who would rather just talk to other blind people all day...I have nothing against them, and I don't think they're bad people.  I'm just not interested in talking to them.

283,"My vision deteriorated last October and I've been using a long cane since November. The best thing I was told was that if it helped me, I could use it. If it didn't help in a situation or made me very self conscious, I could opt to not use it. The cane is really there for you, there aren't set rules about when you use it. 

I personally really like the cane. It took a while to get used to but now I feel much more comfortable using it. It's great to know that the sidewalk doesn't end right in front of me, or there isn't a sudden curb. 


I don't know much about ID canes but even with a long cane people don't seem to realize what it's for. On the plus side, people move out of my way and pull their kids out of my way too!  ",,,,awesomesaucesaywhat,,,1460341717,t5_2qpec,t3_4e3zt2,t3_4e3zt2,1,1463358590,0,0,d1y069d,Blind,1,,,,
