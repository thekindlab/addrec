&gt; Also when I refer to the blind community I intend to say the Reddit Blind community, as most of the employees here working on this campaign are in fact blind as well.


I'm glad to hear that!  In that case, why are none of them willing to engage with this community?  Why are they allowing posts to be written about them in third person? If this campaign is run by blind folks, it seems to me like it would say ""our world"", not ""their world"".  Why are blind people themselves talking about us, instead of talking with or to us?  Why are your own blind employees seemingly excluding their own voices from the campaign?  Wouldn't letting your employees speak directly add more authenticity?  Why is the fact that the campaign itself is being run by blind people never mentioned in your PR?  Even when you're covered by the media, this is covered as something done for the blind, rather than something done by the blind.  I'm sure with a little thought, you can understand the assumption that no blind people are involved at all.  Because it seems that they have been given no agency or voice themselves.  

third message:
&gt; FYI, it's not nice to say things like ""actual blind people"" as I'm visually impaired.


Again, that's good to hear!  But it's also not nice to talk about blind people in the third person, when you're speaking directly to blind people.  What's even less nice is to try and use /r/blind as your personal PR outlet. The fact that you yourself are visually impaired makes your request to silence the voices of other blind and visually impaired people, by requesting threads ""including the comments"" be deleted, even worse, not better.  It's also not nice to sign up to Reddit exclusively to try and get free PR on the back of an AMA done by /u/Nighthawk321, especially when you've apparently had no previous association with him.  Deleting your account in a huff, when you don't get your way and get called on what you're doing, just adds the icing to the ""not nice"" cake.  

So, this is where we stand now.  Once again, I'd like to offer my heartfelt regrets to the community for the way I mishandled parts of the situation.  I'd also like to repeat that I think the people at BlindNewWorlds are good people, with good intentions.  They're just executing on them all wrong, and that's extremely frustrating.  If BlindNewWorlds ever does decide to try and fix the problems with what they're doing, and make a second attempt at getting it right in a new campaign, I'll do my best to give them a fair shake. Or if they just decide to come back and engage with us, I'll do what I can to help them do a better job.  And I know the rest of the Reddit community will also treat them fairly and openly.  Perhaps more fairly and openly than I have.

I am 31 years old and at 20 my hair started thinning and I was noticeably balding by 22 years old. I also am on the Autism Spectrum and while I have zero cognitive deficiencies and an above average IQ. I can't read body language well.

Interestingly enough, when I was losing my hair that was the first time I felt ""unattractive"". Then I finally figured out something was really wrong with my social cues and found out I have autism which again makes me feel ""unattractive"".

Anyway, my point is: I think it is natural to feel ""unattractive"" when you don't fit your own model of attractive and cool. However, maybe it is indicative of how you feel about yourself? ",,,,buymydebt,,,1465916749,t5_2qpec,t3_4lf7y9,t3_4lf7y9,1,1469032729,0,0,d48t4wz,Blind,1,,,,

40,"The horizon would still be a factor in attaining the high ground. Height allows you to see over other objects, but it also allows you to see miles and miles farther out to the horizon, which is especially significant back in the day when sight was pretty much the only way you knew the enemy was approaching, and the majority of them were approaching on foot, so seeing them a few miles sooner gave you significantly more time to prepare.  That's why castles will often have a couple really high towers even though the castle itself is already on the highest hill in the area.

71,"A shortened version of bloggles, for those who don't wana go click around wordpress:

Sometimes there is value is starting things over again. This painting is a prime example. The painting was going in a certain direction and it wasn’t working out, for a myriad of reasons, it was just all wrong.  It was wrong mainly because I had an idea of how it was going to go in my head, but when I went to actually make that plan come to fruition, it was just not working. In real life, things fail to work out all the time.  In this painting, the failure was a lot of things, but mainly the scale, the perspective and to some degree the color. I had it in my head that this seasons series I was working on had to have aspen trees as the primary focus in each painting, but I also really wanted the summer painting to be about flowers and, to a lesser extent, afternoon storms.  I really enjoy summertime storms.

So if I had to describe the painting for r/blind I would say that the first painting was not working out because it was the visual equivalent of a meal that has way too many competing spices vying for your attention, and the overall effect is just gross.

The final painting though still has all the same spices, aspens, flowers and clouds, but they are not competing, they are complimentary. The sky is a miasma of swirling clouds, powerful and foreboding, presaged by the scent of rain and electricity. In the distance, at the edge of an expansive meadow stand the aspen trees, their leaves rustling in the wind that carries the storm. Behind the aspens the cool dark of the pines and the thicker forest, the pines trees thin and spikey and tall in their ascent towards the heavens, making the horizon line jagged.

* I've tried Eclipse which proceeded to complain about the missing legacy Java SE 6, which I installed and then it proceeded to complain about the version of the installed JVM but without telling anything about the appropriate version, so I couldn't use it;
* I've tried NetBeans but didn't find it accessible as I couldn't even find a way to write code after adding a file to the project;
* SublimeText is inaccessible according to many posts that I've read around, including that Tools of a Blind Programmer post that you mentioned , so I didn't even try it;
* Notepad++ is a Windows-only IDE, and I'm on OS X.  I've considered switching to Windows, but for Visual Studio, which is accessible according to the reviews that I've read around.

I've also tried:

* Xcode - Is accessible for the most part but is a pain to navigate and error messages don't display line numbers;
* TextMate 1.x - Is inaccessible as buttons aren't even labeled and I couldn't even find a way to finish creating a project;
* TextMate 2.x - Is the most accessible of all the IDEs and editors that I've tried but I couldn't find a way to save to my home directory as it only lists the most common directories;
* nano in the console - Is accessible but the console has its own issues and nano doesn't have a quick way to jump to a given line;

It's the only team sport I've ever played and therefore the only one I know enough about to know what is going on and be able to narrate it.. though for just people watching at a sporting event, I'd be all about that.  I don't have any blind friends in person, though.

 I know! I need to call the vision specialist people in my area and figure out when the newbs to being blind meet up... but I am procrastinating a lot.... actually I just don't want to call that lady and have to explain the whole situation over the phone. It feels like when someone dies or is in the process of dying. It is just really fucking sad and you don't want to have to rehash it with new people, because when you do it feels new all over again.  

I mean.. I'm at the point where I am mostly okay emotionally, but then I will see something really beautiful and I fall apart.  I keep thinking I'm fine and am totally going to handle this, and then I am driving home from work and the sun is setting and there are storm clouds above the mountains and the lightening is dancing all across the range. It is so perfectly beautiful it hurts, and tears are just streaming down my face and pretty soon it is more than just a silent cascade of tears. I am sobbing, those horrible shuddering breathes.  The sadness is paralysing. 

I just wait for it to pass.

The truth is, I have no idea what I am doing, no idea what I am going to do. But I like this sub reddit. I spend a lot of time here. People are so nice and their stories make me  hopeful. And I guess that is why I feel like I totally have this handled, at least part of the time, because I feel like it will be okay, that it won't really be as scary or limiting as I thought at first, just different. 

But I lose it every now and then, because there is a part of me that will just miss visual beauty so much. And it is especially difficult,  because it is that part of me that, until recently, only ever brought my life more beauty, more  joy and more peace.

Comparing two senses is a great place to start when you're thinking about this topic, and science has a lot to say on the matter, too. I recommend looking at scientific literature and Reddit's various science related subs, you can find interesting stuff with keywords like ""totally blind"" with ""space"" and ""sound"". 

If you're really interested in knowing what sight *is* to blind people, it might be even more helpful to ask questions and learn from peoples' different opinions. You can learn a ton from what blind people think about sight. Again, I would look to science for a better understanding of the importance of senses in the brain, what brain development is like for blind children. You might even stumble on an influential way of thinking about the differences between various senses that would help clarify your description further. 

On the other hand, if blindness interests you but you don't care much for the science behind it, you could look into philosophy and literature on blindness, which is more of an artistic interpretation. There's also the option of getting involved in the community! Spending time lurking on this sub will teach you a lot about accessibility and what blindness is like in general.

118,"You *can* hear a candle, if you get your ear close enough to the flame.  It makes a kind of quiet hissing sound.  But speaking from personal experience, if your ear is close enough to hear that, your ear is too close, and it's time to rethink your short-term life choices.  Fires, matches, and almost anything else that creates heat do make sounds of some kind.  But it could be that those sounds are just caused by the air movement around the flame.  

Yes, I do know how sound works, and that it's quite different from the way light works.  When I was writing the question, I knew it was poorly worded nonsense, and not actually getting at the thing I was wondering.  So, with a fresh cup of coffee, I'll take another shot.  I guess the real question is: is the ear more sensitive to sound than the eye is to light?  Based on my understanding, I feel like people can see farther than they can hear just because there's more light around, and because it can carry through a vacuum, when sound cannot.  However, if I replaced all of the 100 watt light bulbs in my house with 100 watt speakers, and turned them up full blast, my house would be so loud I could hardly think!  Yet sighted people don't find my house overly bright, even if I turn on all the lights.  A second, related question would be, can the light from a 100 watt light bulb be seen at a larger distance than the sound from a 100 watt speaker can be heard?  But even that doesn't quite work; sound waves lose energy far quicker than light does.  But that's how I got to my silly question about the moon and stars.  I was wondering if the same amount of energy that hits your eye when you look at the moon or a star, if it hit your ear as sound, could be heard.

148,"Wow, thank you, this is a fantastic reply. You've clearly done more thinking about this subject than I have. I did indeed ignore a lot of things I thought were subtleties, such as light and color, but you're right, to a blind person it's very important to understand lighting and color, both to communicate with people and to accomplish all kinds of tasks and make important decisions, even fashion. Also that is quite true how far away objects lose visual detail just like far away sounds lose audible detail. I'm a guitarist and the comparison you made in regards to colors harmonizing and clashing much like musical chords do, thus creating certain moods, is spot on and fun to think about. That is exactly what happens with color. I now see how important it is to include all the senses, well I'm not sure about smell, when attempting to explain sightedness. I must be a good example of what it's like to take sightedness for granted, in a way, because I thought I could explain it in such a rudimentary way, when in reality sight is such a nuanced sense it would take a very long time both to explain it and to learn about it. Thanks for that perspective. Your thoughts about planets and stars making sound that people could hear, hypothetically, aren't nonsense at all, it's an interesting question. My gut instinct tells me if there was air between us and the sun, the audible sound would be delivered to our ears, at the speed of sound, but of course I'm not a scientist and have no idea what would really happen. Perhaps the sun's sound would scatter in all directions and be too quiet for us to hear once the tiny portion of sound traveling towards the earth arrived here. Interesting question.  Thanks again for answering, I think I'll spend time reading this forum and try to get a better understanding about what it's like to be blind and all the things blind people know about seeing! haha",,,,FloopingtonsGhost,,,1466562278,t5_2qpec,t3_4p6fnw,t1_d4irky5,2,1469206582,0,0,d4ivlgp,Blind,2,,,,

 If you touched it now you would be covered in wet paint, but if you were to touch it in a few weeks, when it is all safely dry, the splatters of black-green grass and the edges of the flower petals would feel smooth, you would be able to feel the vertical direction of the background, and at the bottom of the painting where it dissolves away, you would be able to feel the rivulets where the solvent cut a path through the paint and carried some of it away. The bottom of the painting  is also gritty,  covered in a fine spray of salt to give a particular texture and force the melting paint to split into a myriad of rivulets in its downward journey, like water around stones. 

The painting is dark in color, being only dimly lighter in the center. The flower petals are the brightest thing in the painting , seeming almost to glow. To me it seems like three of the last flowers to bloom at the eve of a nuclear holocaust. 

Sometimes paintings feel insanely personal.  They are this wordless expression.. Sometimes I don't even know what I am trying to say with them.

202,"Yeah I know Chinese braile is phonetic. It wouldn't be so hard to learn. It would just be confusing and annoying. It would be like learning Chinese with only pinyin. It is maddening. There are too many words that sound the same and have completely different meanings. The pictographic nature of the written system sort of locks the meaning of the different words in place. 

For example, Hua with a falling tone could mean to talk or to paint, but both of those words are written completely differently. 话 Hua to speak has a language element (or radical) and a tongue element.  画 Hua to paint has a field element in a box with a lid, but it sort of looks like a painting in a frame as the field is just a box with a cross in it and it is surrounded by another box, the frame.

 Without the pictograms every sentence becomes a sort of puzzle to try to figure out what people are saying. When I was first learning Chinese I mainly relied on pinyin (the romanized phonetic system Chinese people use for all computer based things and for Chinese names in other languages, such as Beijing or Mao). I used pinyin to text with my Chinese family and friends. It was so slow and tedious and confusing.

 For very simple things it could work. But overall, any phonetic system is going to be  an impecfect writing system for Chinese.

The main challenged faced by coverting Chinese to a phonetic system is the overwhelming amount of homophones, and it's streamlined grammar system, which compacts sentences further, making each word and each sentence crammed fun of information. Chinese books are very very thin. The longest Harry Potter looks like something you would read in third grade, just a little paper back thing.  

This can sometimes lead to Chinese mistakenly assuming that Westerners are incredibly voracious readers, as books printed in phonetic languages appear much longer than theirs. But in truth their patience for reading and expectation of story length is much greater than ours. Though, to be fair, most school aged kids don't read full Chinese classics, they just read excerpts.

228,"So, BlindNewWorlds just deleted their Reddit account entirely, after sending several messages to the mods this morning.  As they deleted their account, I can't respond to the messages privately, even if I wanted to.  Thus, I'm going to do so in public here.  This has left a supremely bad taste in my mouth, and I want it in the public record the childish and dishonest way this organization has behaved.  I'd also like to provide the community with a summary of exactly what has gone on, and why.  I did completely mishandle this as a MOD, and I want to be open and up-front about that as well.  If you don't enjoy the airing of dirty laundry, you can stop reading now.  

First of all, they obviously discovered /r/blind after the AMA done by /u/Nighthawk321.  [According to him](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/4oerdm/duscussion_of_recent_posts_by_blindnewworld/d4ctvxm), they sent him a private message attempting to highjack his AMA for PR purposes.  When that didn't work, they headed over to this sub to post.  As the account they were using was less than one day old, [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/4o2f5w/support_blindness_awareness_its_a_blindnewworld) was held for approval.  When this happens, the poster is sent a clear message explaining why the post needs to be approved, and letting them know that we'll get to it shortly.  However, I obviously wasn't fast enough for them; they sent a MOD message, asking us to ""consider letting the post go active today if you could.""  Less than an hour later, they tried to make [a second identical post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/4o78ym/support_blindness_awareness_its_a_blindnewworld), that I didn't approve, because it was an exact dupe of the first one.  When I did finally approve the first post, about 4 hours after they originally made it, they were sent a personal response, that would have landed in their Reddit messages, from me:
&gt; Approved! We got over a hundred new subscribers today, thanks to an ask reddit that hit the front page, so we're a little swamped. Sorry for the wait!


The next day, when they logged in, they would have gotten that message, and thus been clearly told that the original post was approved.  However, they decided they needed to make [a third post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/4o8lye/our_world_is_theirs_too_blindness_awareness) anyway.  They also deleted the first post, that I had approved.  Shortly after making the third post, they decided that they needed to delete it, as well.  My assumption is that it's because the discussion in the thread wasn't going their way.  After deleting all the posts they'd made, they sent some mod messages.  First:
&gt; Hello, I was hoping one of the moderators here also runs the @blindreddit twitter handle. We made a post in this subreddit yesterday, but it didn't flesh out how we wanted. So we deleted the post. However, the tweet on your twitter still links to the post and we were curious if that could potentially be deleted off twitter. Just so people aren't linking to random stuff. If you were able to get in contact with whomever could do that it would mean a lot. The specific tweet was posted yesterday and it says "" Our world is theirs too! Blindness Awareness.: Hey Reddit! We represent the BlindNewWorld movement, as sponso...""
&gt; Thanks!!


""Didn't flesh out how you wanted""? If there is some other way for me to understand that other than ""we didn't like the comments in the thread"", someone please llet me know what exactly that is.  If it really ""didn't flesh out"" how you wanted, you could have easily edited the post.  That would have also provided a more transparent way of evolving your campaign, and let the community know you were listening and taking the criticism you were offered.  

They also sent another message:
&gt; Hello again,
&gt; In addition to the last message about the Twitter handle, is there also a way to completely delete a post/thread we started, including the comments? I think I only deleted the content description, but not the actual thread. Thanks again :)


Well, from what I can tell, that just makes it absolutely clear to me why the post was deleted.  They really want that thread gone, ""including the comments"", and all links to it removed, it seems.  

Around this point, I really was getting upset by this organization, and how they were handling PR.  I also felt that it would be overstepping my bounds as a mod to complain publicly; even when I don't distinguish a post, I worry that what I say and do really can make people feel unwelcome.  So I really wanted to do my best not to show the bias I was quickly developing against BlindNewWorlds.  I thus sent a private message to /u/claudettemonet, in response to the PM she had sent me alerting me to the fact that BlindNewWorlds was deleting posts. It read, in part:
&gt; Wow, they deleted the post, yet again? I'm getting a little worried that they're intentionally controlling the discussion. If they repost the same identical post for a third time, I am going to delete it and ban them for spamming. Could you do me a huge favor? Would you mind making a self post about this, articulating your reasons for not liking the short films? You're more engaged with, and better at articulating this stuff than I am. Also, while banning them for spamming if they make a third identical post would be completely justified, it would kind of make the MODs look horrible. Some discussion from someone in the community, not controlled by these people, I think would go a long way towards making any mod action we might have to take against them easier for subscribers to understand. Plus, Reddit does pretty well in Google searches. If you make a post about your problems with the campaign, that they can't just delete, it'll show the other side of this in Google searches for all time.


I am not proud of doing that.  It's exactly the sort of back-room dealing that makes me sick when other moderators do it, promotes conspiracy theories, and divides the community.  It was a failure on my part. But I was both extremely annoyed, and really unsure of myself.  All I can say is I'm sorry, both to /u/claudettemonet for putting her in that position, and to the community for acting behind your backs.  My first ""thanks for posting!"" comment in this thread was the worst sort of astroturfing, and was just as bad as the behavior BlindNewWorlds has been engaged in.  I failed to be transparent with everyone, and I failed to trust the community developing here.  That's why I'm making this all public now, so that everyone knows exactly what happened and why.  I'd also like to make it clear that this entire issue was handled exclusively by me. No other mod was involved, and I didn't even consult them, even though I perhaps should have.  

After this thread was created, I then responded in private to BlindNewWorlds:
&gt; No, Reddit doesn't allow deleting threads. And even if it did, we wouldn't delete that one. When you present something to the blind community, you don't get to delete the thread just because you don't like the direction of the discussion, or what actual blind people have to say about the post. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but you've made two identical posts in two days. If you make another post with the exact same information, it's going to be spam. And as per our rules, we do not allow spamming here. I think you're trying to do something good, but you're doing it in all the wrong ways. Please read this post from one of our frequent, active users, and take it to heart. Maybe even consider participating in discussion with the community you're advocating for. But please, please, please don't post this a third time. I absolutely don't want to have to ban you for spamming, because I don't think that would be good for anyone.


This morning, just before deleting their account, BlindNewWorlds responded again, and I'd like to respond to those messages here.  

First message:
&gt; Hello,
&gt; Thanks for that information. With all due respect we didn't intend to post two days in a row. This account was made the same day as the first post, so it originally said the post wasn't going to posted, so we didn't realize it went through. Hence why it was posted again. Secondly, when saying 'direction' we also are not saying we don't like how the blind community reacted to it. We are grateful to learn that information on how they want blindness awareness campaigns to be different. When saying 'direction' we are saying we wanted it removed for purposes of not offending anyone further since the post wasn't written correctly. No one was planning on posting it for a third time. Thanks.


You were told via private message your first post was approved.  When you went back and deleted your first post, you would have also been able to clearly read that it had been approved.  I am absolutely unable to understand how you can claim that you didn't ""realize it went through"".  As for not planning to post a third time, you actually have posted three times; I just didn't approve one of them.  But I am glad to know you have no plans for what would, in fact, be a fourth time!  As for deleting your post so as not to offend anyone, I also find this difficult to understand.  It's quite easy to edit your post; you don't need an entire thread ""including the comments"" deleted to achieve that.  If you were worried that you had offended people, you could also have posted in the comments saying ""sorry for any offense"" or something similar.  Instead, you refused to engage with the community in any way what so ever.

It's quite easy to edit your post; you don't need an entire thread ""including the comments"" deleted to achieve that.  If you were worried that you had offended people, you could also have posted in the comments saying ""sorry for any offense"" or something similar.  Instead, you refused to engage with the community in any way what so ever.

7.21 Which phones allow recording the other party without using speakerphone (and without needing root) ?

Some Chinese manufacturers include the ability to record phone calls in the phone dialer app itself.  With other mainstream phones, it is possible to record phone calls.  We have tested these phones which record phone calls successfully with our app i.e. they record both sides of the conversation.  Some phones will work at the Default settings.  While others will require that Settings - Call Recorder - Reset Call Recorder are set to the Samsung E7 type, or another setting there.

Reset Call Recorder set to Default type:

- AndroidOne running Android 6.0 Marshmallow

- Samsung Galaxy Note 4 running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop

- Samsung Galaxy SIII Mini running Android 4.2.2

- Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini (SM-G800F) running Android 4.4.2

- Samsung Galaxy S7 (heroqlteatt) running Android 6.0

- LG G3 running Android 5.0 Lollipop

- Lenovo A6000 running Android 4.4 Kit Kat

- Qmobile Noir A290 running Android 4.4 Kit Kat


Reset Call Recorder set to Samsung E7 type:

- Samsung Galaxy E7 (SM-E700F) running Kit Kat.

- Sony Xperia Z3 Dual (D6633) running Android 5.1

Reset Call Recorder set to Nexus type (uses speakerphone but in a way which does not disturb phone call):

- Nexus 4

- Nexus 5

- Nexus 6P

Reset Call Recorder set to Moto G pre-6.0 (uses speakerphone but in a way which does not disturb phone call):

- Moto G 2nd Gen running Android 5.0 (or versions below 6.0)

- Moto G and Moto X phones

Reset Call Recorder set to Moto G 6.0 type:

- Moto G 2nd Gen running Android 6.0 Marshmallow

- Moto G and Moto X phones


Suggestion for the Samsung Galaxy E7:

click Settings - Call Recorder - Reset Call Recorder - and select the Samsung E7 type.  This will change Audio Source for Call from the default setting (System Default) to Voice Call - this gives a much better balance between the local and the other party's voice on the Samsung Galaxy E7.

I'm totally blind, and I have more entertainment options than I could ever consume, even if I spent 24 hours a day listening to things, without ever eating or sleeping.  

To get back on topic, I'll look forward to the let's play!  I agree that bad players can be more interesting.  What I meant by a ""let's play that doesn't suck"" is that every let's player I can find speaks over the excelent voice work in that game, and it makes me sad.  The Portal games are the only games I've ever heard where the voice acting wasn't deeply, deeply substandard.  Most games the voices just feel rushed or poor quality, like the developers only really cared about the visuals anyway, and good voice acting came in as an extremely low priority on the todo list.

Edit to add: well, the radio and commercials in GTA are a second game where the voice acting is OK.  But it isn't nearly good enough to get on actual radio or TV.  It's just ""good for a game"".  Portal does a job that's miles better.","[{'start': 494, 'end': 502, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 211, 'end': 216, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

292,"I hardly belong here but thought I'd throw in my two cents in case it helps lol I have lower vision in my dominant right eye due to retinal detachment and scleral buckle surgery to correct it. Bad vision to begin with plus uneven double vision (helped with a prism) and poor fine detail vision resulting in depth perception issues and better vision peripherally. I find the best way to deal with depth perception is to understand what the distance means to you; for example I see a car a certain distance from me and I know the distance because I've see it before (like if I'm at a certain sign and the car is at a certain sign). Does tha make sense? When driving, I tend to err on the side of caution and give myself more room than I used to before the surgery. If I'm with someone I have them help me out confirming if I have room to do the action I need to. I quadruple check every move. Also, flickering or flashing lights can throw you off, exits are sometimes sudden, and parking can be tricky. If I'm not sure I can make it, I wait. It sucks because making left handed turns is really anxiety inducing sometimes but way better to wait than get into an accident lol Also, watch out for headaches from focusing more and making your eyes work harder than normal.

322,"&gt;I guess the real question is: is the ear more sensitive to sound than the eye is to light?

this is an interesting question, but i'm no biologist so i'm not equipped to answer it, maybe you can ask it in /r/askscience 

&gt; But I suspect that light bulb wattage and speaker wattage can't quite be interchanged the way I'm doing.

although wattage means the same in both cases, you are correct that they have very different outcomes.  this is due to the fact that their method of energy transmission is different.  for example a person with a sledgehammer can thoroughly destroy a wooden shed in a couple of hours, this person might only be outputting a few hundred watts.  however a high power radio tower outputting tens of thousands of watts couldn't even move a wooden crate even if you directed all of the radio waves towards it.

this happens because of the kind of energy you're transmitting is different.  a person doing work converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, while a radio tower converts electrical energy to photons, which are massless and carry very little momentum.  the energy is stored within the photons themselves since they are pure energy.

the comparison is similar if you replace the person hammering with a speaker. ",,,,wadss,,,1466617872,t5_2qpec,t3_4p6fnw,t1_d4j990f,3,1469219980,0,0,d4jnokj,Blind,3,,,,

This is a MUSH, or a MUD. I'm pretty new to the genre myself, but basically it is an MMORPG that is played completely with text. It is played by sighted and VI people, and it is completely usable with NVDA.
It is high fantasy, so it is very similar to D&amp;D..... Hey, D&amp;D.
It isn't video games, but if you or your friend are into D&amp;D, that is a totally freeing way to explore and be creative in a world, like these high-budget next-gen video games.
I know it's not for everyone, but I'd love to talk about Materia Magica, D&amp;D with blind people, or any of these other fantastic suggestions here. MM is only one of literally thousands of text-based adventure games, single or multi-player.

330,"Well.  I mean.  

I'm glad that you prefaced all of the happy thoughts with all of the terrible ones, because my annoyance and general rage was able to dissipate the further down that I read.  

By all of this, I mean that I was probably so annoyed at reading the beginning of the post because it was coming across as a pity-party, and I just... couldn't handle that, because I've been there, you know? I've had to deal with not getting my homework for the entire semester until 2 months late, and having to work through it obsessively to catch up. I remember the sleepless nights, the inability to eat, the fucking horrific emotional instability and break-outs and losing of hair. While I can sympathize to the nth degree though, self-pity just doesn't help anyone ever, you know?  

So then when I saw that you were actually doing something to circumvent these issues, it made me a lot happier! Congratulations on making the infamous list - that's a great accomplishment! It sounds like you were able to be innovative and help yourself despite the different obstacles that were in your way, and that's always a great thing.  

Now for general thoughts:  
Haha, the bit about seeing the world in a different way kind of made me laugh. University wasn't such a life-changing experience for me, but--and correct me if I'm wrong--I'm getting the impression that your decrease in sight was a recent thing? You probably haven't had the amount of time to become as cynical and realistic as I have, I imagine. That is to say, your comment about people not helping you while you were in obvious distress, totally not surprising to me. While people aren't inherently awful, they are generally self-serving/self-involved - why would they even feel the need to help you, really? Life is hard, and stressful, and obnoxious, and people can be so self-absorbed and oblivious... though take my words with a grain of salt. I'm cynical, as I said above, and I'm not consumed by bitterness enough to not be able to realize that there are some great people out there - props to them!  

Did you attend college in backwoods nowhere, Alabama? In the experience that I've had - and just from talking to other people in this situation - I've found that the more isolated your college is, the harder it is to deal with things of this nature. That isn't to say that university is smooth sailing, however; the issue with my homework being all amounts of inaccessible is a testament to that. I hear about experiences like yours though, and while facepalming relentlessly, come to the decision that mine could've been so much worse than it was. My professors were generally helpful in of themselves; it was more the general clunkiness of our OSD department that made things harder for everyone involved. They have like 300+ kids involved in the one here though, so I understand somewhat.  

Textbooks: nothing new here. I was surprised by the seemingly awkward way of how this process was accomplished, but naw, this is normal. I recommend trying to get your list to the OSD as soon as possible so that you don't have to spend your first weeks flailing helplessly over the abyss. I also understand that some professors don't make that information available until the first day though, which makes it hard to find a middle ground. Just one of those things you have to deal with, I'm afraid.  

God damn. That ending though. I love it. So empowering, so sweet, and despite all of the crap that you had to go through, this gives me the impression that this whole situation must have been a total life-changer for you, and I'm happy for you because of that! Props on finding helpful people, on being innovative, on helping yourself and taking initiative, and on powering through! The end-result is always so awarding, imo.

For example if I dream that I'm on a beach, I might hear the ocean, I might smell the salt water, feel the sand and the sun. I don't see anything just like in real life I don't see anything. Put another way, I experience things in dreams the same way I experience them in real life. The brain doesn't substitute something for the missing visual just like in life how nothing's substituted either.

365,"I think it's just a little oversimplified.  In fact, this was exactly how I used to think about sight when I was a child.  Unfortunately, that system was too simple to be useful.  It doesn't really take into account some of the most important things to remember about sight, and thus isn't useful when interacting with sighted people.

First of all, it doesn't take into account light level, or the type of light.  Objects viewed in sunlight look quite different from the same object viewed in moonlight, or harsh hospital light.  This is important for a few reasons.  Most obviously, it's important to remember to think about lighting when asking a sighted person to look at something.  Even to this day, I will sometimes ask a sighted person to, for example, identify the inputs on the back of my stereo, when I don't have a flashlight anywhere near at hand, and there is just no way the room lights are going to light up the wires back there in the corner.  Then I have to waste someone else's time while I spend 15 minutes scrambling to find a flashlight or some other light source.  Less obviously, where you're going and what you're doing can effect what colours of clothes you might want to wear.  If you're traveling at night, for example, you want to make sure to dress in bright colours, and have something reflective on you, so cars will see you coming.  But if you're traveling to a TV station to be interviewed on camera, this is probably exactly what you don't want to do.  Teaching blind children about sight using your explaination wouldn't allow them to get to grips with just how important brightness and type of light can be.  

Second of all, you really don't talk about colour at all.  And that's a huge oversight.  Knowing the primary colours, how to match colours, what colours are associated with what moods, etc, are hugely important if you can't see.  While a lot of that stuff would just come naturally to sighted people, for those born blind, they're just a set of rules that we have to memorize.  And we *do* have to know them, if we ever want to make our own fassion decisions, decide what colour of sofa we want to buy, or paint the bedroom walls a reasonable colour.  If we want to live an indipendant life, and make a decent impression on the sighted folks around us, we must do all of those things.  

Thirdly, you've missed out on perspective entirely.  It still strikes me as odd that far away objects look small.  But never the less, it's a thing I need to know.  When asking a sighted person to guess at the size of something, it's useful to know how they make that judgement (by using other objects for scale, etc).  

Fourthly, you've left out a lot of other important information about sight.  Obviously, people can't see behind them, unless they turn their head to look.  But when you're 3 or 4 years old, and can't actually see people turning their heads to look behind them, that isn't so obvious at all.  It's important for someone born blind to have at least a passing understanding of things like peripheral vision, blind spots, what degree of vision most people have, how far away they can see objects, and how the details they can make out change for far away objects.  

If I had to explain sight to a child born blind, and keep in mind I was born blind myself so this probably isn't something I should ever do (but it's the Internet, and everyone on the internet is always wrong all the time anyway), I'd probably make a comparison with sound.  Colours are sort of like notes.  Just like notes, some colours have names, but those names are just markers on a continuous scale of colour, that goes from black at the bottom, to white at the top.  And just like cords of notes, particular colours go together and harmonize well, while others do not.  Also like cords, different combinations of colour evoke different moods in viewers.  When we hear far away sounds, they sound quieter; never the less, we can usually tell the difference between a sound that's far away, and a close sound that's just quiet.  Similarly, far away objects look small, but other clues can help people tell the difference between a far away object, and a small object that's close.  Also, far away sounds are much less detailed than close ones, in the same way far away objects can seem less detailed than close ones.  Although people can see much farther than they can hear...I'm not sure exactly how much farther, but people can see airplanes even when the sound of the airplane doesn't reach the ground.  But the main differences between hearing and seeing are: light is required to see objects, an object doesn't have to be making sound to be seen, and it's possible to look away from things.  You can't just not hear something by turning your ears away from it in the same way you can just not look at something.  Similarly, we can hear things going on behind us almost as well as we can hear things going on in front of us, but to see something behind them, a sighted person must happen to be looking that way.  The fact that eyes must focus on what they're looking at in a way that ears don't is also the thing that makes almost all stage magic possible.  I'm not sure it would be possible to perform an audible magic trick, or a trick that relied entirely on any other sense like touch.  

IMHO that would get the basics across much better than an explaination that relies on the sense of touch.  And as the child grows up in an entirely sighted world, that would quickly get refined into a more nuanced understanding.  

Edit: and now I'm wondering about an almost unrelated question.  Assuming there was air between the earth and the moon to carry sound vibrations, and that the moon was putting out as much audible energy as the energy currently contained in the light it reflects, could we hear the moon?  What about other planets? Stars?  I'm pretty sure we could hear the sun; we can feel the energy it's putting out.  This may have been the most useless nonsense I've ever wondered.

If you have and then went blind, typically uou can still see in you dreams (but not awake). Or in theory.
In practice: not always so. If you saw before and life went blurry towards blindness, your dreams go blurry. If you learn braille (or fremch or asl or anything similar), surprise... You'll read braille in your dreams while things are blurry , light/dark, no light perception at all etc.
You can't perceive more in dreams than you were able to awake.

My dreams are at best blur. Sometimes very vivid but not even light perception (so worse than dIly life). I've read braille in my dreams, and my nightmares have kncluded crossing big roads, getting lost in buildings, having nightmare bathrooms etc. i've had realistic blind dreams where i felt like i slept in a different bed. Ghe bed felt completely different...
I've read stuff in mh dreams online, with voiceover etc. Usually its easy tl figure when I'm awake, but soemtimes it also means checking what i typed or posted before i fell asleep.

460,"I watched the couple with bird drumming and making bacon ad. I like it. It's clever. 

It's weird in comparison with the BlindNewWorld ad, bacause it almost feels like it is tackling an entirely different issue. However,  the reality is that it is still about awareness and accessibility.  It is highlighting something that is a real challenge blind people face and presenting it in a thoughtful, novel way that catches the audience off gaurd a bit and makes them think about it, thereby accomplishing the task of raising awareness and showing the need for increased accessibility at the same time.

461,"I'm so glad you guys said something!!! These posts were bugging me, but as a newb to all this and still sighted to boot, I didn't want to say anything. Or at least not the first to say something.  I didn't really like the videos either. They seemed heavy handed. Maybe thats fine and the overall message is good, but I also feel like is setting up a preconception of what people think about blind people by doing so, which might not actually be that true. I feel like before I got my diagnosis I just didn't know that much about blind people. I didn't think about blind people or being blind that much at all because I didn't know anyone personally. I didn't pitty them when I saw them, but the video seems to say that that is the norm. Now when I see blind people I am cumpulsively curious and desperate to talk to them because I am new at this and would love some help along the way and a friend I can talk to in person. You guys are still the only blind people I know! I know I need to work on that. But having you guys has been invaluable.  I can  not tell you how much it has helped me to have you all here these past few months.

When I first started thinking about blindness I didn't make assumptions about what blind people can do, but I did and still do, have serious doubts about my own limitations and ability to adapt to the world without my sight. In one of my firat posts I mentioned my fears about having kids blind. I know blind people have kids. I was worried about MY ability to be blind and raise kids. I didn't end up clarifying this when people got a bit huffy because other people stepped in to inform us all that CPS takes kids from blind parents at a higher rate than they do sighted parents.. which totally freaked me out more and I didn't feel up to replying to those particular tangents at all.. (also genetics was part of the initial concern)

Anyway, the point is, I just didn't know much of anything and am still learning. It wasn't like I was full of all these preconceptions I just had no conceptions. It is like what totally blind people see. Nothing. Not black or white or gray. Not a color or anything at all.  Or to put it another way, like what sighted people see beyond their periphery: nothing.

When I am blind I don't want to run around thinking people are pitying me and that this is some crusade to change the bigotry of the sighted world! That seems like a horrible schema to be operating from and it won't do me any good. 

When I am blind (and even now) I want to think of the experiencnof being a blind/vi person as being similar to being a foreigner living in China. Chinese people might  treat you differently or act strange around you. But it was not because they had all these preconceived notions or were racist or bigoted in any way, they may have simply never met a foreigner before. 

One of my best friends from China is a guy from Zimbabwe.  Very tall, black man. Chinese people would jump around him all the time. He would be standing behind them in line at the store or next to them on the subway and they would realize he was there all of a sudden and jump. They had never seen a black person before. They weren't expecting to see one at that moment. This guy was great about it.  He never assumed it was bigotry or racism on their part. He never got upset or even irritated. If he had chosen to operate from the schema that the Chinese people were racist and bigoted on the whole it would have driven him crazy. I knew expats in China who did operate from that schema. It made them bitter and angry and ugly people to be around.

I would rather operate from the schema that people just don't know what they don't know and that almost all of them are open to learning something new.  I have actual blindspots and what I see there is nothing. I don't want to go making assumptions about other people's metaphorical blindspots, because the thing that is most likely there is nothing. 

Tldr:  I didn't want to be the first to say it, and am so glad other people piped up.. I  also don't like the patronizing tone of the post and take further issue with the underlying schema they set up in the videos.

489,"&gt; This may have been the most useless nonsense I've ever wondered.

sound is simply the air molecules getting knocked around in an organized fashion by something.  if nothing knocks around the air, then there is no sound.

the thing is, the moon or any other celestial object doesn't vibrate like the surface of a drum would.  a drum surface is elastic, so if you hit it it vibrates back and forth, the moon isnt.  so even if there was air, it wouldn't vibrate, and we certainly wouldn't be able to hear it.  if you held up a candle, you can feel the heat, but you can't really hear it, just because something radiates energy of some form doesn't mean it can be translated to be explained via sound.

an interesting note though, even though there isn't much of it, the universe is filled with gasses, mostly hydrogen.  and under certain conditions, those gasses flow, condense, and form shockwaves just like air does on earth like wind, fog, or a sonic boom.  a great deal of astronomy is trying to understand how these gasses behave in bulk.  so while *technically* you can have sound in space, it isn't something audible unless you manipulate it with a computer at which point it isn't really genuine anymore.",,,,wadss,,,1466592175,t5_2qpec,t3_4p6fnw,t1_d4irky5,3,1469212328,0,0,d4j7m6b,Blind,3,,,,

512,"Fastfinge!!! I love this!  For the most part you are dead on. The difference between the distance of  sound and sight is truly staggering though. The horizon is the edge of what a sighted person can see during the day time. The horizon is merely the line past which the earth is curving away from you and the land beyond the horizon is in fact below that horizon line. How far out to the horizon you can see depends on how high up you are. If, for example, you were swimming in a perfectly calm ocean, the horizon line you would see would only be about a mile away from you, base on the fact that your eye level is only several inches above the water, or the surface of the earth.  If, however, you were standing next to the ocean and looking out across it, you would be able to see about 3 miles out. The higher you get the greater the diameter of the area of the earth that you can see.

 This is why many sighted people enjoy high places, because it allows them to see a much larger swath of the earth. Some people find this experience beautiful, but it is also strategically advantageous and part of the reason high ground is sought in battle situations. It is also easier to fight downhill,with gravity, than against gravity, but the sight advantage can not be discounted. 

If you were to go even higher, to the point where you are not so much high above the earth, but far away from it, you would be able to see one entire half of the earth. You wouldn't see the other half for the same reason you can not see beyond the horizon line normally. The curve of the Earth obscures it. In  the same way that if you were sprayed with a hose by a pesky sibling in the summertime, your body would obscure part of the spray and you clothes would only be wet on the spray side. The farthest away thing we see during the day is actually the sun.. as the sun is 93 million miles away.

However,  at night, with the absence of the sun and the reassuring blue haze of our nitrogen atmosphere, we can see much much farther. We can see through the atmosphere to the great, cold dark void of space. Light and invisible energy is traveling through that space, but until the light hits something we don't see it. For example the moon is only bright because it is reflecting the light of the sun. Without a moon, there would be no reflected light at night. However, even without the moon there are still stars.  Which we see because their light is hitting the back of our retinas. The closest star, beside the sun, is a little over 25 billion miles away. Most stars are much farther. The distance is actually so far that some of the  light we see from those distant stars actually left that star hundreds of thousands of years ago. In fact, many of those stars may have already ceased to exist, but we wouldn't even know for another  several hundred years. 

Yet as I mentioned before, light is not the only energy travelling through the void. With the correct equipment you can actually hear the other energu waves.  So you don't need to fill space with air to hear the cosmos. There are lots of observatories you could go to right now to listen to the stars.

No clue if it can do usual audiobooks or eg NLS books.

I prefer human-narrated audiobooks where i can set the speed. Overdrive (used by many libraries including RNIB) is easy to use but only does 2x max speed of audio.
I usually prefer faster (1,75-2,5x, sometimes faster, depends on book, reader, and how awake or sleepy i am).
Braille books would be nice but i don't have a refreshable display (too expensive) yet. Also i'm a lot slower as a braille reader - so audio does perfect now. It's got a learning curve for faster speeds, and it's got its limitations (can't learn spelling, need to have good hearing and headphones, can't read in loud environments such as often in buses etc).
My city (regular) library uses overdrive, but i also have access to other formats (things like nls or learning ally).

I don't mind also machine-read books. So if I can't get an audiobook of something, a pdf or regular ebook can do. VoiceDream is pretty nice as a reader, but meed to find a voice you like. Human voices are generally so much nicer.

Considering your TV will be really close to you, a 32 inch TV is big enough. As for the difference between 720p and 1080p, it relates to the numbers of pixels shown on screen. The higher it is, the clearer the image will be, but the difference is almost unnoticable to a normal-sightest person when the TV is 32 inch. 

A thing worth noting, most 32 inch TV are 720p because the difference to an 1080p TV is too small to notice, so most of TV manifacturer do not bother making their 32 inch TV as 1080p.

537,"Hi there!

&gt; even when i narrate them

It sounds like your friend may have a great time with text quests then. Probably you together will need to investigate what is the best way to use screen reader with them, but I believe this certainly is worth trying.

Of course you'd better try it first yourself. Most of them have many versions / implementations so you'll need to find out which is more suitable for your purpose.

There are two drawbacks I anticipate:

- probably it is hard to skip unnecessary text when using games with screen reader, but some games allow choose between ""short"" and ""verbose"" mode;
- sometimes the player may want to write down some game info (instead of keeping all in his memory) - but probably this could be achieved by alt-tab switching to notepad and making notes there which could be read later (or perhaps you know better apps).

To start try [Colossal Cave (online version)](http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire/exclusives/colossal-cave-adventure) which is the classic of the genre

Or [Zork-1 (also online version)](http://www.web-adventures.org/cgi-bin/webfrotz?s=ZorkDungeon) - it also has 2 and 3 parts but I failed to solve them :)

If you'll succeed with this idea, it would be great to hear your opinion!

I suspect that games of other types than quest (logic and perhaps even arcade) should exist for your case. Perhaps we can find some or even create some... If you have some comparatively simple idea - please share it. Perhaps we can plug in our coding skills :)

I think of colors being like flavors (taste... I sort of have synesthesia with taste and color perception). 
Some tastes are light, fresh, bubbly, others spicy and exotic. Colors kind of can be something like that, but they are also very personal. Everyone seeing colors probably sees them different, just like our tastebuds differ, then just learns that what sky looks like is called blue, what grass looks like is green, even if you are colorblind/color deficient.
Also some colors go together in some cultures, not in others. 
Color psychology is very culture dependent too. Some cultures love xome colors and see them positive, others don't.
And a lot depends on the amount and type of light. In the dark there's less color perception (or none, depends probably on light).
Color blindness is also surprisely common, 1/12 of sighted guys and 1/200 of ladies have some form of it. So what is blue, red, green etc depends also on your cones.

Having been able to see at some point can make it difficult too.
What does a normal field of vision look like? Did i ever have that?
I remember my surprise being able to see the ground when i got my first glasses. No more having to stay on the middle of the path (blur, color) because on the edge there would be often something that would make you fall or stumble.
Also how close or far do normals see? No clue.
I hear a plane, then use an app to figure what kind of plane flies over me... Otherwise not a chance i'd randomly look at the sky and just happen to see something I don't hear.
Facial expressions and body language... Are probably natural for most sighted folks. I learned to interpret and use those from books as a kid. I'm always amazed with described movies that the feelings etc are described, as even if  i had the biggest screen ever I don't think i'd ever have been able to interpret from someone's face their inner cues. (I know still what a smile looks like, but have to rely only on voice in interpreting a smile's genuinety). So it's like magic having that now available for voice.
