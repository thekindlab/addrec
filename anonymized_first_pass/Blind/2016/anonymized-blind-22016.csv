Speaking of madness, the following is how VoiceOver reads a hello world in C++ in the highest punctuation setting:

Number include less iostream greater new-line new-line int main left-paren right-paren left-brace new-line tab std colon colon cout less less quote Hello World exclaim quote less less std colon colon endl semicolon new-line tab return 0 semicolon new-line right-brace new-line.

White-space is only ignored by screen-readers by default.  You can turn on indenting while programming, and then the screen-reader can read the indentation level (""level 1"" or ""level 2"" and so-on) at the start of each line.  A lot of blind folks like it, because it saves counting braces to figure out what's going on at any particular spot in the code.

97,"I've played a few MUDs over the years and they are definitely what gave me the idea. One of the problems with MUDs is that they still have graphical elements that are a required part of gameplay. The games I mentioned are graphical games that are considered very open world. I want to be able to give that same experience to the non-sighted.

The thing that gave me the idea was playing a MUD and I had to go trade with someone. The MUD had an integrated map interface and so I was just hanging around the town waiting for someone to come talk to me as they should be able to see me on the map. He couldn't find me and so I said something along the lines of, ""Dude, just use the map, I'm right outside the town."" I felt awful when it turned out the guy I was coming to trade with played via screen reader and he couldn't use the in-game map.

I was planning to do single player as it means that player reaction speed and similar isn't an issue.

The ones you've linked still seem to have a lot of graphical elements in their interfaces and that's something I want to strip out. Instead of saying stats and getting numeric values delineated by spaces and colons, it'd be a full text based explanation.

119,"Do you mind if I ask where you're located? Because I'm a much less confident traveler than you, though I do get around just fine most of the time, and I never run into this. I have absolutely 0 tolerance for this bullshit and anyone who grabs me without warning can expect to be elbowed in the gut. If you don't want to be treated like a mugger, don't act like one.

Also, to OP: You handled this really well. I would say the three worst things are unwanted relocation (worded awkwardly so as not to be confused with unwanted physical contact), condescension, and screaming out random directions from the other side of the street. The latter is not only downright obnoxious, but can lead to some (potentially fatal) distractions, and is just never OK unless you see a blind person about to walk DIRECTLY into oncoming traffic.

To the other sighted people reading this, yes. I could spend an entire day creating posts on this subreddit about how downright rude sighted people can be. I know the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and all that other nonsense, but I refuse to give someone a free pass for being an idiot just because they think they're being helpful, particularly if it actually disrupts what I'm doing (E.G. shoving me onto the wrong train car, or forcibly turning me in the wrong direction). There are some genuinely wonderful people in this world, and sadly, those are probably the ones that hesitate the most, so many of my experiences involve the pushy types.

134,"Vocational Rehabilitation is supposed to help, but it's debatable whether or not they actually try. They only get funding if they have clients, and if they actually help people through the system, they won't have as many. Either way, they'll hook him up with a company who will help him find work. It might take years, but it has been known to help.

Personally, I would help him find a way to make his own money. I like to find a good deal on used items and resell them. If he has some start up cash, a couple hundred bucks, he can sell weed. He just needs to buy an ounce or two, depending on if he knows someone who can get that for him, and break it in to smaller bags which average stoners will buy for marked up prices thereby giving your friend a profit.  No, I'm not joking. Weed sells like pussy at a naval port, and you don't have to risk your life to sell it. You know people who smoke, and their friends smoke. Plus, you'll meet more people who smoke. Once you know they're cool, just tell em you have some, and boom, instant customer.

It depends on what your friend is good at, but there is some kind of self employment he could make some money at. He might not make enough to get by on that alone, but it will likely help. My guess is that he gets disability right now, but that isn't enough to pay his bills, and that's why it's better that he find work.

There are jobs such as independent freight agent or real estate agent where you work as an independent contractor, and it is easier for blind people to break in to the business, because you have more freedom to do it your way.

The problem with jobs is that they have a set job description. Your friend can likely do most of the things required of him, but there will be one thing that gets in the way. Other than negotiate some kind of deal where another employee does that work while your friend does some of that person's job, or simply making minor changes to the job description, we call that job-carving, they say, ""I'm sorry, company polasy says, bla bla bla,"" so you don't get the job.

Plus, sightedpeople, especially with discrimination law suits and strict rules about what you can ask a prospective employee, don't quite know how to have a conversation with a blind person. If he is anything like me, he is very approachable about the subject, but of course, the employer doesn't know that. Plus, they've often never heard all about what technology is available to help your friend function like a sighted person.

They have generally heard that something is out there, that computers can talk, but they don't know the details. Your blind friend will have to explain it to them, maybe even demonstrate.

Even then, the employer will have concerns. We don't use the same software programs this guy has, will his software work with our computers? Can he do the job fast enough? Aside from adapting to his blindness, is this guy an overall good employee? Does he know how to interact with sighted customers?

The employer has to take a chance on this guy when he has a pile of applications from people who he doesn't need to wonder about. He knows they can do the job, he/or/she just needs to decide which one best fits the position, so your blind friend finds himself being left out. It sucks, but there's only so much that can be done.

His best friend at this point is someone who is willing to give him a chance or someone who already knows him. I got a job once, because my uncle knew the higher ups. To be honest, that's how a lot of people get jobs. Instead of going through the classifieds, they go through their own personal network. Either way, the folks at this company trusted my uncle, so they gave me a shot, and I wound up getting a job. I left because of personal reasons, but if that hadn't happened, I'd still be working there and not looking for a job now.

I guess, after reading this wall of text, sorry about that, you can see about your own workplace. Be open to the idea of your blind friend doing all kinds of jobs. If your current employer is hiring, ask your friend if he might be able to do the job they need. If not, ask why. He might've just never done that before. Maybe, some training will help him and boost his confidence. The same is true if you have friends or family with authority at any company.

He needs to remember that right now, he might not be able to have the job he wants, but if he takes what he can get, what he wants may come along in the future.",,,,simpleman84,,,1455607026,t5_2qpec,t3_45cnow,t3_45cnow,2,1458529457,0,0,d01oa4r,Blind,2,,,,
135,"I used to drive from age 16 up until a couple of years ago at age 34, with one eye.  To be honest, having no depth perception makes us no different from anyone else on the road.  My right eye was the bad one, so I'd compensate by adjusting and using the passenger side mirror in addition to over-the-shoulder checks before merging back into the right lane.

Also, practice practice practice!  I wouldn't have gained so much confidence in my own driving if it hadn't been for my female classmate calling me up and asking me to give her a ride to this house or that house.  Bonus points for letting her take the wheel so she could get her own practice in.  It turned out that she wasn't really my friend and was just using me as a taxi cab because she knew I had no friends and wouldn't say no, but at least I gained enough experience in driving to pick up some tips and tricks.  For example, always leaving a large gap between my own car and the vehicle in front of me and not caring if someone cuts in.  I was also that annoying prick who drove at exactly the speed limit in the right lane, simply because I didn't want to have to go through the whole check-the-mirror-then-over-my-shoulder routine, in addition to giving myself ample time to brake if a problem arose.  There was even an intersection on one of my commutes where the left turning lights were much dimmer than the standard through-way ones, so I simply handled it by making a right at the next stop followed by two more rights around the block so I could safely ""make the turn"" without incident.  Better to lose ten minutes to a detour than ten months to an idiotic wreck.

He may also feel like he is losing his independence, so in that case I would recommend letting him do things he is confident at without offering help, if he is comfortable with that.

They do not provide advocacy or mediation between your friend and his employer should he experience any sort of work discrimination.

As a matter of fact, I've reached out onto reddit over a year ago with a situation regarding two co-workers making a show out of exhibiting discomfort whenever I was around, i.e. brightly warming up to everyone who says ""Good morning!"" to them except for me, going around collecting lunch orders for the food truck from everyone except for me, et cetera.  Despite the many suggestions and helpful responses I've received, it was obvious that the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation does not provide advocacy to their clients once employment has been secured; neither does Social Security's Return to Work program.  Job Assistance Network was a ghetto call center where the lady said she'd e-mail me pertinent info and hung up before I could give her my e-mail address.

As a result, I was too anxious to continue working in late 2014 and went homeless for a while as a result, had to reapply for disability all over again.  Got reapproved but have to pay off overpayments for my attempt at establishing a stable financial foundation for myself and my future, so my monthly check is $425, half of what it should be.  Recently found someone very understanding who was willing to take my disability money in exchange for a room to rent last November, but I'm still suffering until my overpayment is balanced out in January of 2018.  Oh, and also I did try to contact Free Legal Aid about appealing the overpayment garnishment of my benefits -- they dragged their feet and dropped the ball on providing me with a representative to speak for me at the social security hearing.  So I'm being punished for the next couple of years because I had to learn my lesson the hard way that I'm forever a social liability.

Not to be such a downer.  I just wanted to give you a heads' up so your friend doesn't have any above-and-beyond expectations about work resources for the blind based on my own extensive experiences.  It's just that:  Work resources.  The most generous thing he'll get is free paratransit access to his job training programs, and maybe a free pair of prescription sunglasses.  He'll have to provide his own cane and tips, though.  I highly recommend he learn from my mistakes and take the following two steps that I am currently executing:  1.  Get a disability rights attorney on retainer, and 2.  Document literally every little thing.  Vocational rehab and your friend's employers have no more stake in his work ethic other than his caseworker bribing your buddy's potential boss with a fat check to reimburse them for training.

173,"In the case of signs, you're right that they're often not helpful in an entirely new building.  However, if it's a building or campus I'm already familiar with, they do help a lot.  That's because in most large buildings and university campuses, the signs are almost always in the same place.  So if I'm familiar with where the signs are on my usual floor, I can now use them to navigate all the other floors I don't visit as often.  And in the case of bathrooms, the sign is almost always directly on the door itself, or right beside it.  And it's worth spending 30 seconds groping around to make sure I don't walk into the wrong bathroom!  

Although I'll never forget the least useful Braille I ever encountered.  It was in an elevator of an office building.  Unlike most elevators, this one didn't use proper buttons. Instead, it used some kind of touch-sensitive system.  So instead of having to press the button, touching it was enough to select that floor.  No, I don't understand why!  The geniuses who designed this system also, for reasons known only to themselves, put the Braille right on top of the button!  So touching the braille, to read it, would select that floor.  Needless to say, every time I got on the elevators there, it was stopping at every single floor.

194,"I was born with an open angle glaucoma that destroyed my optic nerve on the left side when I was around 4 and oh the right side when I was 31 (I'm 33).  I haven't seen a physician since I went blind because I don't feel any pain or discomfort, and I stop putting in eyedrops because it's just pointless now.  I can still perceive light but I don't care about preserving it; it will eventually fade to complete darkness.

In my case doctors failed to  diagnose my optic atrophy  before it was too late because they couldn't see the back of my eye (my pupils don't dilate).  My complaints of loss of contrast and color perception were all attributed to a cataract that they didn't want to remove before I was completely blind because it was the only remaining eye with vision and the surgery could go wrong.  It turned out that my intra-ocular pressure was OK during the day but peaked at night.

I wish I had been told about rehab before going blind because I believe that I would have assimilated everything better if I could still see.

I use a white cane to go outside alone (which I rarely do) and VoiceOver in OS X and iOS to read me the contents of the screen.  Before going blind there was a period in which I gradually lost color and contrast perception as well as visual acuity.  During this period I used the inverted colors, contrast, and zoom accessibility options in OS X and iOS, and a scanner to read from paper.

First thing he needs to do is contact the local Department of Social Services Rehab Services for the Blind (Or something along those lines, every place has a slightly different name).  This is the number 1 resource available to your friend.

He may also be able to get the funds to go back to school depending on his situation and the agency he works with.  They may also be able to set him up with a temporary pension while he gets things sorted out.  The key advantage here is that the caseworker will work to create a plan that has actionable steps to employment and independence and then will provide the necessary resources to execute said plan.  This is the most valuable resource he has.

The next thing you should do is look for local non-profits.  They often go by names like Society for the Blind and Visually Impaired or Lighthouse for the Blind.

This understanding of being visually impaired vs. totally blind (no light perception at all or only minimal) seems to stump most medical professionals and cause them to assume that patients may be exaggerating their vision difficulties.

246,"As an author who has written stories his whole life, as a writer who has written poetry for mobil apps that have been published through those apps and independantly, and as some who used to be sighted I can honestly tell you a very biased opinion.
One of the most difficult struggles I face as an author is killing the mood, tone, and flow of a book by over describing the details, traits, and landscapes. I've come to realise that the reason for this is because I miss having my sight. And as someone who does have a subscription to audible I can tell you that I do enjoy the fact that really good writers have a knack for giving exactly the perfect amount of detail without the tale becoming oversaturated with things that are better left out of the flow. 
Most, if not all blind or limited vision readers know what an apple is. There is no real need to spend more than a single sentence describing it. 
Now, that being written, There is however a need, almost a duty in my low-valued opinion, a need, a strong need, to describe enviroments. Both physical landscapes and emotional enviroments that set tenor and moods. 
The real answer to your question will honestly depend on the reader. I have plenty of blind friends who I don't think have ever read or listened a book in the whole of their lives. I have some friends who have, and can't detest the 140 page book with over half of it detail to the nth degree. Then, there are those few, who find it perfect detailing. Painting that verbal landscape in their minds and help them forget their day to day struggles and tribulations. 
""I"" myself, being a writer, wouldn't write a book to satisfy solely the blind and visually impared. Instead, I would try to craft a novel that seeks to appeal to as many readers who like that genre as I could possibly could. 
I hoped, if nothing else, you can maybe get a better understanding to this important fact. No matter how much detail is in a book, there are those who will say that it isn't enough. And there will be just as many who bemoan how much they had to trudge through, uphill, both ways, ten miles to school, in the rain adn snow to finish your book. 
For most, nothing is ever perfect, and for few, nothing is ever good enough.",,,,romanj35,,,1456213368,t5_2qpec,t3_474shk,t3_474shk,5,1458679942,0,0,d0adf1w,Blind,5,,,,

254,"In the case of Alter Aeon, check out [mush-z](http://mush-z.com).  It replaces a lot of the numbers with sounds, and provides shortcuts to just read the particular number you want (just type hp, and the screen-reader will say ""47"" or some other number).  The trouble you're going to have is that ""You are a master at swords"" is far, far more verbose than ""swords: 100%"", and so will take the screen-reader even longer to read. It also gives the player slightly less information: what is ""a master""? 100%? 80%? Is ""you have some scratches"" more or less damaged than ""you have some bruises"" or ""you have some cuts"".  This can be a good or bad thing, depending on the design of your game.

266,"Frankly, I'm shocked this isn't discussed more on this sub. I'm in a similar situation. I have a job, and I'm actually in the industry I want to be in, but I'm still working a low-wage entry level job and I want to move up. It's hard to explain to people how much you're judged for having a vision impairment, and unlike most other discriminatory behavior, judging someone based on disability still seems to be culturally acceptable to a large extent. I just had a long conversation with my mom about this. She kept saying ""just wow them in the interview and it won't matter"" but unfortunately you can't always overcome someone's misconceptions in a few minutes. Over the course of weeks or months? Sure, but you don't have weeks or months to prove yourself; you have a short meeting. When I started working at my current job, I know there were several people who asked ""how is he supposed to do his job?"" I'm low vision not totally blind, and most of my job involves reading the computer screen. All I need to do is pull the monitor closer to me, but it boggled their minds. I won them over but it took time. Luckily, I had lots of friends from college working here who relentlessly pushed for my hiring, and my supervisor had met me a few times and knew my reputation. If it wasn't for that I probably wouldn't have gotten the job.

The other frustrating thing is those job placement organizations are overworked and understaffed, and seem to specialize in helping low-functioning individuals find low-skilled work. If you're high-functioning, it seems like you don't need their help and you get overlooked. The problem is that being high-functioning doesn't help you overcome the stigma that others put on you.

Okay, now that I'm done venting I do have one piece of advice. Network! Get out there and meet people in your perspective field. Get to know them and let them get to know you. I work in broadcasting. I was involved in our college radio station which gave me lots of networking opportunities both with people in the industry, and with classmates who would go on to work in the industry. Despite the low job prospects in broadcasting lately, the fact that I've already established myself is part of the reason I've stayed.

But now I can't remember the specifics; do you know what I'm talking about?  ",,,,fastfinge,born blind,,1455204319,t5_2qpec,t3_458kn7,t1_czw1ycb,2,1458431993,0,0,czw2ex9,Blind,2,,blue1,,

282,"Oh I totally get you.  It is a situation I'm sure most of us would rather not be in.  I've always had a fascination with aviation and for the longest time wanted to be a pilot, that's not going to happen for me.  Every once in a while I'll learn about one insanely cool thing or another that I would love to do that just won't happen.  Especially as I have friends going off and doing cool things that aren't accessible to those of us who are legally blind.  But the fact remains that everyone has their challenges and this is just one that I have to deal with, most of the time I just have to remind myself that there isn't anything I can do about it so I just have to make the best of it.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the ways I handle it is by thinking about all of the insanely cool stuff that has happened or will happen because of the disability.  I have met people I would have never had a chance to meet if I was sighted that are now huge parts of my life.  I get to play with different kinds of technology.  In June I'm getting my first guide dog, that's a unique experience that no sighted person will have.  It has made me a more resilient person with better problem solving skills.  There are good parts about it, you just have to look for them.

287,"Absolutely!  So as I mentioned, it's a mid 2015 MacBook Pro.  It has an Intel Core i7 clocked at 2.8 ghz and it is running Intel Iris Pro graphics (1536 MB).  It has 16 gb of RAM and a 1 TB SSD for storage.  I have had it for less than two weeks, but so far it is great, I have the SSD split 50/50 with the latest version of OSX on one end and Windows 10 Professional on the other.  I did this through bootcamp.  I'm waiting for a chance to really put it through it's paces (hopefully with MATLAB soon), but it seems to be a very capable machine.  Windows is running smoothly on the other end, although I'm using the OSX side a lot so I can get used to OS again.  It's nice to have both available.

&amp;nbsp;

A quick note, Bootcamp is pretty badly bugged right now, make sure you are all the way updated before bootcamping or it will be terrible.  Also when it was installing drivers on the Windows side it constantly got hung up on the RealTek audio driver and we had to kill that part of the setup process to get it to finish.

For software I just use the stock accessibility on the OSX side, no need to fix what isn't broken.  On the Windows side I use NVDA and Zoomtext 10.1.
