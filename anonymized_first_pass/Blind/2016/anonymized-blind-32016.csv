Depression does tend to bring out the ""things will never feel much better than this"" in people. 

Depression is treatable. Most people feel better when they get the right treatment. You've had something really awful happen to you that's life-changing and permanent. A lot of people in this subreddit have been where you are after losing their vision, and when those feelings cross over from normal mourning into long-lasting depression it's a pretty good sign that you could use some help.

Or if I can put it another way, would getting professional help likely harm anything? Worst case scenario, if you give it an honest try for a while and don't feel like things have changed, have you lost anything by trying?

48,"Ok so I have a few thoughts here. I love that this sort of thing is being worked on and the possibilities really are endless as long as it works well. I'm totally blind so honestly any information is usually useful. Even something as seemingly simple as locating doorways would be great. I was recently at a VA hospital and had one hell of a time navigating the maze and finding exactly what I was looking for. Having something that would let me locate doorways without having to hit them with a cane would be great. It would make following instructions like ""It's the third door on the right"" so much easier.
At the same time being able to find and read the info signs located in a place like that would be awesome as well. They have signs everywhere that say where things are located but again having no vision and therefore no clue where to look I often have to resort to just finding someone then asking them for directions.
I have always loved rock climbing and even after losing my vision it's something I continue to do. I can imagine what it would be like to be able to just look up and see the next hand or foot hold again without having to sweep an appendage around searching for it like a mine sweeper.
The city I live in has good public transportation but the bus sign posts are right next to the street and unless I already know where it is there's no way I'd be able to find one so again having something that would be able to help with that would be useful even if it just made a beep or chime when I was near it.
That brings to mind street crossings. While I can do it and rarely have issues having a system I could trust to guide me strait across the street would be amazing! Walking in a strait line can be a pain in the rear and any help would be an improvement.
Since I'm just rattling off ideas, getting info on other people and how close I am like in a mall would be great. If I could tell where they were walking or standing I'd be able to avoid cracking ankles with my cane in crowded places. Most of these things really aren't major problems but even small bits of info would be extremely useful.  
The ideas you have listed already sound great but I think one of the biggest issues I've experienced with vision assist devices is the lack of actual usefulness. I was able to spend six months using the Brain Port device and while it sounds super in reality it was cumbersome and the effort it took to figure out what it was displaying made the whole thing more work than it was worth. I was able to sort laundry with it but there were wires everywhere and the battery didn't last very long so once I was done with the clothes I'd have to put it on the charger for an hour just to be able to use it on something else. At the same time the refresh rate was so slow that even a person walking past my line of vision would just confuse it. I could tell that something just happened but it wasn't good enough to even be able to figure out which direction the person was going. 
I love hearing ideas like this and I always try to get involved wherever I can but so far I haven't found anything that's worth the time to use. The Orcam is another device that comes to mind. Sounds great when you read about it but when you try it out it's just not as useful as they make it sound. Even useful things like product recognition take too long, not to mention that you have to add products on your own and it can only remember 100 before the storage is full.

73,"&gt; 1) Is navigation while running screen readers easy and intuitive?

Well, I've been using them for 20 years.  So I'd say yes.  But I think that's an answer that's going to change from person to person.  

&gt; 2) Is it annoying if you have to turn off a screen reader if it is picking up closed captioning on top of audio?

Not really. My screen-reader has a single keypress that can mute speech.  But again, that's going to depend what screen-reader is used, what features it has, and if the user knows about the mute hotkey if they have one.  

&gt; 3) What kind of interactive media do you enjoy?

Not sure what you mean by interactive media.  Most of the media I consume these days comes from Youtube, Google Music, and Netflix if that helps.

I've taken a couple courses put out by the ARRL, and they were pretty good, other than a few images that needed description.

Unlabeled buttons and controls, and no alt-text on images.  In education, image descriptions can be especially important, because a quiz or exam question found later on may well depend on information that was only shown in an image.  

&gt; 6) Have you ever used eLearning Software, if so, what was done right/wrong?

It sounds like part of the key with these devices is that they have to be accurate and fast enough to be reliable and worth the time to learn how to use them.  I'm very curious about your experiences with Orcam and Brain Port.  One of the challenges in designing these devices that detect objects, people, text etc. is balancing the sensitivity: if it's too sensitive, it might miss something, but if its more sensitive it tends to give more false positives because of noise and other objects in the image.  If you don't mind me asking, when using those other devices, did you find either of these two problems particularly frustrating, in addition to the device being slow, needing frequent charging etc.?   What I mean is, did you find it to be more of a problem when the device gave a signal when it wasn't appropriate, or when it didn't give a signal when it should have?

Instead on just moving his eyes around to scan the table, he'll have to learn to move his head around a lot more so his field of vision covers the whole table -  a bit at a time.

If it's a gradual sight loss, he may learn to do this anyway as it progresses.

By switching to a smaller, square monitor I've been able to continue gaming, even shooters.

You'll be surprised at how much he'll adapt as it progresses.  He might get down or frustrated occasionally but if you give him the support he needs then hopefully he can continue to play for years to come.

104,"I made a post pretty much identical to this one last year when I first started using a white cane.  I totally feel you, people think it's okay to touch without permission and it is aggravating and unacceptable behavior.  I think what's important to remember is that although it is totally inappropriate and unacceptable people don't always know that, just something to keep in mind, it doesn't excuse the behavior but it might explain it.  I have had to take more precautions recently though, so simply getting annoyed and moving on is less and less of an option.  I have no tolerance for people grabbing me without asking first anymore, especially in public, it's a safety thing.  If you have an O&amp;M that you are in regular contact with you can ask about the ""Hind's Break"" which is a fairly unaggressive feeling way of getting out of a grip on your arm, I'll use that if I can but I find it difficult because it requires your non grabbed arm and my cane is usually occupying that hand.  I've taken to twisting my arm and pulling it forcefully away, I'll usually take a few steps back and cross my cane over my body as well and just tell them firmly that they cannot touch me.  This usually gets the message across and it also gets attention from other people.  Most of the time I assume it's someone who is well meaning but I've gotten into scary situations three times now because I was complacent.

129,"Hi OP-

Teacher of the Blind/Visually Impaired here. Does your son have a vision teacher? I'm hoping he does, as he/she would be a great resource for you on some things you could do at home. The ipad is fun for kids with CVI, you're right. I've found that apps that have stories that are read out loud are enjoyable, as long as the graphics are not too complex. 

As a general rule, that is something to keep in mind for your son. He probably likes/needs to keep things visually simple. Visual clutter is way too overwhelming for him, so one or two bright colors that he can focus on at a time will capture his interest. Classically it is usually red and yellow, but I try everything- some of my students with CVI love bright fluorescent colors. Most of them are attracted to things that shine or shimmer, like pom-poms, bows, etc. and you may notice that he will look at something, look away, and then react or grab it later. That is because his eyes and his brain aren't quite ""synced up""; this is normal for CVI. 

If you have some money that you can spend, you might buy a light table for your house. Teacher supply stores have them, and kids with CVi will almost always react favorably to them. Pinterest has tons of activities that you can do on a light table, from fun to academic (he can do all of his schoolwork on a light table, actually), if he enjoys it and it keeps his attention. The American Printing House for the Blind makes a big one, but it's very expensive, and even with blind quota funds that can pay for it for him to have at school, it's kind of limited use.

Talk to your son's vision teacher, if there is one, and if you have more questions, you can PM me anytime. :-)",,,,jogajaja,,,1458671099,t5_2qpec,t3_4bfehd,t3_4bfehd,2,1460810948,0,0,d19for0,Blind,2,,,,
130,"I think you'd have a real case to make for vocational rehabilitation to pay for a braille display since it would be an important tool to help you work. 

There's also state specific programs that can help you fund AT. I don't know if all states have them, but if you can get an individual development account for AT you can put savings towards an AT purchase and have your funds matched from other sources (making the overall purchase cheaper.)

If you're paying cash outright (or credit or via a loan), you can often get used braille displays for less outrageous prices (I've seen many in the $500-$1500 range used, sometimes less if you're a hawk for deals.) I've bought one off ebay, but there's also the blindbargains classifieds, state assistive technology exchanges (I would recommend contacting the coordinator of your state's program and asking specifically if they can look out for a braille display, sometimes you can get one being retired out of a state program for free), etc.  

Vocational rehab would be the first stop if you otherwise still would like to work, but even if you're cash paying it doesn't have to be some ridiculous $6,000 or more hit. 

While obviously that doesn't immediately solve the issues of you being slow to read braille, at least my personal experience has been that I utilize a braille display way more than paper braille, and that using a braille display has definitely improved my braille skills over time. When I was still learning to read braille, having the option of audio feedback along with braille was very helpful as well. I can't read braille anywhere near as fast as I can listen, but braille (and a braille display especially) is indispensable for a lot of tasks.

147,"Listen, I think what you had done, and are continuing to do for you friend, is fantastic.


I read about the problems you were having with the guide dogs and looked into the schools.


I've raised service dogs since 2007 but have never been hired by a school. This is my personal research and opinions.


The Desert School is lacking in information about the kind of training that is done at the campus. I don't know enough to make an opinion on the school itself but street guiding is a *fundamental* part of guide dog work and should never be an issue. 



The Eye Dog Foundation of Arizona is not listed on Charity Navigator. I'm going to mention them in detail because I have heard of them. They were started with good intentions in CA but spilt after a dispute in the 70s. There has been concern in the past about fund management. The *Braille Monitor* also did an [investigation in 2008](https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm08/bm0811/bm081103.htm). If you have time give that a read.


Secondly, what to do you with the funds you raised? As you said, you do have two options. One is donate it and the other is try again for a dog. 


There are a few questions you should ask yourself:


1. Is your friend responsible and self-sufficient enough to have a guide dog?


2. Will having a dog improve the quality of his life in ways that other assistance might not?


3. Is he willing to try again?


If the answer to all three is ""yes"" then I suggest The Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. I have raised puppies for them and know their training quite well.


The Seeing Eye is the oldest and most established guide dog school in the U.S. Their [student expectations](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions/expectations.html) are pretty straight forward. They also provide their expectations of [themselves](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions/our-commitment.html) which are great. 



Each training session lasts 3 ½ weeks. [Here](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions) is some information about admissions. What I think The Seeing Eye does best is their gradual, off campus training with the people and their dogs. There is constant contact with the outside world during training and it is reflected in the quality of the dogs and the skills of the trainers. Morristown is great and a good size city to learn in. A university campus would be quiet compared to downtown - and that is the idea of getting practice in there.  


Furthermore, the cost for a dog has not changed in a few decades - each dog is 150 USD. Housing and materials for classes are covered by donation. I pulled the full service post from [this page](http://www.seeingeye.org/about-us/faq.html). 150 USD covers:

The cost of the dog and its initial equipment

The student's instruction with the dog

Room and board during the 18 to 25 days the student spends at the school

Round-trip transportation from anywhere in the United States or Canada

Lifetime follow-up services



Average time from [admissions](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions) to acceptance to the program is about four months. I suggest calling (973) 539-4425 and explaining your situation. 


From Mike's past experiences with guide schools would donating the funds to those schools be appropriate? I honestly would hesitate on that idea for now.  


If you have any questions or comments or anything at all do not hesitate to contact me and I'll get back to you ASAP.

166,"Just downloaded it and installed the app.

First thing I notice: join us with Facebook is a little flaky. The first time I hit the button, it asked me if I wanted to allow the app to open Facebook and I allowed that, then I pressed ""continue as Samuel"" in the facebook app. Then it just returned me to the same screen it had before.  I pressed ""join us with Facebook"" a second time, and it did some stuff (the screens changed too quickly for me to examine with Voiceover), and it let me in.  

Second thing I noticed, after saying ""yes"" to download Bryan, it put me on the main-screen of the app right away, before the download had finished.  When the download was complete, the message didn't get focused with Voiceover, so it took me a minute to figure out why nothing on the main screen was working. I had to explore around the screen to find and press the OK button.  

On the saved tab, everything works.  However, I can't figure out how to delete the ""men walk on moon"" article now that I've read it.  If there is a delete button somewhere, Voiceover isn't finding it.  

Reading articles seems to work just fine. The close button is identified by Voiceover as ""CloseModal"" rather than just ""close"", but other than that, everything here is labelled OK.  I might strip off the word button from each label though, because at the moment, voiceover is saying things like ""ButtonPlay button"" ""ButtonJumpPrev button"", etc, when all I really need is ""JumpPrev button"".  After pressing close on this screen, the play button becomes labelled ""ButtonPlaySmall"".  That's fine, but it could probably stand to be just ""play"".  

On the discover tab, though, things aren't in nearly as good shape.  After pressing the personalize button, I can't choose favourite channels.

First thing I notice: join us with Facebook is a little flaky. The first time I hit the button, it asked me if I wanted to allow the app to open Facebook and I allowed that, then I pressed ""continue as Samuel"" in the facebook app. Then it just returned me to the same screen it had before.  I pressed ""join us with Facebook"" a second time, and it did some stuff (the screens changed too quickly for me to examine with Voiceover), and it let me in.  

Second thing I noticed, after saying ""yes"" to download <PERSON>, it put me on the main-screen of the app right away, before the download had finished.  When the download was complete, the message didn't get focused with Voiceover, so it took me a minute to figure out why nothing on the main screen was working. I had to explore around the screen to find and press the OK button.  

On the saved tab, everything works.  However, I can't figure out how to delete the ""men walk on moon"" article now that I've read it.  If there is a delete button somewhere, Voiceover isn't finding it.  

Reading articles seems to work just fine. The close button is identified by Voiceover as ""CloseModal"" rather than just ""close"", but other than that, everything here is labelled OK.

1: This is inspiration porn. Fuck inspiration porn. Thank you for sharing the article, u/fastfinge, but man, fuck inspiration porn.

2: There are MANY reasons a dog might consistantly put itself on one side of a person over the other. Dogs are pretty habitual creatures. It's also simple and innocuous enough that I'd be willing to question if the dog even did what the article claims.

3: astigmatism isn't a 100% death sentence for your sight, and the eye doctor, assuming they were at all competent at their job, would have spotted it anyway. The fuck does the dog have to do with any of this?

4: I love dogs, but the amount of adoration and mystical abilities attributed to this one is almost enough to start a cult. Licking a spot where the tumor grew? How do we know the dog isn't secretly an evil bastard and was like ""mmmm yess, your impending doom is delicious to me mlem mlem mlem.""
Don't get me wrong, dogs are awesome. My service dog has saved my life so many times, and there has been some, albeit IMO slim, evidence to support the idea that dogs might be able to sense cancer through smell, but come on!

I think all you need is that initial confidence boost - that 1st step getting back into the drivers seat.  Once you do some simple driving, even if just round an empty parking lot and doing some simple maneuvers like three point turn, parking the car etc.

You have to take that first step though - remember the feeling when you 1st got your licence and the sense of freedom &amp; independence it gave you - focus on  that.

I'd kill to be able to drive again, although we have (mostly) great public transport here I can't use it due to mobility problems so I'm pretty much like yourself trapped in my local area.

I saw someone else mentioned driving simulators - 1 game you could try, that I've played myself is European Driving Simulator (I think there's an American truck version too).

Obviously the act of driving is going to be different than a car, but - it's almost like driving with reduced peripheral vision.  Your mouse controls your view, you have to look around the cab while driving, turn view/head to look at the mirrors, turn your view to check if the road is clear at junctions etc.  

It might help you learn a bit about how much you will have to compensate by turning your head more to make sure you are aware of any hazards (which I think is possibly one of your biggest fears - not seeing hazards etc)

I have Homonymous Hemianopsia which means I basically have no visual field on the left side of both eyes. Had a stroke during heart surgery so I went from 20/20 vision to my current state instantly - a big shock to the system.

212,"Shrug. I suppose I probably take a slightly different tact than the other responses, but my question is why do these actions matter so much? I am completely blind and find that sometimes things like this are annoying, but only that. I would say it's comparable to them guiding you by letting you grip their arm. Receiving assistance is often going to be a physical interaction, and prescribing limits on when and where seems like something that will be very difficult to enforce.you can keep telling people not to touch you, and it will work each time, but it sort of requires that you say this after the fact, so you're not really solving much. I found it was much easier to just worry less about the personal space issue. We interact through tactile  sensations, and it's unlikely that that will change.


On the other hand, I do find that the amount of overprotective assistance is often dictated by the blind person's confidence level. Most of the time I ask for help rather than having to have it offered to me, in which case I generally speaking control the dynamics of that assistance. In those cases you generally initiate the contact. This depends on personality though, I think.",,,,Jsevrior,,,1458251333,t5_2qpec,t3_4aukq8,t3_4aukq8,2,1460713474,0,0,d13snl3,Blind,2,,,,
