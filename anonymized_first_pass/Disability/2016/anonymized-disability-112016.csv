11,"Terms and guardianship explanations (copied and pasted)

Guardianships are only appropriate for intellectually disabled individuals who also meet the definition of an “incapacitated person.” An incapacitate person is defined as an individual with a clinically diagnosed condition that effects his or her ability to receive and evaluate information, or to make or communicate decisions, which renders him or her incapable of making essential decisions relating to health, safety, or self-care, even with technological assistance. The inability to make these essential life decisions is really the threshold determiner for a guardianship.


A guardian is an individual who is appointed by the court to make decisions for an intellectually disabled or incapacitated person who is determined by the court to be incapable of making those decisions on their own. The focus of the new guardianship laws is to have limited, tailored guardianships which will allow disabled or incapacitated individuals to retain their right to make decisions in areas where they are capable of making them.

The big ones he could change would be removing the mandate (which would cause premiums to go up, as people who are healthy would no longer be required to have coverage) and the birth control mandate (thereby requiring patients to have cost-sharing on birth control). The birth control mandate wouldn't be applicable until 2018, since again, your plan details can't just be altered on you due to federal law (and in this case since they'd be providing you an extra, non-required service in paying for your birth control. Plans might be altered if suddenly they vote that all providers must give you a physical each month, to not do so once the federal law takes effect would be a violation. That also said, most federal laws have a time frame within which they are implemented, so if they make the changes in 2017, they'd likely write the law to be effective come Jan 2018, so as to not muck around with plans already in place). tl;dr your insurance is likely stable for at least the next two years.

I have tried so many medications, and the opiods are the only ones that have had any effect at all. I am the kind of person who HATES being on medication, but without these I would not be able to function at all. 

I have also been in counselling before, and frequently been in CBT for the depression caused by severe fibro - each has said I generally have good coping skills, and that my reaction is proportionate to the stress and events in my life.

93,"* Fees and expenses

No one here has mentioned that there is a difference between fees and expenses. 

A fee is the money owed for doing work. In Social Security cases, there is usually a contingent fee agreement that says the attorney can only collect his or her fee if you win your case.

Expenses are the out-of-pocket costs the attorney accrues developing your case, e.g. paying to obtain your medical records. You can be required to repay expenses if you do not win your case, even if there is a contingent fee agreement. Whether you or your attorney is responsible for the expenses related to your case will depend on the specific language of the contract you signed though.

* Date last insured (DLI)

118,"This is horrifically common for people with mental illnesses. ""My brother is bipolar so I can tell you how you should take your meds."" It's insufferable. I get that caregivers have their own unique experience, and are more informed than someone who has no contact with someone with a mental illness, but they still don't know what having a mental illness is. 

Often, these people will make assumptions that they understand ALL forms of mental illness or that everyone with the same diagnosis as their brother/wife/mother must behave the same way. They also get very defensive when you suggest to them that it's not okay to treat a person with a mental illness like a small child. 

Many of us have graduate degrees etc but some of these people seem to think we need our steak cut up. I cannot tell you how many caregivers have argued viciously with me that they have a right to ask if their loved one has taken their medication or not because ""they have to deal with the fall out."" Like the aftermath of an episode makes them the primary victim. They don't understand that it is akin to pushing someone's wheelchair without asking or asking a woman if she is on her period. It's saying, ""your behavior is unacceptable or is making me uncomfortable. Are you making sure you are doing everything to make me comfortable?"" It's bad.

Anyhow, several of these issues are birth defects, related to one of my primary diagnoses. If a lot of this sounds familiar, it may make sense to get tested for this too.

Anyhow, several of these issues are birth defects, related to one of my primary diagnoses. If a lot of this sounds familiar, it may make sense to get tested for this too. I have <PERSON>, which causes defects in my collagen and led to my connective tissue being to loose before I was born, thus the birth defects (feet, knees).

143,"First, I'm happy to meet a fellow independent individual who can teach stubborn to a rock!  

Second, being worried about the future is completely understandable, for everyone.  And when you're disabled, it adds another layer of worry.  

I don't see your worry as pessimism, but as a very healthy caution.  And as much as I would like to be full of sunshine and blindly optimistic encouragement, which quite honestly I would have been just a few years ago, I’ve learned that being cautious can help spur people into making very sure that they have the support system in place that can help them weather the many challenges they may encounter in the work force.  

I was fortunate enough to find a supervisor who was not only willing to provide any and all accommodations that I needed, but who truly viewed me as a skilled professional first, foremost, &amp; only.  

Unfortunately, this supervisor’s supervisor did not share his enthusiasm, nor his belief that individuals with disabilities are just as capable as individuals without disabilities, &amp; to compound the issue the employing federal agency is currently in a huge internal political &amp; legal battle with their IT contractor regarding the ongoing disablement of IT-related assistive technology on all of the agency's computers.

Basically, I found my dream job, I was hired for my dream job, and relocated hundreds of miles away from family to accept my dream job, but in 3 years I have not been given any way to perform my work, have been placed on administrative leave (for well over a year now), while the agency's management and IT contractor argue over the disablement of AT. 

I've been told many times that nonfederal employers are more likely to provide reasonable accommodations, expressly because they fear lawsuits, however I have not seen this to be true in practice.

BUT - you have a lot of positives working in your favor, positives that may help you overcome the challenges that have tripped up myself and others like me. (Plus you have the benefit of our being able to identify these pitfalls, so you will be better prepared to avoid them.)

A gigantic positive is that you are studying to work in the medical field.
  
This is fortuitous, and in particular for one very big reason - the amount of medical professionals, who are not disabled in anyway, who utilize Dragon Naturally Speaking (the voice recognition program) to dictate their medical notes, vastly increases the chances that any and all IT-related assistive technology will be functional in your field, or at the very least that wherever you are employed the IT department will have experience with it.

I can't tell you the number of doctors who are tickled pink to share ‘the wonders of Dragon’ with their patients.  They love to demonstrate their favorite computer program to anyone and everyone who is willing to listen. 
 
Dragon will be a vital and necessary AT for you in the work world, &amp; I highly recommend becoming proficient with it now, if you aren't already.  

Another assistive technology that you may or may not have heard of, and which I’ve found to be vital for entering passwords and pin numbers into computer systems so that I can access everything from e-mail to password-protected records, is a capacitive touch keyboard &amp; mouse.

It took me a very long time to find this keyboard and mouse, &amp; it will cost your employer $275, but it is well worth it.  

It is called the Cool Leaf Keyboard (v2)  http://www.dynamism.com/accessories/cool-leaf-keyboard.shtml

Because you are in the medical field, the cost of Dragon will likely already be an expected, or at least a planned, expense for a number of a potential employer's employees, which reduces their ‘less expected’ costs for any needed assistive technology.

And, because the medical field serves people with a wide range of abilities, they are more likely to have wheelchair ramps, automatic doors, &amp; elevators already in place.

You are really in the best possible industry and professional field for needing accommodations.

And just as everyone has worries about the future, but being disabled adds an extra layer of worry - which can spur us to be cautious and ensure that we put contingency plans in place, everyone has challenges applying for positions, and being disabled adds an extra layer of challenge - which can also spur us to ensure that we ‘hope for the best and prepare for the worst’.

In your interviews for positions, you are being interviewed by the employer, but you are also interviewing the employer.  You are assessing whether or not you believe you will be provided the opportunity to do meaningful work that interests you, as well as whether or not you believe the employer will provide you with the reasonable accommodations that you need in order to work.

The supervisor who hired me for my current position (where AT doesn't work) broke rules I didn't even know existed during the interview.
  
After we had discussed my professional skills and abilities in-depth and at length, he gave me a very confused look, and stumbled to find a way to ask the ‘illegal to ask’ questions regarding what my disabilities are &amp; whether or not he would be able to provide the accommodations that I would need.

After his numerous attempts at beating around the bush rather than asking directly, ending in a faltering “so, what's wrong…I mean….how are you…I mean….”, I chose to respond by disclosing a generalized “I have upper body neuromuscular disabilities.  Which in layman's terms translates to no arm strength, no hand strength, and similar challenges.  Fortunately, the assistive technology I need in order to perform work has existed for over 2 decades (Dragon 1st hit the market in the early 90s).”  

I chose to disclose my reasonable accommodation needs during the interview - expressly because I wanted to make sure that I would only be hired if I was going to be provided with the assistive technology that's necessary for me to work.

I have never disclosed this to any other interviewer or potential manager, nor since.  I felt comfortable enough during that interview and with that hiring manager to discuss it.

Ideally, this discussion would've occurred after I had already been hired – and that's the way the law is written.  The intention is to ensure that individuals are hired based upon their skills and abilities, without regard to their disabilities, &amp; to ensure that individuals are not passed over for positions based upon a hiring managers prejudice regarding individuals with disabilities, or even just their lack of understanding of disabilities and the effective reasonable accommodations that exist and are available.

I've submitted thousands of applications and resumes, and participated in countless interviews, both before I was disabled and post-disability.  And at this point I think I've been asked just about every question in the 'top 100 illegal questions to ask an applicant during an interview'.

While some employers are so blatantly discriminatory that I've wondered how they can possibly look themselves in the mirror at night (including one manager who stated to my face, &amp; put in writing, that disabled employees would not be paid the same as their nondisabled peers, and instead would be paid 60% of the standard starting salary for the same positions, as well as would only be hired into the position if the job title was ‘downgraded’ to include ‘Junior’ (i.e., Junior contract specialist)), I’ve also encountered employers who have been like my current supervisor - professionals who view me as a professional  first, foremost, and only.  

The greatest challenge is finding a supervisor like my current one but who is within an organization that is large enough to be experienced with providing reasonable accommodations but that is small enough for there to be accountability should accommodations not be provided.  

As I have discovered, when an employer is too large, there is no one person responsible for ensuring RAs are provided, and the endless passing of the buck results only in frustration without any resolution (or end in sight).

There ARE good managers out there.  I am currently searching for another one like my current manager, but one that is within a company or agency that actually provides functional reasonable accommodations.  

I have seriously considered looking at the medical field, expressly because of the amount of professionals who use Dragon there, &amp; because of the prevalence of everything from elevators to automatic doors.

In attempting to proofread what I've dictated, I realize I may have rambled a bit.  It is 1 am where I am at, and I apologize if I have gotten too far off track.

Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

TL;DR - you are in the best possible field to be provided with functional reasonable accommodations, the key will be finding one of the good managers &amp; an appropriately sized employer.",,,,UserNme_AlreadyTaken,,,1477976560,t5_2qhe8,t3_5aaw75,t3_5aaw75,2,1481104975,0,0,d9ggraj,disability,,,,"First, I'm happy to meet a fellow independent individual who can teach stubborn to a rock!

Basically, I found my dream job, I was hired for my dream job, and relocated hundreds of miles away from family to accept my dream job, but in 3 years I have not been given any way to perform my work, have been placed on administrative leave (for well over a year now), while the agency's management and IT contractor argue over the disablement of AT. 

I've been told many times that nonfederal employers are more likely to provide reasonable accommodations, expressly because they fear lawsuits, however I have not seen this to be true in practice.

BUT - you have a lot of positives working in your favor, positives that may help you overcome the challenges that have tripped up myself and others like me. (Plus you have the benefit of our being able to identify these pitfalls, so you will be better prepared to avoid them.)

A gigantic positive is that you are studying to work in the medical field.
  
This is fortuitous, and in particular for one very big reason - the amount of medical professionals, who are not disabled in anyway, who utilize Dragon Naturally Speaking (the voice recognition program) to dictate their medical notes, vastly increases the chances that any and all IT-related assistive technology will be functional in your field, or at the very least that wherever you are employed the IT department will have experience with it.

I can't tell you the number of doctors who are tickled pink to share ‘the wonders of Dragon’ with their patients.  They love to demonstrate their favorite computer program to anyone and everyone who is willing to listen. 
 
Dragon will be a vital and necessary AT for you in the work world, &amp; I highly recommend becoming proficient with it now, if you aren't already.  

Another assistive technology that you may or may not have heard of, and which I’ve found to be vital for entering passwords and pin numbers into computer systems so that I can access everything from e-mail to password-protected records, is a capacitive touch keyboard &amp; mouse.

It took me a very long time to find this keyboard and mouse, &amp; it will cost your employer $275, but it is well worth it.  

It is called the Cool Leaf Keyboard (v2)  <URL>

Because you are in the medical field, the cost of Dragon will likely already be an expected, or at least a planned, expense for a number of a potential employer's employees, which reduces their ‘less expected’ costs for any needed assistive technology.

And, because the medical field serves people with a wide range of abilities, they are more likely to have wheelchair ramps, automatic doors, &amp; elevators already in place.

You are really in the best possible industry and professional field for needing accommodations.

And just as everyone has worries about the future, but being disabled adds an extra layer of worry - which can spur us to be cautious and ensure that we put contingency plans in place, everyone has challenges applying for positions, and being disabled adds an extra layer of challenge - which can also spur us to ensure that we ‘hope for the best and prepare for the worst’.

In your interviews for positions, you are being interviewed by the employer, but you are also interviewing the employer.  You are assessing whether or not you believe you will be provided the opportunity to do meaningful work that interests you, as well as whether or not you believe the employer will provide you with the reasonable accommodations that you need in order to work.

The supervisor who hired me for my current position (where AT doesn't work) broke rules I didn't even know existed during the interview.
  
After we had discussed my professional skills and abilities in-depth and at length, he gave me a very confused look, and stumbled to find a way to ask the ‘illegal to ask’ questions regarding what my disabilities are &amp; whether or not he would be able to provide the accommodations that I would need.

After his numerous attempts at beating around the <PERSON> rather than asking directly, ending in a faltering “so, what's wrong…I mean….how are you…I mean….”, I chose to respond by disclosing a generalized “I have upper body neuromuscular disabilities.  Which in layman's terms translates to no arm strength, no hand strength, and similar challenges.  Fortunately, the assistive technology I need in order to perform work has existed for over 2 decades (Dragon 1st hit the market in the early 90s).”  

I chose to disclose my reasonable accommodation needs during the interview - expressly because I wanted to make sure that I would only be hired if I was going to be provided with the assistive technology that's necessary for me to work.

I have never disclosed this to any other interviewer or potential manager, nor since.  I felt comfortable enough during that interview and with that hiring manager to discuss it.

Ideally, this discussion would've occurred after I had already been hired – and that's the way the law is written.  The intention is to ensure that individuals are hired based upon their skills and abilities, without regard to their disabilities, &amp; to ensure that individuals are not passed over for positions based upon a hiring managers prejudice regarding individuals with disabilities, or even just their lack of understanding of disabilities and the effective reasonable accommodations that exist and are available.

I've submitted thousands of applications and resumes, and participated in countless interviews, both before I was disabled and post-disability.  And at this point I think I've been asked just about every question in the 'top 100 illegal questions to ask an applicant during an interview'.

While some employers are so blatantly discriminatory that I've wondered how they can possibly look themselves in the mirror at night (including one manager who stated to my face, &amp; put in writing, that disabled employees would not be paid the same as their nondisabled peers, and instead would be paid 60% of the standard starting salary for the same positions, as well as would only be hired into the position if the job title was ‘downgraded’ to include ‘Junior’ (i.e., Junior contract specialist)), I’ve also encountered employers who have been like my current supervisor - professionals who view me as a professional  first, foremost, and only.  

The greatest challenge is finding a supervisor like my current one but who is within an organization that is large enough to be experienced with providing reasonable accommodations but that is small enough for there to be accountability should accommodations not be provided.  

As I have discovered, when an employer is too large, there is no one person responsible for ensuring RAs are provided, and the endless passing of the buck results only in frustration without any resolution (or end in sight).

There ARE good managers out there.  I am currently searching for another one like my current manager, but one that is within a company or agency that actually provides functional reasonable accommodations.  

I have seriously considered looking at the medical field, expressly because of the amount of professionals who use Dragon there, &amp; because of the prevalence of everything from elevators to automatic doors.

In attempting to proofread what I've dictated, I realize I may have rambled a bit.  It is 1 am where I am at, and I apologize if I have gotten too far off track.

Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

TL;DR - you are in the best possible field to be provided with functional reasonable accommodations, the key will be finding one of the good managers &amp; an appropriately sized employer.","[{'start': 5267, 'end': 5275, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3480, 'end': 3485, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

157,"Here’s a generalized version of my response to the OP, edited for public postability.

I urge anyone who is seeking to transition from disability back into the workforce to do so with the utmost caution, because none of us can foretell what the future may hold.  

I had been in the workforce, then had to go on disability (SSDI) for multiple disabilities.  I worked very hard to get to the point where I felt I was ready &amp; could return to the workforce.

In order to bolster my chances of success in going back to work, &amp; as all of the job openings that I found that would provide me with an income high enough to support myself required an an MBA, so I went back to college and earned one.

After I completed my MBA I was recruited by a federal agency for my dream job, with the assurances that the assistive technology (AT) I needed in order to work were in place and in use at the agency already.  

The downsides of this position included my having to relocate hundreds of miles away from my family, my doctors, &amp; my support system, as well as a ‘lower starting salary, with guaranteed yearly salary increases varying from $14,000- $15,000 per year for the first 3 years of employment’ (this is an accepted, industry-wide standard practice).

Despite the downsides, I accepted the position, knowing I possessed the professional capabilities to excel at the position, &amp; being shocked at my luck at finding someplace that already had my needed AT in place.

Unfortunately, the AT - a standard voice recognition program that works fine at home, at colleges, &amp; (supposedly) in companies across the globe – turned out to not be functional.
  
It took 2 years of my being required to “attempt to work without functional accommodations”, and during which my professional competence was questioned, if not outright ridiculed, daily - solely because I physically can't type, and the filing of an EEO complaint, for it to be brought to light that ALL assistive technology has been and continues to be disabled on the agency's computers, nationwide.

The agency’s IT department’s claim over the previous 2 years that ‘everyone else is using assistive technology just fine’, &amp; that ‘only I was having any problems’, were proven to be completely &amp; utterly false.
  
However, the damage to my professional reputation has been done, as has my loss of position related experience, the numerous lost promotion opportunities, not to mention the severe damage to my self-esteem, my confidence, &amp; the eroding of everything else that I had worked so hard on in order to be ready to return workforce.

Even now, all AT continues to be disabled on all agency computers, despite their being fully aware of the fact that their IT contractor is actively and continuously disabling AT.

It's become a power play between the agency’s management and the IT contractor.  If the IT contractor admits that AT has been disabled by them on agency computers for the past decade and a half, they could face legal repercussions as well as the requirement to repay billions of dollars to the government.

Some factions of agency management are determined to ‘make the IT contractor do their job’, i.e. - to cease the disablement and to make AT functional on agency computers.

Meanwhile, other factions of agency management have been working behind the scenes on a very different solution, one that is designed to ‘protect the agency from EEO complaints’ - by ensuring that there's no one left to file an EEO complaint over this.

I was informed (off the record) by a national level agency IT manager that the agency has terminated or 'coerced into accepting disability retirement‘ well over half of the employees who need AT in order to work, &amp; that the remaining 80+ of us are ‘on a list’.
  
While the official agency claim is that this list is of ‘people who need the AT to be made functional’, the IT manager warned me that this list grows shorter and shorter every week, as more employees with disabilities 'leave the agency'.

It's not legal, but, as I keep being told by some very high ranking individuals within the federal disability employment and EEO law enforcement offices, it is nearly impossible for a single individual to ‘force a federal agency to comply with the law’.
  
The individuals with disabilities who, like me, either have or are going through this that I've spoken with have echoed what I was originally told by the management at my employer’s –  they do what they want, &amp; basically say ‘so sue me’.
  
Agencies know that few individuals with disabilities file EEO complaints – even if they’re terminated (as they fear it will prevent them from getting another job), fewer still are able to endure the retaliation and intimidation exacted upon them by the agency if they do file an EEO complaint, &amp; a very, tiny percentage are able to endure, or afford, the almost decade-long legal process that federal employees with disabilities are required to go through in order to ‘request enforcement' of even the most basic equal employment opportunity laws.

And during the long, drawn out EEO process (which can take 7-10 years), anyone who files an EEO complaint loses out on vital on the job experience, training, certifications, networking interactions, promotions, and everything else employment related that could potentially be leveraged into another position, with another employer.

I've applied to many jobs, but without success, &amp; with the added worries of whether or not I'll be right back at square one, with nonfunctional AT, &amp; potentially facing yet another confrontational battle with the people I am hired to be in asset to, just to be provided with a standard, basic, reasonable accommodation so that I can perform the work that I’m hired to do.
  
The agency placed me on administrative leave, on the justification that the agency ‘doesn't know how to get AT functional on their computers’.  They do know how, in fact.  The various AT manufacturers have provided them with this information, in detail (I made sure of it).  However, having this information does not resolve the internal political power play between the agency and the IT contractor.

If I am terminated, unlawfully or not, I will still be without a paycheck, &amp; I will be forced to attempt to go back on SSDI.   But, since it is my employer's refusal to provide the necessary, management approved, reasonable accommodations, rather than my inability to work due to my disabilities, that are at the root of this issue, it is unlikely that I would be approved to begin receiving SSDI again.

And even if I am able to overcome this hurdle, if I go back on disability, my income would immediately plummet to less than 20% of my current income, &amp; would be less than 13% of what my job’s salary was contracted to be.  From a promised  $98,000 a year salary back down to $12,000 a year in disability.
  
3 ½ years ago my plans for the future had seemed perfect &amp; my future seemed extremely bright.  I had been recruited by respectable agency for an excellent job, at which my AT was reportedly in place and in use.
  
Now, I'm faced with losing my home &amp; potentially not having an income of any kind, despite over 15 years of pre-disability work experience, my educational degrees, and my considerable skills &amp; abilities.  And despite my carefully thought out, well laid plans.  

This ongoing ordeal is why I urge others to be cautious, &amp; to plan with care, when they are exploring going back to work. 
Whatever you do, don't sacrifice your health. Keep your health as a top priority, always.  ‘Temporary’ sacrifices can all too easily, and far too often, become permanent sacrifices.

Once you go off disability, even the thought of going back to the lower income, or to no income, is more devastating than words could ever convey. 
 
It is imperative to ensure that taking the step off of disability is immediately followed by a step into stable, solid/supported employment.

I strongly caution anyone to seriously reconsider any thought of accepting a position that requires that they relocate away from their support system, be it friends, family, doctors, or any other aspect of their support system, especially if the employer is not going to pay for the relocation - Even if an offered position is ‘your dream job’, as mine was.

And no matter how good any plan for employment may be, there is always a need for a backup plan, &amp; a ‘worst-case scenario’ contingency plan.  Always.

I urge people to take incremental steps when considering rejoining the workforce after being on disability.  

To recognize that even if they themselves are ready to rejoin the workforce, there's always the question of whether a potential employer, or even just a change in management, will choose to provide the necessary reasonable accommodations, &amp; will choose to provide the equal employment opportunity that really should already be standard in our society by now.

Unfortunately, while the laws requiring employers, federal or otherwise, to provide equal opportunity in employment have been on the books for over 40 years, and the Americans with Disabilities Act has been in effect for 25 years, it's been my experience, and the experience of every individual with disabilities that I've talked to (employed or otherwise), that reality bears almost no resemblance to what the laws claim to ‘guarantee’.

I encourage people who are seeking to rejoin the workforce to ensure that they have the support system in place that can help them weather the many challenges they may encounter.
  
I've heard that there are people who have successfully made the transition from disability into or back into the workforce, without encountering the extreme barriers and challenges that I and other persons with disabilities that I've talked with have encountered.

Hopefully, some of them will post here and share what helped them to make this transition successfully.

As adults, if someone doesn't take their meds and you know they will become very sick or suicidal or something, then you need to be prepared/have an emergency line.

The first bit of advice i would suggest is taking a big metaphorical deep breath. The agencies you mentioned, and all agencies/facilities in general, can't (and shouldn't) just take your word as truth. You are going to have to provide some kind of verification for your claims, whether it's your dd-214 or the doctors ""note"" saying you have a disability. The VA can't just take in any joe schmo off the street that says ""but I swear, I was there"" and the state can't just hand out disability/ssi to anyone who says ""I'm disabled"". With all of that said, i sympathize with you for having to ""prove"" to people what you already know. It can feel like the whole system is out to get you sometimes but the only alternative would be universal health care and that's a whole other ball of wax.

**If I were you, and i think the easiest route, would be to track down a dd-214. Start with the recruiter office where you signed up or even where you went to MEPS. They keep the paper records you signed during in-processing. They wouldn't have a 214 on you but they would have your enlistment papers.

You can accept... You'll get over it. 

You can be depressed... Well... That lingers... 

But.  It is possible to learn to do much less,  have much less,  expect much less,  and try,  then even succeed to be OK. 

I never said everything will be fine and hunky dory.  A lifetime of pain and limitations in every aspect is never going to be OK if you keep expecting to get healed and stop hurting g and sign up for those tango lessons.

My longtime buddy,  a former March of dimes kid... Paraplegic,  braces,  pain... Just died two weeks ago.  50 years of living as he was,  and not as he wished to be.  

I can do no less.  I lost everything.  Everything.  I live in an old bar I used to own.  Cold running water and electricity.  My car is a beat up pos  without reverse.  Flat broke. 

But being depressed doesn't change anything.  I'm going through intensive therapy to deal with the emotional  trauma I went through. 

But I'm on my own.  

I will never be healed.  I will never be whole again.  I can only strive to be better than I am. 

And life aint fair,  and it sucks.  So I find joy in what 8 can while I rebuild my life as much as I can with what I've got.

I do use cripple as a joke, and I use spastic when I am trying to draw attention to something - be it spasms, or not fulfilling inspiration porn -so it is very much referring to the movement or the political position of being othered and pointing out that.

However, over the past few years and reading up on my politic etc, I have come to use the word sparingly - although I am not hugely against it. I would be more likely to refer to myself as a crip than as disabled, because I feel that at least in my culture (Glasgow, Scotland) direct language such as cripple is more inkeeping with my politics than disabled, which although true, refers to how society views me, but in a way that is palatable to them. 

Cripple is much more direct, and it makes people uncomfortable often, which is fine - because often that discomfort comes from the fact that they know it is true, and they understand the weight of that word comes from primarily able bodied usage of it as a slur. Spastic is similar, though still active in the medical community so is actually a descriptor of a school of movement, I do also use spastic to refer to non medical things, body popping for example, is able bodied spasticity.

223,"It's difficult, but not impossible to get approved if your only impairments are depression and anxiety.  If you're under the age of 50, it's harder still.  The easiest way is to meet a listing under the disability  bluebook :12.04 or 12.06

We would  need to see medical proof of several marked or at least one extreme limitation in several functional categories: activities of daily living; social functioning;  the capacity to maintain concentration, persistence, and pace; and repeated episodes of decompensation.  Here's what this means.

ADLs: to get a finding of a marked or extreme impairment, you would need to have such severe problems that you can't function independently.  That means significant day to day assistance from a family member, health professional, or social worker.  If you can independently shower, clothe yourself, and cook meals, you are unlikely to  get above moderate designation.

Social:  Do you have medically documented crippling panic attacks when you have to interact with anyone other than someone whom you're very close to?  Can you go out in public, even just to do things like go grocery shopping?  If the answers are no and yes respectively, then you probably don't have a marked or extreme limitation.

CPP: you would likely need to have some form of medically documented cognitive impairment, or severe recurrent panic attacks which impair your concentration in order to reach the marked or extreme level.

Decomp:  repeated episodes of decompensation, as defined in blue book section 12.00(4) means you've been hospitalized at least three times within one year, or an average of once every four months, each lasting for at least two weeks.

So yeah... It's a very high bar to meet or functionally equal a listing.  While it's possible to get approved for depression and anxiety without meeting a listing, you would need a very extensive and compelling treatment record, with treatment from specialists, showing that you have very severe symptoms despite treatment including medications.

I understand it's discouraging to hear how difficult it is to qualify for disability on the sole basis of affective disorders.  Regardless, the first step you should take is to seek the best treatment you can get -good treatment records are your best friend.

Becoming disabled is freakin expensive.

You didn't say in your post, but if you work for a small company (IIRC is 15 employees) than this is a moot conversation because they are exempt from FMLA. 

From a financial side, I think you need to think long term. Take a few months off now, maybe go into some debt, but you'll be taking care of the problem now. Then you can go back to work and start paying down the debt. 

 The reverse of that is that you keep working and try to ""push through"". But then your problems will likely get worse and you probably will get to a point that you won't be able to do your job, you'll get fired, and then risk long-term unemployment and debt.

273,"Hey there, I work at a Center for Independent Living and would like to give what little advice that I can. Unfortunately, as others have said,  there aren't many ways to increase your income without working but there are a few ways that you can augment the income that you are getting. I would definitely take a good hard look at the subsidized housing options in your area; more importantly, your primary goal should be to get a voucher for the Section 8 housing subsidy. I understand that most income based housing is, to put it politely, not ideal but they are usually the best place to start. Once you're living in the community with your own rental expenses, SSA typically increases your payment amount because your *expenses* have increased. That Section 8 voucher is your ticket to higher quality housing at an affordable rate. 

I would also look into any State run programs that you might be eligible for. Food stamps, medical assistance (in conjunction with Medicaid) and cash assistance are just some of the programs available in the state that I live in. 

Feel free to PM if you need help finding a CIL that might be able to help you look into these things. Best of luck!

I can't help but feel like I deserve it, but that time for me was something I struggled to even eat during, let alone perform normally at work. And then all that happens is I get reminded we're a team, told my performance is unacceptable and questioned as to why I'm so sick when I'm ""so young"". 

I don't even want to know how they're going to take it when I inevitably, at some point, have to show up in leg braces or similar. The more I have to expose, the more in danger I feel of being ejected from the company for being more trouble than I'm worth.

301,"&gt; I'm not sure how but my TWP was already used up in several years before I even got put on disability 

It can happen - it depends on if you were working below SGA at the time of filing. For example, if you were earning $800/mo, they could have found you disabled, but then yes - you were already using TWP months. If your allowance was retroactive, you could conceivably have used them up before you were ever approved. 



&gt;Due to the timing of my paychecks I'll end up getting an extra paycheck possibly barely putting me over the 1100 limit will I lose my benefits for this one time concurrence?

In general, we look at when the money was *earned* vs. when the money was paid, so if your schedule was the same the whole time, and the only reason you got paid 'extra' that month was because of the way the pay periods fell, you're fine. Make sure you provide pay stubs so that they can see the exact pay periods, otherwise we contact the employers and ask for the information, and in my experience, employers are idiots and give us the pay date information even though the request explicitly requests they list when it was *earned*. 

The other thing to remember is that - as HeritcalHawk listed below, if your earnings for a month are too high, you won't be due payment for that month - **but** - you need to know that you will very likely *receive* that payment anyways. 
There is not a continual review of your earnings going on - during periodic work reviews (which are most commonly initiated when you tell us about a change in your work activity), we review a retroactive period of time since the last review; during that review if it is determined that you weren't due payments that you received, you will have an overpayment. 

**Please keep track of your earnings yourself.** Not only will that help you know whether or not to agree with the decision made about SGA months, but also if there are months you aren't due payment, you can set the funds aside for later repayment. Those overpayments are *extremely difficult* to get waived, as there is almost no way to convince us that the overpayment is 100% not your fault; even if you reported it, the fact is you worked, and you should have known that you weren't due payment for those months due to your earnings.

Anyway, all the people I know with my condition that are on disability had to go in front of the ALJ to have their case approved. I somehow got approved on my first submission, and that terrifies me.

336,"Since you are on CDB/DAC benefits based off of your parent's work history, there is nothing that you can do to increase you benefits.  

CDB benefits are a form of SSDI, which, unlike SSI, can't just be reduced on a whim of someone. I don't think that it is a fair assessment that those of us who work for SSA are just ""chomping at the bit"" to reduce benefits.

343,"I see what you're saying but I kind of interpreted OP's post differently, more in the context of advocacy. Personally, I feel like there's a difference between understanding our experience and speaking for us. 

The difference really hit me recently, using a totally different example. In the place I live, the building is very old and there are colonial pieces of art on the wall depicting black people. A conversation was had about whether this is offensive/hurtful to black residents. The only people debating this were white people, most of whom were like ""nah it's not racist, it's a painting, how could it be offensive?"". There was also one gay man who was adamant that black people should take these portrayals and embrace them because that's what the LGBT community has done and it has worked for them (his words, not mine). 

I realized, as a white person myself, that regardless of what I think about the painting, it's not my place to decide whether or not it is hurtful. In fact, there is basically no validity to my opinion because I'm missing generations of context and all the daily experiences that add up to the marginalization of that group. I may be able to empathize with their marginalization because as a disabled person I have also experienced some form of marginalization (which I think is similar to what OP is saying) but I recognize that doesn't give me the right to have an opinion on their experience.

It is entirely up to the person depicted in that painting whether they find it offensive or not, some will and some won't. My job, as someone who gives a fuck about the marginalization of minorities, is to clear the space so that those people can speak their mind if they want to. I was really saddened to find out that some of these people felt scared to say how the painting made them feel because they feared they might not be able to live here anymore. We essentially shut them out of conversation.

Of course, like you say, it depends on the context of the conversation. But, if we're going to get anywhere as a rights movement we need to make sure we have a powerful voice and we need to make sure ""there is nothing about us without us"".

350,"I understand that you're upset, but please know that those if us within the bureaucracy really are doing our best, and recognize that there are real people affected by every decision we make.  I know that I periodically attend hearings in order to see and connect with claimants, and the agency as a whole absolutely pushes the message that each claimant is a real individual, not just a number.

There is a huge national backlog for disability claims and appeals -over one million cases waiting to be adjudicated at the hearing level, and tens of thousands waiting to be written once decided.  The fault is generally not with SSA employees, I promise you we are working very hard.  Judges are expected to hear in excess of 500 cases per year, and attorneys writing the cases have crazy high production requirements.  The case I'm currently working on has over 4k pages of medical records, and I am expected to review those in detail and write a legally sufficient case defensible in federal court, in under 10 hours (and I'll make it happen).  Almost everyone I know puts in extra unpaid hours against SSA regulations in order to reach our production goals.

The problem is that, as an agency, SSA and ODAR (office of disability adjudication and review) are horribly understaffed and underfunded for the workload we have.  The problem will only be exacerbated in the coming year, as we are expecting a bare bones budget.  We already have a hiring freeze in place (no new employees and can't replace those who leave), and more cuts are likely under the forthcoming administration.

It's just as frustrating for us as it is for you, I promise.  If you want change, don't blame the bureaucracy, instead look to Congress and push for them to give us adequate resources to do our jobs.

353,"I highly recommend you share the disabled unemployment statistics, and especially some select EEO cases regarding reasonable accommodation denials, refusals, challenges, etc., with the ‘therapy staff’.  

Your students NEED to become not only comfortable with, but well versed in identifying as being ‘disabled’.

I am a disabled professional, and I’ve found that trying to skirt around the term ‘disability’ is counterproductive, and can lead to denials of disabled individuals’ legally protected civil rights.  

When a person does not state that they are disabled, the person denying the disabled person’s protected civil rights has an ‘out’ – they are able to successfully defend with “but I didn’t know they were DISABLED, they never said that!”

It sounds incredulous, but it’s a common mistake people make when requesting accommodations they are legally entitled to - especially formerly able people who have become disabled, &amp; who are struggling with having to identify as a ‘disabled person’, or individuals who have been expressly instructed not to use the word ‘disabled’.

If a disabled individual makes their request for accommodation on the basis of their ‘exceptionality’ or ‘diagnosis’, whomever they are making their request to is allowed to assume that the individual does not meet the legal requirements of being ‘an individual with an ADA disability’, and consequently that the requester is not legally entitled to be provided with any accommodation.  This has been repeatedly established in case law.

If a person is requesting an accommodation at a college, a business, or an employer, that person is requesting that the other party comply with the laws requiring that they accommodate the person’s  DISABILITY.  

ALWAYS identify as a person with a disability when you are self-advocating.   ALWAYS.  This is VITAL to obtaining the needed accommodations.

Judgement after judgment, legal case after legal case, it has been ruled that the general public ‘can not be expected to, &amp; shall not be required to, recognize’ any terms aside from ‘disability’ &amp; ‘disabled’ when deciding whether or not a person is legally entitled to an accommodation.  And unless the person with a disability states that they are requesting accommodation for their disability, &amp;/or because they are disabled, anyone they are making the accommodation request to is allowed to deny their request, on the grounds that the person has not established that they are an individual who meets the legal criteria for being categorized as disabled.

Disabled is a legal designation. 

Disabled and disability are THE legal terms upon which accommodation decisions are based.  Words are the most powerful tool an individual with a disability has when they are self-advocating.  Sometimes, it is the only tool available to them.

I am one of the ‘formerly able, now severely disabled’ people who fought being labeled as ‘disabled’.  My neuromuscular disabilities are not visible.  In fact there are no outward signs that I am a severely disabled individual.

However, I am unable to open any non-ADA compliant door.  I’ve been unable to enter places of employment (due to heavy blast doors that were not compliant with ADA laws regarding accessible entrances) - including for interviews, had my requests for accommodation ‘brushed aside’ and ignored, and a whole host of other unpleasant experiences, all because I did not use the ‘magic word’ – disabled, nor self-identify as having disabilities.
  
It has been a challenge for me to self-identify as being disabled.  The stigma of being an individual with a disability can be overwhelming at times, and having to state that I am ‘disabled’, well, frankly, for lack of a better word, it sucks.

However, being denied reasonable accommodations, being trapped inside rooms that I am physically incapable of exiting without assistance, &amp; being denied basic civil rights, simply because I have an aversion to identifying as ‘disabled’ is ludicrous and has caused me far more damage, both physically and psychologically, than my uncomfortableness with this very powerful, legal designation ever has or could.

I applaud you for providing your students with the opportunity to learn self-advocating skills.  I have had to stumble through and learn them through trial and error, which is an extremely unpleasant and detrimental method for obtaining this knowledge.

If you need assistance in locating EEO discrimination claims in which the disabled individual has not received accommodations, nor compensation for this discrimination, expressly and/or exclusively because the defense claimed “we didn't know the person was disabled”, please let me know.  I am currently in a battle with my employer regarding not being provided with the approved, documented, reasonable accommodations that I was assured would be provided even before I was offered my position, &amp; I have spent countless hours combing through EEO cases.

I have been overwhelmed by the number of disabled individuals who have lost their EEO discrimination cases expressly because they did not self- identify as being “disabled”.
  
The therapy staff is beyond misguided in this matter, &amp; their instructions to you to not use the term disability with your students is detrimental to their future.   And their claims that teaching students to use the term disability is 'teaching the students to have a crutch' belies their own prejudices towards individuals with disabilities.  

To say that I am outraged at their attempt to shame disabled individuals into not using the legally required terms that will empower them to enforce their civil rights would be an understatement of grave proportions.

The Americans with Disabilities Act may be 25 years old, but society, from colleges to medical providers and businesses to employers to individuals, have not attained the level of societal acceptance of individuals with disabilities, nor obtained legal compliance with the ADA, that would allow differently able people to identify as anything other than ‘disabled’.

Honestly, I wouldn't have stated this 15 years ago.  Back when I was an able individual, I had no idea at just how little compliance there is with the ADA, and just how much discrimination anyone with a disability faces every single day.

Please feel free to private message me at any time should you need, or want, assistance in educating the therapy staff about this.  

I will do whatever I can to help prevent other individuals with disabilities from enduring even a fraction of the challenges and out right discrimination that I have endured.

And I am more than happy to educate the disinformed, misinformed, and misguided regarding such matters.   ;)",,,,UserNme_AlreadyTaken,,,1477981536,t5_2qhe8,t3_59eyp0,t3_59eyp0,4,1481105953,0,0,d9ginuc,disability,,,,,
354,"They have to turn over their records, but that's it. My psychiatrist is not required to fill out an RFC or make a statement.

Getting a letter of support from my doctor is simply a way to shore up my case. SSA isn't going to pay them for that.

Longer wait times, rushed decisions, payment errors, worse customer service, etc.  Most state DDS adjudicators make anywhere from $35-49k so States have a hard time attracting/retaining the best employees. over the last few years Congress has been pushing for more CDR reviews, and I do expect that to continue to increase.

378,"It's not that the government wants to keep you in poverty.  Well, not the SSA at least.  It's that we have very limited funds and resources.  Our budget is likely to be bare bones in the coming year (we will almost certainly have a week or two of unpaid furlough), and we've already put a hiring freeze in place, meaning we can't even replace employees who leave.  

The disability trust fund is in danger of completely running out in 2022 (it was also in danger of insolvency this past year, but was extended by the bipartisan budget act).

In order to solve the problem, we need stronger social safety nets.  However, this would require agreement by Congress and the president.  It would also require either shifting resource allocation in the budget or increasing taxes.  As you're no doubt aware, Trump was just elected president and we have a Republican Congress and House.  Increasing social safety nets like SSA disability is at the bottom of their priority list.

I am able to walk, but only short distances as my heart rate shoots through the roof just standing up.  I have certainly pushed myself too far trying to do everything and being stubborn about using my assistive devices. 

For work, I am a PhD student ad technology researcher. Luckily since I work in medical and assistive tech, most people are pretty understanding. In addition to my EDS and POTS I also have severe allergies and asthma. So, I have an air filter in the office to clean the dust which I am severely allergic to.  Fortunately my office mates all like it since it cleans their air too, haha. I also am now using a wheelchair most days, so my work area was expanded somewhat to accommodate the wheelchair. I also have a reserved parking pace up front. While yes, there is disability parking and I do have a pass, there are minimal disability spots. Because of this, I have a reserved spot for the event that the disability spot is being taken by a visitor. 

As far as who would want to hire you over an able-bodied person, well, that really depends.  Being able to do more things =/= more qualified. In my job, I mainly do research. And while I suffer fatigue and brain fog at times, I am still able to do my job and perform better than many of my able-bodied colleagues. I have brains and grit and that is what gets me through and makes me good at my job. Who cares if I can't life the boxes of paper for the printer? There are a million other people in the building who can do that, it isn't necessary for me to, nor would it make be a better researcher.

My understanding (I don't work on the medical determination side of things) is that during the initial claim, the disability determination folks have a very stringent set of rules they have to follow, with no wiggle room - but that judges have more leeway. 

In that case, the worst case scenario is that you go through with the hearing and are denied. If you have the hour or two to spare, **GO**. If you don't go, you are definitely not getting paid, but if you *do* go, there is at least a possibility.

420,"Ok, long ramble coming, covering various points:

I use crip as a joke when referring to myself sometimes or to the community as a whole in an abstract way. In the latter case, I only use it around people who know me well and only in a light-hearted way. For example, I was out once and there seemed to be a lot of people using wheelchairs around so I said something like ""Guess it's crips on trips day or something"". I only ever use it in that kind of context.

I feel that words have a history and with that history comes a certain kind of weight and tone which must be respected. So whilst I may use the word 'crip' in a jokey way, I would never use it with a serious tone and I would never refer to specific individuals directly as cripples. I like having some ownership over the word but I also feel there is some line that shouldn't be crossed.

Don't like the word spastic, really really don't like it and have never used it. Hate the words special, challenged or handicapped. I use disabled and I don't use person first language because I don't see the point but I respect that others might want to. 

I met a disabled guy from Nigeria during my studies. He'd fought so hard to leave his country to get an education and he planned to go back to help disabled people. He told me that in Nigeria, a person's title is everything in terms of social standing. So saying ""disabled person"" meant that person was totally defined by that by their entire community and could be shunned for it. He was a strong advocate for person first language because it meant you were at least a person first, disabled second. He articulated that way better than I just did but it did make me think that maybe person first language is important in certain cultures. Or maybe it's that stigma and discrimination are at different stages in different countries and so maybe the use of language in general is important. I think he would be horrified if I referred to myself or the community as cripples in front of him for example. I can see how our experiences might differ in such a way that the language that is OK for me is not OK for him.

Using the word disabled to refer to myself was something that was extremely difficult. I hated the word but mostly the problem was that I couldn't connect with it, it felt so foreign. Going to therapy and having to confront the aspects of my disability that were making my life hard kind of forced me to have to use the word and now I'm cool with it. Like, it doesn't define me, but I feel ownership over the word and ownership is a form of power.

424,"Edit: Wow, that's long. I'm shortening it. 

Well, my disorders largely are mild-to-moderate (by far my worst is anxiety) and mostly controlled by medication. Like I'm fairly certain this tremor has been around for 4 years, and covered by medication that incidentally also treats tremor. I was on Inderal for anxiety back in Summer 2012 to sometime in 2013, then I just got off Topamax three months ago when the tremors came back. Both are used to treat essential tremor.

I keep up a medical chart, note medication changes, and track symptoms. (The most thoroughly tracked are my migraines, which have two apps on the phone tracking separate data.) 

I tried three different depression meds (with three combo-meds) before I got something that really attacked my depression/anxiety. It seems the combo Wellbutrin + Pamelor is pretty effective, which suggests my depression and anxiety are caused by three different neurotransmitters. So keep trying, try to find common links in what works and what doesn't. Information is your friend. And getting information from one doctor to another is frustrating but worth it. (the most frustrating to me is that my psychiatrist and therapist theoretically share the same system being in the same damn building, but clearly don't see one-another's notes on me.) Plus, there are things like: my GP prescribed a drug my neuro is going to want to double-check, my neuro prescribed a drug that is primarily a psych drug, so my psychiatrist should know how it's working, ect.

I've found zero will to enforce even basic access laws over the past couple of years, &amp; the courts have been chipping away at the ADA with contradictory ruling after contradictory ruling.

It will take Congress vocally crying foul, &amp; calling for investigations, before the courts will choose to enforce the ADA laws as they are written (instead of creating case precedent for loopholes galore).

With the current political environment,  that's not going to happen, unfortunately.

I've actually tried every writing utensil on the link you shared, &amp; wasn't able to use any of them, unfortunately.  (Becoming disabled has been horribly expensive in so many ways!)

They all 'seem' like functional devices, but every disabled/elderly person I've talked to says the same thing I found - a few of them 'work', if you're not disabled, &amp; if you only want to sign your name once a day, at most (as even the 'working' ones cause pain &amp;/or rapid fatigue). 

That's been the biggest benefit of my daughter's inventions - she works at the issue until every aspect of the need is met, &amp; until I have a fully functional, fully usable device that gives me as close to my former, non-disabled, abilities as possible. 

OTs are AWESOME, by the way!  The ones I've been fortunate enough to know have been wonderful!  I had one ask if my daughter could accompany me more often, as she solved 3 other patients' device/AT needs during one of my visits.

459,"I'm going to assume you mean a manual chair here. There's really only one answer to this, which is: it depends. It would help if you gave an idea of what area you're looking at, meanwhile here is a list of some modifiers;

* Your chair. There are many different types of chairs. A full time user normally has an [active user chair](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independentliving.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F04%2FVoyager_Evo_HR.jpg&amp;f=1), which is a lightweight chair generally custom fit with more manoeuvrability. They are significantly more expensive than a [standard chair](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.caremedicalsource.com%2Ftools_v2%2Fresources%2F498d60b4e22c70e91315918b8ebc5040%2Fupload_images%2Fbreezy600.jpg&amp;f=1), so not everyone can afford one. There are a whole lot of things that can make your chair more customised and easier to use, including some electrical assistance devices.

* How often you use your chair. A part-time chair user will be able to have breaks to rest their arms. A full time user does not. 

* The terrain you use it on. A nice flat street will be less effort than a paved hill which is less effort than a muddy hill. Even the type of paving used makes a difference. I've never been to Copenhagen but it's an old city, and I would guess it has cobbles. These are a nightmare in a chair. The gradient of hills makes a huge difference as well, steeper hills I have to stop halfway up, put the brakes on and rest. 

* Your physical capabilities, muscle strength, grip, fatigue levels, spasticity and so on. 

* Your own body weight! When overweight, it is much harder to push your chair just because it's more weight on your arms.

* Your wheelchair skills. Being able to do a rolling wheelie for example can get you over rough terrain, but as a trade off it is much more tiring on your arms. You can also use something like a [freewheel](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Ma82e716719ba5dd1f6f0766fb6cd9cfao0%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1) which allows you to roll over rough ground without holding yourself in a wheelie. In the same vein, being able to pop up and down kerbs rather than look for a kerb drop (which are often not available) makes a huge difference. If I have to go find a kerb drop, I can spend another ten minutes looking. If I can pop on and off the pavement, that's a lot of time and pushing energy saved as I can just cross where I am. 

* Weather. Ice is my nightmare as I have much less grip. Snow is also a nuisance. Rain is only a problem when going from outdoors to indoors, notably on buses as even with brakes on your chair will slide if it has wet wheels. Having to hold your chair in place on a moving bus is tiring.

So when I see people in here and other threads telling people to ""get over it and calm down"" it isn't very helpful. Everyone is still processing this election it's not been 24 hours even. The wounds are still fresh. It doesn't make any of us who have fears think at all positively about the kind of people on the side of Trump and the republicans. It reinforces the negative feelings we get when we think about the future. Educate and inform us.

While it's very unpredictable and has left me stranded a couple of times, it makes me feel somewhat independent since I don't have to always depend on my sister. You buy coupon books from the bus terminal at $30 for 15 coupons. You then use these coupons with eligible taxis. 1 coupon travels up to 4 miles I believe.

511,"CDRs are mandated by the government to ensure that people are on the rolls who need to be on the rolls. A lot of people are allowed for conditions that do improve, and these impairments need to be re-evaluted regularly. In order to be fair, ALL cases are reviewed.

With CDRs, we are not looking to get you off the rolls, despite what people may say. We are looking to see how you were when you are allowed and how you are now. Most psychologists, no matter how good or bad, keep fairly consistent notes indicating improvement, decompensations, suicidal ideations, medication reactions, etc. If your psychologist's notes are insufficient, DDS will sent you to a doctor (at DDS's expense) to get a current mental status exam.

My best advice is to not ask the doctor to write anything, even informally, in your notes. Nothing makes me roll my eyes more than seeing ""patient wants disability form filled out"" or ""patient needs limitations documented"". Medical evidence SHOWS what your disabilities are. Hospital records show your suicide attempts, your severe decompensations. 

Substance abuse is a tricky issue, but if your medications are prescribed, even if they are narcotics, they cannot be held against you. What raises red flags is going to multiple hospitals and prescribers to get medications, but this still isn't a make-or-break. For mental health, SSA realizes a lot of people self-medicate, and that is taken into account as part of the disease. Substance abuse is not an automatic black mark denial.

SSA isn't just looking at if you are articulate enough to get hired. We're looking at if you could sustain and maintain employment. We really don't want to deny deserving people, despite the rumors.

Your degenerative disc disease will be evaluated as a new condition if the disability examiner decides you have had medical improvement. If there is no medical improvement, your DDD is a moot point, because you are still unable to work.

Fill out the paperwork to your best ability. Call the examiner if you need to and explain you have the paperwork, but are struggling to fill it out and may require extra time. Communication with your analyst is essential; don't just let the deadline lapse with no contact; this CAN lead to a denial. 

What questions have I missed, or what are you still worried about? I'm happy to help however I can. I realize you're going to be anxious no matter what, but a CDR review IS completely routine and normal. EVERYONE on SSI/SSDI has to go through one at some point.

for:

&gt;• out-of-pocket expenses you incur or expect to  incur, for example, the cost of getting evidence. Our authorization is not needed for such expenses.

They will take money from you for the next however many months necessary to ""pay back"" the money that they gave you for the month you were ""ineligible"" (the month you had the $2000). If that money sat there too long, they could have decided you did something sketchy and suspended your payments in which case you have to call them and sort of explain what happened. You are not the first person that has happened to. 

It's a grey area since it's not income and it's not technically ""your"" money since it's loan money. There's a way to argue that if you present it carefully to social security and you get someone sympathetic on the phone. The best case scenario is going to be though, if you revived a payment in the month(s) that you had more than $2k in your account, social security is going to dock your future payments for several months to recoup that months or months until it is paid back.

536,"I get your frustration. However, there are a lot of things you say in your post that are somewhat unfair.

Adjudicators have to make decisions within the realm of policy they did not create, nor necessarily agree with. This policy is set by SSA, and the adjudicators have no say in enforcing it. Administrative law judges do NOT have to rule within these boundaries. So while you were allowed by an ALJ, it does not mean the initial decisions were wrong. It simply means the adjudicators' decisions were within policy the ALJ did not necessarily have to adjudicate within. 

As an adjudicator, I do know my claimants are people. I do want to call and ask how they are doing, but I simply do not have time. I have requirements that I am expected to make- I have production requirements. I have to read and adjudicate a certain number of cases a quarter and year. These requirements are SET BY CONGRESS. If I call every claimant every few months to just ask how he/she is doing, I will never make my numbers, and more than that, the people I don't get to will have to wait longer. Also, once your case has a decision made, it leaves that adjudicator's caseload. So, while you were waiting for a hearing with the administrative law judge, your claim was not with an adjudicator. There was no one to call to check on your. Your case was pending with the ALJ. 

This will seem harsh, but we cannot concern ourselves with issues outside of your disability. I am truly sorry about your mother's death and the circumstances surrounding it, but if everyone's personal and budgetary issue are taken into account, no cases would ever be adjudicated. There are strict ways that cases are adjudicated, and examiners have to adjudicate within these policies. And the weather is beyond anyone's control, so the fact that your hearing was pushed back a few months is not anyone's fault.

I do not know any adjudicators who use a fake name. I do not give out my last name due to the nature of my job, but I do not use a fake name. I try my best not to be a ""faceless bureaucrat"", as you put it. 

I try to make decisions that are correct based on policy and what medical evidence shows. Unfortunately, most claimants have no idea what those policies are or how social security decisions are made. Did you consult the disability blue book [here](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm) to see how you were being evaluated? Did you educate yourself on the process?

However, there are a lot of things you say in your post that are somewhat unfair.

Adjudicators have to make decisions within the realm of policy they did not create, nor necessarily agree with. This policy is set by SSA, and the adjudicators have no say in enforcing it. Administrative law judges do NOT have to rule within these boundaries. So while you were allowed by an ALJ, it does not mean the initial decisions were wrong. It simply means the adjudicators' decisions were within policy the ALJ did not necessarily have to adjudicate within. 

As an adjudicator, I do know my claimants are people. I do want to call and ask how they are doing, but I simply do not have time. I have requirements that I am expected to make- I have production requirements. I have to read and adjudicate a certain number of cases a quarter and year. These requirements are SET BY CONGRESS. If I call every claimant every few months to just ask how he/she is doing, I will never make my numbers, and more than that, the people I don't get to will have to wait longer. Also, once your case has a decision made, it leaves that adjudicator's caseload. So, while you were waiting for a hearing with the administrative law judge, your claim was not with an adjudicator. There was no one to call to check on your. Your case was pending with the ALJ. 

This will seem harsh, but we cannot concern ourselves with issues outside of your disability. I am truly sorry about your mother's death and the circumstances surrounding it, but if everyone's personal and budgetary issue are taken into account, no cases would ever be adjudicated. There are strict ways that cases are adjudicated, and examiners have to adjudicate within these policies. And the weather is beyond anyone's control, so the fact that your hearing was pushed back a few months is not anyone's fault.

I do not know any adjudicators who use a fake name. I do not give out my last name due to the nature of my job, but I do not use a fake name. I try my best not to be a ""faceless bureaucrat"", as you put it. 

I try to make decisions that are correct based on policy and what medical evidence shows. Unfortunately, most claimants have no idea what those policies are or how social security decisions are made. Did you consult the disability blue book [here](<URL>) to see how you were being evaluated? Did you educate yourself on the process?

538,"You might swing by a higher end store like Nordstrom and explain what you've got going on. I have all sorts of specific things I can't have in shoes to accommodate my gait issues from my CP. This girl who helped me last week was SOOOOO helpful. She sent me home with a bunch of squishy pads to add in shoes to help them fit me comfortably. I got a $115 pair of flats. She also helped me figure out that one foot is size 4.5 and the other 5.5, which probably has a lot to do with my shoe issues because i've been wearing 6's for... forever.. Also, if you need a shoe that is 1.5 sizes bigger (iirc, also includes if you need one wide and one regular width or whatever) they'll give you the two different sizes and only charge you for the price of one pair so you don't have to buy two pairs of shoes. IIRC, they donate the shoes to an organization that sells shoes to folks who only need one shoe for like $30! :) Just ask for help and see if they can find something that fits for you. Or ask your doctor for a specific note. Follow up with your HR department about whatever is needed for a reasonable accommodation. If your doctor won't help you, find a new doctor. Seriously. None of my current doctors diagnosed me with CP but they do everything they can to help make my life just a little bit easier... even if it is as simple as asking my University to allow me to have my finals proctored at the library instead of taking a cab to a town pretty far away to take my final in person (applies only to online classes). My doctor filled out the form without hesitation. I think they charged me like $15 and that was totally fine! Sometimes employers can just be forgiving and not need a note, but speak to HR first (not your manager).

Yes, in most typical Mental Health cases, reviews are conducted 3 years later, after the Hearing date. I'm not in that boat. 

I even skated on VERY THIN ICE by doing some light, easy, ""fake"" office File Clerk work FOR PAY for a year or so right until the Hearing(I was basically coerced into working by my Landlord and it nearly blew up in my face at the Hearing). My Attorney and I explained that the job was only a few hours per week and I got to come in and leave the Accounting Office (Of a Drug Rehab-see a theme?) whenever I felt like it and didn't have to work at all if I was having a ""bad day"". The whole, real, reason that I was given the job was partly Clinical in nature-to get me to stop isolating in my apartment,and interact with people, and also contribute something to  ""give back"" to the Rehab that I had been a Resident in for 4 months before getting a real apartment with a real legally binding Lease.

 If I said ""No"" to the job, I may have lost my place and became homeless. The place I'm talking about is dirty: Incompetent, Corrupt, another 12 Step Based Recruitment Center with a tight clan at the Top Administration Level. It is a Glorified Homeless Shelter: No real Treatment is offered or provided. Counseling is a matter of Counselors filling out the necessary paperwork to keep the whole Operation up and running without losing (even more) funding or Grants. It is a SHADY 501(C)3 Rehab that clients get Stockholm Syndrome for if the are treated well. I once had this delusional thinking. I'm going on a Tangent but Rehab and 12 Step ARE THE SAME THING. THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE...But in the 1980's AA became the Monolithic sole source of ""Recovery"" from Addiction/Alcohol Abuse. If you are in AA or NA, and don't like this, know that I am not attacking the individual members. It is the Group, The Club, The 501(c)3 AAWS and NAWS that I have major issues with.

I stated to the judge who kept attacking me from all angles, that as long as I was out of my room and physically in the Accounting Office, they'd pay me Minimum Wage for my time present there. Which is  the truth. 

However, I did definitely do stuff that would be considered ""work"" by organizing tons of Accounting papers and putting them where they belonged in file cabinets. Do NOT do what I did.DO NOT WORK AT ALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN AWAITING A DISABILITY HEARING. Not even light work. 

 I should have refused to work that job, which the CFO of the Rehab and my Landlord collaborated on to get me some busywork for the sake of doing something productive. And so it was less file work for the real, salaried employees. Work for work's sake. Why did my Landlord care what I was doing with my free time? Because at this nutty 12 Step Housing Complex, it is Subsidized Housing and considered a modified Section 8 deal. Not true Section 8. No Voucher to move elsewhere. But very similar. The Landlord wanted/needed to show to the County Housing Agency that I was doing something ""good"" and ""productive"" with my time. So my funding was justified. I wasn't just ""sleeping all day."" In truth, at least half of the Tenants do NOTHING all day, except go to Mandatory Group Meetings once per day.

The Landlord is all too familiar with Disability Cases, so my assumption is that she never thougnt I had a chance of winning my Case to begin with, based on my age, her potentially bigoted views, and her misunderstsnding of my work history and complete lack of comprehension of what is wrong with me. 

My problem is that on the outside, I can appear calm, focused, maybe even happy or ""normal"" , and functional as if nothing is wrong with me. My Landlord was being Pragmatic and making one of the Queen Bee's Drones leave the Hive to show evidence of some ""Rehabilitation"" and that I was trying to be a good productive member of Society, to an extent, which they could prove with Pay Stubs. Grrr...

What the Queen Bee failed to notice was that I was, at the the time, volunteering out in the Summer Florida Heat at a Wildlife Sanctuary, Aviary and Exotic  Animal exhibit at a Science Museum. I did that all on my own. No one asked me or told me to get an unpaid volunteer job. Yet I did, so I could be less Self-Incarcerated. 

More to come...someone is going to figure out the identity of this facility. I will not mention it by Name. Let its Staff Members and Board Of Trustees give me the grief. If you are an outsider or a Stepper, do not criticize me for not following the herd. Thank you.

My Attorney and I explained that the job was only a few hours per week and I got to come in and leave the Accounting Office (Of a Drug Rehab-see a theme?) whenever I felt like it and didn't have to work at all if I was having a ""bad day"". The whole, real, reason that I was given the job was partly Clinical in nature-to get me to stop isolating in my apartment,and interact with people, and also contribute something to  ""give back"" to the <LOCATION> that I had been a Resident in for 4 months before getting a real apartment with a real legally binding Lease.

 If I said ""No"" to the job, I may have lost my place and became homeless. The place I'm talking about is dirty: Incompetent, Corrupt, another 12 Step Based Recruitment Center with a tight clan at the Top Administration Level. It is a Glorified Homeless Shelter: No real Treatment is offered or provided. Counseling is a matter of Counselors filling out the necessary paperwork to keep the whole Operation up and running without losing (even more) funding or Grants. It is a SHADY 501(C)3 Rehab that clients get Stockholm Syndrome for if the are treated well. I once had this delusional thinking. I'm going on a Tangent but <LOCATION> and 12 Step ARE THE SAME THING. THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE...But in the 1980's AA became the Monolithic sole source of ""Recovery"" from Addiction/Alcohol Abuse. If you are in AA or NA, and don't like this, know that I am not attacking the individual members. It is the Group, The Club, The 501(c)3 AAWS and NAWS that I have major issues with.

I stated to the judge who kept attacking me from all angles, that as long as I was out of my room and physically in the Accounting Office, they'd pay me Minimum Wage for my time present there. Which is  the truth. 

However, I did definitely do stuff that would be considered ""work"" by organizing tons of Accounting papers and putting them where they belonged in file cabinets. Do NOT do what I <URL> NOT WORK AT ALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN AWAITING A DISABILITY HEARING. Not even light work. 

 I should have refused to work that job, which the CFO of the <LOCATION> and my <PERSON> collaborated on to get me some busywork for the sake of doing something productive. And so it was less file work for the real, salaried employees. Work for work's sake. Why did my <PERSON> care what I was doing with my free time? Because at this nutty 12 Step Housing Complex, it is Subsidized Housing and considered a modified Section 8 deal. Not true Section 8. No Voucher to move elsewhere. But very similar. The <PERSON> wanted/needed to show to the County Housing Agency that I was doing something ""good"" and ""productive"" with my time. So my funding was justified. I wasn't just ""sleeping all day."" In truth, at least half of the Tenants do NOTHING all day, except go to Mandatory Group Meetings once per day.

The <PERSON> is all too familiar with Disability Cases, so my assumption is that she never thougnt I had a chance of winning my Case to begin with, based on my age, her potentially bigoted views, and her misunderstsnding of my work history and complete lack of comprehension of what is wrong with me. 

My problem is that on the outside, I can appear calm, focused, maybe even happy or ""normal"" , and functional as if nothing is wrong with me. My <PERSON> was being Pragmatic and making one of the Queen Bee's Drones leave the Hive to show evidence of some ""Rehabilitation"" and that I was trying to be a good productive member of Society, to an extent, which they could prove with Pay Stubs. Grrr...

What the Queen Bee failed to notice was that I was, at the the time, volunteering out in the Summer <LOCATION> Heat at <LOCATION>, Aviary and Exotic  Animal exhibit at a Science Museum. I did that all on my own. No one asked me or told me to get an unpaid volunteer job. Yet I did, so I could be less Self-Incarcerated. 

More to <URL>meone is going to figure out the identity of this facility. I will not mention it by Name. Let its Staff Members and Board Of Trustees give me the grief. If you are an outsider or a Stepper, do not criticize me for not following the herd. Thank you.

Thank You for addressing my particular issues. You answered questions before I had time to ask them. If I wasn't falling asleep, I'd fix and edit my posts.

This isn't your typical halfway house but they have me micro-managed and can independently verify things like my fear of leaving my room too much because my neighbors are clinically psychotic and dangerous and violent.

577,"It requires so little forethought and effort to do it right the first time. So infuriating. Instead things get done cheap and lazy, then you're left trying to fix or adapt someone else's half-assed work.

A place I frequent recently had its whole parking lot redone. Even though the building is for and full of disabled peeps, they did not consider that much at all when planning their construction. They made spaces narrower, so if you don't get a designated handicap spot and use a walker/wheelchair/scooter, there is little chance you'll be able to side-load. They moved many of the handicap spaces *further away*. 

OMG, and so many others things. It's a huge disgrace.

They turned a reasonably accessible parking lot into a considerably less accessible one simply by putting zero thought into it beforehand. They even had to come back after and redo large parts to instill some level of accessibility, though still a long way from how decent it used to be. A huge lump sum payed to the city from the taxpayers, and they do it cheap as possible in order to maximize the profits they pocket. Pardon me, I'm just livid over this kind of stuff lately.

 There is a lot of Nepotism from Staff Members who were hired solely because of their AA or NA Membership. And they are for the most part, incompetent to help people such as myself. They hire their own Tenants as Staff Members. I'm in a nightmare. They, my <PERSON> and her Staff who control my life, aren't truly concerned about my well-being. I fear for my safety. The Staff is just here for a <LOCATION> from the Parent 501(c)3 that runs the show here, and people work here to gain acceptance from their 12 Step Club that they belong to. 

I live on a Cult Compound. How the hell  can I be improved, mentally, or functionally??? The Controlling Management and <PERSON> encourage we do absolutely nothing....except go to 12 Step meetings and return back in time for curfew.

I'm not fishing for sympathy but my mental state collapsed when my physical state (my back) fell apart. I'm still in my 30's. I can't live another 30 feeling like this. I can't. Read up on how sciatica feels.

603,"I understand it's discouraging, but I promise you that the process isn't dragged out in an effort to get petitioners to drop their claims.

The simple fact of the matter is that the system is overloaded.  There are over one million cases waiting to be heard by judges nation wide.  While we are trying hard to address it (we just hired around 200 new judges), we have limited funds.  SSA budget for hiring is almost certainly frozen next year, as we're so underfunded as an agency that we may have to go on unpaid leave for a week or two.

Every day, we push hard to get out as many cases as possible.  Each judge hears numerous cases per day, and they typically work long hours in order to adequately review cases beforehand.  Attorneys such as myself review cases prior to hearings and help the judges reach conclusions.  We also write the decisions, and each decision requires that we carefully review the entire medical record ave make compelling legal arguments.  A good argument takes time to write, and most of the attorneys I work with sneak in extra unpaid hours to meet the crazy high case quotas we're given.

604,"It's complicated. I usually did not see deafness as a 'true disability' -- as in, I would quite literally forget that I was even deaf most of the time. But as I grew older, I started understanding the public's disdain for any kind of accommodation, being ignored in conversations even with family, and I developed deep fears of holding my SO back (he's hearing) and a huge sense of inadequancy and self-hate for not being on the same level as my peers (although that one does have a lot less to do with deafness, and more so with depression).

I cry myself to sleep sometimes. Now I feel like I am disabled. I truly understand people now who are deaf, but were raised in a deaf-friendly environment *and* had deaf parents and/or deaf siblings, who didn't feel like they were missing a sense and were more confident in themselves for it, who went to school and weren't left behind or had a lot of advocacy back-up... I understand exactly why they don't consider themselves disabled. 

And I wish I had that. I will never regret meeting my SO, and under no circumstances would I have considered not dating him or ever dropping him at any time, but with family... friends... it's painful. He understands. I think that because he is a polyglot, that's why he understands my high-pitched speech with some pronounciation difficulties a lot easier, and he tries his best to support me and be there for me. But most people don't even do the bare minimum, even some of my friends. And that makes me feel like shit.

I'm not sure how much he will receive per month; I get $850 for having one eye and severe hearing loss, which is all gone after paying rent and hospital bills for replacing my retinal prophylactic so I'm basically living off of microwaved dinners -- but I am also a single male who only worked for a total of eight years.  Since your dad worked for much longer, he will probably be able to afford a better quality of life.  Again, not sure how much he would receive but it'll be substantial due to his many years of being a productive member of society who contributed to the economy.

That said, my office of disability services is quite clear that no accommodation can fundamentally alter the basics of a course, such as a lab, which has required attendance and group work, exams, papers, etc. I do not believe ""no group projects"" is a reasonable accommodation so you should come up with a plan for how you will manage that.

644,"&gt; It sickens me how willing the government is to keep the disabled in poverty and terrible living conditions.

I realize that this is a stressful situation for you, but making comments about how the government is just out to screw people is not a fair statement. If that were true there would be NO SSI/SSDI program. 

You have to look at things as a whole. Lets say you get $1000/mo cash ($12,000/yr) in benefits. You also have to factor in all of the non-monetary benefits that you get. 

* HUD housing: capped at 30% - you pay $300 for a market rate $600 apartment (total savings of $3600/yr)

* Medicaid/Medicare: being on disability gives you access to free/reduced healthcare. If you were working, you'd likely have to pay $100/mo in premiums on top of copays, etc. So lets give it an average of $200/mo; that comes out to $2400/yr. 

* Other state benefits: TANF, or food stamps, lets say you're eligible for $100 worth of stuff per month ($1200/yr)

So just in housing, healthcare, and state assistance that is an additional $7,200 per year in benefits that you are getting that aren't straight cash. that doesn't include other incentives like discounted bus fares, reduced utilities, reduced car registration, etc. 

As a country we have decided to take care of our disabled population through the SSI and SSDI programs. Would it be great if everyone was able to get $25,000/year in benefits? Sure. But on a pragmatic level, how do we pay for that? There are something like 15 million people on disability right now, that would add billions of dollars to the national debt.

I don't claim to know how certain groups feel at all.

What I mean is---I can empathize with how minority groups get frustrated with majority groups telling them how to feel.

As someone with many privileges, I see how I used to be an ignorant person who is a majority group who has poo-pooed others in minority groups because I put my feelings above theirs. 

And I know every PWD has a different feeling on certain things--but I hate when able-bodied people speak for us. I'm not meaning to single out anybody. From online places it seems PWDs tend to have majority and minority opinions (ie it seems the majority of people take offense to the word ""retarded"") but I'm just saying that only those of us with disabilities can speak for ourselves. I can point out specific majority opinions the outspoken PWDs within the diabetic community have, for example. But I still respect opposing views.

I have limited hand strength &amp; dexterity, &amp; using my phone can be challenging at times.

I was sooo glad for the case with a built in stand - the i-Blason  (description &amp; link to a pic are at the bottom of this post).

I don't use the stand as a stand - I use it to help me hold my phone. I slide the ring &amp; middle fingers of my left hand into the opening made by the kick stand, my pinky &amp; index fingers are on either side of the kickstand, &amp; I'm able to brace my thumb against the side (which puts it in a good position for emergency grabbing of my phone, should I angle my hand down too much).

I use a Samsung s6 (not the note kind), &amp; the only thing I don't like is the manual 'home button' (it's challenging for me to depress, especially as the day wears on). Fortunately, there are tons of workarounds for this. And, since he's been using a flip phone, I doubt one button is going to cause him trouble.

Anything that can show how much care you require is going to help. If you appeal, go into it prepared with this documentation.

Say she had to have a  full-time job, so 40 hrs *plus* whatever commute time would be.

686,"As you've seen below there are a whole bunch of solutions for people with reduced grip who still want to use a manual chair. An adaptation will normally be to the chair itself rather than a hand brace, as fully supportive braces tend to extend into the hand and actually make grip worse. Something like a thick grippy glove is an option for some but it really depends on the level of grip issue. 

Generally speaking it's better to use a manual (self propelled) as long as possible, it's more exercise, better circulation, less muscle atrophy which is important in so many illnesses. You can get manual wheelchairs with many adaptations including electric wheels which can be turned off and on for those who have fluctuating or deteriorating conditions, and want the benefits of a manual chair for as long as possible. 

A lot goes into choosing a wheelchair so I would suggest your friend is assessed by a wheelchair specialist, who through the NHS is normally a specific physiotherapist or OT. They will be able to have a proper chat about his condition as  a full time wheelchair is a very custom-fit piece of kit. They may lend him a chair to see how he manages, they're not right for everyone. If you live in Scotland and are/should be a full-time chair user, you will normally be offered an active user chair, which is a lighter chair for those who still have good mobility. Part-time chair users or those without good balance are also given chairs but slightly different options. Electric wheelchairs are notoriously difficult to get and most people buy them privately. In England no matter what your level of mobility you are given an assessment, some recommendations and a vouchers towards the cost of a chair, which is normally something like 10% of the actual cost. Electric wheelchairs are again even harder to get. I cannot comment for Wales and N. Ireland. 

As he is working he also has the option of the [Access to Work](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work/overview) scheme - this pays for equipment to keep those with disabilities in work, including wheelchairs. They do cover active user chairs and e-assist wheels, and also do assessments. I strongly suggest he takes advantage of this as it's a fantastic scheme and covers things like e-assist wheels and different wheel rims which are never covered on the NHS. 

The other option of course is something like a [rollator](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fbonanzleimages%2Fafu%2Fimages%2F2367%2F9241%2F34%2F__57.jpg&amp;f=1), a rolling walker for people who are struggling with a stick but not quite ready to use a wheelchair. The benefit of a rollator is that you're still exercising your legs and as they all have an inbuilt seat, you can sit down any time there's a bit of a wobble. They do not require good grip and are becoming more and more popular due to their light weight and ease to transport. These are also available through Access to Work or if he wants to buy privately, there are many second hand rollators out there in excellent condition.

688,"Hi there.  First of all, I wouldn't worry about having applied for SSI for your child.  The worst that can happen is that you get declined.  Without seeing the record, I can't say whether you will get approved, but from what you've said, it sounds like applying was a good idea given the scope of your child's birth defects and need for physical therapy.

The only hitch is that, even if your child medically qualifies, you may not be entitled to aid if you or your spouse have income/resources in excess of the income/resource benefits ceiling.

Regarding the call, I'm not sure what is said there, as I'm higher up in the appeals process, but it will likely be fairly basic questions.  There's no reason to be nervous about it.

I do think, though, that with this change in administration and leadership, we will probably see some adjustment to the disability rules (making it more difficult to obtain) and an increase in the frequency of CDR reviews.  New administration or not, these have been issues for a while that need to be addressed. 

It will also be interesting how they handle the budgets for the State DDSs and also how they treat us Federal Workers.

700,"PIP isn't designed to be helpful really, sorry to hear it's giving you a shitty time. Disclaimer: I have been through the PIP process but I have a totally different condition to you and I have not been through the appeals process. Not sure if what I'll say is helpful but I know how stressful it is so I'll try my best.

What I would say is that you need to answer questions with your worst possible day in mind (especially if you're someone for whom things vary from day to day). As disabled people, we're so used to trying to convince people that we can do things that it's actually quite hard to get into this mindset of straight up saying that we cannot do something in a clear and concise way. 

So don't say things like ""Walking causes me to feel tired and therefore I find it hard"". Instead say ""My condition causes significant and overwhelming fatigue which prevents me from being able to walk more than X metres"". Don't say ""I know how to cook but I injure myself when doing so and so I don't do it"". Say ""I cannot cook because the exhaustion that my condition causes me prevents me from being able to carry out simple tasks like using the cooker etc (insert more examples)"".

I think the mistake a lot of people make is that they try to over-explain things and they mess it up in the process. Keep it simple/blunt and always try to make it clear that you can't do X, make sure you always start off with that.

734,"This is a common complaint, that the psychiatrist is not keeping detailed enough notes or does not paint an accurate picture. This is why we have function reports and third party function reports to get a sense of how you and significant people in your life believe you to be functioning. Most psychiatrists, no matter how busy, keep fairy detailed records. Even if you didn't see him writing, he might have done it later. There will typically be evaluations, mental status exams, and response to medications, as well as typical session notes. Template exams (the same thing over and over in each visit) do raise a red flag for examiners, so if your doctor did not keep good or significant notes, that might trigger the examiner to get a consultative examination on you. 

Understandably, you're nervous that your records will not show the totality of your condition, but we will make sure to have enough records one way or another. Make sure you will fill out your function report accurately; don't exaggerate to make up for what you think will be incomplete medical records (we see this a lot). Just be as honest and truthful as you can. 

While not being compliant with medications isn't good, with mental health cases, it's like substance abuse. It's considered, but recognized as something that is tied into the mental health condition. It's not an automatic denial. 

I promise, we've seen almost every type of medical record, good and bad. We receive ongoing training, and every case has to be received by a DDS doctor to be signed off on to ensure we are interpreting the medical evidence correctly.

737,"I seriously doubt you're going to find something pre-built that is functional for those steps. 

Almost everywhere, wheelchair ramps have to be 12"" long for every 1"" of rise to meet ADA/code requirements. That looks like 3 steps, so we'll call it 24"". That means that, to be to code, your ramp would have to be 24 *feet* long. If you own the building and know when it will be expected, you could get away with an 8:1 ratio (16 feet of ramp) and have it be workable, but it will be very difficult. If you don't own the building and install a shorter ramp, the building could be hit with a very large fine, which would probably end with you having to pay it or be thrown out.

At the end of the day, though, there is another consideration besides just building code. A ramp with an 8:1 ratio is nearly impossible to get up in a manual wheelchair and begins to put you at real risk of tipping in both manual and power chairs. Once or twice might be fine, but when you start talking about daily use you're risking real injury.

Some applications (like for getting a chair in a car) aren't subject to the above restrictions because the ramps are removed after every use, and are intended to be used with an empty wheelchair. You might find a 64"" suitcase ramp for a car, but it isn't going to hold up well to being left outside, they are super narrow, and there is nothing you can do to prevent it from being stolen.

The best thing to do is get a ""permanent"" ramp built, but not ""affixed"" to the property. So, a huge wooden ramp that can't be moved, but also isn't cemented in place and is intended to be broken down when you move. Unfortunately, I don't know that you have enough room/length to do that without impairing your door.

If you do have the room, but were trying to avoid the ""cost"" of a permanent ramp, some places like Habitat for Humanity will help build one for low/no cost for folks in need.

There are companies who use metal/abs to create temporary ramps that you rent for as long as you need them, but they stick to code requirements and are generally much more expensive than traditional ramps, in my experience.

741,"Is this an FMLA form? Most employers want you to fill those out if you have a planned medical absence or might need time off. FMLA offers you 12 weeks of protection for your job while you take care of yourself. 

I would avoid quitting if you can. It is highly unlikely that you will get approved disability, especially for something that is a recent onset and that should get better over time (since the etiology of this decompensation is your husband). 

My best advice is take some time off (although you have job protection they don't have to pay you) to work on you. Once you come back see if there are any reasonable accommodations they can make. Maybe change your job duties a bit to something with less interaction with others. Finally, if that fails, you might need to just look for a different job.
