See, military stuff is all about function, and flight suits are built for guys whose job it is to sit in a cramped cockpit for hours on end. It's not a *perfect* parallel for wheelchair users -- but it's damn close (source: I've been both). There's lots of pockets in play here, and a few notably absent.

ABSENT: Basically all conventional pockets. No buttcheek pockets, no hip pockets. This is *dramatically* more comfortable when sitting for long periods -- all that stitching on your butt is no bueno.

PRESENT:

- Side thigh pocket on one side. Better access when seated, and stuff doesn't rest on your lap, so that's a plus. 

- Front/top thigh pocket on the other side. Less useful most of the time, but you really don't need more than one side pocket.

These things are *awesome*.

- Knife pocket on the inner thigh. Not really practical for, well, anybody, but you could put like a cell phone pocket in the same place maybe if you really wanted, it's not intrusive.

- Calf pockets on both sides. These are *also amazing* and it's dead space on most pants. For good reason, I mean, if you're walking around you don't want to always be smacking your stack of quarters against your shinbone. But if you're seated, they're epic. 

NOT PANTS BUT STILL POCKETS THOUGH

- Breast pockets. Big, deep breast pockets. Flippin' great.

- Sleeve pockets, various -- also great. If you're looking for ways to get more functional pockets, but you just can't make pants that do the job, these upper-arm pockets might be a work-around. 

Most of these are zippered, but there's a bit of velcro mixed in here and there (mostly useless -- we usually cut off the velcro parts so we don't have to fiddle with them).

22,"I don't mind, it is a rather reoccurring topic in my life actually.

My main experiences comes from a long term partner with mild CP, and several partners and ""complications"" in the autistic spectrum.

The problems we ran into was mostly that my partner with CP refused to admit that he had it. He hid it for me for a year, and I then just assumed he was clumsy. Since he was so ashamed of it as he was, we never found ways to deal with it, at all. I do suspect it was a part of why his mental health was not quite good, something that was a part of why we parted ways. I was quite young when this was going on, and he was my first serious partner.

When it comes to autism, it has been both easier, and more difficult. OCD is a hell of a bitch. So is minds that fixates on a issue, and refuses to let go. A partner of mine could bring up, more then a year after it happened, that I used the wrong towel for something.

30,"I have no idea what program you're applying for, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. 

Regardless of whether this is temporary or permanent disability, the one big thing you need to focus on is how this impacts your daily life. You seem to be on the right track, but you need to really hammer that in. 

Lethargy, and poor sleep usually isn't enough as it describes half the first world population. What makes your condition different from every other overworked and poorly slept individual? How do you struggle to cope where they manage to muddle through? This is a good place to focus on your depression, social issues, and whatever other difficulties you have due to your condition and its effects. Keep it evidence based, and try to avoid talking about emotions if you want to dodge that teenage tone. ""My depression causes this..."" and not ""My depression makes me feel like...""

The other big thing to focus on is your treatment and medication. What you have tried, and how they have / haven't worked for you. If you have plenty of treatment options before you that could help or cure, then you're going to have a near impossible uphill battle with your petition --unless we're talking about temporary disability. 

Disability applications world round tend to have one thing in common, and that's to show how you've failed. They try to weed out those who are looking for an easy solution to those who are looking for a last resort. If you can show you've tried treatments, you've tried to better yourself, you've been to work, and all this has failed you should have a pretty solid case.

The final result was the girl I ended up marrying, 11 years ago, and I told her after six days of regular online communication.

53,"I am obese because of my disability. Granted, the definition of obesity has become extremely broad, so while I am technically obese as a 5'7"" woman weighing 220lbs., I wear ""only"" extra large clothing (14-16), fit with room to spare in airplane seats, etc., so I don't think that I physically portray what most people think of when they think of the word obese.

Regardless, I have gained about 50 pounds over the course of a decade directly due to my disability. I have a severe digestive disorder, and one of the many ways it is treated is by following an extreme low residue diet. People don't believe me that this is a diet when I explain it, but a quick search on the Mayo Clinic website proves otherwise. I cannot digest fruits, vegetables, or fiber. All that I can eat is meat, dairy, and plain old, no nutritional value, white flour carbohydrates.

Of course, people hear this and start arguing immediately that I could still maintain a healthy weight if I eat nothing but skinless chicken, hard cheese, egg whites, etc. That doesn't work because part of my condition is greatly exacerbated by a stomach filled with excess quantities of bile. I also have gastroparesis, which is the very slow emptying of the stomach, including all of this acidic bile. The bottom line is that I have to eat carbs and sugar frequently to neutralize and absorb the bile, and I have to eat every few hours, to keep the stomach working, because with gastroparesis. It is a lot healthier to never let the stomach rest, then to let it rest and then have to digest foods from a complete stop.

So, since I have not found any way to eat less than 2500 to 3000 calories a day when it is necessary to eat a certain portion of carbohydrates every few hours, I will continue to gain weight over the course of my lifetime. Since I deal with much more severe risks due to my condition, like stomach seizures, ileus, bowel impactions, risk of intestinal tears, etc., maintaining or losing weight is the furthest thing from my medical teams' minds.",,,,IckyBelly,,,1463059254,t5_2qhe8,t3_49puwy,t3_49puwy,1,1465804797,0,0,d32mksv,disability,1,,,,

66,"&gt;Most disability programs are happy to help, but only when you really need it.

That really depends on what country one is in and what type of disability program one is talking about. In the US, Social Security Disability *Insurance* is based on one's medical condition, and has nothing to do with financial need. As long as one has amassed enough ""credits"" from having worked and paid into the system, one can apply for SSDI, regardless of one's financial situation.

67,"You can apply for disability at any point and you do not need a lawyer to get the process started. I would recommend getting established and in treatment for at least 3-6 months first just so that SSA will have some records to look at when you apply.

Have a history of work can be either good or bad when it comes to a disability application. On one hand you were able to work for 7-10 years which can be construed as you being able to maintain steady employment in spite of your condition (so you wouldn't be disabled) or it can be construed as your work history showing a desire to work but that your condition currently prevents it. 

I can't speak for all disability examiners but personally I would prefer an applicant with the work history. The big question with all disability claims is ""can this person work even with these medical conditions"". If I have a person who has worked in the past it is actually easier for me to justify why they can't work now. If you put their work history side-by-side with their medical a lot of times you can see the link between the condition and them stopping work. 

Failed work attempts really are the best evidence to answer the question of ""can this person work"". When you get an application of someone who has never even attempted to work how are you supposed to know if they can or not? You can't just take people at their word when they say ""well, I've never tried to work but I know that I won't be able to"".  When you work disability claims you see a lot of people who are just applying as they see it as ""easy money"" from the government. But when you see someone who had a high paying job (50-150K) quit and file for disability I find that much more credible because no one would take an 80% pay cut for ""easy money"".",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1462883226,t5_2qhe8,t3_4inp5p,t3_4inp5p,5,1465756542,0,0,d2ztpgc,disability,5,,,,

81,"On Point 4:

I'm autistic. I'm not referring to the people who talk to me like I'm 2 when I say people mistake me as intellectually impaired. I don't think it's insulting to be treated like I'm intellectually impaired, but it is a serious problem at times. 

Such as when the nurses assumed my sister was intellectually impaired and wouldn't let her see her newborn, kept demanding to speak to her ""guardian"" (she has none) to discuss having her institutionalized, until my bro-in-law got there from work and explained she just has difficulty processing verbal communication.

I have to carry around a full copy of my diagnosis and assessment, because literally everyone assumes I'm intellectually impaired and incompetent. 

There's more IQ difference between me and average than between average and impaired, and I'm still borderline incompetent and barely functional. Intellectually ability doesn't mean squat to me. My two best friends are 2+ decades from me, one's a toddler, and one was an adult before I was even born. People are people, 2, 12, or 70, IQ of 55 or 155. Presumption of competence and presumption of even developmental success or failure sucks universally.

As for the rest of it, the fact that people can treat people, *any* people, the way they treat me and my sister is fucked up. 

I get really pissed that it's ok to presume incompetence or that one's level of impairment must be universal across all areas of development.

As far as I'm concerned, the intellectually impaired fall under neurodiversity already. The presumptions and ignorances we're fighting are one and the same. The dangers are just as real for me as they are for those who are actually intellectually impaired. The challenges of finding safe and affective care with a doctor who doesn't make assumptions are real whether you have ASD or ID. 

I see no reason to divide ID out from the neurodiversity movement. Neurodiversity is all about recognizing that we're all people with human rights, regardless of how our brain processes. ",,,,xyzyxyzyx,,,1464373012,t5_2qhe8,t3_4l8chx,t3_4l8chx,4,1466139905,0,0,d3m1sok,disability,4,,,,

Safety and compliance was addressed specifically that any abuse or misuse of medications can lead to discharge from the practice as well as addiction and or injury. CT-PMP is routinely checked.

Safety and compliance was addressed specifically that any abuse or misuse of medications can lead to discharge from the practice as well as addiction and or injury. CT-PMP is routinely checked. U-Tox is randomly obtained and checked for compliance. There is no access of meds to minors or non caregivers. The pain management agreement was discussed with the patient.

126,"Hi there! I can absolutely relate to how you're feeling. I have a form of muscular dystrophy called Spinal Muscular Atrophy; I use a power chair and only have minimal strength in my right hand, so I require help with *everything*. I have struggled with depression since early adolescence, but my early 20s were the worst by far. (I'll be 36 next week, even though I wasn't supposed to make it to 4!) Having a disability is incredibly isolating, especially when your peers are moving away, getting married, etc. Here's a bit of my hard-earned wisdom:

1. Find a counselor who specializes in adjustment to disability (often they come from rehab counseling program, so start at your local universities). There is no shame in this. There are all kinds of judgements and misperceptions about PWD in our society, and it's only natural that we internalize them (like how studies show unconscious race bias is just as common in Black people as in whites). Learning to recognize those judgements when they pop up and then disregard them is incredibly powerful!

2. Take excellent care of yourself. Make sure you're getting the nutrients you need, are well hydrated, and get enough sleep. (Specifically, have your Vitamin D levels checked!)

3. What are you passionate about? I love art, so I paint miniatures and do calligraphy. You like sports? Find some podcasts you enjoy. Find some way to light up the spark that makes you YOU. In time, it may even lead you to your career! (I took a few detours, but I'm an executive coach and corporate trainer. I set my own hours, take only the jobs I want, and absolutely love it!)

4. Find community, and then don't be afraid to ask for help doing whatever you need to do to stay involved (transportation, for example).

5. Have you ever considered a service dog? I cannot say enough about how my life, and my experience of the world, changed when I got my first dog at age 23. I feel safer, people have something to do/say (I hear whispers about my dog, not my wheelchair),  and I always have a buddy with me!

134,"Not physically disabled, but I have PTSD+Depression+Anxiety, as well as memory issues (PTSD related).  These are the small ""life-hacks"" (I'm not sure you can even call them that) which work for me.
-Alarms for everything (dissociation=forgetfulness, forgetfulness=anxiety about what I forgot)
-Lists for daily tasks (helps with anxiety about forgetting to do something)
-Weighted blankets or something heavy for Deep Pressure Therapy (DPT helps calm the heart rate and helps with panic attacks, anxiety, and flashbacks).  My service dog is trained for this but there are other options for those without SD's.
-Small things to fiddle with to reduce skin-picking
-A recording device for any lectures/important things
-Coloring book and colored pencils to help reduce anxiety

Service Dog related hacks:
-SD vest with pockets or backpack, so my dog can help carry things (emergency information, medication, small water bottle, dog treats/food, foldable dog bowl)
-Business cards/small pamphlets with SD-specific bits of the ADA written on them
-Hands-free leash (mine goes around my waist)
-Dog-sized felt rectangle for my dog to lie on when on hard/cold surfaces
-Treat pouch
-Large, very visible patches all over her vest that say ""Service Dog"", ""No Touch, No Talk, No Eye Contact"", ""Do Not Distract"", and other short phrases that get the message through.

151,"I met my current boyfriend on OKCupid. I had made a profile as a joke one weekend with a friend as a result of being lonely. I had recently just started college in another state and did not have many friends. I did not post pictures of me in my wheelchair or mention my disability in my bio. (I did write the cheeky hint, ""I don't enjoy long walks on the beach""--he understood that later on.) I ended up receiving a lot of messages to my surprise and entertained myself by reading them between classes. I replied to a few who gave effort into writing more than just ""hey, wanna meet up?""

One guy in particular was extremely persistent about going on a date with me. I was flattered but also mortified at the thought of having to explain ""my situation"" to him, thinking he may just turn tail and run. I struggled with the thought of it, as I had much less self-confidence at the time. I nearly almost said ""no."" I didn't want to come off as dishonest or make myself vulnerable to a stranger.

Eventually, I gave in to his request. After I agreed to the date, I was open and honest with him, explaining that I was in a car accident 13 years ago (at that time) and was a paraplegic. That weekend, he drove an hour to take me to dinner and a movie. It was the most awkward but sweetest date I had ever had. At dinner, he ordered a salad (I've never seen him order a salad since that day). For dessert, we laughed and shared a milkshake and he was horrified to find out that he ate the only cherry instead of offering it to me. He even ran over his own foot trying to give me a hug! However, I melted a little inside when at the theatre, he offered to lift me into one of the seats instead of me staying in my chair for the film. He wanted me to be close to him and I was blindsided by his thoughtfulness.

Six and a half years later, we are still together. There have been conversations about the first time we met, and he admitted to having his reservations about my disability at the time before he really got to know me. After all, he *would* look like a jerk if he stood me up after I revealed my disability to him. We are happy and have been through a rollercoaster of a life so far together. All because I put my reservations aside and said **""yes.""**

Maybe this was more of a story than you had asked for, but the moral of it all is that, above all else, have confidence in yourself. A wheelchair is not a burden--we are liberated by it! Trust your instincts and have that conversation when it is right for you and with the right person. You know yourself best, so don't let anyone else dictate who you are.

Your daughter would be eligible, as she is a minor, to receive some money based on your SSN record and disability until she is 18. If your wife isn't on benefits she should, I believe, not be involved at all in this situation.

176,"I had been sending emails to HR since mid- to late-April, so they were made perfectly clear about the situation. My advocate was present for the initial part of the ""meeting"", then demanded that she leave or else I would be fired. I asked her for help because their solution to my supervisor's harassment was to suggest I move to another center, which actually requires there to be an open position, I have to apply to it, and HR would have to write a letter for me (something they most likely would not write honestly). My advocate suggested that they may have suggested it in the hopes that I would apply there, quit here once they say they'll ""get back"" to me, then end up not getting the job.

I ended up quitting the other day as I had developed a UTI from being forced to hold it in whenever my supervisor was around, as she no longer allowed me to take lunch or bathroom breaks, and every time she was watching (and she would walk in at random times), she would critique literally anything I did for being slow or being wrong, and tell me to work faster. I had to quit because the pain was too bad, and I saw someone else in pain who I was trying to help, only to realize that working for this company just put us in the same situation, except I was *choosing* to put up with it.

I sent an email addressing my concerns to almost everyone I had spoken to in the company (excluding the crazy VP of HR, and unintentionally my supervisor, as I misspelled her email), including how they were aware I was a diabetic and did not allot time for testing my blood sugar or eating to adjust it, how I received a UTI due to having to sneak to use the bathroom (and even being tracked down while in the bathroom to get out by my supervisor, even though I was in the middle of changing my menstrual pad), how poor decisions regarding staffing and timing were affecting our customers, and how there was a safety issue that is definitely putting lives at risk (but could also potentially affect their insurance). I received an email back almost immediately, and you know which point they were actually upset about... Their insurance could have raised their rates over this! Unacceptable!

199,"Who is telling you that it is going to be dismissed? And who is telling you about the 6 month waiting period?

A judge can ""dismiss"" a case if the claimant is non-responsive to letters/requests and if an attorney requests the dismissal. A judge will not just dismiss a case for lack of evidence (this isn't a criminal proceeding) he would just rule against you. 

There is no waiting period for how quickly you can file a claim after one is denied. You can go in the very next day to file a new application. 

As for backpay, I'm going to assume, since the person is 22, that this is an SSI claim only. SSI onset dates are always the date of filing the initial application. The backpay will go back that far *as long as* the case is appealed continuously. There are several different appeals levels (initial, recon, judge, appeals court, federal court) and as you move through all of those that filing date stays the same. 

however, if you stop a pending disability claim (or don't appeal a denial) and file a NEW claim, then that new filing date replaces the old one and, should it be approved, the back pay would only go back to that new date. 

There are some instances where an old claim can be reopened and reversed. So lets say the first claim was in 2014 and you were denied and didn't appeal. you file again in 2016 and are approved. At this point, IF there is enough evidence to show disability back to 2014 the claim can be reopened and the decision changed. However, this actually doesn't happen all that much so I would not count on it. ",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1463058069,t5_2qhe8,t3_4irim5,t1_d32d9fe,2,1465804493,0,0,d32lxl6,disability,2,,,,

Have you reached out to any prospective schools' admissions departments, or spoken to the departments that handle ADA compliance for students at the schools you're interested in? That might be a good start for figuring out your options and making contacts that can help you get admitted. 

On the ADA compliance point, schools are required to help students who have impairments or disabilities get support services that even the academic playing field where possible. These programs might get you more time for tests, a note taker, or perhaps you'd be allowed to take audio recordings of a lecture to make up for processing or memory delays - all accommodations that lower your risk of getting a low GPA and failing out. A school is going to want to avoid that as much as possible. 

Schools with the most comprehensive services in these areas might be more likely to accept students like you, who are intelligent and work hard, have the passion but have much, much higher hurdles to leap to get the same assignments completed. And who might not have the most stellar prior GPA because of it. Also, schools want a diverse student population, so you may very well be able to use your TBI to your advantage.

247,"First off, do you have a license? If not,  there may be some hoops you have to jump through. Getting a license does after all require a vision test.

But I have one functioning eye, and I still drive. There are adaptive mirrors you could get, but here are the rules I follow:  

-Be overly cautious. Car accidents are no joke.  
-On multi-lane highways, stay in the slow lane whenever possible. I have found that the most diffuclt thing is changing lanes and merging with traffic b/c you're still moving at a decent rate of speed, and you may have to turn completely around, depending on your field of vision.  

And that's it. I did get in one accident, not long after my vision was damaged. But I earned my lesson after that, and haven't had another accident in the 4 years since then.

252,"After a ALJ/hearing denial there are 2 additional appeals levels. You can file an appeal to the Appeals Council (AC) level first. This level is more of a review of the judges decision to make sure it was policy compliant and that no egregious errors were made. I rarely see an AC decision come back as favorable to the claimant; even if the AC person reviewing the claim disagrees with the ALJ decision they can't always just send it back to reverse it. 

After the AC comes federal court. Very few claims go this far because there are very few attorney's who want to escalate to this level. Federal court dates can take years and its is a lot of paperwork for attorney's who aren't going to make very much money on the claim. It just doesn't make financial sense for them to take the claim. 

I'm sorry that your mom got the outcome that she did. It sounds like the reason she was denied is that there just isn't enough evidence in her favor. It is one of the problems with folks who are under/uninsured is that there isn't anything to prove their claim. 

As for where you go from here: I would consult with a disability attorney (if you don't already have one). They know your claim and will know what the best suggestion is. Your options are either appeal the claim further (as discussed above), file a new claim, or don't do anything.  From my anecdotal experience the majority of people in your mom's shoes will file a new claim. Sometimes refilling and hoping to get approved the second time around is faster than waiting for a federal court date.

I said this elsewhere but it is one thing to have these thoughts as an individual disabled person, it is quite another for those feelings to be normalized and legitimized in popular culture through a romanticized and sanitized lens held by people who don't necessarily understand the gravity of the subject matter and are using it as a plot device.

301,"To your question about the vocational expert: all disability adjudicators (from the initial/recon level examiners to the judges) have a certain degree of flexibility with the decision. We get input from doctors (both SSA doctors and a claimant's doctor), vocational experts, and policy experts in our offices for the decision. But ultimately the decision rests *with* the examiner. Sure their decision can be stopped if the decision was egregiously wrong, but there is always a certain degree of judgment on the part of the adjudicator. SSA rules are black and white in some areas but incredibly grey in others (on purpose). 

So while the vocational expert may have said there were no jobs that your mom could do, the judge does not have to take that statement as fact. I'm sure that the judge asked the expert that question with a base ""residual functional capacity"" in mind and then changed his mind. If he initially thought that your mom was going to be a Sedentary RFC (desk job) and asked that question it would be a different answer than if, upon reviewing all the information later, he decided to change her RFC to light work (retail, cashier, etc). In all disability claims the medical decision (what they are capable of) always comes before the vocational decision (can they do their past or other work). 

As to your other points: SSI/SSDI are compassionate programs (we take care of those who can't) but only to a certain degree. Financial need does not come into the disability decision; we can only look at the medical evidence. For whatever reason, at least 3 people (and likely more by the time you add in supervisors and federal QA staff) have looked at your mom's claim and said that she does not qualify for disability. Obviously I don't know if those were right or wrong decisions not seeing her case file. As adjudicators we cannot make our decisions based on someone's socioeconomic situation or with a worry about what they will do if they are denied. The program would be unsustainable that way and, if that much subjectivity would be given, it would open the program up to a lot of potential fraud and misuse. 

There is always going to be a certain segment of the population who is going to fall into the gap between not being able to maintain a job and not qualifying for disability. It is unfortunate but it does happen. For your mother (and I'm just giving an educated guess here) it is likely due to the fact that she has been uninsured for so long. SSA needs hard facts and evidence for disability claims to support statements that claimant's make. There have been plenty of times that I can tell that a claimant is likely disabled but there just isn't enough evidence in file to support it. That flexibility/grey area I mentioned earlier can only get me so far. 

My best advice for your mom (and for you) is to do whatever it takes to get her some consistent and steady medical treatment. Obamacare, Medicaid, whatever you need to do. Have you checked into any eligibility for state programs? Some states (like CA) have their own LTD programs that have more lax requirements for benefits.

304,"To clarify and expand...

I am wondering if the fact that my application went to the quality review board is potential indicator that the examiner approved it.

To recap the conditions for which I am applying for disability... I have severe digestion problems which cause my stomach and intestines to seize and to prevent food and bile from going through my system. The main reason this prevents me from working is because each unpredictable episode puts me in bed for two or three days at a time and I am having three or four episodes a month. In addition to this, even when I am ""well"", digestion is a very long and painful process where I often need to be in the bathroom for an hour at a time, at all different unpredictable times each day, and usually have to lie down for an hour or so after the daily bathroom visit due to stomach pain and to physical damage to my rectum and anus that need to subside before I can walk and sit. I am often crying and groaning unavoidably in pain during this bathroom visits. Using the bathroom is also sometimes a very bloody affair, and without going into too much detail, the blood is not always contained in the toilet bowl, which would be traumatic for me to experience at a work place, and I have to imagine it would be a biohazard to other employees.

In addition to that condition I have a seizure disorder that has made me extremely hard of hearing. My hearing aids are a catch-22, though, because if I wear them for more than a few hours, they cause the type of migraines that causes the seizures. Also, even with my hearing aids in, I have difficulty hearing.

In addition to a formal application, I personally submitted 18 pages including a very thorough and compelling letter from my general practitioner explaining the severity of my conditions, several pages of hospital records discussing instances of my condition going back ten years, compilation of six months of data from a pain tracking application noting frequency, length, severity, etc. of incidences, and a few pictures showing the drainage from my stomach when I am in the hospital, what my anus looks like after a daily bathroom visit, and the amount of blood all over the bathroom after some visits.

Given this medical history and to the fact that a determination was made and then my case was sent for quality review, do I have good reason to be cautiously optimistic that I am going to be approved during the first round?

Also, for whatever this is worth, my congressman is aware of my situation and is trying to help encourage an approval. An aid made several phone calls to several people with the disability branch of the Social Security Administration last week trying to learn the determination, so I would imagine that somewhere in my file it is noted that a federal congressman's office is interested in the outcome and an advocate for its approval.",,,,IckyBelly,,,1462953574,t5_2qhe8,t3_4iq2a1,t3_4iq2a1,1,1465777898,0,0,d3128aq,disability,1,,,,

You may not have worked enough to qualify for SSDI but you can still get SSI. This is a needs based program, so if you have more than 2.5k saved or make over a certain limit a month they will deny you.

359,"Without reading his medical records, it's hard to tell why he was denied. I also don't understand why his psychologist would no longer see him once he filed. The problem is that records for your son were probably only requested from when he turned 18, not before. He could not be allowed before that, so many analyst won't apply before. I'm guessing it was determined he could perform simple and repetitive tasks with limited social interaction. Was your son sent to a consultative exam with a disability doctor?

Once you are denied on a reconsideration, it is time to hire a lawyer if you want to appeal to an ALJ (administrative law judge). You can also file a new claim if you prefer. Most people prefer to go before an ALJ, as they feel they will be allowed more easily. 

If you decide to reapply, it would be prudent to submit any medical records, IEPs (individualized educational plans) or special education/transcrips you have. These can help if the records are not requested. 

In terms of resources, you can look for free clinics in your area to help provide medical/mental health resources. Perhaps they can find the right combination of medications/counseling. I realize you've tried having your son work before, but keep trying sheltered work.

362,"What you need to apply for is HUD housing and section 8. HUD housing are typically apartments/townhomes where all the residents pay 30% of their income towards rent/utilities. 

HUD housing tends to not be in the greatest of condition or neighborhoods but when you apply for HUD you also need to apply for a Section 8 waiver. These waivers are the ones that can take years to get (especially if you do not have children) but these waivers will allow you to rent a market-rate place but they will just give you a certain amount each month that the government will pay for (and you pay the rest if there is any). 

If you google ""HUD [your state]"" you should be able to find the nearest office to apply. I would also look to see if your area has any income based housing that is for disabled individuals only (some states/cities have them). You mention not being tied to a location which is good. In my experience if you live in a less-populated town the HUD housing tends to be a bit easier to get. Large urban areas tend to have the longer wait times in my experience. 

Since you are getting divorced and you're on SSDI you will also now qualify for a lot more state programs such as cash assistance and food stamps.

373,"I went, but more as a joke. I attended a very very very small school. As in my graduating class had 6 people. My best friend and I had no interest in going but his mom convinced us to. So we went together and dressed semi-formal. So no tux, no limo, not dates. Which is everything you're asking about. Haha. 

But, I'll try to be helpful.

I suppose I should start by saying I'm a 31-year-old paraplegic in a wheelchair. I have been in a chair since I was 13. As far as a tux goes, I've only ever worn one once. Go get it tailored like anyone else and you should be fine. The jacket will be the trickiest part. And the most annoying part. You ever see in movies how the dapper dude will only have one button done up and he'll undo it when he sits? That's because that's how it's supposed to be done in most cases. You unbutton when you sit. But you and I are always sitting! A tux or suit jacket tends to bunch up, look funny, rub up against our sides or our chair. With all that said, the one and only time I wore a tux was honestly not that bad. Most of you are probably going to be taking your jackets off after grand march anyway, so find something that works well enough and then get yourself a sweet bow tie and suspenders. Yeah, suspenders don't do anything for you but they look good and you can joke around about them.

As far as the limo goes, shouldn't be much of a problem. Can you transfer well? Do you drive? You should be able to get into one without much of a problem. The driver should be able to throw your chair in the trunk if you have a manual chair that breaks down. 

Dancing? Shit, son, you can dance! Throw your hands in the air, move them to the beat a little. For slow dancing bring your date to the side of your chair, put one arm around her waste and hold her hand with the other. Put her on your lap. You'll find there are tons of moves that you can do. Do some of them look silly? Hell yeah! But no one is going to fault you, and honestly, some women absolutely adore it!

And speaking of girls, or guys if that's your thing, finding a date is totally possible. You're in high school, the downside is that you're surrounded by girls when they're at the age of being the most shallow and close-minded as they'll ever in their life, if they're lucky. But there are tons of sweethearts out there as well. You won't be ""ruining"" their prom experience. If you don't find one maybe I'll put some stamps on my 17-year-old sister and send her your way for the weekend.

Also, it's prom. It's just part of high school. It's ok and all to get excited about it, but when it's all said and done, it's just a stupid dance. My little sister just had her first prom a little over a month ago. She enjoyed it but said all the pomp and circumstance behind it was dumb. She spent money on a dress, getting her hair done, limo with friends, everything you described, and she said next year when she goes she'll forgo all the excessive aspects of it. She had a great time but none of it was due to a limo, her dress, or paying someone to do her hair.

And lastly, you're in high school, all of these things only get easier as time goes. Especially girls. You'll find that your disability means very little to many many girls out there.",,,,mewithoutCthulhu,,,1464011951,t5_2qhe8,t3_4kmcth,t3_4kmcth,4,1466041734,0,0,d3gd080,disability,4,,,,

The psychiatrist he was seeing just dropped him with no explanation. I feel like he just didn't want to have to deal with SS but have no proof. He has been with his current doctor for several years now, so hopefully the former doctor's opinion may hold less weight? I just don't know.

I have to start from the beginning again since it has been too long to file another appeal, it's been over a year and a half since he was denied last time. So maybe this time we have more luck. ",,,,anamoirae,,,1464142506,t5_2qhe8,t3_4kwtmr,t1_d3ij7xa,1,1466079630,0,0,d3ikacb,disability,1,,,,

404,"&gt; Like, they have to care about that. They have to follow the rules they're given, to the letter, or they're screwed.

I think you hit on a very important point that sometimes gets lost in the debate about disability and access. The *intent* of these rules is not discriminatory they create these rules for liability/CYA purposes. From the text of what OP said it sounds like he/she rode several rides at the park it was just the one ride in question. 

OP, I'm no physicist or engineer but I am willing to be that there is a reason that the ride required you to be able to grip the bars. You mention that nobody holds onto the lap bars during the ride but there are still there for safety reasons. What if, God forbid, there is a malfunction during the ride and those bars become disengaged. Most people would then have to manually try to hold the bars down and/or hold themselves in while the ride was being stopped.

I think that there is an overall discussion that needs to be had with regard to access at amusement parks. However, the #1 thing need to always be passenger safety. Safety for the person riding the ride, safety for the other people on the ride, and safety fro everyone around the ride. If a person's physical attributes (disability, height, weight, etc) make it unsafe for them to ride then they should not be able to ride the ride.

I'm a few months into the process myself!

I have debilitating PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder along with Add. 

What they want to know is if you can work and how medications make you feel. I am being treated but the medicines are really harsh on me and cause me to be extremely lethargic, sleepy and lightheaded.

Even if you cannot physically do something, they can still deny you depending on if you can work an ""office"" job. It is very hard for me to focus on my goals and I have memory problems due to my illness and the medications I take. My PTSD also makes it really difficult to work well with others. But everyone is different in the end and they want to know how you consider yourself disabled. 

The best advice is to seek professional help and get all your symptoms and problems on record. Let them know how the medications you take effect you, how much you spend on doctor visits, medications ect.

467,"&gt; Starting my journey to SSI. Hello. I'm 30 years old and starting this journey. Kinda lost and afraid, I'm looking for guidance * * *Anyone know what the next step is? Advice on getting it to go through? Thank you!!

First go find a lawyer specializing in handling disability cases before the Social Security Administration, who is willing to take your case and actually help you help you apply by filling out all of the application questions (a process that can take 2 or more hours to itemize all of the doctors and hospitals you have been to, prescription drugs you are taking, etc.) and answering all of the investigatory  questionnaires and forms (which probe into your daily life activities and request detailed information about your work history) and must be completed before a decision is made on your case.  You can severely sabotage your case by trying to be your own lawyer on these cases.  

If you meet any lawyers, who says anything about not ""able to do anything"" or ""can't get involved"" before ""you have been denied,"" shop around further. There is a terrible myth out there that lawyers can will only get involved  after a denial decision has been made.

This information is incorrect there are lawyers, such as myself, who are eager and willing to help you start and file your case from square one.  So if  any lawyers tell you anything to the effect of, ""Come back and see me if you get denied,"" thank them for their time and wait until you can find an attorney willing to help you from the start before you do anything. 

The ""Come back and see me if you get denied,"" is just polite tactic some lawyers use to get rid of you when they aren't really interested in your case.  As someone working primarily on disability claims, want to see you get approved as soon as possible.  If you are selling a house, I doubt you want any lawyer telling you to go write your own deed, ""And I'll get involved if the buyer doesn't accept it.""  Or, if charged with a crime, I can't believe you would listen to any lawyers tell you, ""You will only need us is you go to trial and get convicted.""  Yet when it comes to applying for Social Security disability benefits, I hear from and meet up with people all the time who have fallen into the mentality that they don't need a lawyer.  They, in fact often get the idea because they went to the local Social Security office and a secretary or receptionist said, ""Oh, you don't need an attorney to apply.  The upshot of  this is that I can not even tell you how many people I see, who have f---ed up their own case by thinking they could ""fill out the paperwork"" themselves.  I lost count several years ago!

The problem is most people simply do not understand all of the concepts, rules, and regulations the Social Security Administration applies in deciding a person has a disability, which prevents them from working and entitles them to payments under either the SSI (Supplemental Security Income) or SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) programs.  For example your doctor may believe you are disabled because you are unable to do the job you used to do , but the Social Security Administration does not deem you to be disabled unless you can prove you have, ""A medical condition (or combination of conditions) which are expected to last at least a year in duration and prevent you from carrying on any substantially gainful activity in our national economy.""  

For example I notice you have only referred to applying for SSI.  Most people want to collect anything available to them under SSDI, before resorting to SSI benefits since people collecting SSDI benefits do not have the same financial restrictions on them with regard to money saved in bank accounts, attempting to work part time (i.e., to supplement their benefits), etc. that are imposed on people collecting SSI.  I should also note that even with a lawyer's help you are going to have an uphill battle at age 30 to prove you are disabled to the Social Security Administration.  Until you turn age 50 the Social Security Administration expects that even with back pain you will still be able to do a sedentary (sit-down) type of job [i.e., being a computer data entry clerk, working as the retail security system monitor (where you just watch television screens all day looking for shoplifters), etc.].

You might consider /r/entrepreneur.  They have a lot of folks who do e-commerce and can help with resources on how to set up your website and how to market it.  The first thing they will say is you need to have a domain name of your own; otherwise your site is going to be very hard to find.

You also might consider offering your graphic design services there, or find out from them how to do it as a virtual service.  From looking at the shirts you clearly have talent, and you might be able to develop a good income stream from it.

Shopify is a paid hosting site with a number of different storefront options; of more interest to you might be their tutorials on how to set up and market an online commerce site.  I found them very useful.

Re the shirts--is there anything that makes them disability-appropriate, or are you aiming for the general public?

You say:  ""he believes that if you're not in a wheelchair with both arms missing you should be able to do something.""
This could be his (possibly misguided depending on how he communicates this view) way of encouraging you to test your limits and motivating you. Some people push this point too hard and end up making someone feel worse, but the intent may be coming from a positive place.

I personally believe everyone can do something, if they want to. Every human being has a contribution to make in the world. It's not something you can force though. It may not be right at this very second, (or the near future since great things take time to cultivate) but eventually everyone leaves their mark on the world.

You have a right to refuse services. You can talk to a Benefits Coordinator (or someone of a similar title in your area) about the possible repercussions of refusing certain services. After that you can make a well informed decision on what's best for you.

545,"First, how old are you now? 

SSI rules for children and for adults are exponentially different. I would say that, anecdotally, about 80-90% of people who are considered disabled as children do not meet the definition of disability as an adult. The rules are a lot less lax because, as children, the goal of the SSI funds is to help the family pay for treatment so that the child can then develop as normally as possible. 

So if you are over 18 now then the fact that you were on as a child will have no bearing on your adult claim since the rules are totally different. They may glance at your old file for some historical information but that is about it. 

If you are still under 18, it is your parents that have to apply for you. you cannot go and apply for benefits on your own (unless I suppose you are legally emancipated).

557,"Getting fired from your jobs will really neither help nor hurt your disability case. SSA really cares more about how long you worked at the jobs and how much money that you made. You can say that you were fired due to your disability but there is no way for SSA to verify that. 

As an examiner I never really paid attention to that type of information unless I felt it was pertinent to the claim. We have to take everything a claimant says with a grain of salt knowing that they are trying to portray themselves in the best light. I've had plenty of people say that they were fired due to their disability but then received information from their employer (sometimes we send them questions) that they were fired for cause. 

Even if you were fired due to your disability, and can provide documentation that proves that fact, it will not matter for your SSDI/SSI application. That would be an ADA issue. The crux of getting on SSI/SSDI is that you are unable to work *any* job not just ones you've had in the past.

there shouldn't be any waiting period at all for opening a new case. 

&gt;So even if another case is opened... Everything would be lost essentially? Back-pay only to the date of the 2ND case opening?
&gt;Say after the 2nd case, we gather all the records needed to prove disability from the point of 3 years ago, the back-pay STILL wouldn't go that far, would it?

It would depend. If the judge makes a decision then that would ""close"" the case up to that point. If it is dismissed then technically you could still get backpay into that period if later found disabled. However, there has to be evidence to document things so if there is not enough evidence to prove that you condition was disabling that far back. 

&gt;Also, what do you mean by claim type?

SSI can be approved based on filing date. SSDI(which is based on work credits earned) can be approved back to what ever date you allege(after work activity stopped). 

Hopefully this clears things up a bit?

The maximum benefit is $733. If you work, after the first $85 they deduct $1 from your SSI for every $2 you make. 

SSDI is an insurance benefit paid to those adults who have been paying FICA for enough quarters. It's paid with Social Security funds. After 24 months you are eligible for Medicare. There is no asset limit.

599,"I think it's because the issue is not black or white and it's easy to get lost in the gray area counterarguments. 

There are a lot of advocacy groups that are concerned that disabled (and elderly) people will be driven to suicide because support systems are lacking, because of poor mental health and because they don't want to be a burden to their family/friends. It's actually quite difficult to separate the internal forces (i.e. the legitimate desire of a person not to live with their disease) and external forces (e.g. a lack of support systems, marginalization etc) in a lot of cases where people want to end their lives, because the latter are always part of the package when living with a disability. I'm not saying this is true for all cases, I'm just saying this is a problem when disability advocates are trying to wrap their head around assisted suicide because it conflicts with what they are fighting for. If they could separate the two issues, it would help.

In principle, if the choice is truly due to ""internal forces"" (as described in the post above, for example) then I think a lot of people will empathize and accept that even if they don't necessarily understand it. It is the ""external forces"" that muddy the waters and cause people to feel hurt and defensive, because I think we can all agree that a lot of us face enormous mental health struggles due to a lack of support or guilt or financial worries or whatever.  I think most can also agree that we wish these external aspects could be better. But we must try not to confuse that with the legitimate desire of some people to simply not continue in their state of being.

607,I'm sorry you feel depressed and alone. I'm also sorry you had to deal with bullying. That makes it scary to talk to people in itself. My cousin dealt with this because his disability causes him not to be able to drive so his network of people to hang out with is always limited. He has never been able to work and he dropped out of school at a young age. He has epilepsy and when he has seizures he wets himself sometimes so school was hard for him. It's something very much out of his control but unfortunately most young people are too immature to realize that until they are much older. I became sick at 26 and it is hard on me so I couldn't imagine how hard it is to have a disability from birth and try to make friends and maintain the friendships over the years. Thank goodness for the Internet because no one deserves to feel alone with their struggles. I really hope that you don't have to feel alone and isolated much longer.

611,"Not impossible and it sounds like you have a pretty good case for disability. You're education, trained, and seem to have evidence of a losing battle despite your efforts, but there are two conditions that may be troublesome. 

First you'll need medical documentation and probably quite a bit of leg work from your doctor(s) and possibly even your employer. Without that you're probably better off looking for unemployment benefits. 

Secondly, your husband could be the biggest hurdle. Most disability programs are happy to help, but only when you really need it. If your situation is a case of downgrading, or moving into a smaller space, or whatever, you may be out of luck. They'll likely need to see that you and your family have exhausted all your options. I've even seen a few programs request the spouse find a better or a second job, and others yet try to shift the burden onto the children / parents if they're old enough. 

Either way, it would not hurt for you to apply and/or approach your disability program. Even if you get rejected now, a year or two down the road with more evidence may get you in. They may also have a job placement program to help you find something more suitable. Unemployment programs would also be worth looking into if they are available, and would ultimately be something to help your application to a disability program.

648,"I'm tired of it as well. SSA does not deny every initial claim. People view it that way because part of the determination is based on how old a person is. Obviously, the more the apply, the older they are. If a person applies five times, he/she is older the fifth time than he/she was the first. So when he/she is allowed the fifth time, he/she just exclaims SSA loves to deny people the first few times! Add to that the amount of time a person waits for the reconsideration and the ALJ decision, and you're looking at years between initial filing and ALJ decision. OF COURSE it's easier to be allowed by the time the ALJ rolls around, because you're in a different age category.

SSA actually FAVORS allowances. We prefer to allow when we can. It's very frustrating to read that every initial case is denied on practically every thread. 

Also, for the initial claim, there is no reason to hire a lawyer. You can easily do things yourself.

668,"Hello, I've been in that boat since a few years ago. Almost the same! It hit me real bad last year when the oil price crashed and there was pessimism abound (due to economic changes and huge retrenchments).

I read somewhere during the whole recent ""depression is linked to social media activity"" that we should remember that reading social media is comparing others' highlight reels to our bloopers. We don't necessarily get a look into what they're going through or struggling with outside of social media, so our lives just look like shit in comparison. It's a self destructive cycle, at least for me it was.

I cannot say I have broken out yet, but after a really crappy 2015, I decided to just take more initiative, because like you, I felt like the biggest loser, and bad for myself. However I knew nothing will change if things do not change.

What I did first was remember past memories, old school mates, acquaintances I've met at events and even ""people I've admired in the past"". I just sent them Facebook messages, citing memories of the days back, hoping that they are well. To my great surprise, quite many people responded very positively. A kind gesture and showing them, ""I still remember you!"" goes a long way. I've since chosen to kept in touch with a few people, often those you may turn out to share a common interest in.

Next I tried out volunteering at charity initiatives. Being a disabled I wasn't sure what I could do, but I found a position to teach basic computing skills to underprivileged children. Helping others can be therapeutic in that you're not just wallowing in your own despair, but actively thinking of building people up. It's the same mindset I TRY to have when reconnecting/connecting with people. 

I've made new contacts through volunteer work. I guess people who're willing to work with the needy MAY be more open to friendship with a disabled?

Being disabled, it's not easy. We may generally have it harder than able people, but they have their own problems as well. Regardless of how big or minor problems are, they're very real for the individual (and for us as well). We're all kinda on the same boat here actually, even if it doesn't feel that way.

I felt bad, unworthy, useless and stagnant. Stagnant really stands out to me because I had my disability when I just started university. Seeing all my peers go ahead of me really sucked. I'm sure you can relate.

I'm still in depression, as I've just started to change things up. My message to you hopefully is, it's okay to feel the way you do. Come to terms with it, then start to formulate plans to counteract it. Only you can change you.

You're describing an awful lot of science.  Got to be some products in there somewhere!  The shipping container thing sounds very cool.

There's so much money available for cool projects, esp the kind of ""sustainability"" and ""low cost construction"" stuff that you're describing, I would go  to the funding markets with it.  You'd have to have a good write-up, but that would probably be one of the fun parts.  I have heard of a few projects that started on crowdfunding or kickstarter, but then attracted much bigger VC funding based on their popularity.

I mean, a solar-wind self-contained hydroponic farm even sounds like something you could put on Mars.  That's far out.  Or, you know, in the Arizona desert for those off-grid hipsters... lol... but they do tend to have a lot of cash, perhaps even some for investing.  Who knows, you come up with a good design, maybe even NASA would look at it in a few years.

It would also be too hard to try to identify how much impact my situation had on the decision to end brief relationships, because so many end quickly for other reasons, too, even when both parties have no significant issues.

Bottom line is that it was not an issue at all for the man whom I eventually married. For my part, I wouldn't be hesitant in the slightest to pursue something with a man in a wheelchair if all of the important boxes were checked.

There are so many things that are accepted or not based on initial attraction to a person. Things like appreciating frequent contact if you are into someone but finding it smothering if you aren't. I believe that disabilities are handled the same way, even if only on a subconscious level.

699,"&gt;  For both SSI and SSDI they will start with your income.

I am guessing that you mean *earnings* here. Only SSI cares about any other forms of income, as it is a needs-based program. 


&gt; I don't do applications but, to my knowledge, there is no reason you can't apply for SSI online. Logically that doesn't even make sense since SSA is really pushing for people to use the online services rather than phone/in person.

It really doesn't make any sense, but no - you actually can't file for SSI online. You can do the full SSDI application as well as the disability report, and indicate on the application that you *want* to file for SSI, but the application itself can't be done - you'll have to make an appointment for that. 

It's idiotic, because they *are* pushing everyone to the internet... but it doesn't actually help anything or make anything go faster. We all have our scheduled appointments, and then our iClaims are on top of that, with no extra time to process them. 

So my advice is to go ahead and do it online, but if you know you won't qualify for SSDI and/or want to file for SSI, call afterwards and make an appointment - if the office is swamped like mine, all they'll do is send out a letter saying in essence, ""you said you want to file for SSI, so you'd better do it within 60 days or you might lose out on back pay,"" *still leaving you to get in touch with them to file the application.*

703,"First, I can appreciate how frustrating it is to not have a diagnosis for your complaints. You just have to keep pushing for more tests for them to figure out what the issue is. I would ask for an MRI of your back as it could actually be a disc issue in your back causing the problems in your feet. 

As for the disability, I am going to assume that you are under the age of 50 based on reddit demographics. Your problem is two-fold. 

First, you don't have a diagnosis which is something that SSA is going to need. SSA requires hard, objective evidence of disorders before we can even consider them. If you file complaining of pain in your feet, we get the normal xray, then, to us, you have no medical condition. SSA also looks at response to treatment; most medical conditions are not disabling because they respond to treatment. If your pain is nerve related there are several things that doctors can do to help alleviate the pain and possibly eliminate the cause.

Secondly, your age. It is incredibly difficult to get approved for disability benefits if you are under the age of 50. You google ""SSA medical vocational rules"" for an explanation why. Right now your issues are linked to you being on your feet for work. I bet that if you obtained a desk/sedentary job (coupled together with treatment for whatever issue is going on) your impairment would have minimal impact on your ability to work. 

The point of SSI/SSDI benefits is that a person cannot do *any* job in the national economy.

I respect the right for people to choose to end their lives but we should be careful that that is not corrupted to become the result of inadequate support or a feeling of being burdensome. People internalize these kinds of messages. I know I did.

If we had shown Will being taken in and out of his chair, or put in a hoist over a bath, the impression we would give is of difficulty. I wanted to make it more normal.'

Sanitizing the experience of disability whilst at the same time trying to tell people that being disabled is so awful and difficult and horrible that you simply must want to kill yourself is absurd.
