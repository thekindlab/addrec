SSI is not taxable income; SSDI generally is not *unless* you are earning extra income or you file jointly and your spouse works. You'd have to speak to a CPA/tax person about your specific situation.

As for medical insurance, again, it depends on whether you are on SSI or SSDI. You have to remember that MediCAID is a state-run program but MediCARE is federal.  Each state's Medicaid rules are slightly different with regards to eligibility. From what I've heard, most states will give Medicaid to all SSI recipients regardless of their SSI-income level. You still have to apply for it and go through the process (so its not automatic in that sense).

  If you are on SSDI, after 24 months of disability you will become eligible for Medicare regardless of how much your get per month, assets, etc.  If you are in that 24 month gap then you can still receive Medicaid, but you'd be subject to the state-qualifications.

54,"&gt; Hey HereNowThis! I have very similar disabilities, though my story differs (multiple mental health + fibromyalgia). I was diagnosed with JIA before 18. I started having mental health issues right when I applied. I applied at 18 (my mother is a disability advocate, which made the process much more feasible). I was rejected twice, but was awarded at the last appeal with a judge. It was the mental health component and the chronicity of the rheumatoid arthritis (was actually fibro I later learned) that put me over the edge. It also was before Obamacare, so I needed health insurance to stay okay. 

&gt; I've been in voc rehab since being awarded, earning an education  that can allow me to work with my disability. Because I'm under voc rehab, I'm under the Ticket to Work program. As long as I'm making substantive progress, I don't get reevaluated. I feel like the situation would be similar if you are able to get SSI/SSDI. 

&gt; The nice thing on Ticket to Work is that it ""reserves"" your benefits in case you cannot work. There is a lot of complexity to it, but that's the gist of it.

&gt; Oh, and I think there is a reduction if you live with family, but only if you are claimed as a dependent (don't quote me on that one).

61,"My agency actively blocks Dragon from functioning, &amp; terminates anyone who needs it or requests it.

79 Dragon users have been terminated in 6 months - after management was made aware that Dragon is being blocked from functioning by the Agency's IT contractor's IT settings.  

It's not legal, but enforcement is left up to us individuals with disabilities, &amp; just the costs of the lawyer, let alone the almost decade it takes for the legal process to get anywhere, is too high a price for any of us to pay.

Between Section 508 of the Rehab Act of 1973, as amended, &amp; the ADA, federal agencies are 'required to make it work' - even the Access Board states this, emphatically   (they're ones in charge of telling individuals how to 'enforce' the law - by filing useless complaints that paint a target on you &amp; only result in termination).

My agency's management says they 'are in a standoff' with their IT contractor over who must pay for the manufacturer's support ($1,500 per user, annually) to get Dragon functional and keep it functional.  

And both the Agency &amp; the IT contractor have repeatedly stated that they 'have no legal obligation to provide accessible access to IT to anyone, disabled or not'.

My direct supervisor told me ""it's going to take someone MUCH higher up than you or I to convince them to follow the law &amp; make Dragon work.  This would probably have to go all the way to the Supreme Court.""

Another manager told me 'off the record' that upper management knows it can stomp on EEO laws and then claim ignorance/incompetence and 'force the retirement' of a retirement-age, willing scapegoat - IF the complaint ever gets to court.  

I've read far too many court cases where their go-to strategy has worked at the EEOC level (10+ years to reach this point).  

It doesn't work in federal court, which is the option after the EEOC process finishes, but that can take another 5+ years, &amp; the costs are astronomical.

And during this decade to decade and a half EEOC/court process the filer's career is decimated.  The entire process is horrible &amp; provides zero protection for federal employees.  

I accepted my position in large part BECAUSE my agency had claimed that Dragon was 'certified for use' on their system/computers. 

It's still listed online as currently 'certified for use' on their computers &amp; system ....even though it has never actually been functional anywhere on the Agency-wide network of over 300,000 computers.  

The kicker is Dragon HAS been &amp; IS functional on the small pockets of computers at different sites across the country that don't have the Agency's IT contractor's settings, AND the Agency even has the support contracts in place to keep Dragon functional on those computers - but these are in only use by NON-disabled employees.

Meanwhile the Agency refuses to provide this same technology to disabled employees.  

The discrimination is blatant, and is being committed openly &amp; with the full knowledge of even the highest levels of management.

They know there is zero enforcement, &amp; know their internal EEO office has high priced Agency staff lawyers to help them destroy anyone who files a complaint.  

My Union reps couldn't believe the discrimination was so cut-&amp;-dried, obviously illegal, &amp; blatant.  

They thought like I did at first - if the correct people in the Agency were made aware of this Agency-wide EEO violation, it would be corrected &amp; Dragon would be made functional for every employee who needs it now &amp; in the future.

Unfortunately, that's not what happens.  At all.  

My Union is the only reason I wasn't &amp; haven't been terminated (yet).  Instead, I was 'placed on Admin Leave because Dragon doesn't work, &amp; while the EEO case is being processed' shortly after my Union became involved.  

I would much rather have gone my whole life without learning any of this.

I went back to college expressly to serve my country.  

When my hands stopped working, I sought out &amp; became proficient in the assistive tech tools that efficiently &amp; effectively 'act as my hands'.

I was recruited by my Agency for my position because of my professional skills &amp; abilities - under a disability hiring initiative &amp; with their full knowledge of my needing Dragon in order to work.

It seemed like the perfect opportunity, complete with 'guaranteed advancement' - &amp; I relocated 5 states away from family to accept it.

But it quickly became a nightmare - one that's caused 79 disabled Dragon users to be terminated so far &amp; put the rest on the fast track to being terminated.

I had no idea that the calls to 'hire people with disabilities into federal service' were just lip service &amp; PR sound bites, with no actual intention of providing the equal opportunity to work.  (And neither did my direct supervisor.)

My own career has been derailed, &amp; my health and life are being destroyed over this.   

I just want to WORK, not spend the rest of my life in a fruitless, endless, million dollar battle (that I can't afford) in an attempt to force an Agency with a budget of hundreds of billions - including a $5+ billion budgeted for IT - to just comply with the EEO/RA/Disability laws.

My hope is to find an employer where there are people who are currently actively using Dragon - in the hopes of not ending up back at square one at a new job with yet another nonfunctional Dragon. 

I just want the equal opportunity to work.

149,"There are ways to protect your SSI benefits with the inheritance. If your state has the ability, you can set up an ABLE account. There are certain types of trusts or annuities that you can set up. But because you're on SSI (as opposed to SSDI) it is important that you speak to an estate or disability attorney who can steer you in the right direction.  The question is going to be whether you want to save the money for later (trust or ABLE account) or whether you have needs that you want to take care of now. 

Eventually you are going to need to let SSA know. Along with an attorney you should speak to an SSI CR and they can explain the rules and the process. IIRC, when you get a windfall such as an inheritance you will get a certain amount of time to spend that money before it is counted against you. For the sake of argument, lets say that is 6 months. So for that 6 months you'd be exempt from the asset limit so you get a chance to spend that money on things that you need. 

When I was a representative payee I had a client, on SSI, that received about $30K. Due to the program she was in, we had to spend that money ASAP. We spent most of the money pre-paying things for her housing. We paid a year's worth of rent and paid a few thousand on her utilities so that way she had that ""credit"" built up. After that we bought her some new clothes, a new TV, etc. The benefit to that is that, then for year, she didn't have to worry about those bills and she could use that extra ""income"" each month towards more fun activities that came up throughout the year.

That's a direct translation of what we call the procedure in Sweden.

Lightened steering servo can be done in most vehicles, some are easier than others. In fact for some brands you can order this directly from the factory, others are done electronically and others mechanically. **Some brands however, are not even possible**, so be sure to check what applies to the car you want before buying a car to adapt. 

In fact that is great advice when it comes to all adaptations. **Always talk to your vehicle adaptation technician before buying a car.** Not only does the car have to suit your taste it must be compatible with you and the adaptations you are going to use. I mean, just because a swivel seat suits one person in let's say a Volkswagen Golf, doesn't mean that it will be a good car for anyone that needs a swivel seat. After all we're all different shapes and sizes. 

To make a steering wheel easier to handle you can use what is called a **steering device*, **wheel spinner** or **steering knob**. There might even be more names for this kind of product that I don't know about. They come in all shapes and sizes, from plain flat grips and round ball shaped, to more ergonomically correct flat-oval shapes as well as a stick like grip with pins that will keep your hand in place for those that have little to no grip strength.

251,"Hey HereNowThis! I have very similar disabilities (multiple mental health + fibromyalgia), though my story differs. I was diagnosed with JIA before 18. I started having mental health issues around the time I applied at 18 (my mother is a disability advocate, which made the process much more feasible). I was rejected twice, but was awarded at the last appeal with a judge. It was the mental health component and the chronicity of the rheumatoid arthritis (was actually fibro I later learned) that put me over the edge. It also was before Obamacare, so I needed health insurance to stay okay. 

I've been in voc rehab since being awarded, earning an education  that can allow me to work with my disability. Because I'm under voc rehab, I'm under the Ticket to Work program. As long as I'm making substantive progress, I don't get reevaluated. I feel like the situation would be similar if you are able to get SSI/SSDI. 

The nice thing on Ticket to Work is that it ""reserves"" your benefits in case you cannot work. There is a lot of complexity to it, but that's the gist of it.

I had a student loan refund hit once when I first was on SSI and I ended up getting a reduced amount for 11 months or something until I ""paid back"" the month that I didn't deserve SSI because for literally 5 minutes on one day I had $2200 in my account. 

I know someone else who inherited over $20k and he didn't report it right away because he didn't realize his mom deposited it in his account. The government said he tried to commit fraud and completely cut him off.

302,"That's a cute idea. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a wheelchair user who would take offense at that. Also, kudos for coming here to ask for advice and opinions.

But, just playing as the devil's advocate here: I think the danger you were running into is that you're implying a servile nature/requirement at the same time that you're implicating handicapped people.l, and It is always going to be clear that you're using a handicapped parking sign. Defacing one could be seen as inherently disrespectful (what I think the admin was getting at when she mentioned ""vandalism""). Changing the symbol into a king and asking everyone to serve this king (who is still obviously a wheelchair symbol) could be seen as mocking, or implying that disabled people aren't capable of doing things on their own. 

The problem is mainly the word ""serve,"" because it almost always has connotations of a hierarchy. If a wheelchair user were carrying the sign it would be fine, because it's self-deprecating humor. When an able bodied person carries it, it's seen as humor at the expense of a disadvantaged group, which rarely goes over well publicly.

Again, I don't think that there would be any serious issue from within the PWD community as long as your transformation of the figure is well done. I certainly wouldn't care, and the folks I know personally wouldn't. However, I can still see it from the perspective of an overly-cautious administrator, because, as I explained above, you're implication is that a group of people is less than someone else (the king), but you're using disability imagery to get the point across -- and the two just do not easily mesh well. Especially in a photo, which is what would be posted online, since photos do not convey the context or meaning behind what you've created. If I were the administrator, the transformation to King wouldn't make any difference to me. To cover my own ass I would require you to use a different sign or none at all.

Also, if it wasn't a school thing, you'd be perfectly fine. Wear it to comicon and no one cares -- if a picture of you winds up on tumblr and they decide they're offended, you're the only one who takes heat for it. But at a school event, the school is going to get hit hardest for allowing this if someone decides that they are offended and wants to make a fuss. Worst case scenario and a handicapped person in your school finds it offensive and finds out that it was pre-approved by an administrator, the school could even get hit with a Title IX suit over it (the suit wouldn't really go anywhere, but the district would probably be forced to settle and your administrator would be fired).

At the end of the day, sometimes the people who ""look out for"" people with disabilities can take more offense/be more sheltering that PWD would themselves. I think that's what's happening here. It's just a sign. It's a non-issue. But I wanted to explain why it could be offensive to those people out there who are looking to be offended. And there are plenty of them.

325,"It doesn't make a lot of sense medically, but you have to remember that SSA is, above all else, policy driven.  All of the medical decisions are based around the question ""can this person work a 40 hour work week on a sustained basis"".

 For seizures, most individuals will have some sort of postictal period that can last for a few hours to a few days. If that person was working they would likely have to miss work for at least 1-2 days following a seizure. So if you have seizures lets say, 2-3x per month that is unsustainable and you wouldn't be able to work because you'd only be at work 75% of the time. Now, contrast that with a person who has 2-3 seizures per month but they occur ALL on the same day (for whatever reason). That person may only miss 1-2 days of work, which is not that outside of the norm of the general population.

Ironically enough, the way that seizures are evaluated by SSA is based on their frequency (depending on the type - grand mal or petit/other). Generally they require a seizure at least once or twice per month (depending on the type) over the course of 4 months. But once a seizure occurs a 24 hour clock starts and any seizures during that time aren't ""counted"" for SSA [listing] purposes. So if a person has a seizure at 10am, 2pm, 5pm, 7pm, and 12am that is considered 1.

336,"For 9 months (doesn't have to be consecutive. 9 months out of 60 is the rule) you can basically make a billion dollars a month and your benefits will pay out as they normally do. You must report Substantial Gainful Employment to the SSA. SGA is generally earning $1,130 or more per month.

After those 9 months, you enter the Extended Period of Eligibility where your benefits kick back in any month where your income drops below the SGA level. This period lasts for 36 months (minus the initial 9 months I just talked about). During this time you will not need to submit any new applications for disability.

After that, if you are receiving MediCare, those benefits will continue for 93 months after the initial 9 months of the Trial Work Period. If, during this time, your employment was to end you can apply for disability again but it will be expedited so that you only spend about 4-6 weeks waiting for an answer and you don't have to resubmit documentation of your disability.

If you exceed that limit, you might be looking at a spenddown, depending on your monthly medical need, or you could be considered for a Medicare Savings Program (MSP) which allows higher income and may help to pay Medicare Part B premiums.

Your renewal form will ask you to verify your info and update any changes in income or life circumstances.

I'd be hospitalized for some mood episode (by my choice) or just so depressed I couldn't see the other side of my bed, let alone a reason to get out of it. Working any kind of long term job that was going to provide me stability seemed... impossible. I was still denied and had to appeal. Most mental health cases are, especially for younger people. No judge told me to get more work experience though. It was clear working was not my answer.

The point in telling you that is that not everyone's story is the same. You might have a completely different experience. You will likely have a different judge. Keep your head up.",,,,ivybelle,,,1476958227,t5_2qhe8,t3_58dln4,t3_58dln4,3,1478746069,0,0,d90421a,disability,,,,,

Next I would research homeless shelters. Find one that you will be able to navigate with your disabilities, and just buy a bus ticket. Paying rent on a storage unit is cheaper than staying there a few more months. You want to do this before they fill up for the winter. 

When you get disability and back pay you can move back, if you want. Your family might me worth being around even if they can't help you at the moment. Being homeless out of state would differently help prove you are in need of SSDI. If you keep on track of paperwork, it could even move along the process.

Typically we have clients come for an orientation and paperwork meeting.  Afterwards we talk about employment goals and set up a trial work experience with a local employer.  An evaluator goes out with the client to assess their work skills.  Upon completion of the trial work experience your assessment is reviewed and depending on your performance results you will either be recommended more supplemental programs to aid employment or be refered to job placement.

I have had too many crying old ladies tell me they just wanted to die because life wasn't anything any more, and it was much more noticeable in those who needed extensive physical care. Some people are lucky enough to keep their physical health into old age and keep up hobbies, many do not. Additionally so many people now have very little saved for retirement which makes life so much harder. We're going to see a lot of people living longer mentally while their physical bodies can't do shit, and I think that might change the empathy that people have for those of us in that position at a much younger age.

Im getting kicked out of where I'm staying now in 2 months, most likely have to move back in with my parents who 1. Dont believe in mental illness at all, and thus 2. Will force me to ""get a job"" as soon as I move in with them. Which, considering I still actually have a job (on long term medical leave), I just cant mentally handle it without literally breaking down (and due to how stress and such affects me, their ""suggestion"" of just get a job anywhere like mcdonalds at least, is god awfully terrifying) its kind of fucking ridiculous and so stupid and counter-productive I cant even explain it. But im sure you understand from what youve said. So thats coming up really really fast, the depression is getting worse every day, and I seriously dont know what to do.

I have had disability lawyers since the beginning, theyre not super local but their main office as far as I know is roughly an hr away. I started the process early June, and have a psychiatric evaluation appointment on Nov 3 that SS scheduled to get ""more information on my condition"" as my therapist isnt actually a full psychiatrist. And I'm terrified, so much so I feel like I can't breathe sometimes, that I wont say the right thing, or that even if I do, even, telling them about the suicidal thoughts,  the debilitating lack of motivation to do ANYTHING, etc, that SSI just wont give a fuck and will deny me and I'll be screwed. Because its either keep trying for SSI and be homeless, living in my car with 190 in food stamps every month and no way to cook food, or move in with my parents, make my mental health even worse, and go back to my old job or get a new one, both would be equally bad so probably back to my old one. And then what? Just keep spiraling, getting worse and worse, hoping constantly for a miracle to happen? Cuz then SSI will 100% deny me forever saying I'm ""capable of working"". So that option, the only one that could get my life together, will be gone.

The older someone gets we do give them longer review periods (so instead of 3 they get 7) because the cessation chances are low.

Outside of conditions expected to improve quickly (e.g., a broken leg), Social Security regulations provide that a review should be scheduled every three to seven years based on the nature of your impairment. [See here](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-1590.htm). 

If you return to work, that can trigger a review earlier than scheduled.

* Work

If you qualify for SSDI, you get a [trial work period](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/ssdi-only-employment-supports.htm) where you get to work without any negative impact on your benefits for several months regardless of your income. Your trial work period ends only if you make more than a certain threshold ($810 per month in 2016) for 9 months total in a 60-month period. Social Security may cease your benefits after that if you starting engaging in substantial gainful activity (i.e., income over $1,130.00 per month in 2016) or they may start a review to determine if they should cease your benefits for medical improvement. If your benefits are ceased due to your income, you will enter an extended period of eligibility that makes it easy to re-initiate benefits if your income drops below substantial gainful activity levels.

If you only qualify for SSI, Social Security uses a formula to reduce your monthly based on your wages. The formula does not count the first $65.00 of income and reduces your benefit by $1.00 for every $2.00 earned. Working at substantial gainful activity levels will result in the cessation of benefits; there is no trial work period or extended period of eligibility.

There are also some separate work incentives that provide additional rules or exceptions to the above. [See here](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-work-ussi.htm).

* Living with relatives.

Living with relatives can decrease your monthly benefit SSI. Basically if family is providing you a benefit you'd otherwise have to pay for (e.g., rent or food), Social Security will consider that in-kind support and reduce your monthly SSI benefit.

I know you've filed before, so you remember those ADL forms and perhaps you went to a consultative exam or two. If you're homeless they will make sure to not schedule the exam too quickly (to allow you time to get the information), will give you extra phone calls, and get a third party involved to make sure you make the appointment. Even with the extra protections homeless individuals have the highest ""failure"" rate just because SSA can't get in touch with them. 

If possible, try to stay within the same state, even if you are moving between places to stay. If you stay somewhere for more than 60 days you're considered a resident of that state and they have to transfer your claim which will slow it down. 

Again though, when you apply tell them you are homeless and then once the DDS gets your case I would reiterate it to them as well (in case the field office didn't flag it correctly). SSA will go out of their way to help (if they can) but you just have to let them know what is going on. Depending on your financial status (which, if you're being homeless is probably poor) you might qualify for ""Dire Need"" status which will also speed your claim up a bit.

511,"I see what you're saying and I somewhat agree with the general point you're making, that there is a distinction between misunderstanding and insensitivity or discrimination. 

But cerebral palsy is not generally considered an invisible disability and I also find it kind of weird that when the young man asked if he could sit further back (I assume this means further back in the bus?), the driver said no. It sounds like there was at least some understanding that he was disabled and I feel like that should have been enough. 

There are also several ways this could be resolved:
1) Fold up stroller, hold baby and sit down elsewhere.
2) If stroller does not fold up, put stroller on bus wherever it fits, hold baby and sit down elsewhere.
3) Kind stranger could offer to hold bag or place bag elsewhere.

My own personal experience suggests that most people just sit there gawping awkwardly instead of trying to find a solution, bus driver included. We're not all so busy and important that we can't take 5 minutes of our day to use our highly evolved brains to find some sort of solution, imperfect as it may be.
