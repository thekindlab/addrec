14,"That link actually confirms my concerns about mental illness and substance abuse and why people are continually denied when those are comorbid. Step six of that process essentially asks an examiner to determine if someone's disability would not be as severe and potentially make then able to work if they were not actively abusing substances. I feel confident that most people doing these determinations at social security are not licensed clinicians and have no real way of knowing that. Nor is there any real way of knowing that, even for a licensed clinician. The default assumption then becomes, ""the depression this person is experiencing would be a lot better if they weren't drinking so, we are going to deny their disability."" The concept is, as you so warmly put it, people on disability shouldn't be using their benefits to buy drugs. 

I agree that disability benefits should not be used to support addiction. That is not ideal. There should be some recognition however that cooccurring disorders, particularly in mental health, are hugely prevalent, and those people are likely to need more help, not less. Denying them access to the healthcare benefits that social security provides just ensures that they continue on the death spiral. 

I was lucky in that I did not have a substance issue to contend with so my appeal went smoothly (I was of course initially denied because I was in my early 30's and it was a mental illness claim). It's not okay that the denial rates for legitimately mentally ill people is so high. In my case, I hadn't had a job last longer than six months in my entire life. I was in my early 30's, had a college degree but it took like 8 years to get it because I had to drop so many semesters. I had to file bankruptcy at one point due to a $30k 2 month shopping spree. My case was pretty obvious. I had 4 years of biweekly psychiatry visit notes along with a very specific evaluation from my psychiatrist. I had also qualified for disability from my state. I was still initially denied by social security, had to get a lawyer, wait two years for an appeal hearing all to get my SSI benefit of $430 or whatever a month since I live with my parents. The Medicaid is what I really needed, so that was the important part. Honestly though, that is a bit of a joke since it only covers 20 mental health visits (psychiatry and therapy included in that) so I have multiple ongoing battles with my local mental health agency for therapy and such. So, it's kind of a mess.

Arguing that somehow this system works, to people who actually have to live in it, doesn't fly. I'm sure you want to defend it. That's great. Good for you.

Also for me, it isn't just pain, not even nearly, I'm a pretty big fall risk and I've already been nearly trampled (pushed down AND jumped all over) in one of these crowds at a concert like this one I want to see, so I could get really hurt.

21,"No medication inherently means a person has a disability, and even further, no disease is classified by the government as ""disabled."" The ADA outlines categories of life activities, and if you have, or even in some cases are perceived as having, an impairment that leads to your inability to perform one or more life sustaining activity, you can seek reasonable accommodations through your employer and your government under the ADA. 

For example, some people with rheumatoid arthritis have their condition well under control and might be going out climbing mountains on the weekends and capable of performing all sustaining life activities. However, one person might be unable to even dress themselves. The second person would qualify for disability status under the ADA. The impact of the disease on the individual can very so much that the decision was to look at a persons capability or incapability of performing certain ubiquitous life functions. This is why the government is not in the business of classifying any particular disease or condition as disabled. Also could you imagine the outcry! If the government suddenly declared that everyone taking a high blood pressure medication was disabled... some people would be unaffected, some would be infuriated as they are otherwise healthy, and others would attempt to flood or ""game"" the system. This is why we look at it on the individual basis. 

So, to specifically answer your question, no diagnosis is universally considered disabled.

As to not being able to drive, does your city public transportation? If so, they may have a special system for disabled persons who cannot drive and who may not be able to use the regular bus. For me, I was able to use this system because I use a rolling walker and there were no sidewalks between me and the bus stops closest to my house. In your case, your doctor may certify that you can't use public transportation due to your back pain (exhaustion/inability to walk long distances to bus stops, busses can be awfully herky-jerky and pain inducing!) and your anxiety (the anxiety of a press of people, the anxiety of bus schedules, etc.). Cost will vary. In my city the one-way trips to wherever I wanted to go, while not always convenient (they often got me to doctor's appointments over an hour early) were cheap at $1.95.

However, please note that your brother (due to no work history) is going to be applying for SSI only and *a lot* of lawyers won't take SSI-only claims.

If you can't find an attorney I would suggest looking at any large, community based mental health centers in the area. Sometimes they have staff members that can serve as ""non attorney representatives"" for SSI which gives them all the rights of an attorney (to speak to SSA, submit paperwork, etc) but they don't get paid. 

As a practical matter, I can understand that there isn't much that ongoing treatment is going to help your brother, but SSA really gives more weight to cases where there is ongoing treatment.

If I had your claim I wouldn't grant you benefits, and while there is some subjectivity between examiners I am confident that 97% of examiners would make the same decision.  

I think you need to do what you can to get into a podiatrist and psychiatrist or therapist. Don't think of it as things that will help your SSI claim rather things that are going to help your health. And try different jobs. You say that you wouldn't be able to do a sedentary job full time but you dismiss it without even trying. Working with chronic conditions sucks, I know that personally, but you are selling yourself short.  You say that you cannot work any job but you dismiss anything other than mowing lawns immediately. The SSA definition of disability is that you are prevented from doing ALL jobs. Not just jobs that you want to do, think you can do, or even that are available in your town.  

You seem like a real nice guy and I do sympathize with you and your situation. I just want you to have some contingency plans should you not get SSI. ",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1473122881,t5_2qhe8,t3_513e7i,t1_d7auv2q,3,1475369756,0,0,d7awylb,disability,3,,,,

So even the idea of productivity is perverted. I don't think it's judgmental to call productivity a virtue.

1.  It's impossible to say whether you're a good candidate based just on your information. It is going to depend mostly on what is in your medical records. It is great that you have your doctors to support you but please keep in mind that your doctors don't get to decide your disability status. They cAn provide supporting documentation and opinions but those opinions must be supported by there records. 

2.  When you apply for disability they will look into all the programs that you are eligible for. The two main types are SSDI and SSI. both have the same medical qualifications but the non-medical qualifications are different. SSDI is based. On your women work record, this usually requires 20 quarters of earnings within the last 10 years. However, if you are under 31 the rules are slightly different and you basically just need to have worked 50% of the time starting at age 21. SSI has no work requirements, you just need to have under $2,000 in assets. There is a subset of SSDI that is based on your parents earnings (if you're not insure yourself for SSDI) that requires disability to be established prior to age22. However, since you have worked since then you would be ineligible for this program. 

You can make a mysocialsecurity account online at ssa.gov to see if your insured for SSDI benefits. 

3.   Cart before the horse question. There are programs but it depends on whether these are private or federal loans, what type of loan program, etc

4.  While you are in the application process you can work under SGA (2016 is $1130/mo gross) and still have an application pending. You should be aware that SSA looks at your current daily/functional activities when making a disability determination. If you are working 15-20hours per week that will lend less credibility to your claim that you are disabled.  Also, if you are cohabitation with your girlfriend, SSA can end up using her assets and income towards the ""household"" and render you ineligible for SSI. You don't necessarily need to be married. These situations are very fact specific and I don't do financial eligibility so I can't give you any more specifics. 

5.  You can work while on SSDI and SSI. the rules for working are different for each. SSI is much more restrictive and your benefits will be reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn pee month. SSDI you won't see a reduced check as long as you stay under the SGA limit. Again, this is. Dry simplified information and you'd need to talk to SSA, should you get approvd, for the specific information. 

6. You seem to have all your ducks in a row. Honestly, you seem smart enough that you don't need a disability attorney at this point. The paperwork honestly isn't that hard; if you went to college you can handle it. I only ever suggest a disability attorney once you are denied at the initial/recon levels and you are going before a judge. The first two levels that aren't going to be able to make your case go any faster or improve your chances.  Honestly, they can actually impede your case (depending on the attorney) because they can slow it down and prevent an adjudicator from calling you for additional information. Information from the claimant is usually the tipping point for an allowance. If the attorney gives us the information it is usually heavily embellished so we just disregard it. 


Again, I don't have a crystal ball to be able to tell you if you'd be allowed or not. Being young doesn't help your case nor does completing a college degree And working during the time that you will be claiming your condition is disabling. One thing that they will look at is the type of work you've done and whether you can do other work. Have you tried switching jobs/positions to see if that will help? The best evidence (second to your medical records) is a consistent pattern of failed work attempts. You are going to claim that you can work but if you've been at the same job for 1-1.5 years (even if it was difficult) they will say that the work has been successful. There is a big difference between having difficultly working due to a medical conditions (or pain in your case) and that medical condition being disabling.

111,"I think the helplessness and grief of losing my abilities is certainly a factor, yes. At least, in causing its increased severity. My hoarding compulsion began when I was much younger, just at a much less severe level. Like the majority of my unusual/dysfunctional behaviors as an adult, I think the root cause is most likely based in my early experiences with my former stepfather. To put it bluntly: he was an abusive asshole. Because my sister is naturally timid and passive, he didn't pay her much attention, but being the type of person I am (according to my mother I learned to speak so late they were concerned I might be developmentally stunted in some way, but once I started talking I haven't shut up since) I became his primary target. Aside from the run of the mill physical and verbal abuse, he also did things like coming into my room uninvited, going through my things, and throwing away anything he deemed ""useless"" (toys, books, my journal, whatever). So I'm pretty certain that's the root of the hoarding behavior, as well as my compulsive need to keep my bedroom door closed, and why having anyone in my ""personal space"" or touching my possessions makes me irrationally anxious. It's obnoxious that 20 years later he's *still* interferring in my life. Ugh.

* You always get the right-of-way. Always. Even if it means people leap five feet sideways in fear of getting hit by the cripple.

170,"You've go a lot in there, so I'll try to kind of go through point by point

You are not going to be eligible for SSDI because of your lack of work history; unless you have a parent that is deceased, retired, or disabled. You're SSI eligibility will depend on your assets. You cannot apply for SSI online; you'll need to contact your local FO to set up an appointment (in phone or in person)

Form what information you've given, honestly, you probably won't medically qualify. As the other poster said, it is more about functional limitations than diagnosis. BUT you still have to have a medically determinable impairment (MDI) that could *reasonably* cause your reported limitations. 

Your main complaints seem to be back/neck and feet. I'll just tell you know that your allergies and blood pressure will not come into play. Each are controlled with medications and they aren't going to cause significant work related limitations. 

The problem with your musculoskeletal complaints is that you really don't have that diagnosis (MDI); muscle spams are a symptom of a problem not a condition in themselves. The fact that you've had normal X-rays and MRIs (along with your foot complaints) leads me to believe that this is more of a physiological condition. Either related to deconditioning (you are obese but at your age your body can overcome that a bit), posture, or your activity level. Did all of this get worse after you started mowing? If you already had poor posture/conditioning and you threw yourself into physical work it is going to make the situation worse 

Your information sounds familiar; I""m thinking that you have PM'd me before. I do think that you need to seek out additional medical treatment. Stop going to that chiropractor - he is just going to keep trying to sell you things and you need a physical therapist (they are NOT the same). Also, chiropractors are not considered ""acceptable medical sources"" per SSA guidelines; so even if he did diagnose you SSA can't use it. Only certain MDs can give medical diagnoses and opinions; this does exclude PT providers but their information can still be used.

 I would also encourage you to see a psychiatrist or a therapist. The human body is amazing and infuriating at the same time; there is a very strong connection between our mental health and our physical well-being. Untreated depression and anxiety can cause chronic pain, or a least exacerbate minor issues. Your description of the neck muscle spasms and chronic headaches (without physical explanation) makes me think that you are under a great deal of stress or anxiety? You are seeking for explanation with all these specialists (which is fine, you do need to rule out something serious) but a lot of times the explanations are much simpler. Take care of your mental health, work on your body mechanics, and work on conditioning and I suspect a lot of this would get better.

I suspect the initial denial rate for mental illness specifically is even higher than 70%, simply based on google completion results and forums for people with psychiatric disabilities. People are continually asking what to do because their disability claim was denied and they are on multiple medications, have been hospitalized multiple times, sometimes have lasting short term memory loss from ECT, and horrific work histories. They can't work but they are still denied disability. It happens constantly. 

In my case, my disability is supposed to be reviewed every three years. Somehow, my bipolar might suddenly be cured and I might magically be healed enough. Never mind I have been struggling for 20 and have never successfully held a job longer than six months. In three years I might be all better. The BEST part? There is no hearing in three years. The system is so back logged, that hasn't happened. The fact that my determination letter SAYS three years though, makes it so I am not considered permanently disabled. It's great. It means that the ton of student debt that I have gets to hang over my head but I cannot pay it so it sits on income contingent basis but cannot be discharged because my determination letter says three years. 

Social security can say whatever they want. They can set whatever rules they want but all of those have actual consequences for people. Those decisions that are made every day, have a huge impact. When someone has a legit mental illness record and is legitimately mentally ill, yet they are denied because they drink, they then have to wait two or three years before they can even see anyone for an appeal. In the meantime, their whole life is continuing to fall apart. 

I didn't really have the two years to spare while I was waiting for my appeal. I was ""lucky"" to be so poor that I qualified for state disability assistance. That literally meant that I had less than $200 a month coming in. I got Medicaid that way and so when I ended up on a psych unit, it was paid for. 

I realize you feel like you need to correct ""faulty"" information on the Internet, but I feel like I need to remind you that you are dealing with real life long term impacts on people's lives every day. You are the difference between homelessness or keeping a roof over a family's head in some cases. You are the difference in someone deciding whether the fight for life is still worth it. You in a very real way, hold a ton of power. Compassion is warranted.

""Some people are just addicts"" is not an informed statement about addiction either. Addiction IS an illness. I have watched it consume many people. It's not a choice. Some people can drink a beer on a Saturday and be fine. Some people pick up a beer on a Saturday and never put one down again. That isn't a matter of choice. Thinking it is kind of proves the whole problem with the attitude of the SSA in general. Substance abuse is in the DSM. It's part of mental health treatment. ""Just an addict"" is ""just disgusting."" You ""just work at the SSA."" What do you know about addictive disorders?

183,"Pre-chopped veggies can be a lifesaver, too. They do cost a bit more, but they can be worth it in terms of not having to do the chopping and the cleaning up of cutting boards and knives. Most grocery stores have at the very least pre-chopped onions, celery, and carrots already in a dice that are good for putting in soups and whatnot.

Sometimes I buy just the pre-cut carrot sticks as I like to snack on them, and then I can very easily dice some of them up if I need diced carrots rather than having to wash, peel, slice and then dice a carrot. Some stores have a wider selection, like pre-packed sliced fajita vegetables that they do ""in house."" Many also have pre-washed/bagged vegetables such as broccoli crowns and cauliflower crowns. These are great because it takes out a lot of the prep. They are good for simply opening up and snacking on with some dip, you can pour them into a microwave steamer for fresh steamed veggies, or you can use them in another dish.

Pre-done stir-fry kits are also super easy for prep work. My store has some fresh options with the aforementioned fresh veggie section but also there's options in the frozen. Open bag, dump into a skillet, add in 1 pound of pre-peeled&amp;deveined shrimp and dinner is done in about 7 minutes with no chopping or prep. You can make it chicken stir-fry very simply by looking for frozen, fully-cooked chicken breast strips if you don't want to mess with cutting up raw chicken.

I would say that one of my favorite kitchen tools, for versatility and ease of use, is an InstantPot. It's a combination pressure cooker/slow cooker, which does have a sauté function so you can brown things before adding in liquids. It is bulky, but it has a twist-on lid with a handle on top that makes it easy to pick up and move if you're having problems lifting with both arms. Because it is electric, you could also place it on a lower surface to cook with. I love it for making big batches of homemade chili (with beans even!), stews made with pre-cubed meat, homemade soups or even things like slow-cooker pasta sauce with pre-made frozen meatballs.

Speaking of pasta, it doesn't always have to be a case of boil a bunch of water, boil pasta, drain, then put pasta on the plate and put sauce on the top.

190,"I'll second the food processor. Get one with a wide feeder tube so you can slice bigger things into flat discs. If you need to chop something further, it is a little easier to work a knife if you've got flat objects on a flat surface. Food processors aren't that hard to clean really.. if you have a sprayer on your sink, it is quite simple (even better with a dishwasher). Just dump out the blade into the sink and rinse it off and toss in the dishwasher. Rinse out the work bowl and lid and toss in the dishwasher. Easy. I have an old Cuisnart DLC-5 that came with three different slicing blades, a shred, a medium slice, a chopping blade and something else I can't think of. Works great for shredding cheese and vegetables, pulverizing all the things for salsa and slice things like cucumber or whatever. For peeling things, there is this video where a guy stabs some apples with a power drill and holds a vegetable peeler against the apple and it peels in no time... 
Getting things presliced is way more expensive than buying whole. I'd also recommend a foodsaver. If you have a friend or family member who wouldn't mind doing some chopping for you, you can seal up things you aren't going to use right away and it stays pretty fresh!

Actual reply:

For the 

    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

which will turn out like this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \* ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol

***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***

Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \_italicize\_ or \*italicize\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\_italicize\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.",,,,Shrugfacebot,,,1473425777,t5_2qhe8,t3_51trer,t1_d7fk7fb,2,1475485651,0,0,d7fk7it,disability,2,,,,

207,"**edit: ok finished writing**

I wanted to give a personal anecdote on top of what /u/RambleRamble has already explained (she's ***wonderful*** by the way!!). I had my CDR appeal last month. I had no idea what to expect so I'm glad I can share my experience now.

I went to a field office near me (I'm not sure if it's set up like this at all places but) it was a small building with a waiting room and on either side there were small hearing rooms. on one side there were a few chairs, and a table that spans the length of the room. then a glass partition dividing you from the other half which is where the officer sits at a computer with a microphone (I would imagine they record the hearing as well as typing). 

So they call you in and basically review your case and now you have an opportunity to tell your side of the story, to bring up any mistakes that you may have seen in your records. (**I HIGHLY recommend making an appointment at your local office BEFORE YOUR HEARING for them to burn you a disk of your files**). As /u/RambleRamble mentioned, ALL of your files are in there, along with internal memos and whatnot. It will have all of your files from the very beginning of your case! What I did (which might not be practical for you, it depends on what info you have) was print out all of my documents and went through them with a fine toothed comb, making notes in the margins and highlighting things. 

I put in my request for a hearing in February 2016, and received a letter DATED July 4th for a hearing set for July 26th. They mail out the notice 21 days before your hearing. The 21 days counts from the date on the letter, so for me I didn't actually have 21 days, I had a little less because of waiting for the mail. 

My diagnoses were RSD/CRPS (chronic nerve pain disease), trochanteric bursitis, myofascial pain syndrome, PTSD, Depression, ADHD. My RSD, MPS and bursitis are the most disabling. I have a spinal cord stimulator. 

Go into the hearing with a plan, with notes if you need them. I made a binder with sticky notes and highlights in case I needed to refer to them. I only brought in a copy of my resume (to demonstrate that I am unable to do any of the jobs I used to). I did bring my fiance with me, but the hearing officer decided he didn't need to speak with him. They wait outside the room, and if called to testify they go into the room alone.

I think the biggest thing was that they thought I couldn't walk AT ALL when I was using a wheelchair when they first granted me benefits, so when they saw me able to walk even a small bit during this CDR they assumed I had greatly improved which wasn't the case. I noticed the DHO said something to that effect in his paperwork. He said I was very intelligent and he ended up making his decision the next day which I noticed on the letter. It did take me about a week and a half to get my approval. Again, this is my PERSONAL experience, so it's not the same for everyone.

I wanted to give a personal anecdote on top of what <USER> has already explained (she's ***wonderful*** by the way!!). I had my CDR appeal last month. I had no idea what to expect so I'm glad I can share my experience now.

I went to a field office near me (I'm not sure if it's set up like this at all places but) it was a small building with a waiting room and on either side there were small hearing rooms. on one side there were a few chairs, and a table that spans the length of the room. then a glass partition dividing you from the other half which is where the officer sits at a computer with a microphone (I would imagine they record the hearing as well as typing). 

So they call you in and basically review your case and now you have an opportunity to tell your side of the story, to bring up any mistakes that you may have seen in your records. (**I HIGHLY recommend making an appointment at your local office BEFORE YOUR HEARING for them to burn you a disk of your files**). As <USER> mentioned, ALL of your files are in there, along with internal memos and whatnot. It will have all of your files from the very beginning of your case! What I did (which might not be practical for you, it depends on what info you have) was print out all of my documents and went through them with a fine toothed comb, making notes in the margins and highlighting things.

240,"Fellow person with depression that meds don't help much with.  I haven't had the same experiences you've had, but I feel some of your pain.

Have you tried SNRIs?  There are several.  Or adding other antipsychotics (even if your depression doesn't have psychotic features, sometimes adding antipsychotics can help boost the efficacy of your antidepressant).  There are loads of options these days.  On the one hand that can be reassuring - there's lots to try! - but on the other hand it can be overwhelming - there are so many to try!  

I certainly don't blame you for not wanting to get off your meds again, especially if you know without the meds you're suicidal.  If you are able to afford it, you might want to discuss with your doctor going into the hospital to facilitate your med change.  This will help keep you safe and will allow the docs to observe how these meds affect you.  But I know there are various reasons why you might not be able to.

244,"Invest in some really solid oven mitts (bbq gloves if you want something you can wear throughout the process) and a thick thermal resistant apron in case you're moving something hot and your strength gives out requiring you to rest it in your lap. 

After that get a few good knives. In order: a big old vegetable cleaver, a good chef's knife, pairing knife, and bread knife. A sharp and heavy knife is safer than some light flimsy thing and should save you a lot of work and injury. Let the knife do the cutting for you.

Get pots and pans that work for you. Working with something unnecessarily large and unwieldy is just asking for trouble. Hot plates and griddles may also be something work looking into if counter top / stove top reach is an issue. There can be a lot of splashing and that can come with a lot of burning. If you're at chest level with a hot oil filled pan you may be in for a nasty surprise. 

Slowcookers are amazing if you get into them, but they can be on the heavy side when moving them around and cleaning. Many of the recipes just have you toss in ingredients and wait with very minimal prep work. I love my slowcooker. 

Food processors, stand mixers, and immersion blenders are also great if you're going to use them.

As for the actual cooking start out with simple stuff and work your way up. Eggs, pastas, stir fry, and wraps are great examples of this. Learn too cook plain eggs in a few different ways, move up to omelettes, frittatas, and quiches. 

Pasta, buy everything premade, throw in your jarred sauce, with maybe a few herbs, spices, and ingredients (meat / onions / mushrooms / carrots / celery or whatever you fancy) and you got yourself a meal in about 10 to 15 minutes. Start getting fancy and adding in more meats / veggies, start making your own sauces, pastas, however far you feel like going with that. You learn a lot about sauces, seasoning, and flavour with pastas. 

Stir fry, grab a frozen bag of mixed veggies, some rice or noodles, jarred sauce, and whatever else you feel like tossing into the pan. Start making your own sauces, get experimenting with rices and noodles, move on to fresh veggies as you see fit. Quick and easy meals full of fundamental cooking experience.

Wraps and sandwiches are also a really great place to focus on --especially if you get into a slowcooker. They usually require minimal effort for a lot of flavor. 

Finally, look at what you want to eat and start building up your kitchen from there. Nothing wrong with buying a dozen eggs, some pasta, a jar of tomato sauce, lettuce, a couple veggies, sausage / ground beef, and some wraps. You got yourself a nice and simple pasta or two (if you get adventurous and make carbonara), some tacos / burritos, and a bunch of breakfasts. Work on a few meals a week, get them under your belt, and move onward to more adventurous recipes.  

Lastly, just keep in mind that a lot of things can be made in an oven. Don't have a BBQ? Oven! Stove top getting you down? Oven! Not into that slowcooker noise? Oven! 

Super lastly, if you are new to cooking know that it comes down to heat, ingredients, and time, and heat is one of the biggest mistakes new cooks make. Eggs can and often should be done with low to medium-low heat. Nearly everything else with medium heat. Save the max heat for warming up pots and pans, getting water to a faster boil, or searing the hell out of something.

Other people would do anything for a cure.  It might be good to have characters who have these differing viewpoints: the main character you describe would obviously do anything to cure themselves since they're using magic, but maybe they have a friend with the same condition who thinks using magic to lessen its effects is unnatural.

Here's another frame of reference: have you seen the X-Men movies?  In the third one, there becomes a cure available for people who are mutants.  Some of the characters think it's offensive, that there's nothing wrong with being different; some even thinks it's an attempted genocide on mutants.

255,"SSI and SSDI are not designed to support people's substance abuse habits. There are many distinctions within the program when it comes to the ""materiality"" of drug abuse/addiction (DAA). The only time that comes into play is if that person, with DAA issues, is found to be disabled. If SSA can show (with evidence) that, absent the DAA, that person would NOT be disabled then they will be denied. 

SSA understands and tries to be sensitive to the fact that a lot of people (especially with mental health) self-medicate with substances. If a person is considered disabled despite the ongoing DAA then they will be allowed benefits.

Here are a few examples to illustrate how DAA is processed:

* Individual is diagnosed with depression and alcoholism. Records show that even with alcoholism, the person would not be disabled. Claim will be denied with barely a mention of the alcohol issues. 

*  Same depression/alcoholism issues as example 1. however, this individual has years of documented severe depression and alcoholism to the point that it is considered to be disabling. However, this person has been an alcoholic their entire life and has no periods of sobriety. SSA rules dictate that if there is no period of sobriety to look at, DAA cannot be material. In this example the person is allowed benefits giving the claimant the benefit of the doubt that depression alone is disabling. 

* Same situation as example 2. However, in this example, the claimants depression was controlled for several years during a period of sobriety. Record shows that claimant started drinking heavily and their functioning got worse to the point that current condition is disabling. In this example, the person would likely be denied for ""DAA materiality"" reasons. Because SSA has evidence showing that the alcoholism is what is disabling, not the depression. 

DAA materiality denials really don't happen as much as people would like to think. There has to be a preponderance of evidence to show that drugs/alcohol are the cause of the disabling functioning. I believe that all individuals have the right to drink and do drugs to their hearts content, but if that ongoing abuse renders them disabled then that is not on the taxpayers to support them.

257,"Hey there. Thought I'd pop in and take a crack at answering.

I'm legally blind due to an eye disorder that WILL get worse. Retinitis Pigmentosa is degenerative, and I've got the eye tests to back up the fact that I've lost about 60% of the vision I had when I was originally diagnosed at age 11. I'm 26 now. I met my wife almost eight years ago, and we're coming up on our first year anniversary. We were together for 6-7 years before we had the wedding, but that was because it took me a while to finish college. :/ Whatever. 

Your mileage may vary with your partner, but trust me on one thing:
If your partner leaves because you've fallen beneath some sort of ""threshold"" of ability because stuff has gotten worse, then fuck 'em. It's not something you can control, and if they can't handle it, they can't handle it.

I too have worries about being a burden. I worry about burdening my wife, my family, my friends, and it's a crappy feeling. No doubt about it. I can't drive, and my wife hates driving, but when we visit family across my state, she puts up with it and I do my best to help her manage the stress of driving by finding audiobooks, telling jokes, and reminding her that it's okay to take a few minutes' break from driving every hour or two. Remember that your relationship isn't going to be a one-way street when it comes to caring about someone. you're contributing something, even if it's not in the manual-labor department. 

If you worry about your disability getting worse over time and that impacting your relationship, that stress is going to affect your relationship, and may affect your health and make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. My wife can tell I'm feeling guilty if we go somewhere that I want to and she doesn't necessarily seem to want to go, but she drives anyway because I can't. I also happen to be a way better cook than she is, so if she's craving something that I'm not craving, I'll try to make it anyway. That kind of compromise happens in all relationships. Maybe to some, it may seem a bit like the scales aren't balanced, but at least you're trying, or you should be. Honestly, the best advice I can give you about any future relationships you may have is to take it a day at a time. If they don't feel you're worth the trouble, they're not worth yours either.

As for ""preparing"" for my disability to get worse, I kinda got that out of the way when I was diagnosed as a kid, i.e. braille classes, learning how to be as independent as possible, etc. For something like cerebral palsy, just keep a look out for the newest adaptations that come out. Could an exoskeleton work for you? Keep an eye out for articles. A more comfortable chair for the shower? Bookmark that crap on amazon. As long as you're aware of your own disability, you should be fine. Even if there's a sudden change, you adapt as best you can like anyone gaining a new disability. Remember, once all these able-bodied fucks hit 50, their chances of joining our club goes up exponentially every year. We've got a head start on living our lives with a disability. 

You deserve to be happy. If you're genuinely happier being single, no sweat. If you want companionship, that's fine too. Don't feel guilty about wanting something that most other people want as well just because you're different.

And remember, you're a *different* kind of relationship, but not a *lesser* kind of relationship. Different, not less. That's my mantra. 

Now go forth and try to be happy. If you come back worried about what to do as a parent with a disability, I'll consider my advice a success. :P",,,,blind_devotion08,Retinitis Pigmentosa / Legally Blind,,1473264838,t5_2qhe8,t3_51lw2o,t3_51lw2o,5,1475417746,0,0,d7cxz39,disability,5,,,,

272,"I'm going to be honest. I didn't read a lot of what you wrote. 

Let's start at the top. By ""red flags"" I mean any of the several things which I recognized as potential problems with your case. Waiting several years to file, working during the period at issue, and not having a particularly compelling medical condition to name a few. Without more information these things do not bode well for your claim. Your age, income, and work experience are just some of the bits of information which would determine if the red flags are problematic. Up until now I didn't know your age. I still know very little about your MDIs and I know nothing about your past work. These things matter.

At this point I want to pause and remind you THAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TO TALK TO AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF YOUR CASE WHICH CAN'T BE PROPERLY EVALUATED OVER REDDIT! 

DDD is not that interesting of a diagnosis; however, someone over 55 can get a lot more mileage out of that diagnosis than someone who is 35. You're 59, apparently. That's a good sign. This doesn't mean that you'll win or lose. I'd need to know more about your medical history and past work experience to make that sort of judgment. Same with 50% blindness or whatever. There is case law concerning visual deficits which evaluates the condition outside of a Step 3 argument.

Let's talk about medical exams. I think I saw that mentioned in there somewhere. As I said earlier, you will probably be ordered to attend a consultative examination. This is an examination WHERE THE SSA PAYS FOR YOU TO SEE A DOCTOR. You will not be charged for this appointment. Said doctor will review medical records and possibly conduct imaging studies such as x-rays and MRIs. Again, as I've said before, the SSA will pay for this. All you have to do is show up.

Lastly, I saw some worry about legal fees and such. I have said this twice already: YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT PAY ANYTHING UNLESS YOU PREVAIL IN YOUR CLAIM. The SSA has rules which govern how much a law firm can collect from disability applicants. 

I don't know what the other atty told you. I can't imagine that it was a productive conversation because you don't appear to have a grasp on what actually matters. I would hope that speaking with a competent atty would give you such an insight. Maybe this atty was incompetent or inexperienced. I neither know nor care.

You are doing yourself a disservice by not having your case evaluated by an attorney. It actually looks promising. I want to point out, though, again, that Reddit is not an appropriate place to conduct a proper evaluation.

Please. For the love of God. Stop flailing about on the Internet and retain an attorney. Send me a personal message or something and I'll see if I can put you in contact with someone who can help you.",,,,Thirdrawn,,,1474513748,t5_2qhe8,t3_53fh0g,t1_d7wtoa9,1,1475930648,0,0,d7wzyj6,disability,1,,,,

Also, I know nothing about your ""genetic condition"" but it needs to cause more than DDD in order to be noteworthy. Everybody has DDD at L5/S1. Visual deficits are generally judged based on the best correction in the better eye.

275,"I don't understand. My dad got a disability when he was 40 and had to quit climbing the corporate ladder at age 44, when he quit work. He had to be the stay-at-home parent. When he first quit work, he said he was sad because he was on the way to becoming the CEO of the company he worked for. He said he overcame it by giving himself ""Stay-at-Home Parent"" as his corporate title. As one human being who often has a difficult time coping whenever life gives me lemons, I often think about my dad as inspiration. 

I think, for the most part, Americans (and probably people in other countries) like the underdog and since our world is predominantly designed for able-bodied people, someone who is disabled is almost always (if not always) an underdog.

My understanding about thinking of a disabled person is ok if the following happens: 1. I don't think the person has a unique story because that person is disabled. It is because society has put that person in a tough situation, which makes him/her an underdog. 2. I understand that no one is perfect, and that includes the disabled people I have put on a pedestal. For example, I know that my dad looks back at his paid career fondly and sometimes wishes he could return to it and that's ok. I still think of him as a role model because he has been able to think positive thoughts about his career most of the time.

If those of us who are not disabled think within those limits, is it ok?",,,,its_all_one_word,,,1473300630,t5_2qhe8,t3_51l46x,t3_51l46x,1,1475436549,0,0,d7do77j,disability,1,,,,

284,"I can understand why this is a tough situation. Here's my two cents.

One option is to call whatever airlines you might use and ask them about what sort of accommodations they can make for someone in a wheelchair who might also need to get to the bathroom on short notice. Even though 9 hours is less than 14, it's still a long time, even for people without any medical issues. Armed with new information, you could always try convincing her that way.

Still, your mom is the one with the MS, and even if it might seem like she's making excuses, (and hey, that could very well be the case,) she's still the one who gets to make the call about whether or not she thinks she can handle the trip. 

It's always fine to encourage someone to try something they're unsure about, but if she gives a firm answer like ""No, I can't do/handle that,"" you need to just respect that decision. It sucks, but hey, you can always do a study abroad thing in college or save up for the trip to go alone or with a friend.

Another (kinda out there) option would be to go yourself or with a friend/family member and video EVERYTHING. Between youtube, skype, and maybe some livestreaming stuff I don't know about, maybe you can give her the virtual experience. Maybe find a way to do panoramic shots of different scenic locations and let her ""look around"" from the comfort of her own environment. You could start small with something like a day trip to somewhere 5-6 hours away, see if that gets the travel-excitement going again, and hooray!

After a health scare he dropped the weight. All of it. A year later I started slowing down, it took a while to get diagnosed.

Treatment when I was young has mostly fixed my issues, but working labor intensive jobs the last 10 years really did some damage. I went to a podiatrist first, and was given multiple steroid shots, as well as some ""custom"" inserts. They were really just generic inserts with some arbitrary padding glued on. They kinda worked, but they slid around a lot and I would always be partially walking on the edge of the insert because they were too small. I got fed up trying to deal with them after about 8 months and went to my orthopedic specialist. He was much more expensive, and not very polite.  He did comment on the inserts saying they were bad idea, I needed real custom ones. He sent me to a place that makes prosthetic limbs and splints. Now I have inserts that wrap around my foot on both sides, and go up past the ankles. They had to goof with insurance claim, because these inserts are typically for diabetes patients,  which I am not. It went through after about 12 months of submitting  and re submitting.

305,"I'm no expert in CP, but I have enough neuroscientific knowledge to give a bit of background. CP is a developmental brain disorder mainly affecting the motor cortex. From this you can already conclude that hemiplegia is more common, since this will occur when one hemisphere of the brain is affected, but the other isn't. 

There is however no theoretical reason for only the arms to be affected, but also no theoretical reason for only the legs to be affected. From my understanding of the disorder, often all limbs are affected to some extent. Pure paraplegia is not common in CP (*only* legs affected), same as pure paralysis of the arms is probably not common. This is because the damage or problematic brain development encountered in CP, will rarely follow the mapping of muscles of the brain. Areas that map to very different parts of the body can be found next to each other. There is no reason to assume that the 'damage' in CP (which can be from various sources) is specific to either the arm or leg area's. 

Someone who is better verses in CP, can probably be more clear about this. What I can be a bit more clear about, is the naming conventions. The reason we have names for certain types of paralysis is that they are common. I tried to explain above that pure paralysis of the arms is not very common, so that is why there is no name for. 

Paraplegia happens to almost all people that get substantial damage to their spinal cord anywhere in the T1-L2 region. Quadraplegia happens to people that get substantial damage in the C5-C7 region. Pentaplegion (a phrase I don't commonly hear), happens to people with damage in the C2-C4 region and in brain disorders, most famously ALS. Hemiplegia is characteristic of onesided brain damage, such as trauma and strokes. If you have twosided brain damage, you often have quad or triplegia (also something I don't hear often). 

It is possible to have only your arms affected, but for that you would need very twosided damage to your brain to very specific regions, leaving intact the regions next to it. The other way would be to have two sided damage in the spinal cord (or just outside it) that would only affect the nerves innervating the arms. Due to the nature of brain and nerve damage, this is just extremely rare. 

The only cases that I know of that have specific paralysis of an arm, are when the nerve going to the arm is cut off outside the spinal cord.

Not paying someone benefits for DAA is written into social security legislation. While substance abuse very much needs to be treated as a mental illness by society, there is still a line between having the illness and being disabled by it.

321,"To be honest, I don't find your voice all that unusual. Granted, I worked in the medical field for 13 years and had exposure to a wide range of intellectual and neurological conditions that cause vocal issues, so what sounds unremarkable to me  might not be inline with the average person. The thing about youtube is bullying trolls are assholes, and they can be persistent. I had a similar situation where this girl started harassing me about my disability, and then told her subscribers that I was the one harassing *her*, and sent them all to my channel to downvote me. She also did weird things like stealing my videos and uploading them under an account with my name on it (I still don't understand what that was meant to accomplish). I tried to reason with her and when that didn't work I blocked her account, but she just came back under different accounts, so I filed a formal cyberbullying complaint with google (they own youtube). If you block someone, they aren't allowed to return to your channel with a different account. They also aren't allowed to use multiple accounts to downvote you, and google can tell when they do that because the accounts all have the same ISP. I suggest you take screenshots of any comments saying anything like that and file a cyberbullying complaint. 

And as hurtful and frustrating as it may be, try to keep it in perspective. Disabling the comments is an understandable knee-jerk reaction, but it doesn't really solve anything, and it eliminates one of the most important elements of youtube; interaction with your viewers. If you can't interact with your community, you might as well be screaming into the wind. Besides, it just lets your bullies know that they're affecting you, and why give them the satisfaction? To hell with them. They don't deserve that twisted kind of joy. Also, down votes might be hurtful, but turning ratings off is a bad idea. Youtube doesn't care if votes are up or down, they see them the same, and the more votes and traffic your videos get, the more likely they are to suggest your videos to people. When that girl sent her subs to downvote me she actually gave me quite a boost in traffic (she has a lot of subs because she does giveaways, Ipods and games and such, so basically she buys her subs) and I ended up getting more subs, both from youtube suggesting my videos more because of the higher traffic, and also because a few of her subs figured out she was being a jerk and called her out on it before subscribing to me :) It's rough being targeted in this manner, but the way you handle it can completely change the situation, and it could even become something positive, like it did for me. [This is a short vlog](https://youtu.be/C6TovWUMYso) I made at the time of the incident, and I think it will reinforce my earlier point about why disabling comments probably isn't the best way to approach the situation.

I also have some practical suggestions regarding your videos, and I hope you understand I only mean to help by sharing things I've learned through doing youtube myself. As a fellow disabled gamer and vlogger, I've found youtube to be very rewarding, and I would like you to get a similar experience out of it. So I want to share some tips on how to improve your videos, and I hope you'll focus more on that than on the cyberbullying, because I'd hate to see you give up on something that can be a wonderful outlet for people like us who (for different reasons, sure) have difficulty interacting and being involved in person. 

First, definitely don't record while driving. It's not a good idea in general, but if you have a naturally soft voice, road noise is going to drown you out, and even if you amplify the audio in post, your voice will still be hard to hear/understand and the road noise will just peak the audio all over the place. Plus, the moving background is distracting. When recording audio, especially if you don't have a good microphone (and I don't; I have to use my cell phone) remove all extra background sounds, including fans. If you can, put up padding or mattresses or even just some blankets around your recording space. This will help keep out background noise but also ""trap"" the sound of your voice so it will record more clearly and you won't have to amp it so much in post.

Also, you definitely need to work on editing. There were portions of the video where you were just sitting there silently for 5 to 15 seconds. Those *have* to go. If you go back through the video and cut out all the snippets of silence and watch it again, you will see a drastically improved video. Yes, it can be very tedious and time-consuming, especially if you have a crap computer (and heaven knows I do) but good editing can make up for what you may lack in audio or visual quality. If a viewer sees you just sitting there for 10 seconds, they're definitely going to click on another video, I promise you. 

And definitely don't feel bad or like I'm picking on you. I know these things because I've made the same mistakes myself, as did pretty much every youtuber :) If you want to see an example, you can compare [one of my more recent vlogs](https://youtu.be/kEo31BLVuxA) to the other one, and you'll most likely see the change in editing and audio quality.

I really hope you file a cyberbullying complaint and then put it out of your mind, and instead focus on some of these tips I've given you. It's a much better use of your time and energy, and hopefully in a few weeks you'll come out of this with no cyberbullies *and* higher quality content that will make youtube a more satisfying experience for you :) Chin up, and good luck!

Granted, I worked in the medical field for 13 years and had exposure to a wide range of intellectual and neurological conditions that cause vocal issues, so what sounds unremarkable to me  might not be inline with the average person. The thing about youtube is bullying trolls are assholes, and they can be persistent. I had a similar situation where this girl started harassing me about my disability, and then told her subscribers that I was the one harassing *her*, and sent them all to my channel to downvote me. She also did weird things like stealing my videos and uploading them under an account with my name on it (I still don't understand what that was meant to accomplish). I tried to reason with her and when that didn't work I blocked her account, but she just came back under different accounts, so I filed a formal cyberbullying complaint with google (they own youtube). If you block someone, they aren't allowed to return to your channel with a different account. They also aren't allowed to use multiple accounts to downvote you, and google can tell when they do that because the accounts all have the same ISP. I suggest you take screenshots of any comments saying anything like that and file a cyberbullying complaint. 

And as hurtful and frustrating as it may be, try to keep it in perspective. Disabling the comments is an understandable knee-jerk reaction, but it doesn't really solve anything, and it eliminates one of the most important elements of youtube; interaction with your viewers. If you can't interact with your community, you might as well be screaming into the wind. Besides, it just lets your bullies know that they're affecting you, and why give them the satisfaction? To hell with them. They don't deserve that twisted kind of joy. Also, down votes might be hurtful, but turning ratings off is a bad idea. Youtube doesn't care if votes are up or down, they see them the same, and the more votes and traffic your videos get, the more likely they are to suggest your videos to people. When that girl sent her subs to downvote me she actually gave me quite a boost in traffic (she has a lot of subs because she does giveaways, Ipods and games and such, so basically she buys her subs) and I ended up getting more subs, both from youtube suggesting my videos more because of the higher traffic, and also because a few of her subs figured out she was being a jerk and called her out on it before subscribing to me :) It's rough being targeted in this manner, but the way you handle it can completely change the situation, and it could even become something positive, like it did for me.

334,"The big thing is whether you are on SSI or SSDI. The work rules are much different for both.

I don't think you're going to get a specific answer here because no one has access to your pay stubs and other SSA-related information. For SSDI, generally, a person does get a 9 month trial work period (TWP) where they can earn as much as they want without affecting their benefits. After that, if you earn over current SGA amounts ($1130 in 2016) you wouldn't be entitled to a check that month. 

You need to rip the bandaid off and call SSA or make an appointment at the field office and bring all your check stubs. For those 9 months of your TWP, even if you made $1mil a month, they won't ask for that money back. The overpayment only comes after those 9 months if you earn too much. If you do happen to have a few overpayment months, they will set you up on a payment plan so they would take it out of your check in small amounts.

342,"All SSA records (aside from some very specific and rare situations) are kept electronically. So whatever was inputted in the system in Florida will be available for you in Colorado. 

It never hurts to get a copy of your SSA file. There used to be a big issue with folders getting lost but since the move to electronic-only folders several years ago this is, for the most part, no longer an issue. 

As far as record keeping; my best advice to anyone who is on disability is just to keep **everything** that SSA sends you. Most of that stuff you won't need, but it does not hurt to keep copies. Everyone also should keep some sort of record (notebook, 3 ring binder, etc) of their ongoing medical treatment. Just jotting down appointment information, doctors names/addresses, any med changes, etc. will be invaluable when it comes time for the CDR.  

If you have the means, I would also get copies of all her medical records. At minimum you need to get copies of all imaging studies (MRIs, xrays, CTs, etc), labwork, and any other testing. One of the big reasons that people are denied disability or have their benefits ceased is due to non-response from their medical sources. We can send records requests but we cannot force them to comply. If you have copies of the medical records it will ensure that SSA will have everything. 

I know it seems like a lot of work, but the value far exceeds it. I actually recommend this to all my friends/family just in case they ever have to file for disability, for insurance reasons, etc. I get copies of all my [important] medical records and just scan a .pdf electronic version and jot down the information in an excel spreadsheet.

Everyone also should keep some sort of record (notebook, 3 ring binder, etc) of their ongoing medical treatment. Just jotting down appointment information, doctors names/addresses, any med changes, etc. will be invaluable when it comes time for the CDR.  

If you have the means, I would also get copies of all her medical records. At minimum you need to get copies of all imaging studies (MRIs, xrays, CTs, etc), labwork, and any other testing. One of the big reasons that people are denied disability or have their benefits ceased is due to non-response from their medical sources. We can send records requests but we cannot force them to comply. If you have copies of the medical records it will ensure that SSA will have everything. 

I know it seems like a lot of work, but the value far exceeds it. I actually recommend this to all my friends/family just in case they ever have to file for disability, for insurance reasons, etc. I get copies of all my [important] medical records and just scan a .pdf electronic version and jot down the information in an excel spreadsheet. Not just for disability reasons, but because then anytime I see a new doctor or specialist I can pull up my entire medical history to show them instantly.

343,"I wouldn't worry about getting a lawyer. You aren't going to actually go before a judge. CDR appeals are done with a ""hearings officer"" who is essentially a very highly trained disability examiner. 

The hearing should happen fairly quickly (each state varies, I would be surprised if its more than a few months) as these cases stay within the DDS office and all these Hearings Officers do is CDR appeals. The wait time is NOTHING like the  people who wait for their ALJ hearing. After your hearing the HO will have to go through all the evidence, consult with doctors, and then write up their findings. This can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks (again, I'm just giving you my best guess, YMMV depending on the state) before you'll get the decision. 

For your hearing you can submit any additional documentation that you want. The fact that it is called a ""hearing"" is misleading, it is really more of a face-to-face interview with the hearings officer either in the DDS, or, if you don't live in the same town as the DDS office, they will likely have you report to the field office and you'll do it by video conference.  I do believe that you can bring a third party with you, but you can't bring a string of ""witnesses"". If you want your doctor's involvement I would suggest that they write a letter on your behalf and submit that. The HO can always call your doctor later for clarification/additional information if they want. 

You've taken the first two, and most important, steps. You've filed the appeal timely and elected for benefit continuation. At this point you just have to wait for your hearing to be set. In the meantime, I would gather as much evidence as you can so that you can be prepared. Letters from doctors, your current employer (maybe documenting any struggles you have at work), and other third parties will help your claim. I would also ask your doctor's for copies of all your medical records from the past 12 months. Often times with disability claims medical providers don't give their records to SSA; sometimes all a reversal of a decision takes is for the missing pieces to be added to the file. 

You can also contact SSA and ask for a copy of your file (they'll give it to you on a CD). Some of the paperwork is for internal SSA use and will be hard for you to follow, but it should still give you a general sense of the case. They would've had to have some indication that your condition has improved since you were first allowed. Perhaps your reported functioning improved, you're working now when you weren't then, your medical records show improvement, you don't get as much treatment, etc. ",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1475086843,t5_2qhe8,t3_54xk95,t3_54xk95,2,1476152644,0,0,d85tome,disability,2,,,,

 Despite not being religious I developed a weird compulsion involving acknowledging...blessings for lack of a better word, and giving thanks. Sounds great, focus on the positive right?

I felt if I didn't do it more bad things would happen to me because I didn't appreciate what I have or something.

As nice as the shuttle service was, they just had too many costumers and while I would give them a schedule, they would often have to drop me off two hours before my class and have to pick me up hours after I was finished, effectively adding five hours onto my days sometimes. It was a mess.

And while my friends were always willing to give me rides when it worked for them, I often felt awkward asking constantly when I needed to get groceries. Sometimes, I did do the half-hour hike with my wheelchair because I needed to buy milk. 

Taxis are expensive, and I found them so frustrating as the drivers often didn't understand my speech. Plus I had to wait until they could send the wheelchair van, which sometimes took hours. 

Also, I do feel like it helps with my personal safety.

389,"Is there any chance of getting a service animal? My neurological motor disorder (Dystonia) causes episodes that have some similarity to cataplexy in that I lose control of my body, though fortunately I know when one is coming about 10 to 15 seconds prior so I can lay down before it starts. One half of my body goes stiff and almost paralyzed, and the other half goes into incredibly painful convulsions and contortions, and this goes on for about 3 to 5 minutes, and I remain conscious the entire time, but unable to control any part of my body except my voice and eyes. 

Because they happen randomly I don't drive, because a 10 to 15 second window of warning isn't always enough to get safely to the side of the road, and I'm not taking the chance of hurting someone else by crashing during an episode, which leaves walking as my only means of getting around by myself. The problem with that is I also have autoimmune disease, which means (aside from my joints hurting) I can't be in direct sunlight for more than a few minutes without breaking out in sores, so I can only go out in the evening and at night. This is potentially very dangerous to do, because disabled people (women in particular) are much more likely to be assaulted. They see the cane and they know you're easy pickings. And if you factor in the chance of having an episode and ending up convulsing on the ground for 5 minutes, any jerk could come up and steal my cell phone or wallet or violate me in some way. So, I trained my dog as a service animal, and now I feel SO much safer walking, which helps me maintain as much independence as possible, and getting more exercise is also good for my health. And I did research into the subject, and service animals don't actually have to be officially registered or anything. If you're going to buy one that is already trained you definitely want to make certain the trainer's credentials are in order, but if you are disabled and you train a dog to assist you, that dog is automatically a service dog and is allowed to accompany you into any buildings or places that any other service animal is legally allowed to go (which I believe is pretty much anywhere, though perhaps not hospitals due to hygiene concerns, I'm not 100% on that).

Another thing that's great about it is that I rescued the dog a year before I became disabled, from a shelter the day before they were going to put him down (and the staff was so happy to see him go they cut the adoption fee in half). So I saved him, and now he's saving me. :) I don't know if your living situation would allow for a dog, but it's an idea that has helped me a lot, so I just wanted to suggest it.

You stated above that you cannot see a physical therapist because they're far from your house.  As an alternative, I'd like to encourage you to start practicing yoga.  Practicing yoga will provide many of the same benefits as physical therapy (correcting your posture, improving muscle strength and flexibility), and it will help you manage your stress.

If you can afford it, I'd encourage you to join an actual class (i find that making the commitment to join a class helps keep me accountable and motivated), but if that's not possible just get a mat and rent some yoga DVDs from your local library.

434,"Based on the limited information about your work history there is a chance that you won't have enough work credits to qualify to SSDI. When you are under the age of 31 the formula is a bit different and you don't need the full 20 quarters of work. For you it will be that you would have needed to work for half of the time since you turned 21 (so for you it would be about 14 quarters). 

Although you won't qualify for SSDI on your own record, if you have a parent that is deceased, disabled, or retired you can get about 75% of what their benefit was. The downside to this is that disability has to be established prior to age 22 (and continuing). The farther out you are from age 22 the harder that becomes. There is also SSI, but you'd be subject to the asset restrictions which are $2000 right now. 

Non-medical qualifications aside, it does sound like you have a good amount of treatment history going on. Do you have a current therapist/psychologist? Or are you just being managed by your PCP while you wait for the outpatient program? For all disability claims, but mental ones in particular, the more records available the better. Your inpatient stay combined with several outpatient programs does lend much more credibility to your assertion that you won't be able to work since those types of treatment are seen only in the most severe cases. 

At this point the thing to do is just apply and see what happens. Most people try to wait to apply until they have all their medical ""ducks in a row"" but the problem is that you won't even get to the medical portion of the claim until you pass the non-medical portion to see if you even qualify based on work/assets.

1. If there are diagnosed substance abuse issues, determine if the individual is disabled when considering all issues - including the substance abuse.

2. If the individual is not disabled, no further evaluation needed.

3. If the individual is found disabled, determine if there are periods of sobriety that allow evaluation of the individual's functioning in the absence of substance abuse.

4. If they are not disabled during the periods of sobriety, then substance abuse is material and the individual is denied. 

5. If the person remains disabled even during periods of sobriety, they are awarded benefits. 

The policy is also setup so that if it's not clear whether substance abuse is material, Social Security is supposed to resolve that issue in the applicant's favor and award benefits.

I'll also call my provider tomorrow and ask where the nearest mental health facility is and see if it's walk-able.

With my feet the pain happens when I stand, walk, run, and push a lawn mower. When I'm lying down it doesn't hurt. The pain is mainly in my heels, with pain sometimes on the bottom of my arch. I wear insuls from the chiropractor for plantar fascilitis, but I'm not sure I even have that. My ankles are starting to hurt more since I've had to power through my heel pain more regularly. Is there a heel/foot doctor i can go to? I think podiatrist are the name, but I also vaguely recall them being only cosmetics of the foot.

456,"Everyone who is eligible for SSDI has an ""insured period"". After you've worked enough you become insured, called the date first insured. A person stays insured for as long as they are working. However, once you stop working, the clock starts ticking on that insured status. Eventually it will lapse. Generally speaking, you will remain insured for 5 years after you stop working (unless you received special insured status prior to age 31, then it's less). 

Once that insured status lapses, you can still file for SSDI but they now have to find you disabled PRIOR to when your insured status lapses (called the Date Last Insured or DLI). SSDI works like any other type of insurance. Once you stop paying the premiums you become ineligible for coverage. 

So in your case your DLI was 12/31/2009 and the medical records at that time didn't establish a finding of disability because your medical records were lacking. In these cases they don't look at anything beyond your DLI. So anything over the last 6ish years wasn't considered. Normally in disability claims if there isn't enough evidence we can order exams/tests but since you're not insured they just denied your claim for insufficient evidence.

One is a hoist that does all the heavy lifting. All you have to do is attach the wheelchair and guide it in the direction you want it. There are many types and manufacturers of hoists, we have one version that will allow you to pick up a powered wheelchair from the side of a vehicle and stow it in the trunk. 

Another solution could be a platform lift for the wheelchair only. Basically you just move the wheelchair onto the platform. Strap it down and then at the press of a button it loads the wheelchair into the trunk.

473,"No, disability is based on your inability to work as an adult.   The exact excerpt from SSA's Website

""WHAT DOES “DISABLED” MEAN FOR AN ADULT?

If you are age 18 or older we may consider you “disabled” if you have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment (including an emotional or learning problem) which:

    -results in the inability to do any substantial gainful activity; and

    -can be expected to result in death; or

    -has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

SSA is committed to providing benefits quickly to applicants whose medical conditions are so serious that their conditions clearly meet disability standards""

Applying as an adult almost always means a denial and an appeal to prove the above conditions.   Very few people get approved immediately even children are being subjected to closer scrutiny.   

My son is one of the few children I know who was approved almost immediately pending medical record reviews which we had in hand for our first in person interview.   He is multiply disabled, vision impaired, technology dependent, can't walk or talk, IQ below 60, can't control his bowels and bladder. All other children I have heard about that got almost immediate approval were either at his level or worse off functionally.

Most people don't deal with emotions like embarrassment or sadness well; they end up manifesting as anger because then it allows us to direct these feelings onto *another* person. 

I would suggest that she needs individual therapy and you guys need couples therapy. Clearly this has been an issue in your relationship but it is also affecting your son.  **You alone cannot fix her; your job is to be a source of encouragement and support.**

You need to have a very frank conversation with her. Struggling with things, whether they be physical problems, mental problems, learning disabilities, etc is a normal part of life. But a person has to take responsibility for doing what they can to work on those issues, especially for situations like your wife's.

 You can provide all the love and support in the world but if she is not interested or wiling to work on herself then that is on her. You say that she would not be able to function independently, but to me it sounds like she can't because she has never had to. 

I you lay all these things out with her (hence the couples counseling) and explain that it is affecting your health, your relationship, and your son and she still refuses help then in my mind you don't need to stay. It is not healthy (nor does it set a good example for your son) to stay in the relationship because you are scared about how she will support herself.  You cannot continuously set yourself on fire to keep her warm.

492,"""Red flags""?  I truly am perplexed as to what I may have said so poorly that's caused your radar to ping.  Do you mean that some portion of what I've written and posted previously seems unbelievable?  Or is it just that you have doubts as to whether my condition is serious enough to qualify for any benefits.  Perhaps you'll tell me at some point in the future.  For now, though, let me try and cut to the chase as to the myriad reasons for my reluctance:

1.  I'm almost 60.  It's my understanding from another source (a disability attorney, but not one who's local that I can retain) that I almost certainly face having to file several appeals before benefits are likely to be granted, that that's just the way the system works these days, and that it will take a few years to complete the process.   That being the case, it sounds like I'll be qualified for regular Social Security and Medicare before I'll even see any disability benefits.  So if this is true, would it even be worth it to pursue a claim?

2.  As a person who has to deal with the consequences of having been bed-ridden for so many years, any requirement that I must go ANYwhere causes me to feel overwhelming dread of the physical agony I know I'll experience.  So yes, I'm far from enthusiastic about the prospect.  But not only is there the agony of the back pain to deal with, there's also the consequences of severe muscle atrophy I developed that leaves me literally gasping to breathe if I'm on my feet for more than four minutes or so.  (Just having to be up in order to go to the restroom a couple of times a day is an activity I'd love to be able to avoid, but I know I need the exercise so I force myself to deal with it, despite spending every second I'm up in a rush to be finished so I can go lay down again.)  And not only am I gasping for air, every cell in my body seems to be screaming for relief.  It's a miserable experience that I already have to endure every month in order to make the mandatory trek to the pain clinic.  I opt out of EVERY other activity that I might otherwise be interested in engaging in in order to avoid this torture.  Further, I also have to expect that I'll eventually be required to attend an independent medical exam which, in addition to the physical challenge, will likely be expensive, even if s/he is willing to review my existing x-rays and MRI films and reports without requiring new sets of each, none of which I can afford inasmuch as I have no income.  Moreover, I cannot transport myself and thus have to beg an unenthusiastic relative for a ride, then have her wait for me, then have the trip topped off by having to endure a guilt-trip speech for much of the return trip.  (sigh)

3.  Long story short, I KNOW beyond any doubt that any law firm I retain will hose me on the costs (in addition to the agreed percentage of any recovery it will be entitled to collect as attorney fees).  If I only qualify for some minimal amount of an award, these costs will likely eat up most of the balance of whatever retroactive amount I may come to be entitled to recover.

So my question is, given my age and the hurdles and difficulties I've outlined (plus others I haven't gone into), is it really even worth it to try and pursue a claim?  I've been working with my my pain physician the past few visits to get his records into compliance with Social Security's disability evaluation ""blue book"" [guidelines](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/) in order to strengthen my case as much as possible, but I admit I sense little reason to feel encouraged given how utterly lousy my overall luck generally tends to be.  Yeah, I guess I sound pretty pathetic; it's from a lifetime of experience of things hardly ever working out.

One of the best things to do is visit the website for yourself, visit an office, or call. The hotline is very busy and hard to get through so going to your local SS office and the web are your best bets.

Each person on SSD and SSDI get a review at one time or another. The Social Security Dept. evaluates if you are still medically disabled.

I haven't had to report every change in my wages, or employment and unemployment. However in a safe place keep your pay stubs. If pay information is on a website, print it out once a month or so.

https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/returning-to-work.htm
This page answers the these questions:
What are your responsibilities when you return to work?
When will review your disability?
When will your benefits stop?

I'm not exactly sure how much you can earn per month before you no longer get benefits. My career counselor has said $800 or $900 I don't recall. Hours per week is also something SSD reviews. Work needs to be, on average, part time (up to 25 hrs a week) otherwise it can be reviewed as able to work.

Check out your local Vocational Rehabilitation office. They can help when you are between jobs, on site or of site job coaching. They also know most of the SSD benefits info or can find it.

You aren't alone. Find other people who can help with your payments and your mental health. I've been hospitalized 4 times for suicidal thoughts.

I have PTSD and I've been through this process and at first it seems alarming. There is so much information and forms that I became depressed and manic (trying to get it all done as fast as I could while cleaning house, starting new projects etc.)

One of the best things to do is visit the website for yourself, visit an office, or call. The hotline is very busy and hard to get through so going to your local SS office and the web are your best bets.

Each person on SSD and SSDI get a review at one time or another. The Social Security Dept. evaluates if you are still medically disabled.

I haven't had to report every change in my wages, or employment and unemployment. However in a safe place keep your pay stubs. If pay information is on a website, print it out once a month or so.

This page answers the these questions:
What are your responsibilities when you return to work?
When will review your disability?
When will your benefits stop?

I'm not exactly sure how much you can earn per month before you no longer get benefits. My career counselor has said $800 or $900 I don't recall. Hours per week is also something SSD reviews. Work needs to be, on average, part time (up to 25 hrs a week) otherwise it can be reviewed as able to work.

Check out your local Vocational Rehabilitation office. They can help when you are between jobs, on site or of site job coaching. They also know most of the SSD benefits info or can find it.

You aren't alone. Find other people who can help with your payments and your mental health. I've been hospitalized 4 times for suicidal thoughts.

523,"So from what I've been able to research, a schedule A job has a specific definition stating: 

*""The Schedule A regulations specify that a person must have an intellectual disability, a severe physical disability or a psychiatric disability to be eligible to be hired through Schedule A. The regulations do not specifically include or exclude particular disabilities under those three categories of disabilities. Remember, to determine eligibility, you must submit proof of disability documentation from (1) your doctor (2) medical professional (3) rehabilitation professional.""*

The government is not in the business of defining what specific medical conditions are or are not disabling; it depends on how it affects you. It looks like the standards used by the ADA are different standards than used for a Schedule A hire, specifically in calling out a ""severe"" physical disability (not sure which kind you identify with). In addition to the disability, you provide proof of certification of job readiness (if not hired on a temporary appointment in lieu of the job readiness certification) and meet all required qualifications for the position.

The Executive Orders authorizing these appointments are limited to people with mental retardation, severe physical disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities. Executive Order 12125 dated March 15, 1979, and Executive Order 13124 dated June 4, 1999, permit individuals with mental retardation, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities to obtain competitive status after two years of satisfactory service in an excepted service position. These Executive Orders were established to assist these individuals with disabilities and to build a Federal workforce that draws from the strength of America's diversity. Different Federal programs use different operational definitions of disability, as do researchers, advocacy groups, and other interested parties. Variations occur because many groups define disability for different purposes. 

It looks like it is allowed for the physician to use discretion in determining if you fit the specific criteria for a Schedule A hire. If he disagrees, you can always seek a second opinion.

532,"While I don't have that exact issue I did notice huge changes in my way of thinking and other behavioral issues after becoming disabled. For me becoming physically disabled made my depression and anxiety worse (although a lot of that may be due to the stress of having no money) and has made me more anti-social than I was before. I feel like becoming disabled intensified some emotional issues I already had and made them much more noticeable. Becoming disabled suddenly is a type of trauma and everyone responds to trauma in different ways. 

I also can't afford therapy but over the years have tried to do some behavioral therapy on myself with at least some degree of success. Like you said since you notice your starting to hoard things that serve no purpose you can try reasoning with yourself about it. For example ""I know there's no point in me keeping a broken mirror, it's just taking up space, doesn't look very nice, and if I get rid of it I will have more room for things that are useful or have some sentimental value.""

But like you said cleaning when you have chronic pain can just be too much.

In your case, you want to participate in society, yet you claim inability to do so because of well documented conditions. Or: you want to be included, but you claim that inclusion is not possible or difficult at best?

550,"It's slightly less about what's wrong with you and more about how it impacts your ability to perform life functions and hold a job. I don't know much about the process but I do know that you should apply immediately because over 70% are denied first round, yours likely will be,  but then you can appeal. Payments if given are backdated to the first application date so making that as early as possible is crucial. Also you need to maintain any doctor appointments and continue to seek out and perform any treatment they give you,  PT or otherwise. A long treatment history with no beneficial physical outcome is a component here. From the wait times I've read your initial application is heard in something like 3-6 months and then appeals can take even 1-2 years to be heard.

553,"I could see where the inconvenience might annoy you and leave you feeling less than charitable or sociable.

A less passive-aggressive way of dealing with it might have been to put the car in park and, assuming you have a cell phone, call your roommates and ask them to have someone come move the car so as to not disturb all of your neighbors.

One way to prevent it in the future, if you can walk a few meters without too much trouble by holding on to the car, might be to put a big orange parking cone in the center of your side of the parking area on the nights they have groups over. When you get home, pull up to the cone, get out and move it to the side, then finish pulling in.

Secondly, there is nothing wrong with getting on Disability, if you need to.  It's there for a reason, and based on what you've said, you might be eligible.  Be warned that it's a lengthy process and can be frustrating as hell, but it can be an option.

But there are other options if you don't want to pursue that route.  There are often agencies that help people with mental illness to locate jobs.  Do you have a counselor and/or a psychiatrist?  If so, ask them about case management to get help locating a job that can accommodate your needs.  If not, most cities/counties have a central mental health agency that can help.

566,"&gt; So he shouldn't need to KEEP going now just to look good for whatever review board SSI uses, right?

If you want the strongest disability case he needs to be seen at least on a semi-regularly (even quarterly) basis by a mental health professional. 

All people (even those with ASD) change a lot from when they were kids to adults. While his condition is ""permanent"" the issues that are often comorbid with the disorder (depression, ADHD, anxiety, etc) can wax and wane over time. You need to have some ongoing documentation (from a professional) that discusses his functional limitations and struggles that he has. 

I have seen individuals get allowed benefits without having treating sources. But that is definitely the exception to the rule. I get that it is frustrating, but this is the best advice I can give you if your goal is getting him onto benefits. As a private citizen here anonymously, I believe you that your brother is disabled. But if I had his case sitting on my desk, I would probably deny him.
