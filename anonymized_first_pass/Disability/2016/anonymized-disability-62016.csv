You say that she has only been out of work for a month. Has she been getting treatment for the vertigo? Has any of it helped. Part of a disability determination is also that the condition has to last (or be expected to last) for at least 12 months.

69,"I've had some training because I was military. Rule number one is, *just give them your shit.* It's not worth it. Any amount of shit you can give them, that gets them away from you without a fight, is better than fighting. Period. **Do that.** Okay? Okay.

So with that understood, 99.999999% of all dangerous encounters should be resolved. *Almost nobody in the country will ever have to fight for their life.* Times are awesome like that. But what if you have to, though? Well..... You can google some techniques, you can get some advice, but here's the truth of things. In a life-or-death crisis you're not fighting with your brain, you're fighting on instinct. You can fill your head with all sorts of ideas and they're not gonna do you a single lick of good. Once in my life, I did something in a fight that I saw in a movie because my brain thought it would be a good idea. Guy was tossing around a scrawny friend of mine, and I wasn't having it, so I punched him in the neck like Jet Li does in movies sometimes. It was a good hit. It hurt the aggressor, I could tell. Then he proceeded to roundly kick my ass for about five minutes until somebody broke it up, and I couldn't tell you a single thing I did after that initial hit because that whole 'having ideas' thing just goes away when the adrenaline hits.

You don't need advice. If you're concerned for your safety, what you need is *actual training.* And you can probably get it. Somewhere near you there is a self-defense class that can take you through the motions and put this stuff into practice. They're not going to just give you ideas, they're going to give you instincts.

Rule number one is, *just give them your shit.* It's not worth it. Any amount of shit you can give them, that gets them away from you without a fight, is better than fighting.

So with that understood, 99.<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>% of all dangerous encounters should be resolved. *Almost nobody in the country will ever have to fight for their life.* Times are awesome like that. But what if you have to, though? Well..... You can google some techniques, you can get some advice, but here's the truth of things. In a life-or-death crisis you're not fighting with your brain, you're fighting on instinct. You can fill your head with all sorts of ideas and they're not gonna do you a single lick of good. Once in my life, I did something in a fight that I saw in a movie because my brain thought it would be a good idea. <PERSON> was tossing around a scrawny friend of mine, and I wasn't having it, so I punched him in the neck like <PERSON> does in movies sometimes. It was a good hit. It hurt the aggressor, I could tell. Then he proceeded to roundly kick my ass for about five minutes until somebody broke it up, and I couldn't tell you a single thing I did after that initial hit because that whole 'having ideas' thing just goes away when the adrenaline hits.

You don't need advice. If you're concerned for your safety, what you need is *actual training.* And you can probably get it. Somewhere near you there is a self-defense class that can take you through the motions and put this stuff into practice. They're not going to just give you ideas, they're going to give you instincts.

Another bum I've met (who's a vet if he's telling the truth) once got beat up as a gang initiation. I don't want to be here. 

Maybe because it's my headaches, but right now even considering being in front of a screen, sitting down, for 8 hours seems like it'll drive me insane.

I have the desire to do things I enjoy, even if I can't do them.

186,"I haven't had any long-term relationships come from online dating, I have had quite a bit of experience with online dating (though, after my most recent experience, I am done with it, at least for now).

Just a quick fyi, I am a female with cerebral palsy and a severe speech disability.

My first tip is just to be open with your disability. It will honestly weed out all the people who you don't want to date anyways. Sure you might get some creepy messages (I had one guy wanting me to take pics of myself in my wheelchair, and quite a few instant marriage proposals) but everyone has to deal with those. Plus, being open saves from bringing up the whole ""sooo, yeah, I'm disabled"" topic.

As for the ""talking to people online"", just do what comes naturally. If things just aren't clicking, end it. Be respectful if the other person is, block them if they are not. Don't give any social media accounts until you are sure this is a person you would at least consider a friend.

As for meeting in person, safety is extremely important. You shouldn't be fearful, since 99% of people are not axe murders, but shit happens. If you are meeting someone in person for the first time, make sure someone you trust knows, and arrange a time, approximately when you think the date will end for someone you trust to expect contact from you. Arrange to meet somewhere public, preferably somewhere where you have gone so you know it is accessible  (and if you can meet somewhere where someone you know works, that adds a level of safety). Have your own transportation there and back.

Lastly, remind them that they have no obligation to anyone. If things aren't working for them, end it. I recently went on a date and the guy clearly had a better time than I did (I, however, got more words in with the waitress than with him) and I had to make it clear to him that I just did not want to date him.",,,,Briannkin,Cerebral Palsy,,1465799972,t5_2qhe8,t3_4nmkyi,t3_4nmkyi,3,1469001917,0,0,d470u9m,disability,3,,,,

Your family history and ""potential"" for reinjury will not have any bearing on your claim.

My son is nonverbal and has an IQ below 60 but his receptive language is quite good.    I have seen him get ashamed before over things I did not think he would even understand fully.   If he had picked up on the insult, I would have dealt with her swiftly and directly then spent the next 10 minutes smoothing over his upset followed with a little pick me up gift/activity to put the nastiness behind him.   If he doesn't pick up on the insult then I would have let it mostly slide by slapping a false smile on my face and chirpily wishing her a happy day in bigot land.

As much as I would probably want to launch across the table and strangle her I would weight my response against my son's perception of the situation because at the end of the day he is my ultimate responsibility, not putting some stranger in her place.

Edit: As I'm thinking about your response, I truly wonder if it has to do with what program you work in. Paras hired though the school Corp who work with mild students most likely do not have access to students' documents, but paras hired through my co-op or paras hired by the school Corp to specifically work in the life skills program are the ones with access to that info. I was told by admin to keep an IEP/IHP binder on hand in the classroom for paras to access freely. Our kids have much higher needs in general, whether it be academically, behaviorally, or medically.

259,"I'd say the answer is a pretty solid yes.

The only arguments I've seen against that is that, of course, disability as a subculture is divided by the many sub-cultures within it, usually defined by the disability a person has, but sometimes also by core beliefs (such as whether 'person first' language matters or the concept of differently-abled vs disabled).

The same however can be said for any subculture. All subcultures can be broken down into component parts. Taking comic book fan subculture as an example, Marvel or DC^1 ? Within Marvel comic fans X-Men or Iron Man or Thor or etc? Within X-Men fans modern X-Men or classic X-Men? And so on and on and on.

With that said, I think your sociology professor/teacher is barking up the wrong tree. Subcultures aren't defined by how their norms and values are different to dominant cultures, but in what criteria that subculture has implicitly agreed on to define themselves by. Most subcultures don't vary from dominant culture in norms and values in any significant way, or even have an implicitly agreed upon set of norms or values that they share and simply define themselves by a shared interest or trait. It'd be just as blurry a thing to ask for for comic fan subculture as it is for disabled subculture.

That said, you don't get marks for being right, you get marks for giving the marker what they want. So ask yourself, what norms and values do the majority of people within disabled subculture hold?

An example I can think of for each:


Norms (how people with disabilities expect/want others to act):

1. Language. Most disabled people have stronger opinions than dominant culture about terminology for and about disabled people.

Values (what people with disabilities want from the world):

1. Accessibility. Obviously accessibility means very different things to different disabled people (ramps, elevators, public transport, audio guides, etc), but it's something that's usually considered important. Even for people who don't have personal accessibility concerns it's often viewed as a positive sign of society acknowledging the existence and rights of the disabled.


Anyway, that's my two cents. Hopefully you'll be able to think of more norms and values that you think apply and other people will chime in with their thoughts as well.

260,"tl;dr: this is a very harsh response, but you need to read it, and anyone who searches for this topic needs to read it. Don't be an idiot, hire an attorney.


Seriously? Get an attorney. Don't fuck around with this. Hit the phone book and find someone who can file for a continuance until they're ready to plead your case. 

40%-60% of people who make it to the hearing stage are denied there. The overwhelming majority of that percentage do not have a lawyer to fight for them. It's an almost guaranteed approval at the hearing stages of you have a lawyer. It's a crapshoot without.

It's harsh, but I don't understand why you let it get to this point. I went through it. I'm on disability. I know the process, and I know what it's like to be in so much pain and dislocate so easily that you can't work. Why would you gamble with your life and your ability to pay rent? 

If you insist on doing this (very stupid thing), answer every question like you're having your worst day. Be firm, and do not equivocate. Do not say ""maybe"" or ""sometimes."" If you can't do it on your worst day, you can't do it.  They will have a jobs expert who knows your skills looking at a list of jobs he thinks you should be able to do. You need to have reasons none of these will work. Some of his jobs will be imaginary work from home positions that don't really exist -- you need to explain why even if you were padded up in your bed with all your braces on you still can't work from home.

Overall, though, be ready for a rejection if you're doing it on your own. And it is not easy to come back from a rejection -- you have to show a change in circumstance, or that you've gotten markedly worse. The decision not to hire a lawyer for this could literally ruin your life. ",,,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1467229752,t5_2qhe8,t3_4qcxhw,t3_4qcxhw,4,1469381602,0,0,d4t0apv,disability,4,,,,

280,"You may apply for disability at any time. To be completely honest with you, however, with the types of allegations you are describing, plus your very young age, it is unlikely you will be allowed. SSA guidelines lead to a determination that you would be able to do a desk job, if nothing else. Of course, I have not read your file or medical records, so I am only going off what you are saying in your post.

The other thing is that you would only qualify for SSI. SSI does not pay much; you'd receive less than one thousand dollars a month. This is not a lot to live on for rent and grocery, internet, phone, etc. You would make more money at almost any job.

My advice would be to go to a psychologist for your depression and anxiety, because it could help you emotionally feel better. Also, try going somewhere for pain management for your pain. Try to find a desk job somewhere now that you are out of high school. As I said, you can always apply for SSI. It will just be hard to be approved due to your age.

Once he completely lost the use of his legs they discovered an arachnoid spinal cyst and immediately did surgery, but it has only been marginal in recovering his mobility.

But I also think you should give therapy another shot, just with a different person. Sometimes it takes a while to find a good therapist who isn't condescending or just plain awful. But you can definitely do it!

As for your question, yes you will need to enroll in a new health insurance policy if your disability isn't renewed. If you let your insurance lapse, it's a tax penalty and I believe it's based on your income (don't quote me on that).

Once your parents (well dad really since mom never worked?) retire, die, or become disabled you'll be able to earn SSDI based on his earnings record at a 75% rate (if you're the only child claiming on it). These benefits, known as CDB or DAC, require that the disability be established prior to the age of 22 which it sounds like yours is. 

If you do become eligible for CDB benefits you can draw on both SSI and SSDI but you're SSI portion will likely decrease depending on how much the SSDI portion will be.

Yes, this is spot on. Sometimes people will see me struggling up a hill, and offer to give me a push.

I spent most of the day calling law firms. Each turned me away saying they only deal with rejected SSDI applications. I contacted the state bar for a recommendation to a law firm, but they haven't gotten back to me yet.

&gt; Is MMJ legal where you are now?

It is at the state level. It's still federally illegal and since SS is a federal program that concerns me.

&gt;  If so, who is prescribing it? 

A doctor who's sole purpose is to be a MMJ card factory. She sees him once per year as required to keep the card up to date. We're afraid to give this doctor's info to SS due to it showing federally illegal drug use. More over, given how brief the conversations with the doctor were, I'm sure the medical records have little more than ""Patient has depression, prescribed MMJ.""

330,"&gt; My previous therapist gently told me that she thought my father needed to take care of me, being that he is the reason I have PTSD 

This has *got* to be the worst advice I've ever heard. I've never been a victim of violence in the way that you have, but I think that the absolutely last thing I would want to do is have a constant reminder of it. Its almost like your therapist wants you to ""stick around"" to punish your father but really it is hurting you. 

I think that you are having a hard time ""moving on"" and being independent because you are perpetually stuck in pre-teen mode. You are not independent because you were never forced to be. I think this therapist has put you in permanent ""victim"" mode. At some point in your life (and it might as well be now) you are going to have to become independent. Better to do it now in your 30s rather than in your 60s when your dad dies and you're left with no support. 

Are you currently in treatment? Do you have a case manager? The first thing you need to do is slowly work towards being independent. First step is money. Either apply for government support (SSI and/or state assistance) or get yourself a job. If you decide to go the job route look into your states voc rehab services to help with job training and employment support. But, rambleramble, I can hear you say, I'll never be able to work. Well, you won't know until you try, even if it is just a part-time job while your dad still supports you. And don't tell him you are working in case he decides to then fully cut you off. Get a separate bank account and stash the money in there. You already have an apartment and live alone, so really you're only issue is just figuring out how to financially support yourself. 

They way I see it you are at a vital impasse in your life. The longer you allow yourself to convince yourself that you are a perpetual victim the harder it will be to move past that. its tough love, but it is what you need to hear. There are [unfortunately] millions of survivors of childhood sexual abuse who are able to have functional lives. But you are going to have to really work towards it.

Its not necessarily an ""agree or disagree"" decision but did the judge do something that makes sense. After that you can appeal to the Federal Court but, be warned, this takes years.

If you do decide to appeal the ALJ decision please look into getting a lawyer. At this stage in your claim the legal portion becomes the most important thing and, even someone who knows SSA like myself wouldn't be able to do it on my own. But please know that a lot of lawyers won't take a claim appealing past the ALJ level. Appealing to the federal court takes years and is a LOT of paperwork but still the most they will get is $6K so it doesn't make financial sense for them.

I don't have anything showing the missing arm in my pictures or talk about it in my profile but I mention I have a lot of scars. If the conversation is going well than I can segue into talking about my disability, but I don't use it as an opener.

358,"I am not agreeing that it is fair but the government has some good reasoning. One of the biggest fraud problems with medicaid/SSI is with people mis-representing their living situations  in order to improperly receive benefits. People will say that they are divorced when they really aren't, they will say that they are separated and not living with their spouse when they really are, etc. 

The theory is that living together as a couple implies a higher level of ongoing support that is not found with non-partners. If I live with a roommate and don't have a way to pay rent *most likely* that roommate is going to kick me out for not paying my share. However, if I have a partner and I have no income they are not likely to kick me out due to our relationship status. Roommates implies that everyone pays their fair share whereas partners implies support. Drastic example: one partner is disabled with no income but lives with their partner who makes $150K per year. Should that individual be allowed to draw on benefits that are only supposed to be for those with less than a few thousand dollars in assets? Clearly, as a partnership household, that disabled individual could be supported. 

Personally, while I think there is some level of unfairness, it is something that the government needs to do. All of these programs are  under intense scrutiny by the political right and their funding levels are dangerously low. Sure, you could just say that your boyfriend is just a roommate and likely keep your services. I will never advocate for lying to the government about things like this (if caught you'll be in for a whole world of hurt) but it is something that a lot of people do.

From a practical standpoint, there are pros and cons to self-identifying as a person with a disability when you are looking for a job. From my experience, unless they specifically state that they are looking to hire people with a disability I wouldn't bring it up. In my experience it is more likely to hurt your application.

At this stage, you shouldn't be looking for resources to show her, unless she has mentioned she needs them. The fact you're looking for them shows you care though. So, the advice I will give you is to tell her you would like to learn the sort of impact her condition has on her day to day life, and what are things other people do (or could do) that are helpful, and what sorts of things make her fee worse.     
         
For example, with my condition, a good thing to know is I need my feet propped up, and places where there is nowhere to sit are miserable for me. Something people do that is helpful is offer their seat to me when they see I don't have one. My husband often casually pulls my legs onto his lap.        
         
Something people do that they think is helpful, but isn't, is ask me every 15 minutes if I am okay and list off all the ways they could help me. I don't get annoyed because obviously these people REALLY want me to be comfortable and it is is heartwarming how much they care, however it makes me feel weird after awhile and isn't helpful.

417,"you can work while you are waiting for a decision but you must inform SSA (or the DDS examiner) that you are working. First, they will look at whether you are earning too much money (over SGA) and, if that is the case, they will deny your claim. 

Even if you are not earning too much money, you working will be included as evidence of your daily functioning.

 Now, what u/asknanners12 said is not entirely accurate (but generally true). It is true that you are more likely to be denied if you are working; that is not always the case. It will boil down to how much you are working, what type of work you are doing, and what your alleged disabling conditions are. For example, if you claim you are disabled due to a bad back and you are working 15 hrs a week doing construction - that lessens the credibility of your allegations since, if your condition was truly disabling, you wouldn't be able to do construction work even part-time. And if you can manage 15 hours a week doing heavy labor then, in SSA's eyes, you should be able to do 40 hours per week of non-labor/light duty work.  

How much you are working will also come into play. If you are working just 3-4 hours per week SSA won't pay too much attention to that. But if you are working just under that SGA ($1130) amount then you'll likely be denied because the evidence is strong that you could work more. Its actually a common ""scheme"" that we see where people will ask to have their earnings/hours to be *just* under the SGA limit so that they can file for disability and get ""free"" money. 

If you do decide to work though, just make sure you tell SSA about it. SSA doesn't automatically get ""alerts"" or anything when people start working. We have access to all your earnings data but, unless we know to go in and look, we won't know. All the letters from SSA will have language about how its your responsibility to report any change in your situation (work activity, medical, living, etc) and willfully not reporting information that could be adverse to your claim can be considered fraudulent action. trust me, you don't want that.

419,"Inpatient treatment has been strongly suggested to me a number of times, but I last had insurance in around 2009/10. So it's never really been an option. Since I've never confessed to being actively suicidal, I've never been forced into a facility such as this. And I don't even know that it would have any impact at this stage or not. At some point it's just a waiting game, unfortunately.

I did gather that my situation is somewhat to be expected, as far as it taking forever. I do find myself having suicidal thoughts quite often in the last few months, since my relapse. I have told my therapist. But I don't have a plan and I'm not even sure I could summon the energy to carry out a plan if I had one. Someone else replied saying I shouldn't fake something like this, and I know that. I'm not planning anything of the sort. But it is complex.

Anyway, my suicidal thoughts are more the annoyingly persistent intrusive hey-pick-up-that-screwdriver-and-use-it-to-slit-your-wrists thoughts than a situation where I'm like, okay, I'm gonna do x, y, and z with this particular and immediate goal in mind. I've told my therapist this.

Anyway, sorry, I'm verbose. I hope this made sense. When I'm speaking, I lose the thread of the conversation very often and have to take a minute to get back on track. I'm talking, mid sentence, I'll go, wait, what was I saying? So I'm not sure how clear I'm being.

425,"SSI and SSDI have the same medical requirements. I'm a little confused by your post, but do you currently have a pending SSDI claim? Or was that one already denied. If you didn't have enough work credits it would have been denied fairly quickly. 

Usually when you file for disability they will do applications for both SSDI and SSI. The first step is the field office where they take all your information. They first look at whether you have enough work credits to qualify for SSDI and then they look at your assets to see if you qualify for SSI. At that point if you qualify for one/both programs they will send your claim to the DDS for a medical decision. If you qualify for neither then your claim is denied. 

If you still have a pending SSDI claim (anywhere in the process) you need to contact your field office to find out if they did a SSI application for you, and, if they didn't, tell them you'd like to add an SSI claim to your SSDI claim. If you have a pending SSDI claim they can just tack on that SSI claim to it to make it what is called a concurrent claim.

However, for at least the last 4 years, the financial permission question is also listed on the paper application ([page 13, top of the page](https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/Attachment%20for%20SSA%20Testimony%207_25_12%20Human%20Resources%20Sub%20Hearing.pdf))

If your approval took place more than 4 months after the application was taken, there is then another interview (which yes, can also conceivably be done on paper) to update all of the information, to determine what months during the period between the application and the allowance you are actually eligible for payment, and how much.

440,"I understand this. I also understand that it's not the answer you were hoping to hear. I would do everything in your power to find an attorney who will have the hearing delayed, even if you wind up calling one of those shady TV lawyers. I would simultaneously be on the line with the courts trying to get it delayed on your own. 

Depending on your state, the probability of being approved at your hearing is around 35% for those without a representation, but you're 50%-75% MORE likely to be approved with an attorney present. If you are denied at the hearing, your recourse is a court appeal. These essentially never overturn the verdict because they can only overturn the judge's decision if he made a legal error; it's a procedural appeal, not a claim appeal. So if you are denied, you have to start over from the beginning. The only problem is that they already have a file on you, showing that your complaint, listing all of the symptoms that you're still describing to them now, has already been denied. So the only way to get it to move forward on your second attempt is if you have proof that a doctor has diagnosed you &amp; is treating you for a NEW qualifying disorder following your hearing. This is pretty unlikely, so for most people who are denied at the hearing, that's the end of the line. This is why not doing absolutely everything possible during the first go-round is like playing Russian Roulette -- only you have bullets in 4 of the 6 chambers.

Your original post sounded to me like you hoped for a quick/easy solution. I understand that you were in a bad situation, but if you're truly bad enough that you can't work (and it sounds like you are) then proceeding with this hearing on Friday unaided has the potential to leave you in that same situation for the rest of your life. I know that's a scary thing to hear. There's nothing you can do now about having not kept up with your lawyer, but -- coming from someone who is currently on disability and who has watched friends struggle after being denied at their hearing who were never able to receive disability after that) -- I would be in that lawyer's office on my hands and knees, begging and crying, come 8 am. 

I really hope that you're able to get it worked out. It's a difficult thing to keep up with, especially given the situation you were/are in, but may very well be the one thing that has the most substantial impact on the rest of you life.

458,"&gt; Your best bet is to find a new doctor and don't tell him about this doctor or give permission to talk

Yes exactly (although I'm not sure how you would go about the latter). 

I recently moved house and as a result, doctors. I went to fill my prescription and lo and behold, I have to collect it weekly. Why? Because I recently asked to be referred back to psychiatry to deal with an ongoing mental health issue. It rears its head and gets ugly every now and again, and psych helps me keep it in check. It does not in any way involve suicide or self harm. The last time I was suicidal was eight years ago when I got hit and paralysed, and I'll give you a medal if you can find a new quad/para who hasn't thought about death at some point. 

My old doc recognised that I am a responsible adult who knows how to deal with my problems and when to ask for help. The new one is apparently an arsehole so I'm on fucking suicide rules until they get a goddamn grip. I have to take time off work every week to pick up my damn prescription as they're only open the hours I'm working. All that's doing is making me stressed as fuck and regretting asking for help in the first place. 

And what's really stupid is that even a week's worth of meds is plenty enough to kill me if I was suicidal. But if I pointed that out to them they'd no doubt have me coming in daily then.

485,"Crikey that's a good question. Top tip is to include your disability openly in your profile. At some point you will need to mention it anyway and it's easier if it's been said before you even start talking. People feel awkward about what they don't have experience with and teenagers even more so. It doesn't need to be anything epic or go into specifics, just a mention. It's also good to have a pic of you where you can see the chair or other aid in your profile, not all close up shots. 

I like to use humour, mine was  

&gt;Hi! My name's wheelywusty, and I use a badass wheelchair due to a genetic disorder. I'm a great date because not only will we get the best parking spaces, I will also roll us down the hill like a couple of lunatics after a few bevvies. Sitting down all day also means lots of energy saved for activities ;)

Basically saying I use a chair, I'm not awkward about it, and yes I can still have sex! Lots of people assume if you're in a chair sex is off the cards, so I sneakily slip it in. (heh) Another favourite is 'and yes, it all still works!'

Once I have started chatting to someone and I know they're actually interested, I'll say they're welcome to ask questions about said disability. This is going to vary a lot from person to person, some will prefer to wait until meeting in person, some will do it after a couple of convos, others will want to know each other better. Also depends on how long you chat online before meeting up. Other wheelie friends have said that the more aware the date is of the realities of their disability, the better the date goes. For example my hands are crap and I need difficult foods pre-cut. Don't mention it in advance, I'd ask the waiter to bring it pre-cut from the kitchen. Mention it in advance, get some flirting in, get date to promise to feed you romantically off their fork.

Warn them about the differing attitudes towards dating someone with a disability. Some people see disabilities as a fetish. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. The date however must be upfront and honest about it, both parties must understand and consent to that dynamic in the relationship and the date realises that you are a person *before your disability*. Often these people are neither honest or seeing you as a person. Look out for a lot of questions about your disability, including many about the origin of it and over-interest in how you manage mundane daily tasks. 

Along the same lines, some people want to be the hero who will do everything for you and magically make it all better. Sometimes tempting from this side of the fence, to have someone to swoop along and be the white knight (or knightess?). It's just waiting to crash and burn, no-one should enter a relationship trying to fix rescue someone else.

Some people will be assholes. Block and report them. Don't engage with someone taking potshots at your disability, it's never worth it. 

If their date suggests a place to meet, before dying of excitement remember to check it's accessible, including a bathroom. **Phone the venue,** as several times now I've gone to a nice pub for a relaxed dinner and the loo is used as storage. If it's not accessible, be proactive and suggest somewhere else. If it's an activity, same thing. If you have dietary requirements, remember and check. Your date doesn't know your options as well as you do, so don't be afraid to put your ideas forward.

Also think on the extra safety risks, in a chair you must still be able to bail if something goes wrong. Have the number of a couple of accessible taxi firms for the area you're going to, not just around home, and make sure your mobile is charged. If your chair is electric, remember and charge that well too! Have enough cash for your fare, I personally like to have an extra fare hidden in the pocket under my chair just in case.

""I do my best when traveling to arrive at a hotel/motel before the evening rush or dark. If the hotel/motel is not accessible it gives me time to find another place. When renting a car with hand controls I always make reservations with two rent a car companies. The odds of the car being present is 50% I call from terminal and go to the company that actually has the car... High beds are the rage in hotels. I never make a reservation at a good hotel without asking about this... My favorite access fails typically involve a swimming pool at ski resorts. Many resorts have heated out door pools. A ton of fun to swim in hot pool after being in cold all day. I have been to resorts that had wheelchair lift to get into the pool. Great.

497,"The SSI system can be unfair in situations like yours but it is always important to remember that SSI is a *needs based* program unlike SSDI which is a program that an individual paid into with their FICA taxes.  If you are working then the theory is that you are less ""needy"" than if you were not working.  To have that kind of decrease in your check you were probably earning maybe just under $1000/mo? It may not seem like it, but to SSA that is significant amount of earnings. Most people think of work as a full-time thing but to SSA you only need to earn $1130/mo to be completely ineligible for the program. 

Are you sure that you aren't already receiving some type of SSDI? You said that your monthly benefit amount is $810 but the current SSI max is around $730. Even though you haven't worked if one/both of your parents is deceased, disabled, or retired you can get SSDI based on their SSN rather than your own. 

It sounds like and your mom are in a tough financial spot. You  mention that your mom has never worked; is there any reason for this (other than caring for you)? I think that the best solution to your guys' problems would be for her to find a way to bring in an income.

The first question SSA will ask is, has your condition lasted or is it expected to last at least a year. Sounds like you meet that requirement. Question two is, what is your disability and when did it start to limit your ability to find and hold a job. SSA is only interested in your medical history from the last two years. So you already have most of that information. One last step before you contact SSA, is to sign up with your state's Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Services. This free program helps folks with disabling conditions find ways to work despite their limits. The reason you need to sign up for this program is they will examine your skills and test your ability to find and keep a job. Because of your age and lack of work history this information will be essential to prove you have a disability. The test results will be your best proof that your disability is real! If you feel you need help to accomplish the above; seek out your states Independent Living Centers web: www.ncil.org Most states fund ILCs to assist folks understand, apply for and maximize benefits and social supports. The service is free.

Working once a week with a CDI can help students a faculty learn signs the student is familiar with and bridge the communication gap.

As usual, communication is key, but communicating about communication can be tricky to begin with. I agree with /u/genivae that the likely best path is to grant your girl the same kind of honesty you're sharing with us: allow her to see your vulnerability by admitting you can't solve this yourself, &amp; strength of character in inviting critique. I've been on the receiving end of this kind of ""how can I talk to you about X"" approach, &amp; it is beautiful. It says ""I care more about our relationship than I do about my anxiety &amp; fear of looking bad"". I've also been on the approaching end, &amp; while scary at first, it gets easier as you better learn how to speak each other's language.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I'm afraid that I'll cause her more stress by making her think that her disability is affecting both of us

This is a really valid concern, &amp; kudos for exercising the maturity &amp; empathy required to see it. I am a C5/6 Complete Quad, &amp; my disability has a profound effect on our relationship. I'm acutely aware of this every hour of every day. Every single compromise we make, every assistance I require, every plan we set is moderated by my disability. As such (assuming relevant similarities in our situations) there are 2 sides to the issue:

1. You are not telling her anything she doesn't already intimately understand. I promise you that if she is half as self-aware as you seem to be, she knows that her disability affects you, even the times you haven't seen it yourself. She may be scared that by bringing it up, naming the issue, she may catalyse conflict or cause you to resent her needs. She may be hoping to endure until circumstance improves, thereby sidestepping potential negativity. I've been there - it's a fairly natural tactic &amp; it *can* be useful if the issue is trivial: ""I don't like these dining room chairs, but I'll soon forget they even exist"". With an issue like disability, it can rot away confidence &amp; harmony. She may be ecstatic you speak first, as it's implicit ""permission"" for her to speak openly too.

2. Mindful of the toll it probably already takes on her mental &amp; emotional state, it is prudent to have a solution-focussed mindset going in. If the message is distilled to be ""your disability drains me/us"", it's understandable that she may come to see the topic as even more taboo (n.b: that's not to say this kind of conversation can't be had, there is certainly a place for venting, but in your context, /u/Katholikos, you need to establish robust communication channels first). Show her that the reason you need to talk about it is that you want to add tools to your toolkit or action some positive strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

Perhaps a personal example paints a better picture:

Within the context of my disability, I'm usually extremely active. I (as an ongoing or intermittent activity) drive, travel, work full time, start too many side projects, go to concerts, festivals, plays, movies, language classes, date nights/weekends, go on road trips, eat out (more than I should), &amp; otherwise socialise with family &amp; friends. This is who I am, &amp; what our relationship formed with. In the past year, however, a few health complications have rendered me pretty useless in contrast to normal life. The timing is terrible (between us: moving interstate, job promotion, job resignation, job seeking in new state, major surgery for father, niece with very rare syndrome undergoing record-breaking surgery, hospitalisation for anaphylaxis, tight financial situation, transition to new health providers (NDIS), etc), &amp; through no fault of either of us the load on my girl has increased dramatically. We have had many conversations about our circumstance &amp; the challenges in that scope. Our best discussions have usually included some key similarities:

* The issue has been identified explicitly &amp; clearly. Sometimes this takes time, especially when a root cause is easily lost in the noise of exhaustion, anxiety, ego, etc. Sometimes it takes a day or two of introspection to differentiate signal from noise. By being so specific we are able to keep our conversation focussed on the solution (e.g: ""I feel that [subject], while certainly something we should discuss, is out of scope for now"").

* Before trying to solve, we discuss the issue &amp; dissect it in detail. The point is to not just identify the root, but to also understand each other's motivation &amp; justification for their view. This includes lots of ""the reason I do that is..."", ""to me that comes across as..."", ""an analogous situation in context you're more familiar with might be..."", etc.

* We *explicitly* verbalise our gained perspective, our apologies, &amp; our praise, so that we both feel heard &amp; understood, &amp; can validate our solutions. This involves phrases like: ""I can see how by doing [*specific* action] I make you feel..."", ""I'm truly sorry that I unfairly chastised you, &amp; I now see how hypocritical I was for..."", ""I notice how much effort you put into [action], &amp; I'm extremely thankful to you for...""

* We take action, &amp; praise each other for it. ""I feel like [issue] is so much easier now, &amp; I'm incredibly grateful for your hard work in..."", etc.

I know this seems very general advice rather than disability specific, but hopefully it helps you in approaching the current conversation as well as future ones.

* ""I know it seems like a selfish complaint when I'm not the one with poor health &amp; there's no fault on your behalf for being unable, but I struggle with not having the 'real you' around. I miss going on dates, having an active boyfriend"" - a time where I was bedridden without even a few hours here &amp; there out of bed. A difficult talk, as I felt guilty already. By discussing so honestly I came away feeling an enormous weight off my shoulders, as I was able to see how she compartmentalised her disappointment in our situation from her feelings about me/us. She allowed me to similarly disassociate one from the other.

* ""I crave the full return of our *very* active sex life, but I understand that your recovery takes precedence. Your long-term health is my priority, but I need you to know that my desire for you has not diminished *one iota*"" - when our usually voracious intimacy has been limited by my recovery. So important for my mental health in knowing her disappointment &amp; cravings mirror my own.

* ""I absolutely appreciate that your life includes some non-standard accessories, but some of the medical equipment in use makes our bedroom feel a bit clinical.

If there are alternatives however, perhaps we could explore the options?"" - when my clunky old hoist takes up a large footprint in our new apartment.

While disability is a very visible use case, the tools you use to communicate in this way will strengthen your whole relationship - from &amp; for both of you, &amp; regarding subjects from choosing dinner to establishing child discipline ideals.

A good couple will feel free to say ""I love when you do X""; a great couple: ""I feel invalidated when you do Y"".

&amp;nbsp;

Your language is so wonderfully appropriate &amp; mature: ""I'm frustrated by/because of X"". The fact that you're asking important questions should give you confidence that you're capable of a great relationship. Well done, &amp; best of luck!

My pain is so bad at night that I barely sleep but my doctors don't see that so they act like nothing is wrong with me.

518,"there is some truth to this, but context is important. school, for SSA purposes, is treated like may other ""activities of daily living"". For example purposes lets say that there is an individual claiming benefits for agoraphobia and inability to leave the house: if that person is taking a full course load at a large, public university where they are regularly in classes of 100+ people that is something that would be *inconsistent* with their reported condition and it will lessen the credibility of their claims. However, that same person taking all online college classes creates a situation where their disabling claims are *consistent* with their actions. 

Generally though, SSA really does everything they can to encourage education and working. While it may not always seem like it, SSA tries to encourage these things because they are good for self-esteem and self-betterment. Yes there is the selfish reason as well since those who get an education are more likely to voluntarily return to work, but there is nothing wrong with this either. As an adjudicator, I would only really consider trying to use education to remove someone from benefits if it was crystal clear that their actions/education would translate to an ability to work.

Many people work who would meet disability listings because they earn more money than they would if they were on disability, or because they want to and are able to work. If someone is prescribed a wheelchair and cannot ambulate independently without it, they would definitely be allowed. 

tsarcasm is correct; someone's ability to go to college full time is taken into account when evaluating his or her mental functional capacity. It is not used as a decisional factor.

There are deafness listings, meaning if you have a certain level of hearing loss, you CAN be allowed for being deaf. They are not easy listings to meet, but being deaf, in and of itself, can prevent a person from working if it is severe enough.

Many people I talk to say they are disabled because they cannot do their  past work, but they can still do other work like desk jobs.

There's a saying among nurses and EMT's about knife fights: The loser dies at the scene, the winner dies in the hospital.

You don't need to precisely line up your sights for someone a pace or two away. For example, police train to shoot from the holster before they aim at someone so close. There are different ways to use a gun and I am confident in my ability to do so or I wouldn't carry one. I am *not* confident in my ability to stab or slash someone.

Guns aren't for everyone, or even most people. But they are a huge advantage for someone who cannot otherwise be effective physically.

As I said earlier, you should always try to just give them what they want, even if you have a gun.

599,"You know, I read the post that this person replied to. And initially I thought, hey, I know those feels, I'll write a reply to the guy about dating and how it's not hopeless. 

Before writing a long post like that, I like to have a quick look through the person's history, to see their mindset and if there are any details that might help me to give a better, more individual response. And you know what I saw in yours? Constant negativity. Admittance that you've given up on medication and therapy. A total fixation on getting a girlfriend when you *know* you are not in a good place mentally. And the overall impression that no matter what I said, you wouldn't listen to me anyway, because anyone who has tried to help you has gotten an angry, hopeless comment in response. 

I do not believe people cause their mental illness or bring it on themselves. But I do believe that once you have a mental illness, it is your responsibility to reach out for and accept help to control that illness. It's no different from a physical illness in that sense. And like a physical illness, there are ups and downs. Sometimes a treatment doesn't work. Sometimes the side effects are too much. Sometimes you don't get on with a doctor. It happens all the time, so you get up again and try something or someone else. It's not a reason to give up entirely. 

And in case you're thinking 'oh, you don't have it, you can't understand', I can assure you I do. I have been in ICU after a suicide attempt that very nearly killed me, and admitted against my will by force to psychiatric care more than once. And until I started admitting I was part of the problem and asked for help, I didn't get any better. I realised that the people I'd called nasty and unhelpful and emotionally negative were anything but, and my illness was the thing making them seem that way.

I guess my point is that while I thoroughly disagree with what that user said and think it's very unhelpful...having been through your post history I can see why they feel that way. I would also like to point out that the *vast majority* of people with a severe physical illness has some sort of psychiatric history, normally depression. Pain clinics often have psych professionals in them because physical pain is so intertwined with mental pain. So someone with that physical disability you can't imagine dealing with has likely more understanding of mental health problems than you'd think.

I think: Have therapy, use it as a place to express all this frustration. There's no guide book as to what you should talk about. Therapy is simply a time slot that is 100% yours to do whatever you want with. You don't have to talk about what others expect you to talk about, talk about what *you* find difficult and frustrating. If you can find someone with experience in disability or who has worked in a healthcare setting that's usually helpful.

I also think it would help you to be honest about everything you've just said here with your friends and family. They may be trying really hard to be empathetic but simply not viewing it from your position. If you have the patience, try and say everything you've said here because I think you've articulated it very well here. Some people will start to get it, some people won't and it's up to you to decide what to do with them. If you don't have the patience to explain things then don't, you don't owe anyone an explanation of your life-view and that's ok too. Just sometimes people need to be told things straight up in order to get out of their heads and see the situation differently. I think you're entitled to judge whether you want to put energy into that or not.

Finally - Feeling small is something I think a lot of us can relate to. You're not though. Don't give up. Don't let yourself become small by giving up your voice, own your feelings and your opinions about your life. Other people aren't entitled to those, only you are.

634,"It's a genetic disorder and really quite rare. The most well-known symptom is an inability to control food intake. People with PW will literally eat themselves to death if they can, there have been some very sad cases of stomach rupture when their food intake was not controlled. 

It has a huge number of other symptoms; there are distinctive physical characteristics, normally some level of intellectual disability, sleep disorders, compulsive behaviour and of course obesity, with all the problems that come with that.

I used to work in a similar environment to OP and we had two little boys with PW. Lovely kids when distracted but any thought of food and the illness took over. Trying to break into cupboards, eating out of bins, eating wrappers, crayons, other inedible objects. They had to eat separately from the other children or they would attack them and staff in order to steal their food. Hence OP's concern about the keys.
