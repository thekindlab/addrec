8,"What you call ""two-faced ableist garbage"" is pretty common, actually. I risk ""preaching to the choir"" by saying so, but there's unfortunately a big difference between how people approach visible, physical disabilities and how they approach invisible disabilities such as mental/emotional/behavioral/personality disorders. Yes, it's still ableism, and it's a hypocrisy for sure, but I think it's more of a representation of the current public mindset rather than someone being intentionally two-faced. 

For some of the people I know who hear about personality disorders, it's really REALLY hard to figure out or understand where the line is between a personality disorder and just being a crappy human being. Same thing goes with other invisible disabilities like depression or anxiety disorders. People have a hard time drawing the line between ""being sad because stuff sucks"" and ""having a disorder that goes beyond attitude and circumstance.""

Empathy is a great thing, and it's absolutely necessary in the disability rights movement. But, people have limits, and empathy has blind spots, and the only treatment is likely generations of patience and work toward understanding and acceptance for people with disabilities.

The advice you are being given is all over the place. I feel your concerns ARE VALID and you are NOT thinking about them too early. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. You have 9 years to figure this out, but it will go fast. In the meantime, you are right (heaven forbid) that anything could happen and you could suddenly be faced with some massive decisions. 

For perspective I am a 9th year special ed teacher, have worked in and managed a few group homes, and have a family member with a disability for whom I am a secondary caretaker. I become primary caretaker if something happens to their primary caretaker. I have to structure my life as such. I took that position by choice, completely willing to do all that was needed. 

First, anyone telling you to contact a school counselor or teacher is incorrect. If the school does not have written consent to share information regarding your sister, they can't. As a teacher I absolutely cannot talk to a sibling unless they are in the student's file as an approved contact.

Second, no one can make you become a legal guardian. Might one argue that it may be the morally correct thing to do? Perhaps. But if you feel it is not for you, you are not obligated to look after your sister. People may guilt you, they may think it is a terrible decision. Ultimately though, they are not the ones that would have to care for your sister. This is your decision, period. You may need to start setting boundaries now. 

Third, do you know if your sister has an IEP (Individual Education Plan) at her school? Does she see a special ed teacher, speech therapist, anyone? If your sister has an IEP, that means her school already identified her as needing accommodations for her disability and she is getting services. If she does, I would encourage you to ask your parents if you can attend her next IEP meeting (they have to happen at least 1x per year). Before anyone jumps on me for suggesting this, it could be that OPs sister is getting services but OP may not be aware exactly what those are. 

If you find your sister does not have an IEP, you may want to encourage your parents to ask for her to be assessed at school. This is a good starting point if nothing has been done. Once you find this out, I may be able to direct you to other subreddits for more suggestions.

Next, and you have every right to ask, see what your parents have in terms of a will and estate planning. /r/legaladvice might be a good place to research or ask further questions, especially if you have questions particular to your state. They may have medical power of attorney set up, a will, whatever. See where you and your sister are mentioned. Do not sign anything such as medical power of attorney or guardianship unless you fully understand and are ready to take on those duties. Are you attending a university? Some universities offer free legal advice. You may want to ask your parents very directly, ""what happens with  [sister] if you both suddenly pass?"" See what sort of plan they have. If there is no plan, encourage them to make one. This should be the responsibility of *any* parent. Unfortunately some people have a heavy dose of denial and/or an inability to discuss these difficult topics. Keep prodding for answers. 

At age 9, it may be hard to project where your sister will be in terms of her abilities when she graduates. She would not be evaluated for a group home until age 17/18 or even as high as 21 in some states (she could stay in school until 21 in some cases, with an IEP). It is in her best interest to get her as many supports as she may be eligible for. This means getting involved now and doing what you can to help your parents see she may need additional supports. It may be hard to say if a group home would be appropriate for her at this point. But...if she gets an IEP at school, this opens a ton of supports as far as transition assistance, work assistance and the like. Those professionals will be able to help her with her goals and decide an appropriate level of support in terms of where she lives.

18,"As for your feelings of guilt and shame, here are couple of thoughts.

As you already know, they don't allow people on disability unless they are genuinely disabled. It's not easy to get on disability. If you are approved initially, then you are genuinely disabled and deserve the benefit. There's no reason to feel guilty about it. No reason at all. You are a human being, and from what you wrote it sounds like a very decent human being. It is not asking too much of society to provide you the meager support that SSI allows.

Also, keep in mind that your value as a human being is not measured by your performance of ""substantial gainful activity"". Unfortunately, we are programmed to believe that are worth is entirely wrapped up in the job that we get paid for. In reality, the jobs that most people get paid for are not the most important job that they do. Unless you are single neurosurgeon with no social ties to anyone, chances are your most important job is not what's listed on your business card. Ask any parent or grandparent and they will tell you that raising children is far more important than their day job.

I'm sure that you can, and probably do provide a lot of value to other people in your life on a daily basis. Do you ever provide a friend or family member an ear to listen or shoulder to cry on? Do you help out your parents or grandparents? Did you ever answer someone looking for help on Reddit? We all have countless opportunities every day to help someone out, raise their spirits, give a little advice, or even just listen to their troubles.

Next time you start getting down on yourself, think about all the little things that you do and you will realize that you are actually pretty cool. And maybe, if you start thinking in these terms, you'll decide that you want to do more of those little things when you get the chance. And maybe you will start doing more of those things, and maybe you'll start feeling even better about yourself.

22,"I think it's also important to know that an adjudicators decision isn't based on whether or not they care, or whether or not they believe you are unable to work. if your impairment does not meet or equal a listing, the process of sequential evaluation requires a determination to be made on your residual functioning capacity. In many cases a claimant may not be able to work past jobs....but sequential evaluation and the vocational rules may require DDS to determine if there are other jobs you can do in the national economy. Now keep in mind these jobs don't necessarily have to be available, but DDS just has to determine that you have the residual functioning capacity to do the other work that your residual functioning capacity suggests. it's not just based on whether or not you can do jobs you've done in the past. Also hopping from doctor to doctor and therapist to therapist can hurt your case. when it becomes apparent that you are simply looking for doctors to make supporting statements for you without a longitudinal treating history, they may be given less weight. and if you have 9 doctors whose records say you have mild to moderate symptoms and one who makes a statement that you are totally disabled, than that one doctor presents an inconsistency which may effect the amount of weight given to his or her medical opinion. statements from treating doctors stating one is totally disabled or unable to work are considered issues reserved to the commissioner, and may not reflect the requirements of SSA's definition of disabled. DDS initial and reconsideration evaluations are heavily bound by specific policies and guidelines, which are reviewed by DDS medical consultants, and state level reviews, and often times reviewed again by the federal Disability Quality Branch. the ALJ can often make looser interpretations of the medical evidence to make a favorable decision which is probably why people believe that they will have to apply several times before they get approved .

Thank you for all your input.  

In case anybody else is looking, I found the Karman Ergo Flight and the Quickie line are lightweight, under 20 pounds.  They are pricey, about $700 USD and up.  

The various home medical places were not too much help.  No lightweights in stock, and most did not have small walkers.  Also the cash prices are outrageous.  If you go through Medicare or Medicaid, it takes a while for approval.  Cash prices for walkers ranged $150 USD and up while internet prices were around $30 and up.  

Medicare won't even approve ANY payment on ultralight wheelchairs, not even the amount they'd provide for a standard.  Also, the Medicare payment for the standard wheelchair is greatly marked up.",,,,fu_ben,,,1482973227,t5_2qhe8,t3_5h0dqz,t3_5h0dqz,1,1484113928,0,0,dbqkld4,disability,,,,,

Each case is reviewed by a doctor. They provide an assessment of what the person is capable of doing in regard to work by reviewing the medical evidence, not by reviewing work activity. After that, an SSA employee determines if the person can return to their relevant past work (not the work below SGA), then they check to see if they can adjust to other work using a table of vocational rules.

76,"The other suggestions here are much better than mine, and if you can do them I'd vote do them. But as a third tier suggestion: *if* it can't work with other suggestions--such as re-adjusting the length of the wheelbase, switching chairs, buying a freewheel (IF it can connect to those swing-away footplates which I'm reallllly not sure of, but it would otherwise definitely address the problem), or buying a different used chair rather than a freewheel (which as another user commented can even be more economical),* then* my suggestion is to toy with your center of gravity in any way you can.

What is fucking you with being forward tippy is that your center of mass is too far forward relative to the back wheels. This puts all the weight on your tiny front wheels, which are happy to get caught and dump you over a side walk crack or a pebble. Adjusting the back wheels *forward* relative to your seatbase shifts your center of gravity *backwards* relative to the main axis and can make the chair less forward tippy. 

There are multiple things going on with that wheelbase any one of which could be shifted to help this problem. Length of wheelbase is one, but in my experience, small changes in the location of the back wheels relative to the main mass of your spine/back creates a much more dramatic impact than lengthened wheelbase. One way I have been able to hack this in a pinch in poorly adjusted chairs is through a combination of posture and seat cushions. Basically, I can't sit up all that straight, but the more I can elevate myself, the more I can shift weight backwards, and thus off those evil front wheels. In a pinch I've found that sitting up higher, on top of an extra cushion for example, even at the loss of leg comfort, gives me that extra backwards tip. Another idea if you've got a shit chair is that if there's a way to temporarily remove or extend the back--a way that lets you sit *farther back*--that would also shift your weight back.

Another thing I've found with forward tippy chairs is that there can be an important geometry/art of someone pushing them.  There are certain angles of approach where in the act of leaning down the person pushing the chair is actually applying a bunch of downward force to those little front wheels. In uneven ground, it's all about removing as much force from those little front suckers as possible! If someone's going to be pushing the chair for the most part, I would suggest playing around with it and seeing if the pusher can feel the difference between pushing down on those front wheels versus the oppsite which is popping a wheelie. Same advice for the one in the chair. Pop those wheelies. *FEEL* those wheelies. The art of rolling over uneven ground is truly the art of rocking a real moderate wheelie over an extended distance.",,,,weboverload,,,1482907788,t5_2qhe8,t3_5klslw,t3_5klslw,2,1484095284,0,0,dbpivfe,disability,,,,,

So my best solution is specialty ""Scleral contacts"" which safely protect irregular corneas and also are ideal for dry eyes. They're different from regular contacts in that they keep the eyes flooded with liquid, and are large in diameter, resting on the white of the eyes. They also look quite intimidating to insert and remove, making me wish I had a simpler prescription solution.

109,"Political, maybe. Six separate instances of Trump supporters shooting police, or being motivated to shoot up a Planned Parenthood doesn't always get reported in conjunction with other cases the way they seem to link all protests and protesters from the left with violence.  The news is not careful how they define political violence or who is on the left/where it is coming from, for that matter.  Yes there is violence, and I believe it is more severe, and also more prevalent from the right.  The difference is that the events coming from ""the left"" are made to seem large, when Trump was telling his supporters to punch protestors at his rallies.  Pizza gate was a very isolated instance of unacceptable violence that could have turned out a lot worse than it did.  

What I was thinking of is, in my opinion, the almost practical militant mentality of some Trump supports ( for instance the KKK), along with what many of his supporters seem to think is appropriate violence on their part.

130,"I do a lot of work in the legal applications of disability law, and the specific details of any situation is critical to how the law is applied. However, I think I understand now it is not an employment issue but that you solicited a service, had your appointment canceled, and are angry? 

First off, the ADA does not apply to companies smaller than 15 people. 

When the ADA does apply, its core purpose is to ensure equal access and opportunity for all people. It also only requires that accommodations be made when it does not unduly affect the nature of a job function or position. 

It would seem that the burden of proof rests on you to demonstrate that specifically your appointment was canceled directly and because of a disability or other federally protected class. You do not have standing to impose a restriction on the exchange of services such as a one hour notification prior to cancellation on a company that you solicit services from as a consumer. An accommodation, in the legal sense, would only be in effect if you were employed with them or had another type of contract that outlined the terms of a business agreement. If you are a consumer, you are not bound by contract. While it is unfortunate that your appointment was canceled, legally I don't see much recourse for you unless you can prove in a courtroom that yours was preferentially canceled due to disability. You might see if they have guideline established for how they run their 'store' and see if you have recourse as a consumer there.

If for whatever reason this is the only 'store' you can book appointments with, *and* it is for a service necessary to sustaining your life, that could give you a bit more standing to attempt to impose any kind of contractual obligation, but again as a consumer you come in with far less ability to demand accommodations than you do as an employee. If you seek out appointments with this store for a consumer good or consumer service because it is your own desire, that's really the end of the line. A court would just advice you to take your service elsewhere, which is where your true power as a consumer resides. 

Edit: also, as you say, ADA and other legislation exists to enable a consumer to engage and do business in the same or comparable manner as a non-disabled consumer. It appears you are capable of seeking out the company and receiving their service just fine. The issue is you must suffer after effects from your visit *after you leave.* that's not a protected status. If I go to the bar and get drunk, I can't get accommodations because I get a hangover the next day. The law does not exist to legislate effects of actions you chose to take. They'll see it as you were going to go to the office for your appointment anyway, and have a history of doing so. You accept whatever consequences it has after you leave. Canceled appointments do happen. ",,,,zebra-stampede,,,1481238703,t5_2qhe8,t3_5h9tx2,t1_dayle0b,3,1483584322,0,0,daym0gf,disability,,,,,

What do you value, like, enjoy?  And why?   What are you most proud of?  Why?  What do you miss - and most importantly, why?

Use these answers to help you look forward, plan your path, and set objectives to help you achieve your goals.  Then work towards achieving them.

For example, if you miss the camaraderie with fellow soldiers &amp; serving your country, your path might include volunteering at a Veteran's Rehabilitation center. 

Or creating a blog about your experiences and how you cope with the challenges of becoming a Disabled Veteran.  Sharing your experiences of adjusting to civilian life with other Disabled Veterans helps them, you, &amp; our country.

If you also love computer programming, &amp; you're able to, you could take courses &amp;/or earn IT certifications, federal government jobs with high Vetetan employment stats.  

Allow yourself to mourn what you've lost, but don't let yourself get trapped in that despair.  

Give yourself something to strive for, something to achieve, something to look forward to.

And Happy Holidays to you, as well!",,,,UserNme_AlreadyTaken,,,1482511325,t5_2qhe8,t3_5jx0np,t3_5jx0np,6,1483992106,0,0,dbjsm1h,disability,,,,,
142,"If you have Medicare then, yes, you're correct. They only want to hear about why the wheelchair needs to be used to support activities of daily living in the home. State Medicaid programs may or may not have similar, home-based requirements. 

If your medical insurance is through the Affordable Care Act or if it's provided by you or your spouse’s employer, then you are much more likely to get a wheelchair for outdoor use, because they don't have the ""only for daily living activities at home"" restrictions found in Medicare. When I had employer-based coverage, and legitimately needed a new wheelchair (as you clearly do) I'd get a prescription from my regular doctor, take it to local durable medical equipment supplier and I'd get a new chair. There was always a co-pay, typically 50% or 20% of the total amount of the chair.

Every state has a [Vocational Rehabilitation Agency](http://askjan.org/cgi-win/TypeQuery.exe?902). They help people with disabilities who want to go to work, or who are already employed, get equipment, training, and other forms of assistance so they get or keep their jobs. 

If you're working, your state vocational rehabilitation would likely love to help you out in keeping you independence at home and in the community, especially if all you need is a new, $900 wheelchair. It's minimal work for them to write the plan for a wheelchair for a person with your level of disability. After ninety days, if you're happy with the wheelchair, they get to close your case. They get tracked by the feds and successful case closures make them look good. Also, they can recoup from the federal government about 80% of their direct expenses when they close a case successfully. 

Even if you aren't working, and can't honestly say that you want to work, your state vocational rehabilitation may still be able to help. Some states have independent living programs in their vocational rehabilitation agencies that can provide assistance for people to function better in the home. I know my state used to be able to spend up to $1500 on independent living clients.

State [Centers for Independent Living](http://www.ilru.org/projects/cil-net/cil-center-and-association-directory#alphaList) are another type of federally funded  organization that might also be a source of funding, or a good referral source to funding sources in your state or community. 

Most of the businesses that supply wheelchairs and other durable medical equipment in my town would love to sell you a wheelchair, and they usually have staff who can help a you find funding sources. Because these are profit-oriented enterprises, rather than state or federal government programs, be certain you understand all of the financing information they present, and shop around, if you have multiple wheelchair vendors in your community.

157,"Hey, Bud… As you've read, I'm also struggling with despair.  

Having said that — and I consider your despair very real, and valid — when we do the arithmetic on our own value, socially, we need to factor in how much we can have a positive impact on other people's lives, and not just how much we eat, how much space we take up, etc.  

This interaction we are having is a good example of how, thanks to the Internet, we can impact ( for good *or* bad) people's lives without even getting out of bed.  

(I only mention the negative impact folks can have online because I feel like I've been getting trolled by folks on Reddit who don't like when I ask other Redditors for assistance.)  

I hope you factor in the good impact you are capable of making in the lives of others.

VR is going to assess your vocational skills and see how their resources can best help you achieve what is attainable and what are your goals.

167,"Food stamps will help with the food part. As for housing, there really isn't much. SSDI or SSI are really the main ways to support ones self when unable to work, or limited on their working capabilities. SSI is generally quicker to get, so it's good short term. SSDI is much slower to get, but more useful long term.

At your age and without a diagnosis both will be hard to get. One of the requirements past a certain age for SSDI is also based on previous works pay which is translated into 'work credits'. Because of that, starting an application as early as possible is really helpful. I'd suggest first discussing with your doctor about how disabling your issues are, since their support/agreement is vital in either SSI or SSDI. Can't stress it enough that the earlier you start the better. I literally had my hearing just 2 days back with my first application 2 years ago. At the very least, a consultation with a law firm specializing in disability is worth the time. It should be free, and if you go forward with it they are paid from a percent of backpay, so the only fees until then are doctors and copy fees (I think I've been charged ~$70 in the two years).

201,"It can be confusing, that is for sure. 

SSI and SSDI are designed for the same purpose: to give cash assistance to people who are disabled and can't work. The only real distinction between the programs is the non-medical qualifications. 

SSDI gives the greater amount (and has less restrictions after the fact) because it is an insurance program paid for with your FICA taxes. Since an individual has ""paid"" into the benefit the amount is higher. SSI is the ""needs based"" wing of the program; this is for people who haven't worked, or who did work but didn't work long enough to qualify for SSDI (general rule is 5 years). The SSI amount is lower because that individual hasn't paid into the system; and it is only given if they are truly in financial need. They will also only continue to receive the benefit if they remain in financial need. 

When a person applies for 'disability' they are actually applying for both SSI and SSDI. The field office takes both applications and checks eligibility for both. From there the applications (SSI, SSDI, or both) are sent to the state's Disability Determination office (DDS) for the medical decision. The medical qualifications are exactly the same for both programs. ",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1481124214,t5_2qhe8,t3_5gy4mn,t1_dawd582,7,1483545583,0,0,dawe85b,disability,,,,,

I have now traveled a lot with my Handicapped Fiance, and let me warn you, they are going to treat your grandpa a little like luggage.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as you know that ahead of time.  
If you can afford First Class, do it.  It is worth the extra expense for the extra leg room.  In-flight adjustments are made infinitely easier with the extra space.  As mentioned in other comments, leg room is key.  You can ask for the ""bulk head seats"" in lieu of first class, which will give you a little more room than the standard seats.

Now on to boarding the plane.  If your grandfather can still walk short distances on his own, then they will wheel him down to the entrance of the plane and he can walk alone, or with your guidance to his seat.  If your grandfather doesn't walk any more, they will wheel him down to the door of the plane, and he will be helped in to a tiny little wheelchair that can go down the tiny aisle.  Upon first glance, this chair will look like some rudimentary torture device.  Your first impression is not completely wrong, but luckily the people helping are usually quite kind and helpful.  I would encourage you to follow your grandfather the whole way to make sure that he is safely in his seat before all the helpers are gone.

Lastly, the chair.  If your grandfather uses a manual chair, then it shouldn't be too hard to fold it up and have it ride underneath.  Be sure to tell the gate attendant that you would like the chair to be brought up to the door of the plane upon landing.  This will mean that your grandfather spends the least amount of time possible outside of his own chair.  If he uses an electric chair, you will likely need to disconnect the battery depending on what type of battery he uses.  We have started removing the controller so that the baggage handlers don't try to drive it. (Yes, they have done this)  We also tape BIG color-coded instructions on how to stop and start the thing. (Move blue lever up to start, move blue lever down to stop)  We have considered translating it in to several different languages, but realize the futility of making the font smaller than HUGE.  Before you leave the gate, check to see that there are no dents in the chair.  It doesn't happen often, but it is better to find it out right away, then to find out when it negatively impacts your grandfathers mobility.

Now that I have probably scared the hell out of you with this wall of text, let me reassure you that the people at the airlines are actually quite accommodating and nice.

Some airlines will try to take it when you first check in, rather than at the gate. Don't cave to this. For one, it will leave you stranded in an unpushable abomination hours before your flight, and for two it will mean never seeing your chair again until baggage claim. I mentioned in my (highly dubious) bathrooming strategy advice that I purposely schedule layovers in international travel. Well, the one thing that can screw that strategy entirely is if they don't give you your own chair during the layover!

For example, last month I had a layover in Iceland, and the only reason I got my own chair during it was because I convinced the guy driving the giant lift-truck they used to deboard me to drive over and snag the wheelchair from the baggage platform.

The ableist do not care if we are dead, or on the streets. Discrimination is real, and it hinders us in many ways. The only way to get people to see the importance of these programs is to fight the prejudice, which  is happening. People with invisible disabilities see the side that many ableist hide, from people with more obvious disabilities. However, those of us with invisible disabilities 
qualify for very little in government assistance, if any.

America is very much a nation of workers. What job you have is considered as much a part of who you are as your age, sex, weight, etc. Either it's a side-effect of the cliche' idea of the ""american dream"" or conditioning over the years of attacks on social welfare services, but the shittiest part of the average person's ideas about people with disabilities is that if you're not working hard, you must be taking it easy, and to the rest of Americans who believe they're working hard, that's unfair.

It's definitely a struggle, then, to feel judgement from people when you're not earning money at all, let alone at the rate most people would consider livable. It's not as bad within my own family, because they know me and they know my limits because they grew up with me experiencing them. However, my in-laws make me feel like that bond of understanding isnt there. To add salt to the wound, my family and my wife's family are across the state from one another, and since we moved closer to my wife's side of the family, I've felt that judgement more and more. 

My own wife sometimes gets stressed over stuff that we both know wouldn't happen if I wasn't disabled. Just yesterday, actually, after coming home from a christmas party, we had a conversation about how shitty the monthly payment of our insurance is. I recently got back on SSI after being off for about six months, so I have medicaid again, so we decided to take me off my wife's insurance plan to see if that saves us some money. It ammounted to about 20 bucks savings, because of course my earnings are so low that the ACA gives us a discount on my half of the insurance. My wife even confided that ""A really hurt part of me wants to say 'there's no reason you can't get a job' but I know that's not fair and not supportive."" Knowing that my disability puts that kind of stress on my wife is awful. If I was able to earn even half of what she does, we wouldn't be in nearly as much hot water financially, but since the difference between me being on or off her insurance is 20 bucks, it's not me that's the problem. In the end, we wound up realizing that this stress of insurance would have been there even if she wasn't married to a blind guy. And the one time I ever told her she would be better off leaving me so she didn't have to deal with this, she actually slapped me. 

OP, there's always going to be people that don't or can't understand, but there are more ways to ""contribute"" than just income. This christmas season, I cooked dinner for both the 24th and 25th. That's contributing with skills. I talked to my crazy relatives-in-law so they wouldn't get on my mother-in-law's nerves. That's contributing with words. I make hand-made soap as a hobby and sometimes sell a few bars and that helps too. It's not much but it's better than nothing.

Find out if there is an Independant living center or disability resource center somewhere near you that they can have one of their advocates come help you try to get accomodations from your job.      
Here's the thing: even tho it is against the law to discriminate and refuse to accomodate someone with a disability, businesses STILL do it and the EEOC only ever find 3% of all cases of harassment/discrimination (on ANY basis of disability, sexual harassment, racism, ageism) with enough ""evidence"" to warrant them to actually persue a lawsuit against the company accused of breaking the law.

I don't know how it works in the US (from the UK myself) but if anyone has the time and energy to actually take action, you can do so in the following two ways according to the 'Idaho Coalition Against Sexual &amp; Domestic Violence'.

1. Call and encourage others to call the Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden at 208 334-2400 to share your concerns about the amendment of the charge to a non-sex offense and the Alford plea, and most importantly, the egregious statements by Deputy Attorney Casey Hemmer that it was not a sex crime, that it did not involve racism, and his discriminatory comments towards individuals with disabilities. 

2. Send a letter to the Attorney General Lawrence G. Wasden Office of the Attorney General, 700 W. Jefferson Street, P.O.

1. A victim of a natural disaster
2. elderly
3. Have children

If you don't fit any of that criteria (me) you're only options (in Pennsylvania) are food stamps and to go through the eviction process because they can't help with rent unless you've already received an eviction notice and have destroyed your relationship with your landlord. The section 8 housing and voucher program here has a 2 year waiting list, cash assistance is only available if you have children under 18 (you're own only, not other people's children that you are raising) and utility assistance only goes so far. 

I called Catholic Charities (only helps the elderly), The United Way, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, and 211 which provides info on programs that are supposed to help locally. They all told me they were sorry there's nothing they could do because I don't fit the criteria or they don't donate directly to individuals. 

It's disgusting really. Someone who is sick and CANNOT work having to stress and worry over money which can worsen their health. Then, the real slap in the face is that you'll probably have to hire a lawyer to win SSDI (and it can take up to 2 years) which you've paid into your whole life. Compared to what I've seen on Canada's website, the US government should be ashamed with how they treat their citizens who had the bad luck to get sick, injured or born with a debilitating disease.

They're currently testing me for Cushings as well, so I had to apply with my nerve damage and ruptured discs from an injury (exacerbated by the suspected Cushings) as well as panic disorder and anxiety.

Wait til the first time you hit a rock, or a curb, in that chairman it flips forward throwing his teeth into the concrete... It can happen in any chair, but it is probable in that one, especially with someone pushing it.

The problem comes from the length of the wheelbase *and* the height of the push-handles, neither of which can be meaningfully adjusted on that chair design, My suggestion is to find a second-hand wheelchair dealer and buy one from them. They're generally very cheap, and you could get something like a Quickie GPV for only a couple hundred dollars that will make life in his chair much more enjoyable, vastly more comfortable, and easier to deal with.

I'm not even going to mention the price on my chair, in case things have changed for him. These folks are all over the place -- you just have to find one within driving distance of yourself.

Chairs like the GPV also come with a way to adjust the positioning (front to back, as well as cant) of the rear wheels, meaning a 5-minute adjustment fits the chair to almost anyone's needs. A slight cant to the wheels makes him more stable from side to side. They also have a more solid seat base, and are often fitted with memory foam seats. This will keep him comfortable for longer periods of time (dinner, seeing a movie) and keep him from getting sores.

I know it isn't the best/easiest solution -- and was probably one you were looking to avoid -- but it is necessary.

I think other people responding to you, with their leg bag approach, are a bit wiser than I. However, having acknowledged that, since I do fly quite a bit both domestically and internationally, I'll share the approach that has worked for me and that is: *Total Dehydration*. 

I know, I know! So much to critique with that approach. I mean, obviously it's unhealthy. Not to mention onerous. And it assumes bladder control, which of course, not everyone has. However, it has worked for me. I've done it countless times. I have the timing of how long before the flight I need to stop intaking liquids down (4-5 hours for a super long flight, maybe 3 for a shorter, lower danger flight). I drink nothing after that point, and nothing after that in flight (except maybe the last 2 hours of flight if I'm feeling solid and confident of no  delays) (ok, and also sometimes some shots of whiskey, with the excuse that they're ""dehydrating"" :-p ). 

With international flights, I try my best to split my flight into legs so I can get a pee break layover in the middle. Ten hours is around the longest leg I feel safe using this approach on. (Ten hours sounds so long during daylight, but not peeing for ten hours is something many people accomplish every night through sleeping--definitely attainable.) Even then, I wear a little bit of padding, just in case. With the *Total Dehydration* approach, the amount of possible liquid you might have to deal with is much smaller, so padding suffices instead of a bag. (would also help the bag emptying problem)

Back when I first started flying a lot, onboard accommodations weren't as common, which probably explains the extremism of my approach. Now, however, those options are more reliable. My experience with them is limited, but here are some features I've gleaned:

* You need to be able to transfer yourself completely for all stages. Getting on and off a plane from an aisle chair, the employees will lift you. However, once you're onboard, the flight attendants are not supposed to do any lifting. They're only allowed to push the aisle chair for you. So you need to be able to get from the seat to the aisle chair and back as well as do the transferring in the bathroom. Sometimes the aisle chair will be of different dimensions than the one you got onboard with, so keep that in mind. For instance, I've encountered some weirdly tall ones.

* Inquire beforehand to make sure the onboard wheelchair is *actually onboard*. Some airlines are better at this than others. Many have them onboard by default now, but some make you actually request it. Just...check.

* Curtain or no, ""accessible"" or no, onboard restrooms are a bitch to transfer into. The aisle chair will fit all the way in, the times I've used them it even fits sideways up against the toilet. But for me at least it was still some of the trickiest transferring I've done. I can use my legs a little bit to aid in transfers, but the aisle chair don't really have a footplate to push against, which is most of what made it hard for me. Saving grace: not much room, so it's hard to actually fall!

In every section of society there are violent individuals who lash out. You can find them on the left and on the right. Note that I say individuals. The right, however, seems to dominate in terms of organizations that incite and legitimize violence. Physical and structural.

You say that white people are also victims, that race is just one issue and victimization is not a contest. White people, on the whole in the US, are 100% not victims in this situation and I cannot see how anyone can possibly think that they are. Even if you compare white people and black people within the same socioeconomic class, there are disparities - with black individuals consistently living in more deprived areas than their peers in the same socioeconomic class or shouldering a greater amount of debt for example. White working class people may think they have it bad and many of them do but there's a whole other level below that for black working class people. And that's not even getting into the structural violence that black people face that white people have never ever had to. White people may be victims of neoliberal economic policies, but they are certainly not victims of society in the same sense that black people or other minorities are.

415,"Get to a lawyer that specializes in Social Security Disability law ASAP. Most will talk to you for free and give you a good assessment of your chances of getting approved for Social Security Disability and Medicare. 

Whether you decide to work with a lawyer or not, get your application in to Social Security ASAP. You get back pay from Social Security Disability from the time they get your application until (and if) they approve you for disability. 

When I became disabled I went with a lawyer because while they charge for their services, it's usually a percentage of the back-pay you get when you're approved. Their expertise in handling these cases means they know how to package your application in a way that increases your chances of success. They also gather all the medical info and other facts about you and the nature of your disability that goes into your application. They can help you get your application in so the clock starts ticking on your potential back-pay.

As has been mentioned, contacting your state's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. You can find your state's office here http://askjan.org/cgi-win/TypeQuery.exe?902. They can help you with getting job skills so you can support yourself. They can also advise you on other benefits that could help you while you wait for approval. 

As far as some jobs you can do with your current level of disability, I can think of a couple possibilities. Many websites now offer the option of chatting online with someone through text typed back and forth for sales questions, customer support, and account maintenance. This is all done without the need to communicate vocally. 

If being exposed to loud noises, without your hearing aids, and with ear covers won't damage what hearing you have left, then searching for work in a factory or other work-site that is too noisy for auditory communication may also be a possibility. 

None of this is going to happen overnight. In the long run, remember nobody is ever going to hire you because of your disabilities. It's your abilities and attitude that are going be your best assets in getting trained, hired, promoted and successfully retired from whatever career it is you want to pursue.

Whether you decide to work with a lawyer or not, get your application in to Social Security ASAP. You get back pay from Social Security Disability from the time they get your application until (and if) they approve you for disability. 

When I became disabled I went with a lawyer because while they charge for their services, it's usually a percentage of the back-pay you get when you're approved. Their expertise in handling these cases means they know how to package your application in a way that increases your chances of success. They also gather all the medical info and other facts about you and the nature of your disability that goes into your application. They can help you get your application in so the clock starts ticking on your potential back-pay.

As has been mentioned, contacting your state's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. You can find your state's office here <URL> They can help you with getting job skills so you can support yourself. They can also advise you on other benefits that could help you while you wait for approval. 

As far as some jobs you can do with your current level of disability, I can think of a couple possibilities. Many websites now offer the option of chatting online with someone through text typed back and forth for sales questions, customer support, and account maintenance. This is all done without the need to communicate vocally. 

If being exposed to loud noises, without your hearing aids, and with ear covers won't damage what hearing you have left, then searching for work in a factory or other work-site that is too noisy for auditory communication may also be a possibility. 

None of this is going to happen overnight. In the long run, remember nobody is ever going to hire you because of your disabilities. It's your abilities and attitude that are going be your best assets in getting trained, hired, promoted and successfully retired from whatever career it is you want to pursue.

I generally say that I am a musician, but that I've had to take time off because of my health. I give them a moment to react and then turn the conversation to their job or their interests. 

Honestly, most people just give a knowing nod at that. Almost everyone has some experience, direct or indirect with health problems at some level. You don't need to say how you support yourself and you certainly don't need to go into more detail about your specific health problems than you want to. 

At some point in the conversation I usually drop in that I'm into gardening, photography, whatever so that they have something to grasp onto in terms of who I am at the moment. This way we can talk about some things that I'm interested in as well as their job.

But then BIID is a legitimate mental health issue, I don't feel it is comparable to transsexual issues because with transsexual issues (I have a close transsexual friend) there is not a real 'loss' when transitioned. There is only the gain of greater mental health, assuming that it all goes well. Transabled however, does have a loss. The sufferer may gain a sense of bodily autonomy, but they will have lost the ability to walk for example, or function in the least difficult way. 

Although I would not choose a cure for my being autistic, and I am in two minds about my mobility issues ... if we could somehow choose what we were to become, it feels doubtful that all things being equal, a rational person would choose to be any oppressed minority, including disabled folk. I exist as I am, and society should adjust for the needs of its people, including me, because it is nonsensical that some people can't access buildings, or functions, or whatever due to physical and societal constraints. But it is not rational to try and grasp at that position through what is, self mutilation, whether or not it is helped by a surgeon imho.

459,"You're right, it is more frustrating for claimants than it is for examiners. However, examiners have to deal not only with people who are denied and don't understand why, but with people who never should have applied and simply do not want to work, and apply time after time after time. We get abused, yelled at, cursed at, and accused of what you and OP are accusing us of daily.

The misunderstanding of how disability works is the ultimate culprit. Most applicants believe if they cannot perform the work they used to do, they will be allowed. That is not how it works.  It's probably the biggest misconception. Social security is based on if you can do *any* job, not just your past job.  This misconception is closely followed-up by age. The younger you are, the harder it will be to be allowed (for physical impairments) due to the fact that when you're younger, you're stronger and can do more work. These are examples.

While most people we deal with genuinely believe they are disabled, unfortunately, we cannot allow everyone who applies. That is why the policies and blue book listings are in play. Disability is not meant to be a fail-safe for people who don't want to work, are anxious when they apply for jobs, or have back pain. Disability is for people who physically or mentally CANNOT SUSTAIN A 40-HOUR WORK WEEK. 

SSA has many policies that are outdated, and many of the ways it operates are not optimal. However, it is the system we have and we have to operate within it. If the ""good people"" who worked there stopped working there, even with the ""degree of complicity"" they work within, the system would be left to those who don't care, and it would become worse than it is. 

While we are not on the edge of poverty, we do not make as high of salaries as many would believe, especially for the type of job we do. It is not a job we perform to get rich. The majority of us work at SSA because we want to help as best we can. 

Ultimately, the problems lie above your typical field office and SSA employees. Until congress changes the policies and laws, we can only do so much.

No big deal for me, I was willing to wait. The attendant on the other hand... Well, once that situation was sorted, she escorts me to the accessible stall and walks right in with me. I ask her to leave, and she says, ""No, I'm here to help."" I told her if I needed help I would have brought a helper. Cue the wailing, ""I just wanted to heeeelp.""

Depending on money, there's a cut off point such like around 15,000, 20,000 etc in savings that makes people ineligible for benefits.  Having money through inheritance means this savings cut off maybe reached.

Why they do this is often means you're now able to afford your own care needs and pay tax and so on.

There's also taken into account, change of circumstances, such as family moving away, death or a change of living ability or ability to work changes.  This varies probably by the SSI rules and laws to make sure you're getting the right amount based on your exact needs.

I'm sure, only very few keep quiet about money and change of circumstances but that often means fraudulent claims.  Failing to report significant change of circumstances means facing problems with law dependent on the rules of that benefit or laws governing it.

It is an awkward situation, there's just no getting around. But if you have the right attitude, it's not that big of a deal. Depending on where you are getting your aide, they should be trained in how to deal with your needs, although they will definitely need direction from you. Every patient they work with is different, and will have different needs and preferences. As long as you clearly articulate what you need and don't need, they will be able to help and you will be fine. Be specific with your instructions, but not demanding or condescending. The aide wants to do their job properly, and wants to help you. You just have to tell them how to do that. Having a sense of humor helps.

546,"First of all, thanks for the gold! Here is a background about myself: I have a disability where my lower body is much smaller than my upper body AMC ( Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita) . My legs and musculature in them did not form correctly. While my upper body is strong, my lower body is small. Think Johnny Bravo.

I didn’t play any sports in Highschool, just pushed my wheelchair around for a bit during a marathon here or there, but mainly I was standing and walking on crutches. I went through high school in 3 years and was working at a soup/salad restaurant for 20 hours a week my junior/senior year.
In College, I played a lot of table tennis on my crutches and then went and competed with the gymnastics club afterwards. Every night. 5 nights a week. I was good on the pommel horse, the parallel bars and the rings ( basically events where I did not have to use my legs.) I wear full leg braces which keeps my legs straight so that helped. After a few years, I became a coach for the team. Although I physically could not do the events, I could watch and give pointers on correct technique for the new gymnasts.

After college, ( or rather in the middle of college, I was in college for quite a long time) I moved to Sacramento, CA and found myself competing in and helping out with a myriad of disabled sports. Wheelchair Basketball, Handcycling, Archery, Wheelchair Football, Waterskiing and Tennis were the main sports that I found myself either actively playing in or helping to teach. I did not have a car, so many members of the disabled sporting community in Sacramento would pick me up and take me to the various events. With my physique and ability to walk on crutches well, I basically could adapt to all these sports. Fast forward to now, I have competed at a national level in Wheelchair Basketball and Tennis. I work with a non-profit in Sacramento CA called TIES ( Teaming Individuals Emphasizing Sports) where we focus on using Wheelchair Tennis to break down barriers between able-bodied individuals and people in chairs on both a social and physical level. Tennis is one of the few “disabled sports” that an able bodied person and a person in a chair can compete on an even level. We call it Up\Down Tennis. It’s basically doubles where one person is sitting and one person is standing. During the summer I work at a wheelchair sports camp called Abilities First as a coach for kids with disabilities. We bring in coaches who have competed at the national level from all around the country and coach a group of 25-32 kids throughout an entire week.

Note: the only different rule in wheelchair tennis vs Able Bodied tennis is the wheelchair player gets two bounces. All other rules are the same. The wheelchair counts as the players body so if the ball contacts the chair before hitting the ground then its considered in play and the point goes to the other player.

Ok onto your question 1. Why did I choose Tennis as my sport. Well I like tennis because it’s a mental sport. When playing singles, it’s basically you and your set of skills against another person. The different divisions have completely different skillsets needed for them as well as abilities within the mental game. Since I played wheelchair basketball first, my ability to push my chair quickly and get up to top speed helped me in tennis. If someone slices a drop shot, I can get up to speed and get to the shot in time and then get back to my hub and get ready for the next shot. I had a lot of friends playing so I played it as well. When playing doubles, it’s you and another person and you have to weigh each other abilities to match the other team playing. ( side of court, serving and such)

Question 2: How are you aggressive, is it harder or easier than what you see in “normal Tennis”. Well ask yourself what being aggressive is and how that plays into the game of tennis. If I have never played the game of tennis and I came out being very aggressive and swinging wildly at shots, then I would have next to NO CONTROL or SHOT PLACEMENT in my game and thus, my aggressiveness would not help me at all. However, when the game is slowed down and I can stop and focus on technique first, then power ( or aggressiveness) can come later. Through muscle memory and technique comes good tennis and the more your technique gets better, the more power you can put behind it and thus the more aggressive one can be. This is basically the same in able bodied tennis as it is in wheelchair tennis. If you are asking about how much power you can put behind a shot if you are sitting and hitting the ball at a lower angle, then I would say it’s just technique and raquet grip technique (standard vs continental). Standard means that if you are doing a backhand top spin, then its all in your wrist to gain that extra top spin. However with the continental grip, you have to work less for that backhand top spin, but the forehand contact will be different. Some players do a switch from standard to continental all the time. I have seen players shorter than I get great contact with the ball and return it with crazy speed.

Question 3: How do you use the wheelchair in my strokes? One of the first things that you learn in wheelchair tennis is the ability to push your chair WHILE holding onto a raquet. You have to learn how to use the handle to push it against the handrim of your chair while you maneuver your way around a court. Like I stated before, one has to learn to push their chair with the raquet in hand before they can start to learn strokes. Once this has been mastered, then we start to learn how fast or slow we need to be as we approach the ball to make contact. Since we need some backwards movement of the raquet to gain some power for the oncoming shot, we need to put this into the pushing movement. The better the player, the more they can adjust their speed and angle as they approach a shot.

With a forehand shot, you want to try and hit the ball at a 45 degree angle from your chair to the court. If you are hitting it too low and it hits the net, point this out and adjust the raquet face angle accordingly. Same thing if you are hitting too high. If you are trying to slice the ball then you might need more time and room to generate that power and raquet angle. One of the most important things to learn is how to be fluid on the court. Three pushes and a turn might be all you need to go forward, hit a shot and return to your hub. As you progress with your shots, you learn to swing through a shot and use the forward momentum to lean into a turn on your chair and get back into position for the next shot.

Social Stigmas. I personally don’t feel the social stigmas. We are all different people with different abilities. If Rafael Nadal showed up to an able bodied match, would an able bodied person playing against him feel a social stigma just because his abilities were worse than Nadal? No,they would just feel like” Oh man this guys skills are just too good” I play with a guy who is in a chair who regularly competes with 3.0-3.5 players in a few leagues. He is just that good.

Are there people out there who see a person with a disability and automatically make assumptions? Heck yeah. But you know what? We all do this disabled or not. Some of the assumptions might even be correct, while others are waay off base. This is one of the reasons we have this Non profit called TIES in Sacramento. We want to try and break down barriers. One example of this in action was this: We have a weekly league set up in late summer where it’s an up/down league. 3 weeks into it, we had as able-bodied player show up late and say something like “Well, I had to come from my JOB had responsibilities that I needed to take care of” We kind of laughed at him and said “Well, you know, John, I work as a network systems analyst for UCDavis and I had to travel 30 more minutes than you did to get here”. John had made the assumption that people in chairs were all on disability and that we had nothing else to do in our lives. He noted this and changed his attitude for the rest of the league. Over the course of the 9 week league, we became good friends with the UP players and were cracking all sorts of jokes ( even disabled ones) with each other cause that’s what friends do.

This is basically the same in able bodied tennis as it is in wheelchair tennis. If you are asking about how much power you can put behind a shot if you are sitting and hitting the ball at a lower angle, then I would say it’s just technique and raquet grip technique (standard vs continental). Standard means that if you are doing a backhand top spin, then its all in your wrist to gain that extra top spin. However with the continental grip, you have to work less for that backhand top spin, but the forehand contact will be different. Some players do a switch from standard to continental all the time. I have seen players shorter than I get great contact with the ball and return it with crazy speed.

Question 3: How do you use the wheelchair in my strokes? One of the first things that you learn in wheelchair tennis is the ability to push your chair WHILE holding onto a raquet. You have to learn how to use the handle to push it against the handrim of your chair while you maneuver your way around a court. Like I stated before, one has to learn to push their chair with the raquet in hand before they can start to learn strokes. Once this has been mastered, then we start to learn how fast or slow we need to be as we approach the ball to make contact. Since we need some backwards movement of the raquet to gain some power for the oncoming shot, we need to put this into the pushing movement. The better the player, the more they can adjust their speed and angle as they approach a shot.

With a forehand shot, you want to try and hit the ball at a 45 degree angle from your chair to the court. If you are hitting it too low and it hits the net, point this out and adjust the raquet face angle accordingly. Same thing if you are hitting too high. If you are trying to slice the ball then you might need more time and room to generate that power and raquet angle. One of the most important things to learn is how to be fluid on the court. Three pushes and a turn might be all you need to go forward, hit a shot and return to your hub. As you progress with your shots, you learn to swing through a shot and use the forward momentum to lean into a turn on your chair and get back into position for the next shot.

Social Stigmas. I personally don’t feel the social stigmas. We are all different people with different abilities. If <PERSON> showed up to an able bodied match, would an able bodied person playing against him feel a social stigma just because his abilities were worse than <PERSON>? No,they would just feel like” Oh man this guys skills are just too good” I play with a guy who is in a chair who regularly competes with 3.0-3.5 players in a few leagues. He is just that good.

Are there people out there who see a person with a disability and automatically make assumptions? Heck yeah. But you know what? We all do this disabled or not. Some of the assumptions might even be correct, while others are waay off base. This is one of the reasons we have this Non profit called TIES in <LOCATION>. We want to try and break down barriers. One example of this in action was this: We have a weekly league set up in late summer where it’s an up/down league. 3 weeks into it, we had as able-bodied player show up late and say something like “Well, I had to come from my JOB had responsibilities that I needed to take care of” We kind of laughed at him and said “Well, you know, John, I work as a network systems analyst for UCDavis and I had to travel 30 more minutes than you did to get here”. <PERSON> had made the assumption that people in chairs were all on disability and that we had nothing else to do in our lives. He noted this and changed his attitude for the rest of the league. Over the course of the 9 week league, we became good friends with the <LOCATION> players and were cracking all sorts of jokes ( even disabled ones) with each other cause that’s what friends do.

Well I need to get some sleep, I hope this answers some questions for ya, I am always looking for an opportunity to inform and educate and share.

Is he a film buff? Old movie posters or set props are great (if you can find them).

620,"If you haven’t already, please read the [whole blog post]( http://www.lflegal.com/2016/12/60-minutes/) that is the topic of this thread. The author is a real disabilities lawyer, not a shyster or a “shitheel”. She does an excellent job of addressing why the segment was discriminatory and misleading and did a disservice to people with disabilities and the ADA. 

In response to the specifics of your post, the segment starts with the Cooper saying “The Americans with Disabilities Act”, and the whole segment resolves around supposed abuses of the ADA. I think that qualifies the segment as being as much about the ADA and people with disabilities, as about general abuses of the legal system. 

But really, this segment was in reality a piece of Republican / Conservative / [Objectivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand) fan fiction, with the usual cast of characters. It includes the poor, innocent, hard working business owners being victimized by greedy, unscrupulous lawyers and well meaning but unjust federal overreach. People with disabilities’ role in the segment were cast in the usual stereotypes. We are portrayed as incompetent, bumbling, “takers” who are being victimized by all sides, but who deserve no real stake in the issue. 

They even found a disabled person to promote the idea that maybe enforcing compliance with ADA does people with disabilities a disservice because it might make business owners wary of people with disabilities. A business owner being wary of an individual because of a common characteristic they share with millions of others is definitely bigoted and possibly illegal too. A fair segment would have featured someone with a disability to point out that not all (and likely few) people with disabilities, their families and advocates’ would agree with that man’s position.  

As [https://www.reddit.com/user/UserNme_AlreadyTaken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand) stated below, “If businesses know they'll get a warning first, there's no incentive for them to comply with the law prior to the warning.” I think that’s a very good reason why the certified letter approach you mentioned is inadequate as a solution to drive-by lawsuits. Besides, who’s going to pay the $10 for each letter? That adds up pretty quickly if you consider the tens of thousands of ADA violators that still exist.  

In your second paragraph, you stated: “Instead of railing about 60 minutes, talk to advocacy groups about a workable solution to shut these ‘shitheels’ down”.  I think it's fair to add non-compliant businesses to the list of “shitheels"" Then you’re not blaming the real victim, this is, people with disabilities. Also, it’s possible both “rail” against and advocate for out civil rights, if one wanted too. That’s what I’m trying to do. 

Since I have a different interpretation of the identity of the real “shitheels” in this situation, I’m advocating for strengthening civil rights laws for people with disabilities at both the state and federal levels, despite a minuscule chance that the laws might be abused. Historically, people with disabilities have suffered most of the abuse, we deserve a break. Besides, this forum is for discussing (or as you characterized it, “railing”) about disability issues, isn’t it? I think these discussions are a healthy thing for at least some of us here on reddit in the disabilities forum.

While the ADA is referred to over and over as the law that causes these lawsuits, Mr. Cooper briefly states at the beginning of the segment “you might think you have to be a customer of a business to file a lawsuit against it, but in some STATES you don’t”. He concludes the segment with “In places like California and Florida there’s little doubt that disability lawsuits have lead to improved access. Most states and the District of Columbia currently award cash damages for plaintiffs who file such lawsuits, and with so many businesses around the country still not in compliance, it may not be long before you start hearing about these kinds of lawsuits in a town or city near you.” 

I interpret Mr. Cooper’s statements as an admission that he and 60 Minutes knew that the ADA itself didn’t cause these lawsuits.  Rather they knew it was the individual states interpretations of the ADA, or those states having civil rights laws that more strictly prohibit discrimination against and enforce the rights of people with disabilities. That is the real issue and what purportedly opened the door to these so-called abuses. Ninety-nine percent of the segment blamed the ADA for something adjudicated at the state level. But under the current administration and our country's current populist streak, you don't dare imply it could be related to ""state's rights"", those are now more sacred than anything federal.

They also failed to mention that Federal ADA enforcement regulations allow for a [mediation process]( https://www.ada.gov/mediate.htm) that provides a quick and effective way to resolve ADA complaints while minimizing the legal costs, time and other expenses for business owners who are charged with a violation (the mediators are supplied to both parties free of charge). Only a very small fraction of complaints to the ADA division of the Department of Justice ever result in federal suits under the ADA. 

As the lawyer mentions in her blog post, the 60 Minutes ADA piece was a portion of an 18 month old segment she participated in that was intended to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the ADA. She mentions that they had plenty of footage to fairly represent people with disabilities stake in the issue and the invaluable progress that the ADA has provided to us. CBS chose not to use it. Instead they used a real story to produce a fairy tale. I think that’s worth discussing and acting on.

I really think you're just jittery because you have some feelings bubbling up and you're nervous so you're just overthinking things a little. If he has problems down there, there are so many other ways of showing affection than sex. Intimacy is extremely important, just hanging out, sleeping close to each other, back rubs, head scratches, things like that. It might be beneficial for you to read up on love languages. Everyone has a preferred way of showing and receiving affection, and knowing the best way for the people you interact with is extremely emotionally rewarding. This is something that will help you in all walks of life, not just the romantic side. Some people feel love when they get gifts, some people hate gifts and only feel truly appreciated with physical contact, everyone is different. 

I think the best thing to do would be to enjoy your time with him and to not ruin anything with expectations or over analyzing. Love in my opinion is a giant spectrum and there is a completely different kind of love for every two people. It's not alway romantic, it never follows any set rules, it's just the strings that connect us all. Don't try to name it or harness it.

651,"You're perhaps just misunderstanding what I'm saying. 

I'm saying that white people are not victims of structural violence (i.e. ways in which social structures disadvantage and marginalize individuals) in any way that compares to minorities. That's what my quote refers to and that is what I was discussing. 

I'm not saying they have not been victims of crimes at an individual level or that they are not victims of the economic policies of the last few decades - of course they can be and are. This is what you're talking about and I don't disagree with that. It is not the point that I was talking about but if you want me to discuss it I would say that we can all be victims of crimes and we have all been affected by economic policies - minorities moreso. You are also talking about the media not showcasing the right wing victims of crimes perpetrated by left wing people. Perhaps that's true, it's difficult to say in the current climate of fake news to what extent it's true or not true.

But, to me, people who support Trump are not bad people because of the behaviour of a few individuals in the group who mistreat minorities (e.g. the example you gave of the Muslim woman). I don't generalize about the behaviour of a group from the violent actions of a few individuals within that group. If I thought that way I would never be able to be OK with any group of people. I base my assessment of a group on the behaviour of the group as a whole. They didn't vote for those violent individuals. But they did vote for a man who is a blatant misogynist and a bigot. They decided those things didn't matter because those things don't affect them. They decided climate change didn't matter either apparently. 

I'm sure there are liberals who think Trump supporters are awful people because of the actions of some individual supporters. But there are plenty of us who can put that aside because we know violent people exist everywhere. What we can't put aside is voting for someone who incites misogyny and bigotry.

Coming in at number 3, we have the time my geneticist suggested I shouldn't have kids becuase I would likely pass on my condition. I was so glad to have a non-trans related reason not to procreate  that it took me a while to realise how eugenecist that sounds.

And finally, in first place, my first ever faith healing. This tale involves me, a helpful (and somewhat bemused) friend, a fundie christian and a psychic. I was non-weight bearing on crutches from the injury that (finally) led to my diagnosis. I was approached by one of the campus Christians while trying to manage to summon the elevator, my friend who was with me having his hands full with food for both of us. The woman asks if she can pray for me. I figured she wanted to do so on her own time, so I agreed. She lays on hands right there and then. The usual, ""Father I lift this woman up to you..."" ensues. Fine. Every little bit helps, I figured at that point. I really wanted my leg to stop hurting. She finished up, and asks if it worked. By this point, the elevator has arrived, Im hungry and running out of time to eat before class, so I said yes. She tells me to walk without my crutches and tries to grab them. I tell her it isn't that much better. No word of a lie, she goes to try again. And thats when the psychic shows up to save me. He tells her it's 3% improved, which he knows because, as I mentioned, he's psychic. I took the opportunity to escape and was never able to thank my psychic saviour.

677,"Unemployment can = homelessness in the UK too. Just being disabled alone in the UK can = homelessness as I'm sure is the same in the US.

I don't know why you think I'm ""completely indifferent"" to unemployment. On what basis and with what right do you judge me for that? Do you actually know me or know what I've campaigned for or done in my life? What is it you actually want from me in order to prove I care just as much as you? Do you want me to get angry over the use of the word 'crazy' in order for you to feel like I care as much as you?

Here's a list of things I've done related to employment, since apparently you think you're the only person who gives a shit:

1) I have volunteered to work with severely intellectually disabled people, teaching them basic skills and coping techniques in order to help them gain access to part-time jobs. 
 
2) During my time at university, I applied for an internship and was told I was rejected because of my disability. I threatened to make it public and I was told that they would give me the job to keep me quiet. I rejected the job and instead filed formal complaints. Why? Because I didn't want disabled people after me to have to face the same discrimination.

3) I pushed at university for better attitudes and provisions for people with mental health problems so that they could finish their degrees even if it took them longer than other people - because I recognize you likely need a degree to gain employment. These provisions existed for physically disabled students and those with intellectual disabilities but not for those with severe depression, anxiety or other mental health problems.

4) At my current institution I am the equality and diversity officer. Currently I'm working on a proposal with some others to provide specialist careers advice services to those with disabilities.


Just because I don't go around shouting that I've done X, Y and Z to try to help a cause, doesn't mean I'm indifferent. It's very rude and presumptive of you to think so. Just because I care deeply for other causes too, like access to health and social care, doesn't mean I don't care about other issues too.

Do you actually know me or know what I've campaigned for or done in my life? What is it you actually want from me in order to prove I care just as much as you? Do you want me to get angry over the use of the word 'crazy' in order for you to feel like I care as much as you?

Here's a list of things I've done related to employment, since apparently you think you're the only person who gives a shit:

1) I have volunteered to work with severely intellectually disabled people, teaching them basic skills and coping techniques in order to help them gain access to part-time jobs. 
 
2) During my time at university, I applied for an internship and was told I was rejected because of my disability. I threatened to make it public and I was told that they would give me the job to keep me quiet. I rejected the job and instead filed formal complaints. Why? Because I didn't want disabled people after me to have to face the same discrimination.

3) I pushed at university for better attitudes and provisions for people with mental health problems so that they could finish their degrees even if it took them longer than other people - because I recognize you likely need a degree to gain employment. These provisions existed for physically disabled students and those with intellectual disabilities but not for those with severe depression, anxiety or other mental health problems.

4) At my current institution I am the equality and diversity officer. Currently I'm working on a proposal with some others to provide specialist careers advice services to those with disabilities.


Just because I don't go around shouting that I've done X, Y and Z to try to help a cause, doesn't mean I'm indifferent. It's very rude and presumptive of you to think so. Just because I care deeply for other causes too, like access to health and social care, doesn't mean I don't care about other issues too. And finally, just because we have different ways of tackling the discrimination we see in front of us, doesn't make your way right and my way wrong and it doesn't mean that we don't want the same things.","[{'start': 149, 'end': 159, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 88, 'end': 98, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 39, 'end': 49, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

726,"It would be helpful if you could post a pic or the make/model of the chair, but in general here are my suggestions. 

Being too tippy forwards is a result of a wheel base that's too short - the small front wheels (casters) are too close to the centre of gravity, so it pushes over the front wheels when he encounters even a small bump. This is the kind of adjustment the chair distributor/dealer should have done and despite my suggestions, I'd advise you find a full service wheelchair dealer and repair place and pay an hour's labour to have it done. There's a lot you can mess up by doing these adjustments without the necessary experience. In a pinch, a bike shop might also be able to help. 

Fuck your insurance for not bothering to make sure he has a chair that fits him. It really matters as far as the usability and safety of his chair. 

Generally the way to fix it is to make the wheelbase bigger, distributing the weight over a larger area. That's why the Freewheel would work, extending the wheel base significantly, away from the centre of gravity. Free wheel isn't a great option as you mentioned, and it can be inconvenient in a lot of everyday circumstances. 

- if your husband's chair has adjustable caster housings (the pieces the front wheels are mounted into that clamp onto the frame of the chair) then move them forward as much as possible. Often this isn't that far but even an inch would probably help. 

-larger, softer casters (are about $125-250/pair) will reduce the lever that causes small bumps to tip the chair forward.  

- if the chair allows a seat length adjustment from the seat back (i.e. At the butt end of the seat) - try extending the seat length a bit to move some weight backwards. 

- a cheap but bad way to do it is to get a 5lb leg weight and Velcro it to the axle bar (that runs between the two large wheels). This isn't a great option because a heavier chair is hard on the user and the helpers. 

- if the seat has angle adjustment, try adding seat dump (lower the rear of the seat somewhat), which lowers the centre of gravity making the weight of the user less likely to pivot over those small bumps and tip forward.",,,,jocelynlt,,,1482879283,t5_2qhe8,t3_5klslw,t3_5klslw,4,1484085428,0,0,dbp0ytf,disability,,,,,

If you cannot see how it affects employment, then we must agree to disagree. This is the issue, you do not see it.  

However, where in your statement did you agree with the unemployment issues. 

&gt;Sure, I don't disagree with what you're saying in principle. Fighting ableism and discrimination is important, in all forms. Whether that be fighting to keep and improve assistance programmes or fighting to change the way people perceive and talk about us. In reality I know I can't always win on both though, so I pick what matters to me most and that's my survival and freedom - both of which are based on legislation. If someone wants to call me a welfare scrounger or a cripple or mentally unstable or say I should be euthanized or whatever then I'm not going to like that and of course I will fight against it but there's not an awful lot I can do about it and my energy might be best spent elsewhere.
Honestly though, I'm not 100% convinced that saying Trump might have a personality disorder is super ableist and offensive. I mean the man ticks all the antisocial personality disorder boxes and is a massive narcissist. Psychologists have even commented on this. I'm not a psychologist or a doctor so I wouldn't make assumptions but I can see why other people might be tempted to based on his behaviour. I can see why saying his supporters need mental help could be considered ableist though - the assumption that they are ""crazy"" rather than uneducated, morally bankrupt and selfish. That I understand.

Dear Mr. Cooper
I’m gondomondo, a 55 year old man who has used a wheelchair since I was 20. Also, for the past 21 years I’ve worked with hundreds of people with a wide variety of disabilities. I’m writing to you regarding your 60 Minutes segment regarding ADA Compliance and frivolous lawsuits. 

I’m a fan of you Mr. Cooper. I make the following statements with respect.

People with disabilities, their families, and advocates fought hard to get the ADA passed. For us it was like the Civil Rights Act for people of color, or more recently, the ruling by the Supreme Court that allowed any loving couple to marry. In my world, it’d a pretty big deal. 

I disagree with the tactics used by these lawyers, but I’m very concerned that your piece might provide ammunition for business owners and their political allies to roll back the rights of people with disabilities. Here are some things that I’d hope you’d consider, for the future, when covering people with disabilities and their rights under the ADA. 

It’s unfortunate that business owners might have to incur an expense to provide us with the same rights of access as other Americans. But your segment ignored the fact that the majority of ADA accommodations cost very little to implement. 

Yes, there are a lot of pages in the ADA. However, you ignored another side of the issue, that is, that any decent contractor should be able inspect a business and help that business be compliant. There are also resources all over the internet that businesses can use to self-inspect. 

You primarily portrayed the business owners as the victims of the greedy lawyers and poorly written federal legislation. Having had 25 years to get it right, these non-compliant business owners and their landlords are primarily victims of their own ignorance and neglect. 

Suppose you and your 60 Minutes crew were approached to do a segment on some business owners who were refusing service to Muslim people. Let’s say you allowed them to state to your viewers that no Muslims ever come in their business, and assert that their business might lose money from any of its bigoted customers who didn’t like Muslims. Wouldn’t you want to immediately confront them on their ignorance and bigotry? Might you make their bigotry  the focus of your segment? Would you even want to report on that? Replace the word Muslim with the phrase “person with disabilities”. I think the same considerations apply. 

Or perhaps you were approached to do a segment on a business owner who refused to comply with fire codes, because he’d never had a fire? Would you provide oxygen to that business owner’s position that fire codes are an unnecessary and exorbitantly expensive without confronting his ignorance forcefully and directly?

There are no ADA police or ADA inspectors actively seeking out violators. Lawsuits like you documented in your segment are the only way to get non-compliant businesses to change. While the lawyers you featured may be bottom feeders, perhaps sometimes, after a couple decades of neglect, the bottom needs a little cleaning up. 

Thank you for your time Mr. Cooper. 

With respect,

gondomondo

People with disabilities, their families, and advocates fought hard to get the ADA passed. For us it was like the Civil Rights Act for people of color, or more recently, the ruling by the Supreme Court that allowed any loving couple to marry. In my world, it’d a pretty big deal. 

I disagree with the tactics used by these lawyers, but I’m very concerned that your piece might provide ammunition for business owners and their political allies to roll back the rights of people with disabilities. Here are some things that I’d hope you’d consider, for the future, when covering people with disabilities and their rights under the ADA. 

It’s unfortunate that business owners might have to incur an expense to provide us with the same rights of access as other Americans. But your segment ignored the fact that the majority of ADA accommodations cost very little to implement. 

Yes, there are a lot of pages in the ADA. However, you ignored another side of the issue, that is, that any decent contractor should be able inspect a business and help that business be compliant. There are also resources all over the internet that businesses can use to self-inspect. 

You primarily portrayed the business owners as the victims of the greedy lawyers and poorly written federal legislation. Having had 25 years to get it right, these non-compliant business owners and their landlords are primarily victims of their own ignorance and neglect. 

Suppose you and your 60 Minutes crew were approached to do a segment on some business owners who were refusing service to Muslim people. Let’s say you allowed them to state to your viewers that no Muslims ever come in their business, and assert that their business might lose money from any of its bigoted customers who didn’t like Muslims. Wouldn’t you want to immediately confront them on their ignorance and bigotry? Might you make their bigotry  the focus of your segment? Would you even want to report on that? Replace the word Muslim with the phrase “person with disabilities”. I think the same considerations apply. 

Or perhaps you were approached to do a segment on a business owner who refused to comply with fire codes, because he’d never had a fire? Would you provide oxygen to that business owner’s position that fire codes are an unnecessary and exorbitantly expensive without confronting his ignorance forcefully and directly?

There are no ADA police or ADA inspectors actively seeking out violators. Lawsuits like you documented in your segment are the only way to get non-compliant businesses to change. While the lawyers you featured may be bottom feeders, perhaps sometimes, after a couple decades of neglect, the bottom needs a little cleaning up. 

Thank you for your time Mr. <PERSON>. 

With respect,

gondomondo

786,"How many years have you worked so far? If you've worked 3 or more years in total, you will be eligible for SSD, not SSI. 

I am deaf and have worked a total of 9 years, until 5 years ago up til now, I couldn't even find a job anywhere (long story) so they put me on SSD due to my work history. 

My wife has not worked more than 3 years so she got SSI before we got married. 

This is what the people at the office told us in two different states and I think this has been mentioned on the SSA website. 

Chances are, you may be switched over to SSD. Also I've asked many people at the SSA office what SSDI is and all of them said they don't know what that is or have heard of it, yet some deaf friends of mine said they get SSDI. So I have no idea what SSDI stands for because I never got an answer from anyone at the office. 

But to give you an idea of what you may be asked, you may be asked about your disability, any documents to back up your disability and if approved, they will ask you how much you pay on a monthly basis toward your housing and utilities. You may also be qualified for food stamp if your income from SSA is not enough to meet your needs so food stamp will add some relief on your grocery shopping. 

Also if you qualify for SSI, chances are you will receive Medicaid. If you qualify for SSD, you will receive Medicare. 

That's all I can give you for now.

EDIT: They may ask you to go to their doctors for an examination for your condition then they will submit their findings to SSA for review then they will determine whether to approve or deny your case. I had to go to their audiologist for a hearing test to prove that I do have hearing loss and they confirmed it.

Do you know if you have enough work history to be insured for SSDI? If not you can create a mySocialSecurity account online and they will tell you. If you aren't qualified you can only apply for SSI, and for that you would have to give up your job because the income would reduce your benefits to a very small amount. I would actually say that if you're applying (to either SSI or SSDI) that you quit your job. It is very difficult to get approved if you're working because it goes against the narrative of you being disabled.  If that job was difficult for you to come by I would strongly consider whether it would be worth giving up that job to apply for something that you have, maybe a 10% chance of getting.

796,"edit: Random thoughts, and some practical suggestions below. After a moment's it sounds like you're getting the wrong accomidation. You need a proper stenographer, not just someone to replace your hands for typing. If you were doing random office work, what you have might do, but writing contracts you need a professional.  


Sounds like your typist sucking is the main problem. While not the massively complex skill, being typist (especially taking dictation) is not something that just a random person that can type will be any good at. There's a reason stenographers get pay decent money.

As you've noticed good spelling/grammar is important but as a certain level of mental separate from the words. You type what you hear, regardless if it's wrong, or you think better, etc. 

Given the circumstances, I realize you may not be to tell HR this guy sucks replace him. 

One setup that people that do this professionally use (no idea what set up use) is that for something you want typed up you record it and give the recording to the typist. The typist then sit downs and types it up from that recording, a setup that lets them pause/rewind the recording with a foot petal is standard for medicial transcriptionists. 

Part of the reason for this setup (beyond no slow you down, and giving the typist the ability to rewind parts and slow down as needed) is that when they are down typing a document, they can 'proofread' it.

Sounds like one thing that would help is when reading a document they typed if you find something where they completely changed your wording, reject the entire outright and tell them to do the whole thing over. If they won't give what you need (a proper stenographer) you'll have to train what have to be one.  ",,,,dnabre,,,1480812244,t5_2qhe8,t3_5gb53z,t3_5gb53z,4,1483454014,0,0,dar71pf,disability,,,,,
