1,"It sucks how people focus on abled parents over Disabled parents (I know depression is a Disability, I'm talking in general).

While it seems like you want to live a fulfilling, independent life *despite* your SMA II (am I getting this right?) and I want to have my Autism, ADHD, and OCD accepted as part of who I am, I can otherwise relate.

It sucks that I am a lower-middle-class teenager in a world not built for my needs. It sucks that people with SMA II don't have caregivers to tend to their needs. It sucks that a lot of rich and upper-middle-class people can't handle that they don't have a ""perfect"" child and kill us.

I also get you about being considered ""unable"" rather than Disabled, being viewed as ""vegetables.""

Despite the huge differences in our Disabilities, I think Disabled groups should unite into one pan-Disability identity. Ableism is ableism, whether you have SMA II, are Autistic, are Bipolar, have Down syndrome, or have epilepsy. I think the underlying assumption among many different forms of ableism is that our lives suck.",,,,AccountHaver25,"I would *not* cure my Autism, ADHD, or OCD if I could",,1448569616,t5_2qhe8,t3_3u7vgl,t1_cxdwa6i,1,1450038924,0,0,cxe0u23,disability,1,,,,

3,"I agree that rallying support is good.  However I think that going after the label/ venue industry is too broad, and it doesn't focus attention on the perpetuates of the creation of inaccessible environments.  It might be best to contact individual venues and point out the flaws in writing and document their responses or the lack thereof and then if the accessibility issues persist, filing a complaint with the Department of Justice for an ADA violation seems like the next logical step.

&amp;nbsp;

This is something that I would do myself with the venue I've had an issue with if I went to more of these kinds of events.  As of now I'm about to move so going through that process with that venue would take too much of my time.  However when I get where I'm going I would likely pursue this action if I ran into these issues.  I think the trick is handling it on a venue by venue basis.  I wouldn't even be surprised if some of the places are just unaware of the accessibility issues they cause and many would likely be happy to accommodate and change their policies.  I find that when you engage in friendly discussion by pointing out the issues places tend to be more happy to work with you, ~~rather than trying to bring an unannounced wave of anger over a policy they may have not even been aware was causing members of the disabled community issues.~~ *rather than bringing what they may perceive as an unannounced, unexpected, wave of anger on their business for something they may have not been aware of.  This is not to say that people shouldn't have the right to speak out against what is clearly wrong with regards to accessibility, but it's also important to remember that psychologically people are defensive of the things they like, basically it's important to tread lightly in order to get the best result.*

&amp;nbsp;

4,"I have amended my previous statement with better wording.  Basically I think that venues that are out of ADA compliance need to get it together.  I am very for ADA compliance and as we approach 2016 I think that situations where people are being charged extra for accessible seating and parking is beyond absurd.  It's more of a matter of approaching the problem in a way that will make the venue owners feel comfortable.  I don't think anyone would like large amounts of public scrutiny, and for venues that haven't been given enough time and advanced notice that they are out of compliance it may be startling.  For owners that remain in blatant violation I am all for public awareness of the issue, but I personally believe that should be a last ditch effort since the internet has a way of getting quite mean quickly without understanding the full story.

I hope I worded that better than I did last time.  This is good stuff to think about though, and definitely important.",,,,geoffisblind,Legally Blind (Low Vision),,1448744727,t5_2qhe8,t3_3uk4jt,t1_cxg0lua,2,1450086933,0,0,cxg22ux,disability,2,,,,

52,"First - sounds like an interesting documentary, hope you get the info you need.

Just want to point something out though - the hearts and minds of the British public have not necessarily changed for the better as a result of the games. The Paralympics in the UK were a wonderful spectacle for all of a few weeks and there are of course many positives to them. However, such events frequently focus on a certain ""type"" of disability and are often used as an example to shame or stigmatize those with other disabilities whilst simultaneously not addressing the real issues that disabled people face every day. There's an atmosphere of ""If you just tried hard enough, if you fought hard enough, you could achieve things on a similar scale to these athletes"". Except not all of us can be athletes, not all of us want to be athletes either. It rightly highlights the achievements of some but it also serves to reinforce stereotypes about others. That's a bit of an aside though.

What I really wanted to say is the following:

- London is still hugely inaccessible, especially now that there is no longer a spotlight on it. I lived in Athens during the Athens paralympics. I can tell you that Athens is just as accessible as London, despite the fact that having a disability in Greece basically means you'll never have any kind of life whatsoever. Only a quarter of tube stations in London are accessible, housing is also still a massive problem for some disabled individuals. It's completely unacceptable to me that such a rich, developed and supposedly progressive country can be comparable to a place like Athens.

- Disabled people across the UK have been subject to some of the harshest cuts to their welfare support in the last few years. Most of this has occurred quietly as the public turns a blind eye or feeds into the lies that we are all benefit scroungers. Recently, some of these cuts have been linked to poor mental health outcomes and suicides by researchers.

People talk about the paralympics as though the disabled community was done some massive favour by the government and the public.

56,"To be clear, are we talking that your disability was deemed retroactive to Sept 2014 yes? And is September when your check started or in your approval letter did they say something to the effect of ""the earliest date we can establish onset is 9/16/14"".  

Also, are you on just SSDI or are you on SSI too?  I'll try to go through all of the possibilities. The ONLY issue that I would see here is that if you were on SSI and you return to SGA level work prior to 12/9/16.  I am going to assume that your disability onset date is the 9/16/14 for SSDI which means that the 12 month time period has already lapsed and you should be fine. 

When in doubt (and this is just a general rule of thumb for all disability recipients) always contact SSA before you start working (or get in touch with a local benefit advisor) so that you know exactly what your rules and reporting requirements are. Too often people think that SSA just magically knows when you return to work and how much money you  make. While eventually we do get that information it can take years before we realize that you shouldn't have been getting benefits and then you end up in an overpayment situation and/or your benefits could be ceased. SSA really does have a lot of programs in place to encourage working (and I anticipate those to only increase as the budget worsens) but you just need to make sure that you fully understand everything first.

As for the EPE; that is just another work incentive that SSA has. Its essentially 36 months after you've used up your TWP where your SSDI reinstatement is quick and easy (well at least by government standards).

67,"Right now businesses have an affirmative obligation to make readily achievable changes to improve accessibility. I get that litigation is expensive for property owners and businesses, but adding a notice requirement allows them the opportunity not to fix anything, ever, until they receive a formal complaint. With this bill, they have 60 days to make any sort of response after receiving the complaint, and then an additional 120 days just to begin working on improvements.

One idea behind the ADA is to provide an integrated, inclusive setting. In other words, if you use a wheelchair, you should be able to go to a new restaurant with the expectation of being able to get in, find a table, and use the bathroom, without making formal complaints and giving 6 months notice before your visit (let alone receiving fines for misquoting the ADA!). No one really wants to make formal complaints or initiate a lawsuit just to visit a coffee shop, that just gets you the stinkeye from the owner every time you return. This bill eviscerates the ability of the ADA to enforce this goal.

Anyway, the DOJ wrote the Accessibility Guidelines to provide bright line rules regarding architectural barriers. If businesses comply with these guidelines, they have a great argument that they are generally ADA-compliant (assuming their policies and procedures are also non-discriminatory). These guidelines have also been integrated into state and local law, as well as most American building codes.

Further, if a court is worried about a particular serial litigant there are other measures in place to prevent them from filing lawsuits without leave of the court.

This bill would greatly reduce ADA lawsuits, but it would also remove any incentive to comply with Title III of the ADA (the part that deals with public accommodations).",,,,cazique,,,1447086789,t5_2qhe8,t3_3r9dqj,t3_3r9dqj,2,1449696730,0,0,cwu77fs,disability,2,,,,

I feel you. I had a '68 bug that I ""restored"" and loved. Many of my weekend adventures involved going for Sunday drives in that car. And most my friends have this iconic image of me driving that bug. 

Well during treatment for my condition I received nerve damage in my leg, losing function in my right foot. One of the hardest moments was realizing I wouldn't drive manual again (I use my left foot for the gas and break now). I put off selling that car for 3 years because it was so rough, but that caused more things to go wrong while it sit in my garage.

So just last month I finally found a new (happy) owner and said my farewell. While getting the car running and prepped for sale, I did learn I could actually drive it despite my non functioning foot, but I would be hurting the rest of the day.

Stay strong. I know how much it hurts to say farewell to driving (edit:manual). But atleast we're still able to drive. And then there's days like today where an accident caused my commute home to take 1.5hrs. If I wasn't in a comfortable car, I wouldn't have made it home.

91,"One common problem with manual chairs is that the tires pick up all sorts of disgusting junk from the ground, and these are right next to your hands. Some people even push their wheels using the tire and the pushrim when their thumbs are getting sore etc. Custom pushrims like the Natural Fit already exist to mitigate some of this. But even in those cases you still have mud and all sorts of germs being tracked up next to your hands. This gets worse in winter when salt is applied to sidewalks and it starts to build up on your cuffs absolutely ruining your garments. They make gloves and sleeves and things, but you still end up with a lot of gross stuff tracking onto your arms. 
  
Snow in general is a problem for wheelchairs and efficient mobility.

For manual wheelchairs there is usually a tradeoff that has to be made between caster size. Smaller casters are less likely to become stuck when you are in tight poorly designed spaces, though they are also more like to get stuck on cracks in the sidewalk and tip you out. Larger casters are less likely to get stuck, but end up needing more space when things are tight. 
  
Also some people have complained of problems with dog walking. Sometimes your dog will get its own idea about which direction to go and can end up tying you into knots with the leash. There is also the problem of how to efficiently push the chair while holding a leash vs. Having it tied to your chair and ceding control.

125,"Transgender means that during gestation, the fetus didn't get the right dosage and/or timing of certain hormones.

Again, the brain expects one layout but is housed in a different one. 

Being male or female is much more complicated than just having a penis or a vagina, or XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes. For example, there is a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome.

133,"I was disabled before the age of 18, so things are so much worse for me.. The answer to whether employers consider ""disability"" part of diversity hiring is complicated. Effectively yes but it's somewhat in its own group o classification. There are *far* more incentives to hire a disabled vet than for just hiring someone who is disabled. For one ""veteran"" and ""disabled"" are both considered protected classes by the federal government. In much the same way religion, gender, and race can't be used as determining factors in hiring or firing (people still do it, but it's a very high bar to prove you were discriminated against based on one of these factors.).

When it comes to statistics, people who were disabled before the age of 18 are one of the absolute worst categories for employment. The way our systems set up VR systems only help people who have enough of their own money to chip in towards an employment outcome.

145,"You father can still work and be on disability but he would have to drop down to less than SGA levels (around $1000) per month net in order to qualify.  I highly recommend that he stop working completely while he is applying. I only say that because it is a ""stronger"" disability case since someone still doing labor at ~20 hours per week is not as believable as someone who is not working at all.  However, if financially that is not possible then just make sure he is below that SGA number. 

At age 60 with only labor work and only a high school education I would say that, assuming the medical records support his statements, he would have an extremely high chance of being approved benefits on the first try. Some will suggest getting a lawyer but I wouldn't, at least not initially. At the initial level lawyers do not really do anything that will help his case. In my experience a lot of lawyers will actually hinder cases at the first two levels of adjudication in order to maximize their payout--but I digress.  As long as your dad can understand the paperwork/process (or have you help him; he can add you as an 'authorized third party' on the application) he will be fine. Most of the paperwork is not difficult to complete.  There is no sense giving a lawyer $6000 when they aren't going to actually do any of the work for you. 

I do hope your dad takes care of himself and applies for benefits. He is the type of person that the system is designed to help. And there is no ""partial disability"" he will either get it or he won't. Again, he sounds like a very strong (I would say 80-90%) just based on your information. I would not recommend trying to ""stick it out"" until he can take early SSA retirement. If he gets on disability he will get more money than early retirement and then it will automatically be transitioned to retirement benefits when he reaches full retirement age.

148,"Working while on dissability is possible, but there are limits on the monthly income you can earn. That sits at somewhere around $1000 right now. Having very clear doctor support will help a lot in filing for disability.

I'd recommend finding a local lawyer who deals with disability. There are federal regulations covering what a lawyer can charge. Most important part of those regulations is that they aren't allowed to charge anything upfront. Instead, they get paid if you get approved. The pay comes from the backpay a client is entitled to (backpay being the monthly payments since the persons last substantially gainful job). The limit is set at a maximum of 25% of the backpay, with a maximum of $6000 total.

Most lawyers do a consultation visit first where they'll ask a barrage of questions before deciding to take the case.

Finally my mom told her, ""Fine, you can't leave the house, or even your room, and can't have sleepovers, or go to parties, or have physical hobbies -- just like your sister."" I think that shut her up a little, but maturity did the most of it. I genuinely wasn't spoiled, but I was definitely treated differently because I had to be.

I'm very selective with who I ask for help from.

161,"I've been on SSI since I was eighteen, and I know SSDI is different. I'm not sure which you're planning on applying for, but I'll explain the difference as I've understood it.

SSI (Suplimental security income) is for people who have never worked, or haven't paid enough into social security to qualify for SSDI. I was found to be legally blind at age eleven, and have only held one part-time job since, so I get SSI.

SSDI is for people who have paid enough into social security (through their taxes on their paystubs) that they qualify for SSDI income.

I'm not sure about SSI, since I'm not on it, but SSI is reduced by sources of income. Because you're married to her, your income will count against how much SSI will give out.

Every single thing we do in life is circumstance dependent. What is in the best interests of one person is not in the best interests of another. There are people who are brain dead, or close enough there to that carers have to make a best decision. For them decisions sometimes have to be made, and as someone that has to make those decisions, it pains me - I've cried and ranted and stressed over every decision my family and her doctors have made regarding her care. 

Disability care has a scope, and everyone needs to be aware of how big that scope is. There are folks who are disabled who we will never know are disabled, and live wonderfully independent lives. There are folks midway, who just need a hand here or there, and there are folks who will need care, and decisions made for them every single step of the way.

Beyond that I don't have much useful advice.  I wear a $15 hoodie and $2 hat all winter long.  I'm paralyzed from the chest down and use a manual chair.  I can only feel a third of my body, and unless I'm snowmobiling or ice fishing, the only time I spend outside in the winter is going to and from my car.  Or out for a 5-minute cigarette.

I've lived in North Dakota all my life so I am used to the cold.  

I hate winter jackets because they're big and bulky.  I bought one 4 years ago and have probably worn it 3 times since.  They bunch up, are uncomfortable, rub against your tires, and push the side-guards out.  My $15 hoodie from Old Navy gives me much better mobility.

The first step is knowing you want a job/career/self employed and then setting goals for it. Can you physically do the work? Can you manage your medications and handle the stress from a job. After that get with your doctor on what he can help you with. 

Third get in touch with ticket to work doing this third will help out because you will know you are ready willing and able you will have what the doctor says you need and they will be impressed with your drive. Many people come to them say I want a job then realize they cannot handle it.

204,"Not a wheelchair user, but in case no one else has info on SF, I thought I'd throw in some observations. In SF, pretty much all buildings open to the public have ramps. Private houses for rent often have a full flight of stairs to the front door though, due to the hills and the high density. Crowd density varies by neighborhood and time of day, but overall it's not nearly as bad as NYC.

BART (the subway for the greater Bay Area) and MUNI (the within-SF public transit) both have occasional issues with elevators at stations being down for repairs, but MUNI only has a handful of stations in their light rail system that require elevators, whereas BART has elevators for all of them.

Lawyers cannot vary their charges for SS claims. It is statutory and mandated by congress. The 25% or $6000 of the outcome if the attorney wins is standard. The $6,000 cap is removed if it goes to Federal Court or Appeals Council. 

Those ""expenses"" are typically reserved for collecting medical records and copying costs. Our contract just says clients must reimburse us for ""reasonable expense."" We explain what the expenses are in person. I take notes typically if clients are concerned with expenses being too high. For those concerned clients we call them and let them know when we are spending money on records and copying. 

What state are you in? 

I do not think this sounds unreasonable, because lawyers get screwed when clients fire them and they handle the case for a year and a half. I kind of wish we had that clause so clients would not back out and screw us over, but I do understand your concern. 

We eat these ""expenses"" if we loose. This is standard and most NOSSCR members use the same form contract.

219,"Not true at all. 

I can offer though some reasons why she thought that was true. Generally the SSA exam (known as a CE) is the last step so likely you'll get your letter (award or denial) about 4-6 weeks after your exam. The prescription for the walker may have helped her depending on her age and other impairments but having a walker (or crutches, cane, or other assistive-device) is not going to automatically qualify someone for disability.

If you do have a legit prescription for the walker I would, though, recommend that you take it along. Likely it is in your  medical records from that provider but you never know. All too often (and I'm talking like I see it 1-2x/day) people will come to these exams stating that their doctor prescribed the cane/crutch/brace/wheelchair/etc but there is no record of it in file so we cannot use that information. 

Showing up to an exam with these devices is one of the most common ways that people try to defraud social security which is why having a documented prescription for a device is important. I have seen people who show up to exams with the price tag still on their brand-new cane, walk with the cane on the wrong side, show up in a wheelchair that they rented, and all sorts of other behavior. Often times doctors/office workers will observe people when they are in the waiting room and the parking lot (if they can see from the windows) to see if their behavior changes. I remember one guy who said he couldn't get out of his wheelchair (and refused to try during the exam) but when he left the building he hopped right up, folded up the chair, and carried it to his car.

232,"Married, debilitatingly disabled mother of 3 here. Let me tell you how we are getting by. I qualify for nothing. 100% nothing. I was self employed with so many tax deductions that I had little to no tax liability, which I was young enough to not realize meant I would never qualify for SSI or SSDI if that happened. So. I started back up my cleaning business. I suffered the pain for a few weeks to train an employee who would be responsible for training employees. I can now (mostly) run this business from the couch. Well,  I have an office, but my ""desk"" chair is a recliner because when I flare, my spine does not bend. 

This is how we survive. I also started up a small, informal drug test company. It's growing, but the advertising is a little more tricky for this business, so it's slower income than the cleaning business. 

I also spent umpteen hours hooking up with wholesale websites and buy things cheap (usually liquidation lots) and resell them on craigslist, facebook yardsale sites, and amazon. 

Another thing I do, is I make holiday crafts and offer them out on the yardsale facebook pages. The fuzzy sock snowman costs me $3 to make and I can get $10 for them usually. I can usually sell several a day, but as the popularity of those yardsale pages grows, it seems to grow my sales as well...

The problem is that there isn't very much of it, and those that I have tried to follow up on have been problematic for various reasons.

I suffer anxiety disorder, but have found with help from a cousin of mine that I'm actually very good at technical copy editing and that a person can actually make a decent living doing this provided that they have the education that opens the doors in this field. This is the one thing I've been able to do that has not failed miserably. All of my other jobs have failed because my anxiety can result in insomnia and irregular sleep pattern, which eventually results in my getting fired within a few months of hire due to health related attendance issues or actually falling asleep on the job. Jobs with regular hours simply do not work for me.

But 3 finger salute, you say, there's a job you say that you can do and that you are doing, what's the problem? The problem is that I do not have the qualifications to do this job even though I am exceptionally good at it, if my cousin isn't simply humoring me. The problem is that I cannot get signed up for the freelancing agencies by which I could acquire more editing work without a degree. I have to rely on my cousin to give me what is essentially his overflow work, and the amount of money I have made doing this for the year - and I've only been doing this since spring 2015 - is probably not even enough to be taxed. 

I have been hesitant to go back to school because it would nix my SSI appeal and I do not know if it would even be financially possible with a full Pell Grant, but just today I ran across something that I hadn't seen before in my attempt to find self-sufficiency despite disability: PASS. Plans for Achieving Self-Support. 

https://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-11017.pdf 

The pamphlet makes it sound like setting up a plan with Social Security's input could actually result in SSI being rewarded as a part of the Plan. If this was possible, it would be amazing. A full Pell Grant would only cover half the cost of on-campus housing, and due to my anxiety condition, living on campus would be a necessity. Easy access to disability services and other resources, no troubles of dealing with the horrid traffic and parking situations at the Uni here. Now, Social Security might just decide that my ""career goal"" is high apple pies in the sky. Simply put, writing and editing is something I can do well. Deadline-based assignments are something I can actually demonstrably do under the constraints of my disability. I just don't have the qualifications to do it on my own. If there was some program that could foot the bill for a year of academic expenses, I could complete my BA and have the qualifications I need to do the thing I know I can do and get out of my parent's house.

The total suspicion and disbelief of the admin judge of the severity of my condition is despair-inducing. It is also very ironic because the State of Washington, where I live, does recognize that I have a disability and provides ABD and SNAP so that I can have some extremely limited autonomy under my parent's roof. I have autism spectrum anxiety disorder (formerly classified as Aspergers Syndrome under the DSM), depression, and chronic insomnia. None of these things on their own is very severe, but add them all up and they can be overwhelming. Being told by so many people in my life that ""I'm not trying hard enough"" and to essentially also be told that by a Fedral SSI judge... it's enough to make me borderline suicidal. Seriously.

261,"The Department of Labor instituted a new policy this year that requires employers with federal contracts to meet a quota of disabled employees. This is only enforced when said employer has been found negligent on other policies.

Supposedly there are a large number of employers trying to attract disabled employees for this reason. I decided to test this by applying to employers through an agency with a job portal that specifically lists jobs meant to fill this quota. I self identified on all of these over the last year (My disabilities are generally considered hidden, I previously chose not to disclose them.).

Of course this is all anecdotal but I can say that out of approximately 100 applications they were processed longer in general before I was not offered an interview. I received one phone interview that went poorly and one slip up on the interviewers part implied to me my disability was frowned upon.

The article indicated that disabled candidates might have trouble being as qualified as able bodied candidates. This is generally the problem I have with getting interviews, I don't have the resources available to compete with other candidates. I was hoping this new policy would help give me an edge, if I had an income source other than SSI I could afford to learn new skills or trades and become more self sustainable.

262,"You can work with someone who trains service dogs privately as opposed to an organization of you exhaust the standard options of going through an organization. 

The thing that makes a service dog a service dog and not a pet or companion animal is their ability to perform specifically trained tasks that mitigate your disability, and their ability to handle themselves in public well beyond the standard canine good citizen standards. 

Many of these tasks can be taught by standard animal trainers, but you and your doctor or other people with knowledge will have to help determine what these tasks should be. You would also need to work extensively with the trainer yourself in order to learn to provide the appropriate reinforcement for the dog as well as care. 

Sometimes people get a puppy with he express purpose of training him/her as a service dog, and find themselves not only without a dog who can help, but way in over their heads. This is where it would be best to find a trainer who has done this many times before and can help find the right dog as far as personality and abilities are concerned. And private dog training is not cheap, either. 

Definitely start by applying at the appropriate organizations with the help of your doctor, and if that does not pan out, then consider alternatives :) 

Whatever you do, read up on service dog laws so that you know your rights and responsibilities and are less likely to have an illegitimate organization or individual take advantage. 

Best of luck!

273,"I'm currently in the process of training with a service dog organization. I found the organization through my school a while ago when one of my professors sent out an email stating that this organization was looking for help with its website.

Prior to that I searched extensively using google (which is probably your best bet). I found many organizations that were location dependent (ie have to live in the area or be willing to commute for training) , some operated throughout the country though.

A lot of them require mandatory ""donations"" of $1000-$5000 and can have a waiting list  anywhere between 1-5 years. Fortunately the organization I'm using didn't require a ""donation' and I started training immediately (so they do exist).

You could also ask your local animal shelters and/or veterinarians if they know of anyone or any organization that trains service dogs.

Also as other users have said, it's not an overnight process. You can't just go to a trainer or organization and leave with a service dog. I've been training with my service for about a year and she is still not ready to take home. Service dogs aren't usually ready to take home until they are about 2 years old (depending on how there training progresses) and can start training at only a few weeks old (socializing skills, etc). I didn't start training with until she was about 1 years old and she is almost 2 now.

There is also a heavy screening process involved. I filled out a good amount of paperwork and my doctor had to write a recommendation for me and I believe they interviewed him too. Had to list previous veterinarians which they interviewed. I was required to have a fenced in backyard and I can't have any other dogs in the household(although that depends on the organization) .  They also sent people out to my house to make sure it was a suitable environment for the dog.

And sometimes the dogs are just ""rentals"", meaning when the dog retires from service work (usually  about 10 years old)  you have to give the dog back to them and then you have to go through the whole process again.

I've found that if someone is playing a concert hall/indoor music venue with permanent seating, it can be very difficult to get tickets online for handicapped areas.

277,"I'm a manual wheelie for reference.

**Wheels:**

I have slightly chunkier tyres, though they're crap and I really need bigger ones for the snow. I use cable ties wrapped around the tyre at maybe inch intervals, it helps give a bit of extra grip. Bonus is that you can use these indoors too unlike tyre chains, though they're nowhere near as heavy duty. Anyone in snowy climes ever used wheelblades? Also can anyone comment on wheelchair slippers or other things to not spend half the winter with the steam mop?

**Rims:** 

I need a cover to widen them for when my hands turn into claws. Any recommendations? The squishy tubing I had previously did not cope well with the grit and fell apart. 

**Gloves:**

I'm struggling with this, I need the good grip and find workshop gloves good but I'm female with tiny wrists and most of them don't stay on. I've tried several leather pairs but they don't have the grip on the inner palm that I need. I've also never found a pair that stay really dry and end up with black stained hands. Again suggestions would be appreciated.

**Lights:** 

Two bike lights on the front. Highly recommended, helps you stop rolling through dog shit with the early darkness. Also good for finding your keys when you wander home half cut.

**Warmth:**

Layers yo. Those thera-heat things that you remove from the packet and heat automatically are great, light to carry around and they have sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your back, shoulders, chest, legs etc. I also have a battery operated heated TeNS machine which is great if a bit chunky. I use a fleecy blanket over my legs and tights or leggings under jeans. I plan on buying a set of long fake fur lined boots. Also looking for sock recommendations. I use a pair of big headphones (Seindheiser?) that double as earmuffs. They also have a plastic frame so are easy to knock on and off with minimal motor control, which is lowered even more when you're all wrapped up.

**Waterproofing:**

Uch. Just no. I wear a normal jacket with velcro sleeves, push them up to the elbow, velcro up tight. Wear cheap tuigrip to cover my forearms and take a plastic bag with a replacement for when they get ick. It is colder but wet sleeves are my pet hate, I'd rather have cold arms. 

I'd love to hear people's solutions for legs in the rain. The problem I have with say a waterproof blanket is that you tuck it in beside your legs, but then the cushion gets wet as the rain runs down the sides or down your back.

Oh!  a brush!  Carry a brush.  Like a small grout brush, is what I used, like [this guy](<URL>).  Very handy for knocking snow buildup off your frame and foot pedals, and also for scrubbing salt/sand out of tire treads.

You don't say her education level or whether she works or goes to school or what, so I'm going to assume at that age she's not able to find a job she can do without a degree of some kind.  You also don't say whether she is able to get out much and see friends in person.  So  I'm guessing she probably has a lot of free time on her hands, and very little social interaction beyond family and facebook.  She probably feels downright trapped in the house.

Does she have any paid caregivers or is it all family, all the time?  At her age she wants desperately to have a normal social life outside of family.  A non-disabled person could just take their phone to their room and text all they want in complete privacy, but she doesn't have that luxury.  Every single text and social interaction has to be negotiated for.  Also, the content of every single text and social interaction has to be filtered through a family member, who may or may not be passing judgment or imposing their own viewpoint.

Think of all the ways that could constrain what you say and how you interact, even if the person was friendly.

I don't blame this man at all for feeling as though he had to hide his blindness in a world where people are mean, petty, rude, and  can simply exploit you because they know that they may be able to do so.  All I can say is that people with visible and indivisible disabilities must work together and support one another. Trade off with one another if you can. For example, as a wheelchair user I had physical issues that my blind friend did not. However, I was her ""eyes"" and she was my ""legs"" so to speak and we looked out for each other whenever we could. If she needed he submitting an online assignment because the website wasn't JAWS-friendly, she'd call and I'd help. The most important thing is to be there for one another. Don't get bogged down in the whole ""my disability is worse than yours"" mentality"" as I so often saw in college because these kinds of thinking will only divide the disability community into factions. 

One thing I did notice in college was the division in blind students that led to cliques, if you will. There seem to be this ""line"" drawn where you were either totally blind or had some remaining vision. These ""lines"" did nothing but divide into further and further divisions.

**Is it difficult to travel down crowded sidewalks with lots of people/navigate the city?**

Not really any more difficult than walking through large crowds. Most people tend overreact and jump out of the way. 

**What are some of the challenges you face living in a high density area?**

In general, I find that larger cities are remarkably easier to get around in by wheelchair 

**Are there any resources about this? I read John Hockenberry’s Moving Violations, but my mom isn’t young and physically fit. I doubt she will use a manual wheelchair.**

Chicago has several organizations that provide resources to wheelchair users. It depends on what you're specifically looking for 

**People up north, how is the ice a factor? Again, we are from Texas and I worry about her ability to get around on her own while I'm at work.**

If it's really bad, I usually only push from my building to my car, and from my car to school. Otherwise I just end up moving slower. It can be much worse for those in power chairs.

Craigslist is the way to go in Chicago. Do not even bother looking for truly accessible apartments. Just find buildings with elevators (anything over 4 stories in Chicago, by code) and see them in person to assess if it will work for you. I've moved three times in Chicago, each time it took less than a month to find and had to visit no more than 10 units. 

**Is there an Uber alternative for disabled people, because I hear Access-a-Ride sucks?**

Nope, not for a heavy power chair. But many of the cabs here use MV1s, which are fantastically accessible. 

**Are there specific wheelchairs for city life?**

**Is it difficult to travel down crowded sidewalks with lots of people/navigate the city?**

Not really any more difficult than walking through large crowds. Most people tend overreact and jump out of the way. 

**What are some of the challenges you face living in a high density area?**

In general, I find that larger cities are remarkably easier to get around in by wheelchair

<LOCATION> has several organizations that provide resources to wheelchair users. It depends on what you're specifically looking for

If it's really bad, I usually only push from my building to my car, and from my car to school. Otherwise I just end up moving slower. It can be much worse for those in power chairs.

355,"&gt; Actually, the biggest problem I find in hotels are heavy doors. Or maybe just really rusty/tough hinges, idk. But it really ruins accessibility when I can't even exit the room by myself because the door weighs 5-10lbs. (Pulling a door open is way harder than pushing when in a wheelchair.)

This is usually caused by the closers, which need to be quite strong to get past the acoustic seals.. plus the doors are wide so they are heavy.  we have a delay action closer so it gives a few seconds before it starts closing.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As for walk-in showers, I appreciate the ones that avoid getting water everywhere. One I really liked had a little niche in it you could direct the showerhead into. And speaking of, I've had a lot of hotels where there were no handheld showerhead or adjustable heights for the showerhead; both of these are essential to me.

The non-adjustable shower head is a mystery to me, people keep proposing it and i have no idea where it comes from. Our standards require the adjustable rails / handheld one
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Higher toilets are always a plus. And well-placed toilet roll; none across the room or behind the toilet or too low or too high whatever awkward place you can dream of.
&gt; 

perrenial problem, especially because you have potential splashing from the shower, some neat flip down rails have the roll holder built-in
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No high beds, please, though I think that trend is slowly dying. Likewise, two beds are preferred; it's common to put one king bed in a handicap room, but two queens are much nicer and way more flexible.

Bed height is creeping up, but we require wheelchair rooms to be 550mm high (with the gap under the bed for hoist legs)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and tons of power outlets! Ones that are easily accessible, too, not hidden behind desks and chairs. I have more things to charge than most people, and doing contortions to do so is hard on the body.

You and every other hotel guest on earth!, we're putting about 9 sockets plus 4 usb points nowadays. adding a couple extra in the wheelchair room would be no biggy

As for walk-in showers, I appreciate the ones that avoid getting water everywhere. One I really liked had a little niche in it you could direct the showerhead into. And speaking of, I've had a lot of hotels where there were no handheld showerhead or adjustable heights for the showerhead; both of these are essential to me.

Higher toilets are always a plus. And well-placed toilet roll; none across the room or behind the toilet or too low or too high whatever awkward place you can dream of.

No high beds, please, though I think that trend is slowly dying. Likewise, two beds are preferred; it's common to put one king bed in a handicap room, but two queens are *much* nicer and way more flexible.

389,"This timing is not uncommon. How long it takes for your claim to get from the Field Office (FO) to the Disability Determinations Office (DDS) really depends on the state where you live and what their current workloads work like. It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to get assigned a DDS worker. Some states have what is called a ""pre-development"" unit. As soon as you file they send out all the paperwork while it is waiting to be actually assigned to the decision maker. 

Generally once it gets to the DDS it will still take anywhere from 30-120 days for a determination. They have to request the medical evidence from your doctors (which they get 30 days to respond), sent it for a medical review with a SSA Medical Contractor (MC), do the vocational assessment, and then do the decision. And that doesn't include any additional steps such as sending you to a Consultative Examination or SSA needing to get updated medical records if you go back to the doctor while they have your case. 

The most important thing you can do now is to be cooperative and responsive. Answer your phone when it rings and you don't know the number. Most DDS examiners carry caseloads of over 100 cases so playing phone tag will delay your case several days. Make sure to fill out all paperwork timely (which it sounds like you are) and go to any appointments that they schedule for you.  That paperwork you received should have had an examiners name/phone number on it. At the end of the month I would suggest you call to check on the status of your claim. Make sure they received your paperwork and find out if you had any of your doctors that didn't respond (you may have to get SSA the records yourself). Being proactive about making sure SSA has everything they need can sometimes avoid delays at the back-end of the case.

As I said at the beginning, you still have probably another 1-3 months before you'll get a decision. This time of year things tend to slow down as the people at the DDS and FO go on vacations. And that 1-3 months is just for the DDS examiner to make a decision. Anywhere from 30-50% of all cases get pulled for either state or federal quality review which can take several weeks to process. And from there, if the QA doesn't like the case, they will send it back for additional development by the examiner which will add another 30-60 days as well.

390,"Treatment by medical means doesn't make something a disability. Appendicitis for example is treated with medication and surgery and is not a disability, it's an illness.

Although there's no set in stone definition of what is and isn't a disability the general deciding factor isn't a matter of how difficult it is to have a condition/illness, but whether or not that condition/illness makes you unable to, or have significant difficulty, performing tasks that the majority of society takes for granted.

For example a person who is paraplegic is disabled in that they can't climb stairs without significant difficulty, a person with an anxiety disorder may be disabled in that they are unable to buy food at a store without experiencing fear or panic, an epileptic person is disabled in that they cannot drive a car without great risk, etc.

I'm not trying to dismiss the hardship that transgender people face, I understand that it's no easy thing to deal with. However a transgender person isn't likely to be considered to fit the definition of a disabled individual as their being transgender does not prevent or impair them in what are considered by most as normal day to day tasks.

At that point the person is no longer disabled in that they can't, for example, safely climb stairs. You could say that they're disabled in that they need to take medicine regularly, but it's hard to argue that having to take medicine on a regular basis should be classified as a disability.

If your medication is able to return you to ""normal"" ability and health then there's a strong argument to be made that you're no longer disabled. You still have a chronic illness and your disability could return, but until that happens you're not disabled.

------------------------------

Stepping aside from that for a moment, there is a philosophy that disability is caused not by a person's health, but by society being built around the expectation that people should be able to do, or be, certain things. For example the argument would hold that a paraplegic not being able to enter a building isn't due their inability to climb stairs, but because the building was built so that they couldn't access it. Their inability to (easily) climb stairs would be irrelevant if the building had a ramp or an elevator instead. In a world where every building was designed for people in wheelchairs to easily access their inability to climb stairs would no longer be a disability.

To put it in another perspective, imagine if our societies were designed with the assumption that everyone was as physically fit as a olympic-level marathon runner. The average person from our world may very well be disabled in that society, whilst all the 'normal' people are running up and down ten flights of stairs several times a day without breaking a sweat they need to take an elevator, while the average person is running to the shops and back carrying their groceries as they run they need to take their car. They're disabled not because of what they can do, but because society is built around the assumption that people can do more than what they can do.

It's an interesting thought experiment (though not one I feel has a great deal of real world use outside of being a thought experiment), and if you look at it from that perspective you could make a fairly strong argument that transgender people are disabled (or at least face issues similar to disabled people) in that a great deal of issues many of them face are because of what society expects everyone to adhere to. If a transgender person has anxiety about going to a public bathroom is it because they're transgender or because society is built around the assumption that people are cisgendered?

Again, it's not a generally accepted way to define what disability is (though it seems to have gained a fair bit of steam in recent years), so I don't think it really effects whether transgender is (or should) be classified as a disability. But disability or not it is an interesting way to look at any illness/condition and to consider what are intrinsic issues with that illness and what are things that could potentially be solved by changing the society that we live in.",,,,Surly_Canary,"Stops, drops and rolls.",,1447217310,t5_2qhe8,t3_3sd168,t1_cww5qwq,6,1449731433,0,0,cww7l7r,disability,6,,,,

420,"Hi there. I know you private messaged me, but I'm wanting to offer some information for the general readers that frequent this sub. 

There is no magic trick to this form. The best thing is to answer honestly. This is the main form where we asses someone's credibility. We will compare it to your medical records so it's in your best interest to match. 

For example, you write down that you can't cook or do any household chores but your medical records show you saying you're mowing your lawn. Or you say you can't walk more than 5 feet or can't even ""count change"". These kinds of answers are what get you denied(or ceased) from disability. 

People always tell you to focus on how your conditions affect your functioning, which is correct but the flip side to that is to make it correct. The more believable you are the better.  80% of people try to over-sell this form which is a mistake. If your statements are inconsistent or not supported by your medical records you'll be dead in the water. It's better to seem ""more functional"" if it matches your records than less functional and have it not match. 

It is always ok to add a supplemental page or explanation if you run out of space. However: 
1. No more than one page
2. Don't include any googled-medical information about your condition (honestly it's insulting to us)
3. Don't beg, plead, or tell me you'll get you congressman involved.  

When in doubt, call the person listed on the form. If you have questions on how to answer he question just call to ask. That is what we are here for. Same if you're going to have it turned in late. We are flexible but you have to let us know. 

Finally, make copies. If you're mailing it in make a copy first. Trust me, it's worth the few bucks to do it. Tens of thousands of these forms are in the mail at this very moment. Things get lost, destroyed, or otherwise misplaced. After you mail/fax it call 7-10 days later to make sure they got it. If they didn't you'll be glad you have that extra copy.

446,"Well you have to first remember that autism like blindness can be on a spectrum. It isn't black and white, but unfortunately people have this tendency to think you either have a disability or you don't. So in this warped view of thinking, you're either  ""100% disabled or 0% disabled "". This kind of thinking is really, quite jaded. The disabled have good and bad days. Some days are better then others, but that doesn't make their disability any LESS existent. The fact that people try to mitigate a person's disability in terms of its severity or to the extent to which a person is affected is EXTREMELY insensitive in and rude. Why? Because no matter how much a person articulates or explains their disability to a person who is non-disabled or even has a disability similar to theirs NOBODY can every live in that person's exact shoes. Even if the experience could be simulated in a way, it wouldn't necessarily match up because being disabled is a lived experience. I'm disabled with Cerebral Palsy 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.

That being said, that doesn't give her a pass to be a bitch. Heck, if someone spend an hour helping me type something, I would be so thankful. 

Some here are suggesting speech apps. Depending on her speech patterns these may cause more frustrations than they are worth (I know my speech is really hard for a computer to understand). However, there may be other ways to give her more independence, like a larger keyboard that an ipad would provide, or even an actual physical keyboard.

471,"Thanks, I think I've actually read this one before - possibly on this subreddit? Always kind of surprised at people who manage to be friends (not just friendly) with their carers, that hasn't ever really worked well for me but it seems like it works for her. I think definitely her last point about making sure they understand the responsibility on the job is something lacking in my situation. 

I did think what she said about rewarding carers for good work was quite interesting. I'm thinking that perhaps for future carers it might be useful for me to set up some sort of review system whereby every month or two months I do a quick summary of what was great about their work and what could be improved or what I might like done differently because otherwise habits become routine pretty quickly and it's hard to get people to change (or at least that has been the case with my current one...).

You're absolutely right that it's a perfect storm for poverty, especially since the COLA only raises SSI benefits every...two years or so.

546,"I'd highly, highly recommend against anything making excessive noise, if the parents care that little to begin with it's likely to go straight into the trash the first time it annoys them (and trust me from experience it will after 6 straight hours much less 6 straight hours everyday). 

My own similarly disabled sibling likes to play with real things like a normal person, that could be part of the reason he's using those specific items. If you can find plastic tools and play utensils those may be a good idea. You also mentioned he likes tidying up and my sibling ***loves*** cleaning stuff as well, though it seems cruel and unusual to outsiders, they're content to sweep for hours for example and love new brooms and dustpans. Obviously avoid anything that involves cleaning with chemicals. Rakes for leaves are good in the fall. 

As for being plopped in from of the TV at night, that's at least partially unavoidable if your bf's mother is a 50 or 60 something single parent who presumably works. It's incredibly difficult to keep up with the active lifestyle of a normal 20-year old at that age. My own sibling is a two or three person full time job even with additional limiting physical abilities and a weekday day program. We keep her entertained with live-action children's movies when you just can't do anything else. The best gift you could likely get both of them is to take him out on your own one or two nights a week.

I just wanted to point out that this young man is an adult, and you should consider his dignity when choosing a toy - in the relationships thread especially some people were suggesting very childish toddler items which might not be appropriate.  
This may or may not be important to him and his parents, and can be a point of contention within families (so the mum might have told you that they don't have time to play, rather than she feels playtime is too childish, to avoid having to justify this to you). Lots of adults do enjoy childish things, but you're not buying your boyfriend any toddler toys or expecting his parents to do playtime with him - it'd be insulting given his age.

That doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to access sensory toys or stimulation, just that you need to choose carefully and not just buy things made for young children.
