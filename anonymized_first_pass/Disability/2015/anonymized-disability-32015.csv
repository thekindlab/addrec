7,"Before I became disabled, I was a teacher of advanced mathematics. Now I am mainly an advocate for severe mental illness. There are many difficulties that I have encountered doing this. To be honest, I worry that most of my attempts fail to achieve their essential purpose. Several of my submissions to Reddit have been removed, and I was also banned from posting to /r/mentalhealth [I do not know the reason for this, nor do I have any way to appeal it]. When a ""stranger"" is trying to protest or educate or share, this is often mis-construed as complaining, condescending, or self-promoting. Even though my disability is purely incidental to my argumentation, it is no secret that I do have a severe mental illness myself, and it is hard to achieve a positive rhetorical effect before a psychologizing audience. When being suggestive or satirical or hypothetical, one comes off as confrontational, spiteful, or inane.

For example, consider my suggestion of the following.

* Anti-depression - a mental illness characterized by a lack of unpleasant emotions.
* Anti-psychosis - a personality disorder characterized by the inability to interpret one's experiences objectively.

I think this is an interesting parody of psychiatric paradigms, which was part of a larger piece I wrote about the ethics of self-medication. Because it is one of my censored submissions, the discussion is lost- but I do recall the top comment.

There are lots of ways to us DS concepts as a framework in other fields, the same way that, for example, feminist rhetoric is used in sociology, psychology, group studies, etc. It is such a multi-disciplinary subject by its nature, that regardless of what your degree is ultimately in, it can be heavily influenced by DS, should you choose to take that route. 

Your interests sound fascinating, the language part specifically. Ableist language is so pervasive and the way that language shapes our perspectives is not considered nearly as much as (I think) it should be. The multiple oppressions sounds a lot like work being produced around intersectionality currently, which is fascinating in its own regard. It's awesome that you are so focused already--I know you think that you are considering a lot of different things, but I see them more as different facets of the same idea.

&gt;Kind of, but if you are only working 33 hours per month then you will probably still have part B coverage. 

I hopefully would be working enough to increase my income. I'm not actually sure how many hours I could handle working, but I wanted to see if working would actually increase my income. Many people on reddit write about actually having less income due to working.

Due to the nature of my disability, I wouldn't be able to take a shared rides program. So, hiring a PCA to drive me is better than a taxi. That being said, I have no job so these transportation numbers are simply a way to work through the math.

&gt;I take the bus and get half off due to medicare, which means I pay 2.50 each day.

&gt;I think the job you want combined with the transportation costs are the things holding you back.

For me, if I'm going to use a secondary chair, I don't want to have to bring two chairs with me to the activity.  When I leave my house I want just the one chair.  But the problem with this is that it limits you.  That chair is going to be wider and more restricting with things not related to its intended activity.  Take camping for example.  A chair that makes it easier to be on rougher terrain when I'm camping would be nice.  But it's a deal break if I decide I need to go into town and get a few things and I can't fit through the doors at the little gas station or general store because of the tires or build of the chair.

Before my therapist would sign off on if he thought I could benefit from a service dog, he wanted to make sure I did my own research and figured out on my own how one could help me, then we could discuss it.

Everyone has their own process towards finding a service dog. The amount of responses I encountered like this one really, really sucked. Why not just post the actual laws, offer the advice you are clearly with-holding, and let them know that they do need a doctor to sign-off to legally bring the dog out and about with them?

I get that part of this response stems from not wanting ""fakers"" to get service dogs. But seriously, is it worth turning away people that actually need one?

So you can definitely say that 14% of the 18% or so of the 45-64 year olds have acquired disabilities, and while some of the rest of the 4% will as well, all of the congenital disabilities will be contained within that group as a certainty.

So if you stopped work 1/1/14 I would request all medical 1/1/13 to Present). 

Now, that being said, we DO NOT go through extrodinary lengths to get the records. We send 2 requests (an initial and a follwo up a few weeks later). I will wait 30 days for the records. If I don't get them I will just move on without them. Only in about 1 in 25 cases will I make a phone call to a source, and that is only in rare circumstances where I think the person is an allowance and I cannot get the information anywhere else. There is nothing that I can do to make a doctor's office give me their records. We do not pre-pay, will will not pay over the state-set maximum, etc.

If I can't find your doctor in our vendor file I will either not send the request or, what more often happens, it gets sent to the wrong place. The second thing that I suggest all applicants do is FOLLOW UP with both your DDS examiner and your doctor's office. Some states require will contact you via letter if your records aren't received but some others don't (I personally don't). So about 3 weeks or so after the DDS gets your case (I would say start that 3 week clock when you get those ADL/work history forms. we mail those the same day we mail records requests) call the DDS examiner to find out what they are still waiting on. If they are still waiting on records from Dr Smith, then you call and hound that office. Follow up again in 1 week. If Dr Smith still hasn't sent them. Then I would suggest going and getting them yourself and faxing or hand delivering those records to the DDS. Make sure to keep your DDS examiner updated; If I know that a claimant is making strides to get the records I will hold the case a little longer.

Sorry, man this got long.

256,"Some good thoughts here already, so I'm going to go off on a tangent a little bit.

Your wife is extremely lucky to have you. I'd bet she knows that, and it's clear you love her. 

Are you looking after yourself? 

Would *you* benefit from counselling – a professional, confidental ear to hear how you're feeling about how things are progressing for and with your wife? If you're struggling a bit to see her decline, and finding it tough to support her through it, there's no shame in that. I think it can be probably pretty hard and draining to be there for a disabled peep and be their support 'pillar'.

I know one of the things I worry about most with my other half is that he's okay, and that he's looked after if things are particularly tough for me/us disability-wise. Partially this is because I love him and want him to be happy, supported and as well as possible; partially this is (and I know this is selfish) because I am aware that people can only take so much, and if he suddenly can't cope anymore I'd lose that lifeline of support.

So... it's important to look after yourself, too. I'd recommend sitting down on your own and figuring out what you can put in place to help yourself. Maybe counselling/therapy, maybe a more informal support network (I'm pretty sure you could find plenty of groups for partners-of-disabled-folks), or are your friends great at being there for you? Do you get yourself treats occasionally to bolster spirits? That kind of thing. Basically anything that might benefit your wife, also applying to your own life individually.

279,"I wish I could have a positive answer for you.  The short answer is: I wish I knew, too. I cannot get my doctor to listen to me about my physical limitations.

[Rant warning]

Over a decade ago I lost most of the use of one leg due malpractice (a doctor ignored clear signs until it spiraled out of control). I spent time in the hospital, and months on very strong drugs and painkillers.  The leg is permanently damaged and I've been told that it may simply stop functioning completely, or get so much worse that it will have to be removed.  With exercise I've managed to keep it at a status quo, for now. It's not getting better, but it's not worse.

However, the catch is -- I'm fat.  My current doctor doesn't have access to the past hospital records (short version: all the records were destroyed) and does not listen when I talk about my issues with my leg. All she can see or hear is that I am disabled because of my weight.  While my weight is an issue, it is not the cause of my disability nor does it affect the disability. (It's kind of like saying that losing weight will stop Alzheimer's. Weight affects some things, but not everything.)

I can't get through to her. I'm at a loss.  The thing is, if you look at the leg right now it mostly looks normal.  I'm utterly terrified that I'm going to again wind up in the hospital, deathly ill and/or losing the leg, listening again to a doctor say, ""Gee, I guess you were right after all.""",False,False,t1_cpkj5xw,mizmoose,weebles wobble but we don't fall down,0,1426813610,t5_2qhe8,t3_2zjjt1,t3_2zjjt1,2,1427865739,0,0,cpkj5xw,disability,2,,,,

300,"That was a really good and thorough article! I must say a lot of things sounded familiar to my situation, while others did not so much. It was a really good read and I would like to give my own perspective about disability, sex and overall images of the disabled or otherwise impaired. 

&amp;nbsp;

I like how the article focuses on the overall problem of a certain image pressing on people, in this case sexuality of disabled people. There are other problems too in the world, like the combination of work and disabled people, but that is for another time. As a male disabled person in Europe I too sense the (rather ignorant) view that disabled people can't or don't want to have sex. And then there is the offensive view that one shouldn't want to have sex with a disabled person, or that the sexual encounter ""does not count"" because impaired people are seen as desperate in this case. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is something each disabled person (I really need to find another word for variety's sake) encounters in his/her life, perhaps in different gradations because of different cultures. Even though in the article the Netherlands is mentioned for advocating the so called sex surrogates, its overall culture and the people living here do not impress me to be open to the idea of disabled people having sex, at least not in my case. Even more so, it SEEMS TO ME it is less of a problem in say, the United States, but that's only through stories on the internet. Over here it also seems that impaired women have it easier in dating than impaired men, although I have no explanation why. 

&amp;nbsp;

Paid sex is mentioned in the article as a special service for disabled people. I have no experience with this, but as far as I know the prices of these services are rather high. I always wonder how a ""regular"" prostitute would react if a wheelchair bound person entered the brothel. Would they be denied for the ""regular"" service? 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes sex is described as a right, just like in this article. I always have doubts with this motto, but I'm not a complete opponent either. Sex is (generally speaking) two people coming together to pleasure each other, which means both parties need to consent. You cannot force another person to have sex with you. The aforementioned sex surrogates also provide only a short term solution for a long term problem in my opinion, given its price and general staleness with its level of professionalism. As far as I can tell, however, most people DO have sex. And if they are not having a sex partner right now, they most likely will in the near future. Of course some people do get more than others, but overall speaking there are plenty of people for pleasure. With us disabled people, it sometimes feels like we are outside of that pool, not selectable for having sex no matter how we try or improve. 

&amp;nbsp;

One thing I miss in the article is impaired people having sex with each other. Sometimes it may not be practical. But especially when both parties are ""equally disabled"", they might understand each other on a whole new level. Please don't neglect that possibility. 

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, we have long ways to go with our disability and sex lives in most cases, but it is improving if only slightly. One thing is most important however. You are just a human being like anyone else, with phsyical urges, like anyone else. Despite what others might tell you, it is normal, okay and perhaps even important to pursue your sexual needs. You are worth it. ",False,False,t1_cpbw83x,sharpgreen,,0,1426110617,t5_2qhe8,t3_2ypc2p,t3_2ypc2p,3,1427708252,0,0,cpbw83x,disability,3,,,"That was a really good and thorough article! I must say a lot of things sounded familiar to my situation, while others did not so much. It was a really good read and I would like to give my own perspective about disability, sex and overall images of the disabled or otherwise impaired. 

&amp;nbsp;

I like how the article focuses on the overall problem of a certain image pressing on people, in this case sexuality of disabled people. There are other problems too in the world, like the combination of work and disabled people, but that is for another time. As a male disabled person in <LOCATION> I too sense the (rather ignorant) view that disabled people can't or don't want to have sex. And then there is the offensive view that one shouldn't want to have sex with a disabled person, or that the sexual encounter ""does not count"" because impaired people are seen as desperate in this case. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is something each disabled person (I really need to find another word for variety's sake) encounters in his/her life, perhaps in different gradations because of different cultures. Even though in the article the <LOCATION> is mentioned for advocating the so called sex surrogates, its overall culture and the people living here do not impress me to be open to the idea of disabled people having sex, at least not in my case. Even more so, it SEEMS TO ME it is less of a problem in say, <LOCATION>, but that's only through stories on the internet. Over here it also seems that impaired women have it easier in dating than impaired men, although I have no explanation why. 

&amp;nbsp;

Paid sex is mentioned in the article as a special service for disabled people. I have no experience with this, but as far as I know the prices of these services are rather high. I always wonder how a ""regular"" prostitute would react if a wheelchair bound person entered the brothel. Would they be denied for the ""regular"" service? 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes sex is described as a right, just like in this article. I always have doubts with this motto, but I'm not a complete opponent either. Sex is (generally speaking) two people coming together to pleasure each other, which means both parties need to consent. You cannot force another person to have sex with you. The aforementioned sex surrogates also provide only a short term solution for a long term problem in my opinion, given its price and general staleness with its level of professionalism. As far as I can tell, however, most people DO have sex. And if they are not having a sex partner right now, they most likely will in the near future. Of course some people do get more than others, but overall speaking there are plenty of people for pleasure. With us disabled people, it sometimes feels like we are outside of that pool, not selectable for having sex no matter how we try or improve.

306,"&gt;Unfortunately here is your issue. If you applied again likely you will get denied. The thing is that it is based on your vision in your best eye. So if you have one eye that is blind that is not an issue. You're vision has to be worse than 20/200 (corrected) in your best eye.

This is almost always the case, there are a few exceptions. I am not sure about OP's background but the following ruling from SSR 85-15 could fit him:

&gt;As a general rule, even if a person's visual impairment(s) were to eliminate all jobs that involve very good vision (such as working with small objects or reading small print), as long as he or she retains sufficient visual acuity to be able to handle and work with rather large objects (and has the visual fields to avoid ordinary hazards in a workplace), there would be a substantial number of jobs remaining across all exertional levels. However, a finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant's vocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education or less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work in which good vision is essential.

From your story, I have a feeling your wife is starting to realize that soon she won't be able to work and will have to apply for benefits, and this may be what is ramping up the depression. I went through the same thing, and it was incredibly difficult.

You may want to look around your city (or even online) for disability or chronic pain support groups. She'll be able to commiserate with people in similar situations, and they usually meet in the evening, so she won't have to miss work for them.

As far as you go, you seem to be doing great in supporting her and being there for her, so just keep doing that. She'll be more grateful for it than you can possibly know. A support system is a precious thing. You may want to have your wife visit /r/chronicpain in the meantime and post her story. Getting it all out in a vent may help her some.

As to your finances, they are no one else's business. Maybe you have a trust fund or inheritance or maybe you partake in some shady practices.

For people who you are closer to, you can say ""it is not something that I like to discuss"" or ""maybe I'll tell you about it one day.""

I, too, do not like telling people about my disability. People don't take it seriously or I just rather them not know.

344,"I third this. Nothing, and I mean nothing, ruins a personal relationship faster than the blurring of the lines between care and friendship/partnership. 

When you're disabled, there are aspects of your care you find frustrating. When I was younger and I was cared for by my mum, I used to find the way she did certain things incredibly frustrating. Sometimes, I needed things done straight away but because my mum had other responsibilities (like looking after my brother or housework or her job), I had to wait or I had to accept things weren't going to get done how I wanted. This led to a cycle of anger and frustration between my mum and me and we both talked to each other in ways we didn't mean during the process of care and then went straight back to having a great relationship during the moments she wasn't caring for me. This kind of thing becomes quite deeply embedded after a while and eventually you stop realizing you're even doing it because you've managed to separate your relationship into a care component and a regular component and forgotten that the person who is caring for you doesn't necessarily have that same perception of things. 

Furthermore, even if your husband doesn't necessarily know it, he is likely to be feeling guilty. Guilt is an enormous and unspoken about aspect of disability, especially when people you care about are doing the caring for you. I felt guilty when my mum had to focus on me instead of my brother or when I saw how tired she was day after day. This just made me more frustrated. In fact, I can say I became more aggressive at times because I wanted to push my mum away so that I didn't have to face the guilt I felt. 

I don't know if any of that makes sense. It doesn't excuse the behaviour but it might be behind some of what is going on. If you are able to, I would strongly strongly advise you discuss getting an outside carer so that you can both be on equal ground.

368,"I'm severely obsessive compulsive and struggle with pretty terrible depression and anxiety. Right now, I'm fighting to get through life, let alone my last year of school (which is especially difficult because of poverty and lack of accommodation). So I'm pretty much with you on this.

For myself, I used to try to hide it, and would go to great lengths to do so. Now, I'm more confident in my identity (though I still struggle), and it's not really an easy thing to hide anyway. So I'm pretty open about everything, because in my eyes, there's nothing wrong with being disabled, and it's nothing I should be ashamed of. In fact, I now take pride in being a disabled woman (thanks, social model).

&gt;  i feel as if the system is stacked against me.

That's because it definitely is.

&gt; the fact is no one sees my disability as being severe enough to warrant not working, and they resent or doubt me for it, when the truth is i wanna try working, but doing so would endanger my safety net...

Yeah, seriously. Fuck those who think they can decide how severe anyone's disability is and who ""deserves"" accommodation. We have a terrible enough time as it is, and integration into the workplace is disincentivized.

&gt;  this sub seems to be more focused on people with physical disabilities, and i don't wanna take anything away from their plight. but the truth is just because you don't see me in a wheel chair or spastic muscles does not mean i'm a fully functional member of society. at least not today.

Yeah, this is an issue in the disability community at large. I won't go into too much detail as to why I think that is, but it's partially because of this notion (conscious or not) that mentally disabled individuals don't struggle that much, or that they somehow deserve their plight because other disabled individuals can't help it, but mental can (obviously false).

And there's also this stigma associated with disability. Disabled people aren't considered whole, so by using the term ""mental illness,"" people internalize ableism, and try to use a term which reflects that they aren't missing something, but that they're merely ill. In the end, these distinctions are bad for all of us, and we need to stop playing against each other in order to appear like we have higher value. The entire measurement of value is based on our capitalist society anyway.

I'm going to use some simple numbers so it's easier.

If I start working, I'll have to pay


Medicare part b $105
Medicaid buy in $65


So, just for these two things


If I'm working $10/hr, I need to work 17 hours per month to break even.


Then it costs me $10 each way to commute to and from a job.


Now each day $20 goes to transportation.


So, let's say I work two days per week. That means $40 per week or $160 per month go to transportation.

409,"Sweet.

I've also looked into UIC, and haven't ruled it out completely, but like I said before, I think I might want to go through another field, and focus on DS instead. I figure that if I study DS specifically, then I might be pigeon-holed a little bit. I would love to go into a career with academia, and I worry that if I study DS, then my only possible career would be in teaching DS (which is not available at many schools). But if I study another discipline and focus in DS, then I will not only have better job opportunities, but I'll also have more of a chance at spreading DS as a legitimate and valuable thing to study.

But yeah. I'm actually most interested in mental, followed by physical and cognitive. (My diagnoses are OCD, depression, and anxiety.) I'm intrigued by political psychiatry, and how it's used to silence people, but also how it's used as an example of bad psychiatry, while other diagnoses are perceived to be legitimate. Particularly when a class analysis is added, you can see how disability (and not just mental) is based on capitalist modes of production, and I want to explore the relationships between disability discrimination and other methods of oppression. Our very language perpetuates ideals of how bodies ""should"" be, so I'm especially interested in how linguistic factors influence our definitions and perceptions.

That's kind of a lot, I know, but I guess I still have time to try to narrow my focus down. I'm planning to spend at least a year working, so I can save up my resources and get stabilized before I start grad school (poverty and disability don't mix well).

432,"A couple of times.

The first was outpatient. This particular therapist was a no-nonsense, no-mercy sort -- *and there's a place for that*. It's usually rather effective. What she didn't seem to understand was that what I described as 'Pain the doctors can't quite diagnose yet' really, actually wasn't 'pain that I just think I have.' It was complex mechanical problems in my knee, stemming from poor alignment, traumatic injury, and a long series of surgeries that only seemed to make it all worse. Ultimately that problem led to the amputation flair you see now; but at the time, it was a nebulous, confusing thing, and this therapist had no time for it. I admire that in a lot of people, but not in her. I've gone through basic training, graduated the Air Force Academy in 2009 and all the physical rigors that come with that; graduated flight school, graduated SERE (a survival and captive-resistance training program where the instructors *literally* beat you, and worse). I was in Special Operations. I don't say this to brag, I say this to emphasize the following point -- *this woman hurt me worse than any trainer I ever had, in any school, in any way, ever.* And she didn't give a hoot. While I channeled screams of pain into a pure bloodthirsty rage as I struggled in a hydrotherapy pool, she would stand on the side throwing insults and making a show of writing down her unfavorable checkmarks. Look -- *I love that kind of thing*. That's a thing because it usually motivates results that will surprise even the trainee. It works, basically, unless you're doing it wrong, and *oh my god she was doing it so wrong*. But I wanted to get better, so I took it, and I took it, and then I took it some more, right up until it broke me even harder than I was already. After about three weeks she had a talk with her overlords and they cut me from therapy, since I was clearly allowing myself to regress and I must not have the strength of character it takes to make circles with my foot (lol). Bitch, I've touched the *sky* and looked down on the birth of tropical storms in the Gulf. When **I** can't do something, it's serious. She didn't deserve me anyway.

The second (and last) was inpatient therapy, after the fourth surgery trying to fix the knee (the following surgery would *remove* the knee). Obviously, if you know where it ended up, you know that this, too, was a doomed endeavor. I don't mind the failure -- it was out of her hands, Mother Theresa couldn't have cured me. But Mother Theresa might have paid attention. This therapist (also a lady -- I'm sorry, my bad experiences are a bit sexist, you'll have to forgive me) was pretty well respected in a *very* well-thought-of facility in Texas. People came from far and wide to get better here -- most of them much older, or in much worse shape, than I was at the time. When I was admitted, the rap sheet simply read that I was recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery -- an easy case, then! And he's *young*, too, you'll have no trouble here. I started out with a guy who was only at the facility temporarily -- I guess people do that, move around building up a resume as temps, and collecting gigantic paychecks. Anyway he got me started and it was going okay -- we built up a pretty good range of motion, we found where the hard limit was (about 105 degrees -- there was **no** getting around 105 degrees). With that limit in place, we started working on strength, endurance, balance, etc. in smart ways that made sense, and I made a lot of progress. *Then she happened*. She took over after about two and a half weeks, and immediately things were different. I came in with a wheelchair, which I'd been using exclusively for the better part of a year. She stole it. Then she stole one of my crutches, too, because ""Arthroscopic means you only need one."" I'm sure she read it in a book, probably a book about some other guy who hadn't been bedridden for over a year in indescribable pain. ""Oh, pain? Here, eat more drugs, I'll get you more drugs, now walk."" Now look, I would've been upset if all she did was wipe out all the progress I made. She did that. I fell from 105 degrees to 90, then back under 90. I would've been angry if she did all that *and* force-fed me narcotics. But that wasn't all. She would drag me halfway up a flight of concrete steps and let go, to go read paperwork with her lackey-in-training. She would leave me stranded on the wrong end of the facility with no way to get back to my bed but one leg and a single crutch. It only took a few days of these antics before I'd torn a new hole in my rotator cuff -- thanks, now in addition to a shit leg I have a shit arm, fantastic work! You'd think that would sort of, you know, catch a person's attention, but no. ""I'll get some more drugs, big day today."" Man, I hated her. Again, being an idiot, I stuck with it, thinking if I push hard enough things will just, you know, work somehow (spoiler: they didn't), but even my stupid patience had its limits. Next time she had me on the stairs, she ran off to impart her copious wisdom to the lackey kid, and I fell off. Fortunately, it was near the bottom, and I caught the railing so that I didn't catch too much damage. I shit you not, she turned around for like a *second*, saw me dangling there, and went back to what she was doing. So I let out a nice, loud, ""FUCK THIS."" My busted crutch arm carried me all the way to the administrative desk, where I let anybody within earshot know exactly what I thought of my therapist, and told them where they could find me when they came up with a new one. I suspect I hurt her feelings. Good. She hurt my goddamn *everything*. But, inpatient facilities being what they are, I didn't manage to avoid her completely -- she kept showing up in the gym, or in group sessions, with that cowed look of someone whose performance report might impact her salary. Fuck her. Once -- again, you're gonna think I'm stretching the truth here, I'm not -- she caught me in a group session, *grabbed my ass*, and tried to force in an explanation of how hard it was to be her. I'm not sure if I hit her or if that was just in my head, probably the latter, but she got the message. The following week I swore up and down that I felt all better and that I was totally ready to go back home and go to work. I wasn't -- but I was totally ready to get the hell away from that woman. They let me out and I'm not going back. 

The lesson I learned -- and it's a good one -- is that it's *so easy* to get rid of these people. You *don't* have to suffer through them -- they're not you, they don't know better than you, and if they think they're better than you, they're wrong. Fire them. **Fire them!** You can, and you should, and you won't regret it. And you might just save yourself a busted shoulder. That's why the second is also the last -- because there will not be a third therapist who treats me that way. I know better now. Just to spite the lot of them, I'm currently kicking ass with one leg and a new therapist who can't believe anybody could ever recover from an amputation so quickly. See that, dragon ladies? **It was all your fault, not mine.

Her independence is at risk. I am progressively getting worse to where I will be in a wheel chair so I know where she is coming from on that. Do not push her away from things she wants to do.

447,"Ok. I'll try to take your questions as chunks. First, apply for both SSD and SSI (they typically have you apply for both) to see which you actually qualify for. 

You're right that they are going to look at the fact that you haven't taken your medications for very long and say ""well he could get better."" In order to be found disabled you have to have the condition at a severity to prevent employment for a continuous 12 months *despite* treatment. So likely the denial you will get will read something like ""although your condition is severe and is currently preventing you from working it is not expected to preclude work activity for 12 months."" Because 75% of people do see a significant improvement with medication, which means that likely you will see improvement although it can take a while for meds to be adjusted. 

You are also correct that sometimes not taking medications (or noncompliance with treatment in general) is considered a symptom of mental illness and is ""excused"" a bit in the disability world. However, this is only generally the case with very severe disorders such as schizophrenia and some organic brain disorders (TBIs, etc). I've never successfully seen that argument for anxiety and depressive disorders. 

Honest talk, a lot of people aren't the greatest with taking their meds and being compliant with follow ups and treatment. And you can be sure to explain that when you apply for disability. But you are young and it doesn't sound like you have much of a treatment history (2 years from what I can tell). You're best bet is to really stick with treatment. Try different medications and therapies and stick with them. 

In the long run you likely will only qualify for SSI which is only about $700 per month max. That is never going to be enough to live on. Disability should never be the first thing that people look for. It is incredibly difficult to get when you are young and you don't have much a of a treatment history (and i'm not directing this soley at you; I see questions like yours frequently in this sub).

491,"&gt; Theoretically, you could make 10,000 one month and be fine?


&gt; 3) If you make above $1090 if you have no twp left your SSDI will be cutoff and you may be responsible for overpayments that must be payed back. Never ever get an over payment. Take that from someone who has had them.
&gt; If you don't mind, could you share more about how this happened and how the aftermath played out?


&gt; 4) You're supposed to report to SSDI any income that you receive, even under $780. The only other way they find out is from the IRS by doing database checks. They've found income I didn't report that way. Generally there's a two year lag-time for them to find it.

&gt; How do you report it?


&gt; 5) Yes, I was completely off SSDI for several years. To get back on I was able to do the social security expedited reinstatement. You have 5 years after losing SSDI to start the expedited process. It's basically like reapplying, but is much faster and according to a lady I spoke to at the SS office, almost always is approved. Unless you really did have an improvement in your condition. (Mine gets worse)

&gt; This is part of what I'm concerned about. I just worry about the political climate and if policies or funding changes, it could be denied, even if it's legitimate.



Yes, you can make a million in a those 9 months if you want. :-D

Got overpayments? I got bad information from a SS worker. That never happens right? (rolls eyes) I now get EVERYTHING from SS in writing. Many many times they have given me wrong information that ended up screwing me over. So, they took money out of my irs return to pay it back. 

You report earnings by calling them or going to an office. I actually don't even bother reporting stuff unless it is near the max allowed. No point really for me. 

Don't worry about it. SS isn't going anywhere. If anything, the funding will increase due to the coming shortfall. They have to figure out a solution at some point.

It's a depressing phase when we are adjusting to a chronic and progressive condition, but it IS possible to get through it.

This can help her compartmentalize the negative stuff.

When first becoming increasingly disabled, you are still constantly thinking of things you can no longer do and dwelling on that. It takes some time to discover there are gifts that come along with being forced to change your lifestyle. You have to slow down and readdress what you really want out of life within new parameters and it can lead to a time of great insight and self-improvement. For example, I can't train horses now, but have this awesome chance to explore art and writing in between hot baths and improving my cooking. Small but fulfilling activities are no longer taken for granted. 

I would highly recommend 'Managing Pain Before if Manages You' by dr Margaret Caudill and 'The Pain Chronicles' by Melanie Thernstrom. The first is a proven effective workbook and the second is a well-written and relatable journalist piece.
