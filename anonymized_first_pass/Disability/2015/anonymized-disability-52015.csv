It's not a psychological thing at all, it's like a signal feedback loop in your actual nervous system.

10,"First I want to say that I think you're having a very normal reaction to a very abnormal situation. Your parents should be helping you become more independent now, at this important time of your life (young adulthood!) and not stringing you along with promises and maybe-laters. I get survival mode, but unfortunately life still goes on in survival mode and from what you've said (very articulately!), your parents appear to be hindering you at every turn. 

First off, finances. YOU need to be in charge of your money. You are a capable adult, and it's time for your parents to give you your money. Since they can't be trusted to give you a straight answer, I suggest getting in touch with social security. They have an online chat but what they can do online is limited. See what they can do to help and explain your communication needs. You need your own bank account so you can use PayPal and manage your own finances however you like. It concerns me that you parents are only giving you a few bucks a month. 

Second, education: I'm like you and did better in classrooms and with focused instruction. I tried a coursera course once and it was almost as good. It might be worth it to try coursera or EdX, where there's lectures and homework, and it's free. Plus there's interacting with other students via message boards. 

It also concerns me that your parents won't make your home more accessible. Portable ramps are an option, and something you could bring with you if you move. But in any case, being kept prisoner by your parents (whether it's deliberate on their part or not) is very unacceptable. Your desire for independence is normal and reasonable and it's infuriating to me (a complete stranger) that your parents are dismissive of your needs. 

If you have a department of rehabilitation in your state, it might be worth calling them to see if you could work with them by phone or email. The one in my state is a pain in the ass but they will pay for home modifications that fit your needs. (If you're going to move soon, they could give you portable mods you can take with you. Including power chairs and accessible vans, along with ramps.) their whole goal is to get you employed. 

I wish you the best of luck. My heart goes out to you. You are a very articulate and intelligent young person and this world needs more people like you. Keep pushing!",False,False,t1_cr4lll4,loveinvein,crip,0,1431276053,t5_2qhe8,t3_35f8vz,t3_35f8vz,3,1432879293,0,0,cr4lll4,disability,3,,,,

I've never actually been to a bank. Parents talked about setting me up with a checking account and debit card--after we move.

The good news is the friend above set me up with a joint bank account through an online-only bank when I was 18.

He wanted to get me used to having/handling money, and I use it to pay my MMO subscription(s) mostly. I have a PayPal account as well, but not much incentive to use it besides website testing, when I can just input the card and use it instead.

42,"Thank you! 

When I first started to have to face facts about my disability and call in an occupational therapist to help me with my job I heard this bullshit way too much. 

I was working as a rigger,  but I was losing strength in my muscles due to muscle fatigue and I was requiring crutches or a wheelchair to mobilise. 

I thought I was going to be coached on other career options of things I like to do and physically can do.

Instead I was told about all the ways in which a wheelchair user can still be a rigger.  I was given different tools and shown how ropes can  be used to allow my chair to be used in a lighting grid.  For those who are not following along, my occupational therapist suggested I hire a rigger to rig a rig for my chair so that I would not lose my job as a rigger.  The OT must have been thinking ""look at me,  I just got two people into the work force for the price of one""  meanwhile,  any employer in the world is thinking ""why would I hire the one in the chair and an able bodied rigger when I can just have the able bodied one and write just one pay check"" 

So no.  You can't do anything.

Here's my advice for you regarding the SSI issues:

1. Call the SSI office for your state and explain your situation (other posters have given more detailed info regarding this so I won't repeat it here)
2. Contact a program like United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) or Vocational Rehab (Voc Rehab). They can help with things like getting a ramp and a vehicle.

Regarding Your Emotional State:

1. You're justified feeling the way you feel given the situation you're in.
2. To help improve things in the here-and-now, I would try and do some exercises. I understand that your hands and upper body are limited, but you can still exercise with resistance bands (arms), grip strength trainers, and (my favorite) silly putty. Seriously, play with that stuff for extended periods of time while you sit at your computer and it'll help with hand coordination (pull it, stretch it, make it into shapes, etc.)

3. Never forget that you live in the future :D The magic of the internet means your can reach out to people and organizations willing to help you from anywhere in the world. No matter where you are, you have a community. 

Other notes:

I've been in the SSI trap. It sucks, but ultimately it's better for you to get steady work then depend on payments from SSI. There's a ton of companies who need copyright work and there's good money in that. Google around and you'll find something. Maybe there's a disability blog that would pay you to write or edit for them. Put together a portfolio of your work and post it online. 

A Final Note About the Exercise Thing:

I'm super serious about the exercise thing. You know what one of the main killers of people with CP is (beyond stuff like infections or ninja attacks)? Fucking heart failure. Seriously.

61,"Yeowch -- I've been there. Like, almost exactly there. Talk to someone (either that doctor or a new one) about patella alignment. Or better yet, there's a whole online community full of people with weird bad knees that can explain the concepts better -- check out http://www.kneeguru.co.uk/KNEEtalk/

The ten-second version is, everybody's knees are ever-so-slightly different, because your hips, femur, tibia, ankles, and patella are all 'not perfectly straight' in slightly different ways. This is not usually a problem, but an injury (even a minor one) can screw up that alignment. If your kneecap is sliding a milimeter left of where it used to, you'll be able to tell because it hurts -- and no one will be able to see that on an X-ray or MRI, because those are stationary images and the problem is related to motion. There are treatment options available -- kneeguru's consensus is that ""Lateral Release,"" the first thing most doctors want to try, is *really bad* (my own experience backs that up, but that's anecdotal). Other better options exist.

HOWEVER.

The skin involvement can also point to CRPS/RSD, which is a nerve dysfunction usually triggered by injuries (even minor one), or the surgeries to correct them. That's typically a burning pain. It does **not** explain the popping/clicking/mechanical pain, but it can coexist beside ~~real~~ **STRUCTURAL** (edit: crps is extremely real) problems and throw a wrench in the whole treatment plan. You want to talk to your primary doctor about seeing a pain specialist so they can look at that -- and you want to do that soon, because if you let it develop, CRPS/RSD is **bad news bears**. 

So, your checklist should be:

1. Make sure you're keeping up with prescribed actions -- if there's PT, do your exercises, if you're supposed to be resting and icing, rest and ice, take pills, etc. 

2. Talk to your doctor about alignment. If s/he doesn't (or can't) address those concerns, get a referral to someone who will or can. 

3. Get in a pain management program, possibly through your orthopedic surgeon, but possibly through a PCM -- not sure, but get there. They can treat or rule out CRPS, and also they're the ones typically best suited to making your daily life less painfully miserable.

He also mentioned that they can reduce or raise the components of the sources depending on certain factors (like whether I'm on my own or have a carer) and that was confusing. So it seems the presence of survivor benefits impacts how much disability I get.

96,"...possibly.

SSI has a different income restriction than SSDI.  SSI takes away money on a 2-for-1 basis (that is, after a certain amount, for every $2 you make they remove $1 of benefit. it's to encourage people to try to work).  

HOWEVER.

The situation becomes weirder when it's not the recipient who is bringing in money.  I think [THINK! do not take this as gospel!] that money you brought in would be treated the same way as if she got a job - she'd be getting income from ""rent"" you paid.

That said.  SSDI also has a limit, you can't bring in more than $1090/month (at this time) of outside income.  The limit is hard; anything more means you are suspended from SSDI.

I suggest that you or your mom needs to talk to the SSA about this. I'm pretty sure that if you were paying, say, $500/month in rent that any ""hit"" to their SSDI or SSI would be negligible, at best.   But I'm not an expert on this, so I cannot be sure.

99,"I've been in a similar situation. The first time I reconnected with this friend, shortly after he'd begun using a wheelchair, he flaked on me for three months before I showed up on his porch one day and wouldn't leave. We've been close ever since. The process of helping my friend find his spark for life again has required a lot of pushiness, but the tough love and lack of pity always came from a place that loved him and believed in him. If you are a true friend to this guy, don't let him wallow forever. 
Though my friend will sometimes revert back into a depressed state for a few days or a week, not leaving the house or cleaning his room or caring about life, I must stay patient and remind him that I won't ever just give up on him and leave him alone. 
Hold your friend accountable if he bails on plans or mopes around; give him a reason to try. Living with a disability, particularly using a wheelchair, is a tough road to hoe, but there's no reason your friend can't lead a full and wonderful life. A person who's wheelchair-bound that never leaves home can't inspire anyone, but there is something really attractive and awesome about people with disabilities who are confident and happy.

Your household needs a budget.  Get them to tell you what the major expenses are.  Rent/Mortgage? Insurance? Car payments? Electricity and/or Gas? Water? Sewage? Taxes?  Start paying attention to the grocery bill receipts.  See what money goes where.

Then start a basic budget. Google spreadsheets will do.   On the left, list each expense.  On the right, have one column of ""expected expense"" and one next to it for ""actual expense.""  If you want, you can make it so you can have multiple ""actuals"" that add up into an ""actual total,"" then set both actual and expected up to total at the bottom.

Then you can start seeing where the money is going, and where, if necessary, you need to either cut back or supplement.

171,"FWIW - At the start of the last economic crisis in the US, the number of claims for SSDI &amp; SSI shot up very quickly. The main reason for this appears to be that disabled people were now competing for jobs with the non-disabled, and often, perhaps due to the myth that disabled people ""cost more"" to employ, the non-disabled were getting hired first.  Suddenly there were far more disabled people unable to find work. 


A lot of these jobs were lower-paid positions taken by people who had once been qualified for different work but now weren't able to do it, which technically makes you qualified for SSDI.

178,"Cool idea! Some of things I would have liked to talk about as a teen and would have helped me are:

- Issues around self-esteem both in terms of learning to accept and love your body and in terms of learning that you have intrinsic value as a human being despite what society might tell you.

- Relationships and sexuality, that they're ok, that you can have them too and how to be comfortable and safe in them. 

- Coping with the enormous levels of anxiety that we have to face when trying to gain independence. Sometimes I felt like I was juggling far too many balls at once and I was very overwhelmed straight out of high school so preparing for that. Perhaps starting to talk about what resources are available and how to access that sort of thing.

- Finding out where you stand in the disabled community and understanding what disability means to you on an emotional level. For a long time I wanted nothing to do with the disabled community or issues around disability and I discovered over time that my reasons for that were more about my own insecurities than anything else. That's not to say that all people who want nothing to do with ""the community"" have insecurities about their disability but I personally just wish I'd had the chance to talk about it and process my thoughts better and be told that I can choose to live my life however I want to. For example, it's ok to want to advocate for disabled rights and it's also ok not to want to. That whole process was really confusing and difficult for me and I still feel like it's a contentious issue between people. I think it would be great to show people that you can have different opinions or outlooks but still support and accept each other.

- In general - discussions about everything. Every day life. Things going on in the world that affect us. Just talking stuff through with other people can really shape the way you see things.

183,"Academically, I did very well in school--I actually liked taking tests and getting high scores; sympathetic teachers would give me access to more challenging material. When I got out of school, that directed learning stopped--and I realized that the way I learn requires somebody to be there explaining it, demonstrating it, writing things out and talking. I've had people direct me to online tutorials, but I don't seem to retain as much--and although I'm computer-savvy, code is like Greek to me. Think the furthest I got was with codecademy's Ruby course--but my brain says ""this is just fancy math, I can do this in my head faster than I can type it."" 

It's probably indicating that I need to change my approach, and I'm sure if I spent many hours and bashed my head against the keyboard a few times, I might get it.

One thing my friend and I considered was working on oDesk, or similar, but the postings seemed ""shady"" to me--broken English, unclear specifications. I'm quickly learning that you can find just about anything on Reddit and that it is quite helpful, so I'm definitely going to poke around. That in itself is a good use of time!

I am good with the software-troubleshooting side of computers and probably could make good money helping the technologically illiterate... things like setting up Windows, troubleshooting software, installing difficult programs or working around issues. My friends call me ""Internet Helpdesk,"" and one pays me with Steam games.

I also can write well (I did article copywriting for my friend's business, but I prefer the creative side), and I can proof anything. If my physical stats are minimized, well, writing's what I maxed out. 

Generally, I have a very fast turnover time and have the advantage of being available at any time of day. The only thing that concerns me with respect to work are taxes and the logistics of getting paid, but I want to sort this out when I call the office on Monday.

Regarding chairs, I was one of those kids who had doctors and PTs grossly advise against a powerchair for the sake of my arms, which were very strong before I got out of school. I can't lift more than 5lb, but I can pull large weights. These days my manual chair is a glorified computer chair, and I'd like to be able to exercise with it again, hence wanting a ramp. 

If I do get a physical job, I would like to get a powerchair, just to travel long distances. I've only had 3 or so chairs, and the most recent one, about 6-7 years old, came after a lot of hubbabaloo with AAAMedical--they tried to get me to switch chair brands and features and basically gave my family the runaround.

People say I am mostly intelligible, but that I tend to ""mumble"", which sounds like a normal volume to my sensitive ears. I think I sound like a simultaneously drunk and stoned 12-year old if I hear myself over a mic, which has left me self-conscious. That alone affects my speech, which regrettably isn't as verbose as this--my spoken register doesn't feel """"natural"" to me, I guess?

I have a fear of telephones and calling businesses due to not having regularly used one growing up--we had a 10 minute rule when I was a kid that made me just not bother. I've only recently started to make my own calls for things such as appointments, and hearing the SS offices ask for me makes me nervous (but I plan to work on it.)

I do host VOIP/Skype calls regularly and have a Google Voice number--if I'm comfortable I can VOIP for hours, since it doesn't tire my arm like holding a phone does. It could be possible to work through VOIP as well, but my house is small and has a lot of background noise from my parents and their dogs...

I'm more comfortable with email/IM until I trust a person, though.

197,"The mental health services organization I looked up last night also offers various forms of advocacy and vocational training/community service assistance in addition to therapy, so this seems good. (It also offers services at the same hospital/healthcare unit I get my dental work done at, which is convenient.)

I went and spoke with my dad about this a few minutes ago, and, aside from him being more open about the idea of therapy than I'd thought, the conversation went as expected. To start off with, I brought up the idea of upgrading my computer, which gives some context as to how our conversations usually go:

(My parents pay me $50-100$ a month depending on expenses as a goodwill gesture, which I save up and sometimes use for the odd game here and there. I've got about $400, and I have a friend in California who provides me with hardware I'd otherwise be unable to get or afford. He offered to build me a new computer if I'd help by covering some of the part costs, but I'd need to find a way to get the cash to him, so I was going to ask my dad about sending a money order.)

When I told him I was thinking about upgrading my hardware, he asked why. I tried to explain to him the reasons that gamers opt for new hardware. He then said, predictably, to just wait until my stepmother's mom passes, we sell the house, and I get a new system then, when we move. Everything always goes back to this, complete with the same old spiel about how this is our last year here and we don't have long to go. This answer is so useless it's almost funny, which made him ask why I was laughing. I used that to segue into needing therapy, explaining that this, again, is really wearing on me.

To put my dad's line of thought another way, he's never stopped or forbidden me expressly from doing anything. In that way, it seems like his heart is in the right place, but my attempts to be proactive always get disparaged rather than encouraged. It's like he feels there is no point to trying to improve my life NOW, rather than later, and the paradisical descriptions of what my life will be like when we move back to WA are a cure-all bandaid. 

He says that he can't do anything physically to really help me until my stepmother's parents are gone and we have money. My parents have no real issue, it seems, with taking me to appointments or picking up items for me (although I'd rather shop for myself, because they tend to get the wrong things.) 

He ended this conversation with the usual warning about how we don't have much savings left from a car repair earlier in the year, and we may need that money in case something else breaks. It has the unintended effect of making me feel self conscious about the money I've ""saved"" for myself, and makes me feel like I can't use it.

I really, really, really hate being poor. I've read that there's a certain amount of money you can make as a disabled person before your benefits are cut (8k a year?) and even that would be way more than I'd need. I'm hoping that those services can educate me about the matter, and maybe, as you said, provide me with some form of job.

My dad also pointed out that they've offered to each me how to do things before, but I've never asked, and I myself can't remember such an offer. It's very hard for me to engage either of them in conversation because I don't feel I can articulate as well as I can through text, and years of habit has reduced my conversations with them to scripts with loads of stuttering and none of the advanced vocabulary I pride myself on. And teaching me would be difficult--the kitchen counters are way too high and there's not enough room for my chair to turn around. I'd probably improve a lot if I could get life skills training, which I'm hoping those services can provide. I'm going to call them on Monday--at the very least it'd get me out of the house.

This is a much, much longer reply than I'd anticipated, but as one last addendum I've kind of been afraid of group homes. I worry they'll force me into a schedule or infringe upon my privacy. The only advantage of living with my parents is that they generally keep to themselves, watching TV or sleeping and thus leaving me to my own devices. When I'm not depressed and actually enjoying the computer, I'm fine spending my time in front of it--and maybe, like a lot of things, I'm misinformed about what it's actually like to live in a good one.

Here's something from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's FAQ on the Americans with Disability Act:  
 ""Q. Should I tell my employer that I have a disability?  
A. If you think you will need a reasonable accommodation in order to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions, you should inform the employer that an accommodation will be needed. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation only for the physical or mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability of which they are aware. Generally, it is the responsibility of the employee to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.""

So I think as long as you feel like there will be accommodation required, you should disclose pretty early. I don't want to make any assumptions, but I would think that it may be important to explain why you may need to hear directions a few times, depending on what the training process is like where you're trying to work.  
It sounds like you have a good idea of how to get people to repeat/rephrase things, and if you are up front about needing an employer/trainer to do that, most reasonable people wouldn't find that a problem. Honestly, in a new job, it wouldn't hurt to hear things several times.  
You may want to consider asking them to print out some training material for you, if they don't usually. As accommodations go, that one is just so simple and easy! I'd suggest that for any employer anyway.  
I don't know if any of that helps. Some of your choices may depend on the specific job you're interviewing and applying for-- it may help to tailor your approach based on that.

About being paired with a certain doctor.
it's because at the first stages of injury I was extremely emotion not to mention horribly negative. Also I wasn't very open to the idea of surgery. mostly because, not all surgeons here can be trusted. So I was afraid he'd do more damage than harm. Example. Instead of sewing a meniscus tears some doctors here will take out the entire thing. When you're under anesthesia you don't have a say on what will or will not happen. They'll also take half of it off when they could have just sown it. That made me afraid of pursing an operation that I possibly needed. However now that I am open to the idea (because I really do want to get better) the doctor is resisting me when I ask if I need an operation or arthroscopic examination. And keeps brushing me off.

245,"Some therapists will kick you off after you get better to a point. Insist that you are not better, keep copies of all medical records and ask them for copies of their reports. Go through their notes and gather whatever info you can, educate yourself. I would look for other doctors and PTs if no one will listen. If a PT is not meeting your needs, perhaps ask to speak with the office or clinic manager, state that your current PT is ""not a good fit"" and perhaps they could recommend someone more enthusiastic? 

I am going to guess here but your knee swelling may be due to fluid going to your knee. My PT explained that when the knee is hurt the body's natural reaction is to surround it with fluid to protect it. It takes WEEKS, even months for fluid to go away. It can cause a tight feeling and may even cause your knee to look bigger. Any PT who is worth anything will measure your knee's ability to bend and also how far flat you can lay your leg. For example with my broken ligament I could not lay my leg down flat. My PT also measured around my leg and knee so we had a measurable way to see if the swelling went down, which it did. Icing and elevating can also help reduce the fluid but you would have to ask the PT how many times to ice per day and how long. 

I wish you good luck, knee injuries are a pain in the ass and a really slow process. But, if you buckle down with more work and research, you will most certainly get to a better place mentally, if not physically as well.

294,"If you've been on SSA-administered payments since childhood, that's SSI.  SSDI is something you have to pay into. It's possible that your father is collecting SSDI if he worked for some years.  Because SSI doesn't come from working, the payments are smaller than the SSDI payments.  The basic SSI payments are (IIRC) generated on things like your living conditions (eg. who do you live with?  But I'm pretty sure a carer does not count!), your assets, and if you are working. 

Ticket to Work is nothing to be afraid of.  You report wages by calling them on the phone and telling them how much you make. After  you make a certain amount, they reduce your SSI payment by $1 for every $2 you make.  *The idea is to keep you solvent*, not to punish you for working. They *want* to help you start working and keep you working, if that's possible for you.  They're there to help.

As to home visits, again, not something to be afraid of. They're not there to rush you off to some group home. They're more likely there to see what kind of accommodations you need and to help you get them.  

And as for getting a job in another state -- why wouldn't they help?  SSA is run by the federal government, not the states. You might have to (re)apply in the new states for things like Medicaid and SNAP (which are state-run), if you qualify for those, but the SSA only wants to know where you live. There's no restriction on moving from state to state.

That led to a whole host of health problems and I look back at my teen self and I feel angry that I allowed myself to internalize that negativity from society because ultimately it has only hurt me and let's be honest, nobody with a disability needs more problems. I certainly didn't and I regret the good years I wasted on the self-hate, low self-esteem, anxiety and depression over my body, fits of rage when I didn't look how I imagined myself to be and the energy I expended on that instead of all the other things I could have been doing.

I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing a therapist if that is a financial possibility for you. It really helped me realize quite a few things. I don't know if that is a possibility for you so I just want to say that I recommend you spend some time thinking about your body. Sometimes, self-consciousness can spill over into self-disgust and that's really what you want to try to tackle because if you can get over that then you can stop viewing yourself from the outside and just be at ease with yourself. Be honest about what it is that bothers you. For me, I just felt that my body from the neck to the waist was disfigured and broken. And you know what? It is. I have scoliosis. I have a huge scar from my neck to my waist. Above and below my chest are not proportional to each other. But you know what else? This body has survived a lot, it has been good to me. The scar means something to me. As weak and broken as my body is, it is also incredibly strong and resilient in its own way. It has got me this far and deserves to be treated with kindness and love, not criticism and disgust. I used to cringe because this just seems so cliche but fuck that, it's true.

Instead 20 minutes before the ceremony, a teacher comes up to my mother to inform her that Mr. Williams was not letting A.J walk across the stage because his shoes are not in dress code. My mother went to Mr. Williams to discuss this, he became aggressive with her and he screamed into her face until he finally said that if he saw A.J there that night; Mr. Williams would have him arrested. Not one thing had taken place for him to make such a threat. Mr. Williams knows A.J s situation. He knows about the accident, he knows that he must wear special shoes due to the injuries that he sustained to his left foot due to an accident. He is aware of a lot of the surgeries that A.J had to his foot just to get it to where it is now. This child’s foot is over 1 shoe size smaller than the other, it has a plate holding the arch in place and not counting many other pins throughout it. His foot has a knot on the top side of his foot about the size of half an orange. He has a very hard time finding any shoes that fit comfortably. The shoe cannot put pressure on it in one way or another. He cannot wear boots, dress shoes or even most tennis shoes. As my mother was trying to explain the plethora of documentation that has been submitted to the school all the way up to now, that is when he got very hostile towards her. One of A.J s teachers who relocated a couple of years ago made a special trip to see him walk across that stage and instead had to try to comfort him on the day that should have been the biggest milestone that he had reached to this point. As I watched some of the students walk that path I saw numerous of them not in dress code one child had on a pair of brown cowboy boots on. Even if he did not have this disability, why would you make a big scene over a pair of shoes on such a big day, you did not do it to the other students so why single him out? Instead you took this very important day away from him, one that he will never be able to get back. He went home crushed. We as his family and close friends had to try to pick up the pieces and let him know that WE ARE PROUD OF HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED! We did turn this heartbreaking experience into something great by the end of the night, but I just really want to know why would you single him out once again and be a bully about it, I really thought that you were there to help our children. I have attached the photo of one of the students that was not in dress code to this. 
Sincerely,
A very disappointed mother.~""

She is very appreciative of people's response and truly wishes this can teach a lesson to other schools out there on civility and compassion.  I encourage you all to share this on your social media sites to send a shot of knowledge to other administrators that IDEA and ADA do not just apply to the class room but to all activities non-disable children are able to enjoy.   

I fought my battles with my son's educational process and worked 20 years in child avocation. This stuck me to the core because I know a lot of this town reflects the action of the school and it is just one of thousands small school systems across the US that find special needs or disabilities as a ""bother"" or ""taking away from 'normal' students."" So much progress has been made in may areas since we began our journey in 1990. This just hurt my heart to see it still happen 25 years later :(

He knows about the accident, he knows that he must wear special shoes due to the injuries that he sustained to his left foot due to an accident. He is aware of a lot of the surgeries that A.J had to his foot just to get it to where it is now. This child’s foot is over 1 shoe size smaller than the other, it has a plate holding the arch in place and not counting many other pins throughout it. His foot has a knot on the top side of his foot about the size of half an orange. He has a very hard time finding any shoes that fit comfortably. The shoe cannot put pressure on it in one way or another. He cannot wear boots, dress shoes or even most tennis shoes. As my mother was trying to explain the plethora of documentation that has been submitted to the school all the way up to now, that is when he got very hostile towards her. One of A.J s teachers who relocated a couple of years ago made a special trip to see him walk across that stage and instead had to try to comfort him on the day that should have been the biggest milestone that he had reached to this point. As I watched some of the students walk that path I saw numerous of them not in dress code one child had on a pair of brown cowboy boots on. Even if he did not have this disability, why would you make a big scene over a pair of shoes on such a big day, you did not do it to the other students so why single him out? Instead you took this very important day away from him, one that he will never be able to get back. He went home crushed. We as his family and close friends had to try to pick up the pieces and let him know that WE ARE PROUD OF HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>! We did turn this heartbreaking experience into something great by the end of the night, but I just really want to know why would you single him out once again and be a bully about it, I really thought that you were there to help our children. I have attached the photo of one of the students that was not in dress code to this. 
Sincerely,
A very disappointed mother.~""

She is very appreciative of people's response and truly wishes this can teach a lesson to other schools out there on civility and compassion.  I encourage you all to share this on your social media sites to send a shot of knowledge to other administrators that IDEA and ADA do not just apply to the class room but to all activities non-disable children are able to enjoy.   

I fought my battles with my son's educational process and worked 20 years in child avocation. This stuck me to the core because I know a lot of this town reflects the action of the school and it is just one of thousands small school systems across the <LOCATION> that find special needs or disabilities as a ""bother"" or ""taking away from 'normal' students."" So much progress has been made in may areas since we began our journey in 1990. This just hurt my heart to see it still happen 25 years later :(

Thanks again and know it was appreciated.

346,"If this is all new for him I can imagine he feels daunted by how to live a normal life as well as embarrassed. I cannot actually imagine being able-bodied and then having to adapt to a whole new way of life as I've always been disabled. However, it's a constant learning process for all of us! 

Maybe talk to him and ask him what's going through his mind. Maybe he has worries that he's not voicing like ""How would I get to that bar?"" or ""What if we end up going to a place that isn't accessible and then everybody realizes that they can't go inside because of me?"". If you really want to help, I suggest going to some effort to think about how you will answer these when and if he asks. For example, maybe you need to scout out your area and see which old and new hangout places are accessible, think about the transportation involved to get there etc. Then you can present him with a list and say 'look dude, X, Y and Z are accessible, let's go there on the weekend, I've planned it all, we're going to take this bus which is accessible etc...'.

If that doesn't work, you can organize a get together at his house perhaps. Invite some of your group over, do whatever it is you guys like to do. Hang out, chat, eat some junk, whatever. Show him that socially, nothing has really changed. That might make him more open to the idea of going out when you bring it up again.

If all that fails, you might need to go nuclear. I'm afraid that disabled people sometimes just need to hear some tough love. How you phrase that and how firm you are about it is up to you and how well you know your friend as well as how long it has been since the accident. Sometimes it can be too soon for that. That's something you could maybe consider down the line. 

Until then, all you can do is be patient and show him that he's not alone by helping him find ways to adapt to his new life. Disability can be very isolating at times and sometimes those who aren't disabled might not be able to understand why.

353,"My guess is they want to be exempt because they don't want to ever be subject to lawsuits. Since it's all contracted out, a single driver being a jerk could make the whole company liable for a *looooot* of money. To prevent that they'd have to add lots of barriers to who could be a driver -- screening, training, etc. The app guys want no part in any of that, they just want to connect drivers to riders and make money (and that's really not an unreasonable goal for a company to have).

From the comments here and elsewhere though I'm gathering that they've pushed back on special categories or whatever that would allow drivers and riders to solve the problem on their own.... THAT seems like something Uber the app should have to fix. Jerk drivers also need to be fixed (though I assume that already happens naturally -- the driver from this article would have to be *racking up* nasty reviews and will -- if the system works as advertised -- be barred from the service in the near future). 

Anyway Uber wants to be exempt because they want the drivers to assume all the liability, responsibility, and whatever else.

Now that is a constant scare, and when I feel odd sensations in the knee, things like that are constantly replaying in my head. (Like there sometimes  is a feeling like something is 'pinching' onto something. scares me alot. And it's at the injury site.

437,"My suggestion would be to try to find a different doctor to see. I'm not sure how things work in the US (I am presuming you're in the US, of course), but it took me years to find a doctor who'd refer me on to a specialist. ""Thankfully"", my mom also has the same condition as me, so it was relatively straightforward to get a diagnosis once I was seeing the right person.

My condition also doesn't show up on any tests. It's called fibromyalgia, and you basically have to test for everything else, and if it's not those things, it's FM. I don't think you have fibromyalgia from what you've said, but do take heart in that sometimes you just need to exhaust every other option before you get to the real issue.

I would strongly advise getting a walking stick or a crutch. Firstly, it will help you to take some weight off your leg if you need it, but also it'll make your condition more obvious and, to some people more legitimate. It might be hard to pluck up the courage to go buy one, or to even go out of the house with one, but part of the reason I use a crutch is so that people know there's something wrong with me, and that I am ""legitimately"" asking for a seat if I need one on the bus or train. Invisible disabilities are really difficult to deal with, so that's why I choose to make mine visible with the crutch. In some ways, it's me taking ownership of my condition, recognising that it can affect me quite badly, but that I am still going to get out and do stuff.

If you don't feel able to get a proper stick or crutch, you could get a foldable/collapseable stick, [like this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adjustable-Aluminium-Folding-Walking-81-92cm/dp/B001EGLIFA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431776774&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=foldable+stick). It means you can keep it in your bag, and can pop it out really easily for when you need it.

Once you get a diagnosis, things will improve, both medically and mentally. Once you know what's wrong, you'll be able to make a plan to deal with it, either via rehabilitation or pain management. As someone else suggested, seeing a physiotherapist could really help, or potentially a pain management specialist (not sure what they're called in the US).

In regards to feeling lonely, I'd say that you've got every right to feel crap about it as you've been dealt a pretty rubbish set of cards... but things will improve. My previous partner felt that he couldn't deal with my disability, and was overwhelmed and confused by it, as I had started out perfectly physically able, but had gotten much worse since we were together. However, my current partner is absolutely wonderful - he helps and understands me and loves me despite my disability. You'll find someone for you, and as long as you're upfront about your condition, it won't come as a surprise to someone.

It might be hard to pluck up the courage to go buy one, or to even go out of the house with one, but part of the reason I use a crutch is so that people know there's something wrong with me, and that I am ""legitimately"" asking for a seat if I need one on the bus or train. Invisible disabilities are really difficult to deal with, so that's why I choose to make mine visible with the crutch. In some ways, it's me taking ownership of my condition, recognising that it can affect me quite badly, but that I am still going to get out and do stuff.

If you don't feel able to get a proper stick or crutch, you could get a foldable/collapseable stick, [like this](<URL>). It means you can keep it in your bag, and can pop it out really easily for when you need it.

Once you get a diagnosis, things will improve, both medically and mentally. Once you know what's wrong, you'll be able to make a plan to deal with it, either via rehabilitation or pain management. As someone else suggested, seeing a physiotherapist could really help, or potentially a pain management specialist (not sure what they're called in the <LOCATION>).

In regards to feeling lonely, I'd say that you've got every right to feel crap about it as you've been dealt a pretty rubbish set of cards... but things will improve. My previous partner felt that he couldn't deal with my disability, and was overwhelmed and confused by it, as I had started out perfectly physically able, but had gotten much worse since we were together. However, my current partner is absolutely wonderful - he helps and understands me and loves me despite my disability. You'll find someone for you, and as long as you're upfront about your condition, it won't come as a surprise to someone. If someone rejects you just because you can't walk very well, then they clearly aren't a kind and loving person, and you should move on.","[{'start': 2059, 'end': 2069, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1608, 'end': 1613, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 142, 'end': 152, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 101, 'end': 111, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I know depression can be crippling but it's usually treatable and people with it can lead productive lives.  If things go well you may then be able to start taking some college level classes.

I do not believe that anyone is going to ""put you in a home"" as long as you are cognizant of your own issues.  There are plenty of people with CP who live on their own. 

As you're over 18 your SSI payments should be going directly to YOU.  Contact the SSA to fix this. 

There's a lot out there to help you, even in rural nowheresville :-).  Disability-supportive housing exists (though it often has a year+ waiting list).  There are programs that help low-income people on SSI with food, utilities, housing, medical care, and more.  

The SSA also has programs to help people get a job, from training to helping you with a job search.  This includes paying for accommodations like getting a powered wheelchair and even help getting a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  

To echo what someone else said, finding a social worker is a good first step.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you ""You can't do that.""  You can; you just need to find the right folks to help you.

SSI is for people who have no or low income who have not paid enough in to the Social Security system, whether because they have not worked enough hours or because they were self-employed and did not pay into the system.   SSI is funded solely by federal government funding.

SSDI is for people who have paid into the system by at least some minimum amount. The amount you get monthly depends on how much you've paid in, with an upper limit.  Because it's funded by money you've paid into it, the amount you get is typically more than SSI.

So I did some windsurfing (but my knee was feeling better for it gets better and not better at random, not sure why) and it was just fine.

472,"Ok, let me talk to you from a personal experience. I have mild CP, I use a set of forearm canes to get around, but in general it does not impact my life as long as you don't ask me to walk with heavy objects or expect me to run a marathon. 

I got a job in undergrad as a research assistant working for a professor I had taken classes with before. Importantly I figured there wouldn't be any issues with him because he knew me in person, and for the most part I physically ""pass"" The jo description was basically ""you are a research assistant, you and a bunch of other newbie research assistant undergrads who know nothing will be trained up on how to use equipment and whatever you have a knack for will become your project""

Importantly everyone who worked that summer knew nothing about research, and nothing was really expected of them initially.

Essentially the first few weeks were essentially training rotations where they would take us around to work on x, or shadow someone working on x so we could understand how to do x. Well everyone but me. From the start, with noo exceptional programming experience (at least no more than the rest of the incoming cohort) I was put on all the programming jobs, essentially skipping out on most of the training rotations. When I was included in those training rotations I was basically stuck in a corner to watch while everyone else got the hands on experience. In essence my boss thought I couldn't do shit, and instead of putting me in the ""awkward"" situation of maybe asking me to do something I couldn't do he chose to play incredibly safe and assume the only things I could do involved sitting. This left me with far fewer skills than my cohort after a few weeks, and my coworkers were (understandably) pissed because they were doing work I should be doing (except I was never trained so I actually couldn't do the work efficiently now).

In the end I got so demoralized by the entire ordeal that by the latter half of the summer I ended up half assing my work, which seemed pointless compared to the work my cohort was doing, and all because of my boss playing it uber safe.

In the end I wish I had had the balls to go and confront my boss about this, but I never wanted to stir shit up/ I;m sure he would have just acted defensive about it.

tl;dr the problem may not be how to answer questions that come your way, but how to force conversations about your disability to prevent ignorance from discriminating against you. ",False,False,t1_cqutbru,slam7211,,0,1430466175,t5_2qhe8,t3_34gn04,t3_34gn04,1,1432709381,0,0,cqutbru,disability,1,,,,

485,"""How will I even get married at this point? Why is that a concern? Because I was already turned down by someone.

I might have a shallow perspective on life but I really don't know how to find a good person who will look past all of that.
How do I become good enough where people can look past this?""

1. Some people will never look past a disability. Some people will never be willing to date someone with a disability. And some people will judge and reject you because of a disability. This, I believe, is actually an advantage of disability. It acts as a built in shitty-human detector. Automatically people are weeded out for you and eventually you'll look around and realize that the people who are in your life are vastly more awesome than everyone else because they won't give a damn about the disability. It doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt at first. It's a huge thing to come to terms with - that people will judge and reject you for something you can't control and even when you come to terms with it, it'll still surprise you and hurt you from time to time. But, like I said, I think it's a blessing to have something that saves me the time and effort of dealing with shitty people.

2. I have a very serious disability and use a power wheelchair. I've been married for 8 years. Marriage is not out of the cards for you. 

3. You don't have to become ""good enough"". You have to try your best to be a good person and try your best to make peace with your life and any limitations in it. A therapist might be useful for you because you're engaging in really damning thought patterns that I recognize from my own attempts to make peace with my disability.

509,"This is a really moving article. Thank you so much for sharing it. I hadn't seen it before. 

To ramble a little in response...

I think that there is such a shame (for me at least) with being dependent on family, friends and the government. There is also great fear, because with benevolence comes the ability for someone to withdraw their help. 

When caregivers start to feel like they're working for me as a favor rather than as a job, then they often perceive my dependence more acutely and my ability to direct and to choose my life is taken away. But with the county paying below a living wage in my area, don't they have to have a certain amount of benevolence to work?

When my life is running well, I feel free and able to do what I want. My assistants are my arms and legs. My chair is my motion. The elevator is my stairs and the cars are my subway. 

But because there are so many more individualized supports in my life than there were before I got sick, there are more chances for them to go wrong. Some are as simple as an elevator, and some are more complex, like an intimate understanding of my day to day needs. 

Because of my illness, I lack flexibility to absorb failures. My body rejects me. It craves activities and then punishes me when I try them. My brain tries to reach for knowledge but is inconsistent in both memory and rationale. Each failure, internal or external, affects my health directly.

Only tiny things went wrong today, and I laugh, but am back in bed and feel my dependence acutely. ",False,False,t1_cr0gvf7,kwxt,,0,1430935919,t5_2qhe8,t3_34z4mp,t1_cqzxsp2,2,1432808047,0,0,cr0gvf7,disability,2,,,,

514,"I think a lot of us like to be independent, even when it comes to travel/flying, however had OP asked for help with the bag, it's likely none of this would have happened. This is why when I fly I take the approach that I am going to make myself as dependent on the airline as I can. This does two things. First, if they are made aware from the beginning that I will need help for just about everything, then I am more likely to get it. Tell the check-in agent. Tell the gate agent. When you pre-board, tell the flight attendants. Something like ""I promise I am not going to be very high maintenance for you but I will need help boarding, getting to my seat, and dealing with bags in the overhead compartment."" Second, if I have this rule in place for myself I am going to ask for help even where I might not have needed it in the real world. If you do this and combine it with a smile and a thankful attitude, you really are going to be more likely to be helped. The backup plan here IS your actual ability. If you ask a flight attendant for help with your bag and are flat out denied then you can go ahead and try yourself. Waiting for them to offer is really an ineffective way to get anything done on a plane. (Even though MOST of the flight attendants I have flown with have offered and have been great...but I think this was because I initially did let them know I would need it.)

I am reminded of that incident where the guy felt he had to crawl on or off the plane. Had he just stayed put and said, ""No I can't crawl!"" (even if he could have) they would have figured something else out and he would have neither been embarrassed or injured. 

This also goes for passing through security. There used to be a time when yes, I could have stood up from the wheelchair but it was difficult and annoying. When they would ask if I could stand, I'd just say ""No"" and that was it.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is not dependent on employment history. An individual can obtain SSI benefits even if they have never worked, as long as he or she fits the disability criteria.

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is the component of the Social Security program that is dependent on work history. 

Did your father work at all over the past decade? If so, there could be a slim chance he meets insurance coverage requirements for SSDI.

This may affect or prevent your father from receiving SSI cash benefits. While there is no work history requirement, there is a [resource cap on households]( http://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm).

Your father may be eligible for Medicaid. The Wisconsin Medicaid website can be found [here]( https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/index.htm).

None of those things are your fault nor are you obligated to help her work through her shit that actually causes you pain.

It's necessary to be standing for cadaver dissections, and it can make some parts of examinations easier when you see patients on a standard exam table. (palpating the abdomen or breast exams for example). AS far as the school making accommodations for me, they helped me find funding for the standing chair, and even paid for part of it. And the school arranged for me to take practical exams on my own instead of with the whole class. This is because questions are set up at each cadaver, like stations. And with only 60 seconds per questions, doing everything you need to stand, ID the part, and sit down is quite burdensome.

As for the disabled community, the problem is that there is one way to be able and 10,000 ways to be disabled. My wife's condition (CRPS) gives her different disabilities than someone with MS even if both might use a wheelchair at times. And both of them are differently disabled from someone who has no legs. Things that might be good for others (the bumps on sidewalk cutouts to slow down a chair) can be bad for her (the bumping is agony). And visa versa.

- what type of doctor are you seeing? Or what types of doctors have you seen? Specialists I would recommend are an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine doctor. 

- a lot of people don't understand how the knee is. You can't ""walk off"" a knee injury. It takes time. It takes a LOT of work. Did you ever have physical therapy? I had several months and did my exercises daily and it made a massive improvement. Although I do not know what parts of your knee are damaged, any PT may help at least reduce pain. I also did lots of ice therapy but under a PT's supervision. You can hurt yourself icing too much too. 

- DO NOT attempt other sports/impact exercises unless approved by your doctor. Knees take forever to do any healing and high impact activities such as running will exacerbate it. Now that I'm doing better, I prefer ""low impact"" activities such as swimming and cycling. These also help build the muscles *around* my knee which in turn supports my lack of a ligament. 

- you may need knee replacement surgery. Are you open to this? I know several people that have had them and are extremely happy with the results and even went back to some of their old activities. 

- with the knee being part of the skeletal system, you have to realize your knee could be affecting other parts of your body - alignment of your hip and spine, positioning of your feet....meanwhile if any of that is out of alignment it is constantly pulling your muscles out of position. After two years your muscles may have got used to being in an unnatural or distorted position. This all needs to get checked out.

And what I do get will have about 50,000 miles more.  So to put it simple, if I want to get the same car, I will be paying more money for a car that has more miles.  All because some lady didn't stop at a red light.  That's the frustrating part.  And my car is on the low end of the spectrum.  If I can't find a replacement of the same model, I'm going to have to look at fancier cars with suicide doors and that means I'm looking at paying almost double.

Sadly because of technology limitations, it's a really expensive thing to measure and diagnose accurately.

Focus on what matters for right now. Make sure you communicate with your attorney to ensure that he/she has all of your medical and mental health records. Stay current with your treatment. If any new developments occur, let your attorney know immediately.

When you get to your hearing, you're going to need to explain to the judge why you are disabled. Now is a good time to start thinking about that. You can tell the judge you have all these medical or mental health diagnoses, but why are they disabling? What about them prevents you from working?

Remember that disability, at least for Social Security, basically means you cannot perform any full-time work. This includes jobs like a surveillance systems monitor, e.g., someone who sits at a desk and watches security camera footage for eight hours per shift. 

Start thinking about why your conditions prevent you from doing a job like that. Talk with your attorney about this before the hearing. This way he/she can give you advice on how to phrase different things and he/she can remind you of any of these issues if you forget during the hearing.

701,"Quick update:

Called the office twice. First time was lunch hour, so I presumed they were out. Tried again a few minutes ago. Both times, the phone rings dozens of times until I decide to cut it off.

This is making me question the legitimacy of the site (or at least the phone number of that specific location. The particular building I am trying to contact is in one town, but their phone number has the area code of another, likely where the main office is.)

I know that small towns tend not to update their websites, if they even have any--but I was able to find some employee names on another page, and they still are listed as working there. Dad says they will go into town and check out the physical location to see if there's any specific business hours... but there wasn't even an answering machine.

If this doesn't work, my only other option as far as vocational rehab is concerned is to go to the state-level DVR, but the nearest state office is in a city an hour away. I suspect that the application and other processes would involve having to physically go there, which isn't possible. State DVR seems geared more towards finding permanent employment that would pay more than I'm looking for. I don't know how much they'd be able to help with a telecommuting job.

In the meantime, I'm considering ""alternative"" methods of work like one user mentioned, such as starting a blog. I looked around on PrestoExperts and almost made an account, but then I realized they need everyone to fill out a W9.... Not only do I not understand taxes, but I'm also concerned about the effect on my benefits were I to file.

You *can* live independently on that, with the help of some subsidized housing costs and food assistance it can be alright. It's about equal to living on minimum wage. If you find employment to earn a good bit more than minimum wage you're generally going to have an altogether better time though.

706,"No worries man, I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I can't imagine anything harder than being in pain and frustrated that my body isn't functioning as I remember it and on top of that nobody believing or really helping me. Hopefully the replies you've received can help you feel less alone and spur you on to find out what the issue is and how to deal with it. If you need to vent somewhere please do post here, people are generally kind and willing to advise or listen and nobody should have to feel alone when dealing with a health issue whether that is a short or long-term one, visible or invisible. Best of luck to you.

PS - About pain - I don't know if this could be a reason or if it could be a small part of the reason but I had a similar kind of experience. I had a surgery when I was young and for a few years afterwards I had these pains that were similar to the pain I experienced in post-operative care. I had completely healed but I would get these sharp pains. Eventually they went away and I now know they were a psychological response to a traumatic experience. Could it be that your accident was so nasty and took such a psychological toll on you that you're experiencing some kind of trauma that is manifesting itself as physical pain? I don't know the answer but it's another question you could ask the doctor you go to see. It could of course be something actually physically wrong with the knee, I'm just trying to think if there are any further questions you could ask the doctor so that you can try to get all your bases covered in order to think about what to do next.

EDIT: I just want to say that if that IS the case and it is psychological pain manifesting as physical, that does not make it less real, less difficult or less painful and you are still well within your right to seek help and support from health professionals.
