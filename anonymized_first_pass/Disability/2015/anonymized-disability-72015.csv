3,"Interesting. Maybe they should consider providing you with an assistant so they can do the stuff in your absence while you do the majority of the workload? 

Also can some, if not all, of your workload be done at your home so you can have a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunneled from your home to the office? A VPN is basically an encrypted, secure network connection between your home and the office and you have access to everything that you would normally find on your work computer, on your laptop and you may need a smart card to sign you in, given the security risks of working for the government. 

An assistant should be able to upload documents to a folder for you to access from home and you can do the work from there like scheduling, managing payrolls and all that you do. 

As far as interacting with your colleagues but you have to be at home, maybe they can set up a videophone for you and a designated spot at the office where the colleague can go in and talk to you face to face via videophone? 

Ehh, this is the best I can imagine what the scenario is like at your workplace and if this does not sound fittingly for you, at least I tried my best to help you out. 

But yeah, it would be wise to get legal help as they would know what to do. I would still talk to an ADA advocacy group about this, they may provide legal help free of charge and will act on your behalf for free. At least that's what the advocacy group did for me a few times, free of charge given my financial situation and my disability. 

I understand the financial situation you are in but if you happen to be let go (hope not!), you can apply for disability benefits through the Social Security Administration.

This meant I managed to complete most (not all) of my exams. Nevertheless, I managed to graduate with good grades.

78,"What? No self lacing Air-Mags lol?  

This is interesting. I like the idea and hope it will help many people out, but I can't help but think this is a bit of a means for Nike to get some great PR while using recycled technology they've been incorporating in their shoes for years. 

I've worked in a shoe store for a long time and in the process, become quite the ""sneaker history buff"" lol and aficionado. Nike and other brands have made secure fitting laceless designs since the mid 90s. Shoes like the Air Kukini, Presto Faze, Presto Cage all used elastic polymer bands for support in place of traditional laces; while others like the Air Rift used a series of velcro straps including a heel mounted strap for support similar to the one found on this upcoming release. I believe the elastic laces were first used by Nike on a pair of Jordans a few years back and there is even a company that specializes in nothing but elastic laces. 

Either way, I think it's wonderful they mish mashed all these technologies together to assist those with trouble tying their shoes and overall this will be extremely good for the sneaker industry. Nike is the leader of the industry and masters of advertising so when they promote something, even if they weren't the originators of the technology, other companies tend to follow suit very quickly. I'd expect to see a lot more shoes like this hitting the market in the coming years. 


Edit: Just looked it up and the company that makes the elastic laces is called ""Lock Laces"".  

Additionally here's a brief list of some sneakers without traditional laces for those who may be looking for different styles or simply aren't LeBron fans lol. 

-Nike Air Rift: Originally made for Kenyan Olympic runners who were accustomed to running barefoot. These use a split toe design (Like a Ninja shoe!) to mimic the foots natural movement as the Kenyans were used to running barefoot, but per Olympic rules had to wear some kind of footwear to compete. These aren't released regularly and can get a bit pricey on the resale market. They also have a rather feminine design, so probably won't be a favorite for the guys. 

-Nike Hurache 94 - Easy on easy off Velcro design with old school stylish looks. 

-Nike Kukini - Elastic polymer net that can be tightened at the heel covers the shoe in place of laces. Original Kukinis are pretty scarce but a few years ago Nike released the Kukini Free, which used the same upper with their ""free"" soles. These didn't sell to well and can still be had all over ebay for reasonable prices. 

-Puma Disc - I've always wanted these for the novelty factor, but they could be very beneficial for someone with CP or trouble with traditional laces. These use a series of wires connected to a dial in the middle of the shoe, that when turned tightens the wires providing a snug fit in place of the laces. 

-Reebok Pump Fury - These use an air bladder in place of laces, that when pumped expands to provide a snug fit. 

There are quite a few more laceless designs out there if anyone's interested, but the aforementioned list includes shoes that have been in production in the past few years and should still be relatively attainable.

Somebody mentioned a balance bike, and that reminded me of something my girlfriend's mom said earlier this month that might work.  She was talking about how balance bikes are pointless and it just makes you spend extra money on a bike that'll be worthless shortly after you buy it.  What she suggested was doing what her parents did with her.  Training wheels are often shitty little plastic wheels attached to sticks of metal.  They're terrible unbalanced and often sit higher than the actual back tire.  So what her parents did was leave the training wheels on until she could ride the bike without having the training wheels touch the ground.  Once she was able to do that, they took the training wheels off, and everything was smooth.  

Maybe training wheels today don't suck as much?  But I'm sure they're still cheap pieces of shit.  So even if the touch the ground, just take them off and bend the metal legs a little.  Just enough so they lift off the ground but still provide protection from tipping over.

Also, have you talked to your son about just taking them off?  7 1/2 is old enough where they might already have pretty decent natural balance.  He's your kid, so I guess I can't speak for that, but he may be able to handle a bike just fine without training wheels or your help.  7 years old or 17 years old, it doesn't matter at a certain point as their sense of balance reaches a certain point where they might not be necessary.",False,False,t1_ctk9ohd,mewithoutCthulhu,,0,1438179782,t5_2qhe8,t3_3ezxsv,t3_3ezxsv,2,1440156471,0,0,ctk9ohd,disability,2,,,,

106,"I actually remember your user name from your post about obtaining medical records a while back :)
Getting approved for disability is a pain in the ass, but totally doable. I also had moved to multiple states and seen many doctors at several hospitals in pursuit of diagnosis, and getting all of head records organized is a pain. But if you get them all in hand, you can prepare yourself well for your case. The records will show a pattern of symptoms and a variety of treatments. They might even contain diagnoses that you didn't know you have received. I was surprised when I read mine.. I learned a lot about my condition that doctors where not explaining to me. You will be able to provide SSA with exactly what they need to approve you. 

Also take a peek at what ""residual functional capacity"" means and what yours is. If you can, have any caretakers/significant other, therapist, regular doctor write up a testimony for you regarding the symptoms they have witnessed and attempted to treat and what prognosis they currently predict despite lack of formal diagnosis. 

Sorry some if this is redundant and all of it is hard. The good news is that you really can get approved as long as you are actually disabled and it doesn't really matter as much what the overriding condition/s are.

If possible, start getting regular treatment from a steady doctor or group of doctors and see a clinical psychologist for regular cognitive behavioral therapy sessions and you will have some pros in place who know you personally and clinically and can go to bat for you :)

As for them ""squeezing her out"" if her ambulation is really that poor they're probably trying to avoid a worker's comp case. There is the possibility that if she began using a wheelchair they would be feel more secure in her ability to manuver safely around the office and as long as she maintains her level of work, they may back off. Obviously I can't say that for certain but it's a possibility. I think a prospective employer will definitely have reservations about hiring someone who hobbles into an interview. They would be taking on a risk, and that doesn't make sense business-wise. And most employers are not going to want to hire someone who demonstrates that level of stubborness right off the bat by refusing to use an ambulation aid.

In higher education I tend to mitigate a lot of that, because when I do make it to class, which frankly, is a lot, (I used to be absent for weeks at a time, now I tend to max out at 3 absences per class that are illness related. Everything else is documented and they have to cover for other reasons besides DSS. Like, last semester, went home twice sick, but stayed home a grievance day and for an unexpected appointment, which I had documentation for,) I am always participating in class, I clearly do (most to all) of the reading, and I manage to turn in at least 85ish percent of my homework. (Getting better all the time, as I adapt to my memory neuro stuff.) 

So I think they start off with this kid who turns in DSS accommodations, approaches them with the ones that get more regularly misused, and go ""oh come on, I hate these,"" and then they, hopefully, get reminded exactly why they exist.

142,"I went to Disney for the first time last October. I have fibromyalgia and had never used a wheelchair. On the second day, I felt like I was going to die - the pain was just so bad. On that day, I used a wheelchair. So, I can speak to the fear of what other people think.

First - the staff were awesome. I never felt judged by them at all. They seem to understand that the need to use a wheelchair is different for everyone. 

Lines - a lot of rides, the entrance is different. That's sort of nice, because you don't have to worry as much about dirty looks. You also do have to wait a bit, and when you are seated, you get less than stellar seats - like the last row on the roller coaster (which I was fine with, it made me feel better, honestly). 

Other people - I had to make myself not look at other people. I wasn't there for them, I was there with my family.

145,"I have a form of muscular dystrophy too. Variant is yet to be determined as I was diagnosed when the tools to do so were not so good. Anyway, I am still able to walk, but just around the house. If I am going outside it is in my Powerchair. Anyway, I was walking around outside and things up until a couple years ago. Prior to that I had a friend who I was interested in and we did lots of date-like things but she never had the same feelings for me as I did for her. She ended up moving across the country and getting married. I decided to give online dating a try. Did it for a number of years and would get dates here and there and when it came time to discuss my disability they all were not interested in any further dates. Nobody came out and said it was because of my disability but I assume it was. It got to the point where I would just find someone on match or whatever and just text and call them and never actually go on dates. That did not work out so well for obvious reasons. Then, right when I was about to give up and delete all my online profiles and become a single hermit for the rest of my life I met her. We are engaged now and have been together every day for the past 3.5 years. My disability was no big deal to her, she loves me for who I am and that is all I need. The moral of this story, is don't give up on the online thing. Also, try to find a nurse. Best women ever!!! That is a joke, but I do find that people in the medical field are more open to people like us due to them having a better understanding of the things we struggle with. Hope this helps.

148,"I'm going to sound like an asshole for asking this, but are you a likable person? 

I would ask this to anyone if I'm being blunt.  Are you a likable person?  Do people like being around you, or at the very least, don't mind being around you?  Do you give off a desperate vibe?  Cynical vibe?  Holier than thou vibe?  Anything of that nature?  Being a nice single guy can make a man bitter sometimes.  Are you one of those types that thinks to themselves, ""I'm such a nice guy, why doesn't anyone see it.  Why wouldn't someone want to date me?""  Do any of those things describe you at all?  I'm not saying they do, I'm just curious, because they're often poisonous as far as attracting women goes.

Sometimes we have to take a look at ourselves and see what we're throwing out there for others to pick up on.

I'm not the best looking guy.  I'm not terrible by any means, but I'm not every lady's cup of tea.  The ones that find me attractive REALLY find me attractive, but their tastes are not exactly traditional.  I'm a chubbier paraplegic in a wheelchair.  I don't exactly attract a stampede of ladies.  But in my time I've been hit on by plenty of women.  I'm the shy type though, so I've never really done much with it in situations like that.  But it's flattering.  I'm not loud.  I'm not obnoxious.  I don't give off a creepy vibe.  I'm pretty relaxed.  Sometimes the type that doesn't really speak up until others are talking or I have something of value to add to the conversation.  I tend to get along with women more than men.  I've had close lady friends who try to be my wing-man when out at the bar.  Again, I'm shy, so it's never really lead to much aside from me awkwardly getting a girl's number and then never using it.

I'm not saying be like me.  I'm going through a small rundown of how I am with the point being that I'm relatively aware of how I am socially and how I can be perceived.  Be aware of the vibe you put out.  Project the best parts of you out there while still being yourself.  The right people will pick up on it.  Sometimes you might not be interested, and that's ok.  Sometimes even if you're, go out on a date.  Get some experience and learn more about the other person.

I have a wonderful girlfriend that I met online.  Most of my really close friends all moved half-way across the country.  I've never been a hugely social person, so without them around, I was going out even less often.  I created a profile online.  Went on a few dates that never lead to much more due to my lack of interest.  I'm extremely picky despite the fact that I have no right to be.  After about 9 months I found a great girl.

163,"Well if they pay you hourly then changing the number of hours you work won't affect your actual hourly pay rate. I double checked and it does look like if your company has more than 15 employees it is subject to the ADA. 

In my experience filling out the ADA form can be a double edged sword. Yes they will have to accomodate you as best they can given their resources/availability. The smaller the company sometimes the easier it is for them to claim that the accomodations are unreasonable. However, there is always a chance that it could limit your future prospects with the company. While, yes, it would be illegal for them to not promote you BECAUSE of your disability it doesn' t mean that they won't do it. It can be difficult to prove discrimination unless they flat out tell you (and have it in writing/an email) that is the reasoning. 

But I think what you need to focus on is what is going to work best for you right now. Turning in the ADA form and getting the accomodations will allow you to continue to work.

193,"Thank you all for your answers!  I guess it's SSI that he has but I was told it was taken from my social security.  It's about $250/month.  The SSDI check is for $760/month.  If they take away the $250, he won't have enough for the mortgage payment.  Sucks!  He does have enough for a 5% down payment; however, I was told by someone to transfer money into a ""hidden"" account so he wouldn't lose benefits.  If he lived on his own, he wouldn't have that money.  Since I could manage without charging him rent, etc, I set it aside, but perhaps that wasn't the smartest thing to do.  

I would think owning a house would be over any state's asset limits.

Both child's name is on my deed; however, my mortgage payment is far too much for him to pay, even with roommates.  Besides, the equity should be split between the kids.  I want to get rid of this large house now before I die so they won't have to deal with the mess I went through when my parents died.  

I really don't need the caretaker or any benefits for myself nor do I want the government to pay those to me when I don't need them even if I were eligible.  I only want my son to be able to live in a house and not be homeless.  I'm really concerned that if he looses the SSI, he won't be able to make the mortgage payment monthly.

197,"First of all, that's horrible that her job is trying to squeeze her out (and could possibly be against the law).  I guess I understand no longer wanting to work in that sort of atmosphere.  However, if she's good at what she does, her using a chair/getting around slowly shouldn't matter.  If she'd want to stay, could you look at any Aging and Disability Resources to help her legally?

With that said (and I guess sort of going into the question of finding another job), I know that some positions might spectate her working and see how much she accomplishes in a given hour.  They then base their pay on the amount of work they finish.  This might be different state to state (and personally, I've never been faced with this sort of ""trial run""), but I've seen signs that talk about doing so up in the break-room at one of my jobs.

I'd also recommend getting some help from a group called DVR (District of Vocational Rehabilitation).  In the city I live in, they share the building with a company that also aids people in finding jobs.  Though due to your wife's disability, they could give her a bit more help (whether it be disability related or how to conduct yourself in an interview) than just a regular job-seeking outfit.

Again, any future employer also shouldn't judge a hopeful employee's potential even if they are ""hobbling"" around.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen (I've heard from a previous employer after I had been hired that some managers had doubts on my abilities since I'm a wheelchair user), but chances are, she won't want to work for a company that turns her down due to her circumstances anyways.

225,"SSI and SSDI are judged on the same characteristics. And you are correct that a diagnosis is not always needed. I just want to parce that out a bit though.

 There has to be some diagnosis, or at least a reasonable suspicion, of the etiology of symptoms. If someone is a diabetic or has a herniated disc and is complaining of nerve pain then it is reasonable to assume it is realted to their conditions.

254,"First, happy birthday soon and I think it’s very cool you’re trying to figure this out.  I like the idea of using water guns: when I went to summer camp we played a game called Gold Rush, and the counselors holding water guns would guard prisoners that were captured and stuck in jail.  The only way to get out of jail would be for a fellow camper to touch your hand, but it was difficult to make it without getting sprayed by a super soaker.

Alternatively, there is a game called chess boxing that combines these two activities.  Essentially, it is a round of boxing and a set amount of chess, repeated.  The player must avoid knockout as well as checkmate.  Perhaps you could tie another game into capture the flag, maybe something more physical than chess but not so physical (rock ‘em sock ‘em robots?).  I know it is not exactly what you’re asking, but maybe it could be fun.  Good luck!

Kidding.  Sorta.  Where I live we see temperatures as low as -50F degrees if not lower with the wind chill.  I go all winter long wearing only a hooded sweatshirt and gloves, for reasons much like you mentioned.  I'm in a wheelchair, so I'm sitting all the time.  Winter coats are big and cumbersome.  When you're sitting they bunch up.  The sides push on your wheels and you look like a big puffy mess.  Also, the arms brush up against your wheels as well.  I typically don't spend a lot of time outdoors in the winter.  Most time spent outside is going from my apartment to my car and from my car into work or a store.  Or  having a cigarette.  For these reasons, I can get by with simply wearing a hoodie.  Hoodies are thin enough that they don't bunch up and cause discomfort or get in the way.  I just wear a typical plain $15 hoodie, but you can pay a few bucks more and get something that is fleece-lined or thermal-lined.  Or invest in a thin shell jacket to wear underneath.  I tend to wear a lot of long-sleeve plaid flannel shirts as well.  Not to keep warm, it's just my style.  But those do work to my advantage as well.

The part that makes it all work is gloves.  I have poor(er) circulation in my hands.  They get cold fast and touching the metal on my chair is unbearable at -50F degrees.

And really, if the dog is behaving as a service animal I say who cares if it is or isn't a ""legit"" service animal.  I think that's why the law is worded the way it is.

287,"As previously stated, some sort of physical therapy program would certainly be recommended. Most doctors should have little issue writing you a script for it. As for keeping in shape on your own, the first, best recommended type of exercise usually seems to be aquatic based. Of course, depending on your particular circumstances, that isn't always the easiest thing to accomplish. With an artificial limb, and confidence issues, that may not be the best option for you.

When I first received my wheelchair, I'll admit I was in fairly rotten shape as I had been doing next to nothing for 6 months while waiting for it to arrive. I too had some pride issues about using it at first, but I will say, just getting outside and rolling around the neighborhood has been very helpful in improving my self-confidence and overall stamina. Who cares what other people think.

As for a home workout, I did the pool thing for awhile, but it really became a bother getting in and out of my local gym's pool. Also, most of their equipment wasn't suited for my 6'4"" frame. I have since bought a resistance based home gym and it has been helpful.  Beyond that I use free weights. Of course, just getting out there and doing anything will be helpful.

296,"Thanks for your response... I will try to be clear about this. I have received a fully favorable decision. The advocate took advantage of me....I AM SURE OF THAT !! The things I shared with this advocate were not supposed to be used against me or used to work out a deal with the judge. Brain fog from Lyme disease is a REAL issue and this lady knew how stressed I was the morning of my hearing. New financial concerns, brain fog, bad thyroid readings. 2 weeks prior to the court date I shared everything about Lyme disease with her. My IRAS, CDS, anything and everything monetary has gone into my arm. After explaining how it has affected me mentally and physically I felt pretty good about the info we went over. If I were the advocate I would have fought for my client or AT LEAST OPENED MY MOUTH. I don't remember much of anything she said in court and my previous advocate that retired was very good and presented any and all pertinent medical information. I was infected in 2002 but was not properly diagnosed until 2003. Went on a treatment program in 2004 and had to quit my job of 9 years. Was suggested way back then that I go on disability but I wanted to go BACK to work after treatment. Received disability closed period ??? for 2 years. One time check for me and my children. The morning of the hearing I was very emotional. Told advocate about financial issues, thyroid problem, etc. She entered judge's room first and then came out to get me. I spoke to judge to tell him how I was feeling. Don't remember her saying much of anything. First thing I know I am being whisked into the hallway and asked if I would take a ""one time payout."" THESE ARE WORDS USED BY THE ADVOCATE. She then said to me..."" you know...like you got in Virginia."" At this point I was lost. IT DOES NOT TAKE A LOT TO GET ME CONFUSED. Did not know and/or was not advised ahead of time this could turn out to be a ""Lets make a deal situation."" I asked her would I be on disability? She said no. Then she says that the judge would give me a MORE favorable decision if I would not go back any further than 2013. At this point my thinking was completely bogged down. I asked her when did we file and are the kids supposed to get anything ??? No answer....she fumbled through papers and I think she mumbled 09 but seemed to be unable or unwilling to answer questions about my kids receiving anything. By this time I was really mentally worked up and we went back into the room with the judge and I agreed to 2013 and then I disagreed. Judge says to the advocate that she might want to take me outside to discuss again. We went back out into a hallway and then she motions the papers towards me and says: "" Remember things change after you are 50. Things are going to change because you are over 50."" I asked her repeatedly what does this mean? NO LEGIBLE ANSWER. She kept saying things were going to change. I went back into the judge and agreed to 2013 but by this time was under great distress. Judge asked me if I was depressed. I told him of course I was. This disease has affected me and hurt my brain. Then he asked me about my thinking and I told him it is like trying to think thru mud. Was this some sort of slap in the face question ? The last time I had a major relapse it cost me 16 + thousand dollars out of my pocket. Long term treatment of Lyme disease is not covered by most insurance companies....some will pay partial. It is like the 80's AIDS epidemic. This advocate should have should have sat me down and talked to me about what I was going to be giving up in backpay.... treatment money, the kid's money, etc. She knew I was in the fog !!! The next morning I woke up thinking I dreamed the whole thing and when I realized it had really happened, I cried my eyeballs out. I tried repeatedly to contact the advocate and could not reach her. I asked to meet with the head of the law firm and he did not want to meet with me. A call back was offered and then the advocate called me instead. The fog in my mind had lifted enough for me to realize what had happened. I told her that she did not speak on my behalf and that I was very upset. Told her I could remember important things and that I either got no answer on , a vague answer, or a very slow response. NEVER understood what the deal was with over 50 because she just kept saying: ""things are going to change after 50."" Let me make this perfectly clear. I may have some brain impairments but I AM NOT BRAIN DEAD ! I told this advocate exactly what I thought went down. What she said in response confirmed EVERYTHING. This lady was not in my corner AT ALL and I am devastated. I am seeking legal counsel at this time. Was told recently by an attorney that the over 50 rule did not even apply in my case. You know my IQ has dropped significantly since the infection but I have ALWAYS been a fighter. Used to be one sharp cookie in the computer tech areas. Brain fog, lack of retention ability, herxheimer reactions from die off of bacteria, nerve pain, loss of smell and taste, etc....the list goes on and on. NOW THIS. My work history is impeccable so why keep my backpay ??? At one point my doctor told me he did not know how I was working. Maybe it is perfectly normal for a judge to want to work out a different date other than the onset date......but this is NOT how things played out !! The judge knew I was confused.....the advocate knew I was confused. My disability was clearly used against me.....and let me add one more thing. When I met with that advocate 2 weeks prior to my court date, I saw the owner of the Law Firm had noted : THIS CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON BY BRAIN SCANS ALONE.

Was this some sort of slap in the face question ? The last time I had a major relapse it cost me 16 + thousand dollars out of my pocket. Long term treatment of Lyme disease is not covered by most insurance <URL>me will pay partial. It is like the 80's AIDS epidemic. This advocate should have should have sat me down and talked to me about what I was going to be giving up in backpay.... treatment money, the kid's money, etc. She knew I was in the fog !!! The next morning I woke up thinking I dreamed the whole thing and when I realized it had really happened, I cried my eyeballs out. I tried repeatedly to contact the advocate and could not reach her. I asked to meet with the head of the law firm and he did not want to meet with me. A call back was offered and then the advocate called me instead. The fog in my mind had lifted enough for me to realize what had happened. I told her that she did not speak on my behalf and that I was very upset. Told her I could remember important things and that I either got no answer on , a vague answer, or a very slow response. NEVER understood what the deal was with over 50 because she just kept saying: ""things are going to change after 50."" Let me make this perfectly clear. I may have some brain impairments but I AM NOT BRAIN DEAD ! I told this advocate exactly what I thought went down. What she said in response confirmed EVERYTHING. This lady was not in my corner AT ALL and I am devastated. I am seeking legal counsel at this time. Was told recently by an attorney that the over 50 rule did not even apply in my case. You know my IQ has dropped significantly since the infection but I have ALWAYS been a fighter. Used to be one sharp cookie in the computer tech areas. Brain fog, lack of retention ability, herxheimer reactions from die off of bacteria, nerve pain, loss of smell and taste, <URL>e list goes on and on. NOW THIS. My work history is impeccable so why keep my backpay ??? At one point my doctor told me he did not know how I was working. Maybe it is perfectly normal for a judge to want to work out a different date other than the onset date......but this is NOT how things played out !! The judge knew I was <URL>e advocate knew I was confused. My disability was clearly used against <URL>d let me add one more thing. When I met with that advocate 2 weeks prior to my court date, I saw the owner of the Law Firm had noted : THIS CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON BY BRAIN SCANS ALONE. If I have failed to provide you with a clear picture of what went down, I am sorry.

5. Scotchguard^tm. Seriously, I spray the absolute shit out of my jeans.
6. Waterproof footwear. I recommend getting some nice leather boots- something comfy, sturdy, and stylish- and again, just waterproof the absolute shit out of it. But YMMV. If you like a sportier look, again, REI.

Obviously, I wish the price point was much lower, but I really do think that making this 'just another shoe' is a great way to integrate universal design into the larger market. If this shoe takes off (I really hope it does), it could inspire more shoe companies to make similar products and create an ecosystem in which the universal design principles used to develop shoes are secondary to the incredible designs they reproduce.

and any chance  those shoes you liked are the nike flyknits? I've seen them before, but they seem to fit your description closely. They do have laces, but I can see how they're secondary or not needed for everyday use. 

also, full disclosure, I am fully able bodied (is there a more polite term for that in comparison to disabled/differently abled?).

337,"Are you talking about ANY decent shoes, or just those without traditional laces?

Either way, eBay is your friend lol.

$100+ is about the norm for sneakers today. But if you aren't picky about the colors. you can find some great deals on sale, at outlets and online. 

Colorways, model variations and production numbers can have a DRASTIC effect on the price of a sneaker. Take the Reebok Pump Fury for example. Their ""HLS"" variant can be found online in the neighborhood of $50, while their camouflage BAPE variant runs roughly $500 and their ultra limited collaboration with Chanel goes for as much as a decent used car. 

I recommend finding a model you like, maybe trying them on in-store to account for proper sizing and then running that model name through various search engines and ebay and seeing what pops up. You may not be able to find that certain colorway you love at a reasonable price, but unless you're craving a pair of Yeezys, chances are more affordable colorway will turn up somewhere.

Online courses are helpful.  Help keep the mind active and many have social components with other students.

Reading is great of course.

Consider getting him an over bead table and put a laptop on it, or even an LCD monitor.  The over bed table works well in bed and in a chair.

354,"Yeah I've definitely heard and seen this, a lot. The only way I've ever been able to explain this is ""internalized self-hate"". Basically, my theory is that disabled people who are like that haven't learnt how to cope with the disgust, hatred or fear that some parts of society project on them so they end up internalizing it on a subconscious level and this comes out as disgust, hatred or fear of other disabilities. I could be totally wrong, but that's what I think it is. I recognize some aspects of it myself, not because I've ever felt this way about people with other disabilities but because when I was younger I had difficulty being around people with similar disabilities to my own but was totally OK with all other disabilities.

What I agree needs to change is the rules with medicaid and disability to not combine incomes because it's utterly ridiculous. ANYONE using any disability services should have the option to file separate tax refunds from their spouses and therefore, always qualify for their benefits.

368,"I'll admit, I can get a bit uncomfortable interacting with people who have severe mental disabilities. I do my best to engage with them and treat them cordially just like I would anyone else, but I'm often running everything I say through my head before I say it to ensure I don't say the wrong thing. I suppose it's not much different than when I'm talking to a cute guy I like, but it's the kind of situation that makes me more nervous than I should be. It has nothing to do with a hierarchy or me thinking I am better then them. It just boils down to my own ineptitude and inexperience in dealing with that kind of person/situation.  It's the same reason I rarely get upset when I can tell someone is noticeably uncomfortable interacting with me due to my disability. It's human nature to get thrown off by things we aren't use to, I understand that. 

In regard to the hierarchy of people with physical disabilities, I try not to think like that (anymore at least). If I did, I'd be going about my life bitter, depressed and feeling less worthy than the countless bipeds that I see on a daily basis, only taking solace in the rare occasion I see someone with a more severe disability. That would be a completely miserable existence. I do feel as though I'm looked down on upon many within the amputee community because I no longer choose to wear a prosthesis. Arm amputees tend to be very understanding, as many I have met don't wear one either. But I can tell the majority of leg amputees and even doctors I have talked to don't respect my choice and view me as some kind of failure or quitter because I prefer crutches. I had an encounter with a recent below knee amputee at a party not long ago and he just couldn't fathom why I ditched my prosthesis, as it had only been a year since the loss of his leg and he was already getting around fine with his. I tried to explain to him I had problems with my hip, wore a prosthesis for 2 years and how it was my preference. But he kept drunkenly rambling on about how it's the 21st century, technological advancements and how ""cyborgs are the future"". I know it was probably coming from a good place but I couldn't help but feel like he was condescending me at the same time. I engaged him for about 20 minutes until he brought up Hugh Herr's bionic legs for what much have been the 5th time and I finally popped off and yelled at him ""DUDE! THEY'RE ******* FEET! NOT LEGS!  YOU AND HUGH STILL HAVE BOTH YOUR ******* KNEES!  IT'S NOT EVEN COMPARABLE!"".  Definitely not one of my finer moments, but I just couldn't take another minute of it. I guess that could be construed as me thinking I was above him in some kind of bizarro hierarchy, not for being less disabled but more-so. I ended up apologizing to him for my outburst later that evening but could tell I threw any potential for a future friendship out the window. 

When it comes to conflicts between those who were born with disabilities and those who acquired them later in their lives. I've been there. I lost my leg at 17 and prior to my injury I was the typical shallow girl in school. Combined with the fact I wasn't able to complete that year of school, when I did go back I was not only an amputee, but also a year older than almost everyone in my classes. I really just expected to get my prosthesis, wear pants and things would just all go back to normal. It took me a while to learn that a lot of my friends weren't really friends when I went from popular to outcast during that time. In addition to the physical challenges I faced, I had to make new (real) friends, learn the difference between being part of the joke or the joke itself and overall change my whole thought process. For a while, I resented both able bodied people and those born into a disability because neither had to suddenly adapt in the ways I did. There was a girl I went to school with who had an underdeveloped hand since birth and I remember being so envious that we were both disabled, but her life had never changed, she still had the same boyfriend since freshman year, the same circle of friends and even though she wasn't the most popular, people generally liked her. It wasn't until I voiced this to a friend that things really started to click for me. He said ""Yeah, but shes always been really nice. No offense, but you can be kinda a *****."". Of course my initial reaction was to go beast mode, cuss him out, but it really gave me something to think about. Even before my injury I was embarrassingly petty, angry and jealous of everyone. My current situation only amplified these negative emotions, while making me a very easy target for people I had wronged in the past. I took my friends comment to heart and while I still have the occasional re-lapse (see story in paragraph above lol), I try to own my disability, be as nice to everyone I come across as possible and never compare my situation to someone elses. Looking back I cant fathom how anyone could have ever bared to be around me when I was like that.

so I was facing being homeless and no food. the 1k? oh i forgot child support i was paying. so i was only getting $700 a month. lol

A softer wood will dent easier and a harder wood will resist dents but some hard woods like lignum vitae can be brittle. Some like the walking stick store sell them as kits you finish the wood and assemble it and then you can say you made it.

It has never happened to me (or maybe it has and I just don't know about it ha), but if it did it might make me a bit uncomfortable. I'm not really sure, actually. I'd probably want to know they cared about other things too because otherwise it feels like objectification in a sense. I guess it's maybe not that different to me liking red hair and freckles. I mean, my boyfriend has red hair and freckles so that's a nice bonus but that's not why I love him or why I was initially attracted to him. So yeah, if there were other reasons for attraction too maybe I'd be ok with it. But then, I can understand that not everybody (disabled or not) is always looking for a meaningful connection outside of physical attraction. Maybe I'd feel more comfortable with it if that was the case? Dunno, hard to say.

My other problem is that I just keep seeing this scene from the youtube series 'my gimpy life' where the main character (who is disabled) wakes up to find her boyfriend over in the corner, caressing and licking her wheelchair wheels. I'm sure that's not what happens in real life but I'd probably have a little difficulty not constantly laughing at the thought of someone licking my wheels.

1) This penalizing disabled people who work by taking away the benefits they require to function needs to end. It is so unreasonable and I've seen so many people on this subreddit who want to work and are scared to lose the support system they need to get out of bed and have a basic level of human decency. It's a vicious cycle and anyone who has complex needs or expensive needs due to their disability is forever trapped in it.

2) There has to be more acknowledgement of how much harder disabled people have to work to achieve the equivalent to their able-bodied peers. I don't know how to put that into meaningful policy and I know affirmative action is contentious but this needs to be debated and thought about. I went to a talk by Tom Shakespeare (he's a researcher in the UK) and he was talking about employment of disabled people. He said something along the lines of ""If you have two candidates  in front of you who are exactly the same in terms of achievements and qualifications then you should always always always pick the disabled candidate because they've had to work 2, 3, 4, 5 times as hard as the able-bodied person to get to where they are and that says something about them"". I'm not saying that's what we should do, I myself have mixed feelings about affirmative action.

I've had people write me references and explicitly have to write that I've had no special favors to get where I am.

448,"I have a disability and I've worked in the disability field for quite a long time now. I don't think there is necessarily a hierarchy but there is definitely internal prejudices. Because ""disability"" encompasses such a wide variety of conditions it is inevitable. People with disabilities are just as likely to have preconceived notions about others. Neurotypical people, even those with significant physical disabilities, are likely to not know how to interact appropriately with people with IDD or ASDs and as such, they carry those preconceived notions. There is also a certain amount of identity many of us take from our disabilities. Someone with significant disabilities (say muscular dystrophy) might view someone with learning disorders as not disabled ""enough"" and so on. There are a million reasons why people behave poorly towards one another.  

For example, the gentleman you mentioned with CP that doesn't like interacting with people with IDD or people with ASD. It could be because, as a person with CP, he is mistakenly identified as having those conditions and so he distances himself from them OR maybe someone was stimming and knocked into him one time OR maybe he's just an asshole. 

In the instances of people acquiring disabilities vs. being born with them, you can find that people will have wildly different relationship with their disabilities. Someone who was born blind or deaf (as opposed to someone who acquires blindness or deafness later) may not necessarily view the condition as having something taken from them. The Deaf community is very strong and those who acquire deafness can have a hard time ""breaking in"" as it takes a long time to become really fluent in ASL and understand the nuances in Deaf communication standards.

You can appeal an ALJ decision. However, if you received a ""fully favorable"" decision then that is the best outcome you could have had (as opposed to a partially favorable decision). You can try to still appeal to the Appeals Council level but they typically just affirm the ALJ decision. You can then do a federal appeal but that takes years to process and I am doubting you will find a laywer who is going to take your case that far.

&gt;Although regarded as [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) by the mainstream medical community, the practice of trepanation for other claimed medical benefits continues. Moreover, some proponents   point to recent research [*[where?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias)*] on the increase in cranial compliance following on trepanation, with resulting increase in blood flow,  as providing some justification for the practice. Individuals have practiced non-emergency trepanation for psychic purposes. A prominent proponent of the modern view is Peter Halvorson, who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase ""brain blood volume"".

Nike is a brand name that the general public thinks is cool and has the cache to charge a higher price for that reason. By marketing these in the same way (and for a similar cost) as they would any other shoe, Nike tells consumers that this IS just like any other designer shoe they sell and is meant to appeal to everyone, not just those with disabilities. This works to promote a marketplace in which universally accessible designs are part of the norm and can be high-end products in their own right instead of a sub market meant to appeal solely to (and effectively differentiate in an ultimately negative way) those with disabilities. 

It reflects a trend in glasses, which I think is ultimately a good thing. After all, the most inclusive designs are those that work well for disabled persons but are cool enough for everyone else to want as well.

I misread this originally -- I get a few hundred dollars more per month than you do, because I defied my doctors and managed to work an extra 10 months at a brilliant job, and then quit working cold turkey. The year before that, they'd offered me $760. It's all, as you know, based on how much your salary was in the quarters leading up to your quitting work. Many people suffer because of that -- they often try to reduce their hours, or go part time, before filing for disability. That can really tank your payment.

The average for 2015 is $1165. You can earn up to $2663 per month, but keep in mind that that number includes the additional amount you get per child that you have. Someone who has a base benefit near yours, but has 4 kids, would actually receive a check much larger than yours, at least until the kids are 18+.

So, I dunno. It's sort of like asking someone's salary. There are a lot of things that factor into it, and, if they answer, the number you get may not tell the full story in itself.

If you can feed yourself, bathe yourself, or walk on on your own, you're doing way better than anyone put into a mental institution or group home and definitely don't belong in one.

I know that 'normies' suck. Anyone different from them is immediately 'the cripple' or 'the disabled person'. The truth is, most of them don't know how to treat you. People grow up learning how to treat their peers, their elders, and little kids... but being 'different' throws a wrench into that. Kids react with avoidance or bullying, adults react by treating you like a child. You have to speak up and tell them what they're doing is wrong. They can't telepathically know how you want to be treated, YOU set that standard.

Most importantly, you can't judge yourself by normal standards. You are you. You are only as ugly or disgusting as you think yourself to be. Who cares what other people think! All those high school kids will forget you the second they get into college. The only people are should matter are the people that DO like you and don't mind any of your weird quirks. You might not know any of those people yet, but they're out there, waiting to meet you. You can't just go 'I hate people and people hate me' because that's quitter talk. That's giving up on meeting those people and giving up on making the most of life.

Disability just means you're different. You have to get through life creatively. It's a challenge for you to make the most of. Never believe you can't get a job or do something with your life. It'll be harder, but it just makes it more rewarding when you do it.

635,"Yeah, I've seen this. In my opinion/experience it *generally* goes physical disability, then social/behavioral (IE the autism spectrum), then mental/intellectual. However, a high functioning autistic person might be ""above"" a person who is paralyze from the neck down. It's like how a independently functioning amputee might look down on someone with severe down syndrome.   

In my experience, I've always been near the top. I have cerebral palsy, I use a wheelchair outside my home and my speech can be difficult to understand at times, but I'm an independently living university student (I have a car and live on my own). Growing up in physical therapy, I was always one of the ""cool kids"" along with another girl with CP similar to me and a girl with spina bifida. As horrible as it sounds, we were a bit ""cliquie"" because we were ""not as disabled"" as the other kids. This extended over to my high school days. Even though I took the ""short bus"" (because of my wheelchair), I didn't really associate with any of the other kids, save for one. He had autism and we got along, however, we hated being 'lumped in with' the mentally disabled kids because we were both quite intelligent. 

I think, for me, it stems from the fear and the hatred of being assumed that I am mentally disabled, when in reality, I'm very smart. I'm a prideful person and I'm proud of my intelligence. 

The ""system"" probably doesn't help much either. For example, the disability services at my university often gets swamped during exam-week simply because there are not enough readers, scribes, or individual test rooms. So some students, such as myself and my blind friend, get priority over students with dyslexia or other learning disorders. You may argue that this is because ""we are more disabled"" (because that is part of it), but it's also because there is NO way I could pass an exam without a scribe. But with a scribe, I can ace it.  


As for conflicts between those disabled since birth (or a very young age) vs a disability acquired later, I haven't seen/experienced this much, but I can see how there could be issues. On one hand a disability acquired later means that a person got to experience ""normal life"" then had to adapt to becoming disabled. But those (like me) who have been disabled since birth have never had to ""learn to be disabled""; our challenges, and how to deal with them, have been engrained with us our entire lives. Does that make me a better, ""more adaptive"" disabled person than the guy who was paralyzed at 25? No, but I would like to think so since he got 25 years of being normal.

644,"A way to open the conversation may be something along the lines of, ""I've felt some tension at times since I have started requiring so much assistance. Have you been feeling it too?""

I think you definitely need to let him know it is upsetting to not have control over your own body and how the way he handles things feels unsupportive and adds to the upset. Him dropping you would likely not have been as emotionally upsetting if he had apologized and together, you had brainstormed where it went wrong in order to decrease the likelihood it happened again. Instead, you basically got reprimanded. 

Be sure to make it known how much you appreciate his help and that you know it isn't easy/frustration-free for him either. I would probably lead with this. Be sure to ask (with the intention of being open and willing to learn) anything you do that may make helping you a challenge or things you could do to make it easier for him. For example, my husband found it really challenging when I wouldn't vocalize how my symptoms were on any given day, but would become upset if he asked too much of me. This wasn't fair to him -- he isn't psychic and I have an invisible illness. 

Prior to you not having use of your arms, did he tend to respect your wishes? Were you a team when approaching challenges? The reason I ask is I am wondering if this dynamic was there before, but just wasn't as obvious.

I cannot tell for sure from your post, but it seems possible he is treating you like a child. When my child (almost 6) is complaining about something that needs to get done, I am sorry to say, I am guilty of not always listening to her when I should. I think I know better and/or just want to get the task over with. However, I never do the same to my husband. If she asked me to use a different cup to rinse her hair after I'd already started, I would ignore the request. If I were in a situation where I was bathing my husband, I would switch cups out of respect, despite thinking it was silly. If she says she wanted a different bowl for her food -- nope. Husband -- yep, because I know there's a good reason beyond not being in the mood for a red bowl.

655,"&gt;The only disability is a bad attitude! /s

That got a laugh out of me!

Julie Zeilinger created Fbomb--a feminist website dedicated to teenage girls, and props to her for that. I call her work ""cookie-cutter feminism"" in a previous comment on this thread because it simply repackages the same points made various places in the online feminist community: it's eerie to me how consistent their talking points are nowadays, and it cuts too close to political performance art for my taste. I don't like their language, I find it combative and insensitive, and it just seems inauthentic to me. It feels like they're writing what they think their audience wants to hear, and that ableism is just the flavor of the month among some feminists.

It seems to me accessibility and inclusion are far more important than cataloguing forms of ableism. People's limitations are frequently invisible to the point of incomprehensibility to others. I think our responsibility is to make our experiences accessible to others in order that they might find their way to help our community in ways consistent with their values. I find most people want to help: no sense in driving them away with six admonishments that really don't give abled folks much more than fodder for awkward conversations with limited folks.

<PERSON> created <PERSON>--a feminist website dedicated to teenage girls, and props to her for that. I call her work ""cookie-cutter feminism"" in a previous comment on this thread because it simply repackages the same points made various places in the online feminist community: it's eerie to me how consistent their talking points are nowadays, and it cuts too close to political performance art for my taste. I don't like their language, I find it combative and insensitive, and it just seems inauthentic to me. It feels like they're writing what they think their audience wants to hear, and that ableism is just the flavor of the month among some feminists.

It seems to me accessibility and inclusion are far more important than cataloguing forms of ableism. People's limitations are frequently invisible to the point of incomprehensibility to others. I think our responsibility is to make our experiences accessible to others in order that they might find their way to help our community in ways consistent with their values. I find most people want to help: no sense in driving them away with six admonishments that really don't give abled folks much more than fodder for awkward conversations with limited folks.

I've lost 25 pounds on near bed rest with zero actual exercise. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure, which is BMR+ physical activity) by picking a number about halfway between my BMR and a ""sedentary"" calculation given to me by My Fitness Pal. 

Because we expend so many fewer calories than active and abled people, an aggressive weight loss plan would put our consumption too far below our BMR to be healthy. I did a 500 Calorie deficit/day which put me eating just around my BMR. That would translate to 1 lb/week.  I lost at about 1.25 lbs/week when I look at the long term graph. 

If you haven't yet, I'd recommend going to weight measurements, especially for calorie dense foods like peanut butter and pasta.

I agree that either a front-clasp or pullover style would probably be easiest.  As for the shoulder slope, perhaps a raceback style, or one with adjustable straps that you could cross in the back?  That should keep the strap from sliding down on the affected side.  Depending on how flexible she is, she may also be able to use a strap clip, attaching it near the back of her neck, then sliding it down a few inches.",False,False,t1_csu7741,genivae,"CRPS, Fibro, Conn. tissue, carpal tunnel, PTSD",0,1436214754,t5_2qhe8,t3_3c8wt5,t3_3c8wt5,2,1440496815,0,0,csu7741,disability,2,,,,
692,"Hi there - I feel pretty qualified to answer this question. I'm a person with a disability and I specifically went to law school so I could do disability advocacy. Thankfully, I now get paid to work at a national level on policy and programs I love. That said, DO NOT go to law school if you don't want to practice law. Actually, check that, DO NOT go into lots of debt attending law school unless you have a passion for the law. While I am a lawyer, I don't actually litigate and I probably could have made it to where I'm at through a less intensive and cheaper masters program. My legal background is helpful in regards to understanding the law and regulations relevant to disability but the real reason I am where I am is that I interned with great disability organizations, volunteered a ton and was eventually elected to lead a national student group while I was in school. Like most career fields, connections and experience will get you farther than just a degree.   

My advice is to get volunteer experience with local disability advocacy groups such as your state Protection and Advocacy group or a city disability/diversity committee. Doing so will allow you to gain a better idea of what academic background would benefit you most for what you specifically want to do, get great advice from people in the field and allow you to develop local connections. Most P&amp;As have a mix of lawyers, policy wonks, fundraisers and professional advocates. If and when you decide on a graduate program - look into doing volunteer work with student groups, campus diversity/disability/accessibility committees.  

I don't want to dissuade you specifically from law school but the trick is knowing precisely what you want to do and achieve within disability rights. For example, I am a policy wonk and work on getting large scale policies and programs benefiting people with disabilities in place. I'm good at it. I'm also good at outreach and consensus building. But there are plenty of things I'm not great at. I can't help individuals get disability benefits or walk them through the process of applying for other various benefits programs. There are disability lawyers that are the complete opposite of me and help tons of individuals while never going into bigger policy work. Finding out what you want to do before choosing a graduate program will save you lots of headache.

693,"There probably isn't a calorie counter just for disabled folks. But you can get a good estimate on your own.




You're going to want to find an online calculator to calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR is the amount of calories you would burn in a day if you were totally inactive. From there, you can increase that number if you are active on a given day.





Next, design your diet around the amount of calories you burn in a day. Generally speaking, a deficit of 3500 calories will result in a lost pound. So a daily deficit of 500 calories will lose you a pound per week, theoretically.

On the other hand, being socially adept is not necessarily a requirement of living independently. Plenty of people are very awkward socially and still live on their own. It's possible that being on your own might help you be more socially at ease.

Anything on the computer, I'd think. Never too late to learn new things. Worst case, games and reading on tablets pass the time pretty decently.

Any crafting he'd be able to do? Or something sports-related if he's into that (like, fantasy teams)? I like loom knitting, which is easier on my hands than regular knitting, but the age and gender is probably not the best for that suggestion.
