1,"Using the elevator during a fire is dangerous to people of all levels of ability. It's not offensive to try and keep *everybody* safe with statements like ""In case of fire, do not use elevator, use stairs"".

What would be useful is clearly displayed evacuation protocol for wheelchair users next to evacuation protocol for able patrons. Every establishment is different, some have fireproof doors and people who can not use stairs are expected to wait behind those doors for Emergency Workers to assist them. Other facilities expect other patrons to assist with evacuation as they lack appropriate firedoors.

The Nature of the evacuation also comes into play. There is a big difference between a fire that is going to cause threat via smoke inhalation vs a fire that is a threat due to structural damage to the building.

Evacuation protocol works on eugenic ethics, The best outcome is to get the most people evacuated safety. This is most easily achieve by making sure able bodied people get out first so that chairs and mobility aids are not blocking walk ways for extended periods of time.

Even in hospitals this method is used. if there is a need to evacuate patients the policy is order of evacuation is ""ambulant, semi-ambulent, totally dependant"".

Before using these, I'd only tried under-arm crutches before -- they bothered my shoulder and took up lots of space, thus the switch. Anyway I don't know *much* about forearm crutches in general -- just lots of experience with this one single model. Which is great! But not without its problems, and I imagine some of them are present in other models too. Let's go by bullets.

&gt; What can you tell us about the current forearm crutch?

It's more compact, lighter, and a little less stable than under-arm counterparts. It takes an extra second to pick up and use, or to put down -- sometimes that's great, like if you want to knock on a door or something, the crutch stays right there with you; sometimes it's a little annoying, like if you only have to move a small distance, you'll spend more time slipping the cuffs on and off than actually walking. Forearm crutches aren't as stable as under-arm, in my experience, but despite that, they're *much* easier on my shoulders (though that could be partly due to the shock-absorber tips on mine -- you could get under-arm crutches with those). Overall I definitely prefer forearm.

&gt; Likes and dislikes?

I like the size, weight, look, and feel. Also, transitioning to a single crutch feels a lot more natural with forearm models, I think -- it's somewhere between a crutch and a cane. 

I don't like the elaborate dexterity process required to put them on. Especially with mine -- the handgrips are specific to one side or the other, but not marked very well, so I usually wind up fumbling with them for a few seconds. More importantly though, I don't like the way the handgrips are designed -- I suspect this varies between different models, but on mine, the grip is rubber, wrapped around a metal post and secured in place with a bolt and washer. But as the rubber heats up, whether from use or from ambient temperature, it gets malleable enough that it slides right over the washer and starts to slip off. They can come totally free in mid-use, and if that happens you're just kind of boned. It's kind of a lot unsafe.

&gt; Is it stable enough?

Most of the time. Wet tips can sort of ruin that -- I guess if they were wider (or maybe just less worn-out than the ones I'm using), that might help. 

&gt; What would your ideal crutch have that current crutches lack?

I'm pretty sure that not all models have the spring-tip shock absorby things that mine have. They totally should. Those are awesome. I think it would be neat if it was easy to collapse -- think, like, switchblade crutches that just retract up into a tiny size when they're not in use, and then shoot out like lightsabers and play heavy metal music when you need them. Or, okay, maybe not that -- but that's always gonna be a good direction to explore. When you get into a car, it would be nice if you could quickly, easily, and comfortably stow your crutches.

21,"Thanks for the question! 

I'll start with a definition. A reasonable modification is a structural change made in order to afford a person with a disability full enjoyment of the premises. These modifications can include structural changes to interiors and exteriors of dwellings and to common and to public use areas. These modifications are generally done at the expense of the requester, but in rental properties that receive federal funding, the modification is generally done at the expense of the housing provider. Probably the most obvious example of a reasonable modification is a ramp over a threshold or stairs. 

By definition, the request must be ""reasonable."" Whether or not something is reasonable is determined on a case-by-case basis and is very fact-specific. As such, there is no predetermined list of what is and is not reasonable. However, anything that could affect others' safety or the structural integrity of the unit might be deemed unreasonable. For example, widening a doorway to allow wheelchair access is generally considered reasonable, but if that doorway happens to be a on a load-bearing wall, it could be considered unreasonable. Or if a ramp could be a trip hazard for others, that particular ramp (or placement) could be considered unreasonable.

A lot of people assume that modifications like widening doorways or removing cabinets under the kitchen sink (or removing or changing other built-in features) are unreasonable, but those have been deemed reasonable by courts.

93,"Thanks for asking! We're checking in periodically to see if there are other questions, so feel free to keep asking anything you'd like!

The Fair Housing Act defines ""disability"" (the Act uses the word ""handicap,"" but we use the updated terminology that has the same meaning), in part, as a ""physical **or mental** impairment which substantially limits one or more ...  major life activities."" 

So, if someone has a mental disability that meets that criterion, we help them just as we would someone who has a physical disability that meets that criterion. A good example of something we might do: Client had an undiagnosed and untreated mental disability that caused him to have loud and inappropriate outbursts. The housing provider began the eviction process. We might write the housing provider a letter that explains that the client has a mental disability that had not been treated that caused the outbursts, that the client had recently begun treatment, and that we are requesting a reasonable accommodation such that the client be able to stay in his/her housing for at least, say, 90 days to see whether the treatment is correcting the problem. 

That is just one example. We have also had cases where someone is being evicted for reasons not stemming from a disability, but we asked that the person be able to stay for an extra 30 to 60 days because of a risk of homelessness that would exacerbate a mental disability.

Okay,back to your question! 
How about doing a piece with a non-famous person with a disability? Like yourself and your own experience, or someone you know? 
Sure, there are people with a disability who changed the world, but there we also people with a disability who change their small corner of the world. 
I think it depends on the kind of piece you are writing. 
Are you trying to write about an amazing thing that happened that is associated with someone with a disability, or are you wanting to write about an aspect of the experience of disability? I think it would be neat to have writing that features disability but isn't inspiration porn. I try to work this idea into my own writing (prose fiction, only sometimes poetry) by having characters with a disability who have a story that is unrelated to the disability. How they tackle problems or relate to the world is influenced by the presence of their disability, but the story isn't about that. 
Of course, poetry is a tighter venue with less space to flesh out a character and their story, so I think any suggestions we think of would need to be informed by what kind of piece you are writing and what your purpose for it is. 
Sorry, I don't think I have been helpful. . But I would love to read your work and I think it's awesome that you are thinking up ways to recreate your life within the parameters that are not in your control. That on its own would be a good subject for a poem....

Also, while she was doing ROM she spouted her holistic anti-medication bias when her assistant told her my current medications and she decided that my seizure-like episodes of Dystonia are pseudo-seizures or caused by the medication, because apparently she knows better than a *neurologist* who has actually seen videos of my episodes, and she flat-out dismissed me when I told her I've had incidents of these motor disturbances prior to taking any medication. I also *loved* that she decided that the rash on my face was caused by my sunglasses and not <PERSON>, as my *rheumatologist* believes, and then she left before I could explain that a) it's been raining for four days, so I haven't been wearing my sunglasses and b) I get rashes elsewhere, too. As for your other suggestions of why this has happened. . . 


1. I have a current doctor, two actually.
2. My doctor's notes are fine. I know someone who works at the clinic and I asked her to look them over to make sure they were in order.
3. Obviously yes, I have been treated.
4. My doctor's notes were sent. I made calls to follow-up.


This doctor apparently sees all of her SSI people in one day, because everyone in the waiting room was there for this reason. I overheard part of her examination of the guy before me (paper-thin walls) and she asked him about his daily habits, had him walk around the office, etc. She didn't ask me shit. She walked in, saw that I'm young (29) and made her mind up then and there before she even opened her mouth. The more I describe it, the more I realize just how screwed up it was. I'm going to go ahead and make a complaint on Monday, though apparently that won't change anything. Maybe it will make me feel better.","[{'start': 1162, 'end': 1170, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Everybody hates on the CEs and nobody thinks they are fair (hell I get probably 5 complaints per week) but the reality is that they are a necessity and typically if you are getting sent to a CE a couple of things could have happened:
1. you have no current doctor (w/in the last 6 months)

-- How did your disability impact your ability to participate in play, school or other social events?

I would say I never felt it really impacted my ability to play in early years despite using a wheelchair, I was a very happy and sociable child up until the age of 11. After that, things changed as I had spinal surgery (a requirement for most people with my disability during their childhood) and the complications involved left me with some mental health issues that made me more fearful and introverted. People who knew me before and after all acknowledge that I essentially completely changed personality overnight.

Nevertheless, I performed very well at school and was involved in the drama society, fundraising societies and was editor of my school newspaper. I went through some severe bullying at about the age of 15 which was related to my disability. This involved a group of people I considered to be my friends ganging up on me and saying things like ""you're not clever at all, you're actually quite stupid, people just feel sorry for you so they give you good marks"". However, I think that sort of emotional bullying would have happened to me sooner or later anyway because I was a complete pushover during that period and I was pretty nerdy - never a good combination! 

In my late teens I felt I was becoming more restricted in participating in social events as these involved going to clubs and places that just weren't easy for me to get to. I became close friends with a group of similarly nerdy and quiet people though so it wasn't that bad.

-- Have have your values or beliefs influenced, or have been influenced, by your disability?

I don't think it has had an effect on religious preferences or anything. I do think it has probably had some influence on my politics and values. I manage to be exceptionally cynical about politics and about peoples motives but at the same time I'm a massive idealist. I don't think there's anything I care more about than equality/justice and openmindedness and that's probably due to my experiences as a disabled person. 

--What skills (motor, cognitive, communication) did you find most difficult due to your disability?

Motor skills were the hardest. I had problems at school completing exams on time and this was very frustrating for me because I was a good student. It got sorted out in the end and I was given extra time based on medical assessments but that was quite stressful. Communication was sometimes a problem because after my surgery I really retreated into myself and, even though I had a lot to say, I really struggled to speak in class or in front of other people out of pure anxiety. I tried my best to overcome it by joining the drama society but it was hard and looking back on it, I realize that some of the teachers were just as cruel about it as my fellow students.

--What routines or habits did you form to help you maintain a fuller life?

Hmmm...In my late teens when I became friends with the nerdy/quiet crowd we spoke on the phone to each other every night and on MSN a lot. This was easy for me because I could rest whilst socializing. I read books, watched TV and wrote stories about the characters in these or my own. So much so that my parents and teachers thought I would go on to be a writer. I also studied a ridiculous amount compared to most kids my age, it was kind of my way of staying connected to the world around me. I remember my grandma once saying to me that ""nobody can take knowledge away from you"" and that really stuck with me. It was also about survival though, I knew from a young age that if I ever wanted to be independent I'd have to work harder than my peers. It was pretty obvious to me that I'd need to achieve more than them in order to have the same things if that makes sense.

--What impact has your disability had on your family? (relationships, financial, logistical, etc)

Financially I know my family has struggled immensely because of me. What I said about needing to achieve more than other people in order to have the same things applies to my family too. The cost of new wheelchairs, electric beds, an adapted car, an adapted house, hoists, hoist batteries, slings, repairs when things break, my care etc. It's a never-ending list and there's always been something that we needed.

&gt;-- How did your disability impact your ability to participate in play, school or other social events?

In school, since I went into high school with my injury, ""play"" wasn't really affected. I obviously couldn't do a ton during the down time when we were outside throwing the football or anything like that, but otherwise, very little changed. I also wasn't in PE, so the only adjustments made for me were longer-than-normal bathroom breaks. On the social side of things, I maintained the same friends pre and post injury, and that was actually not too affected.

&gt;-- Have have your values or beliefs influenced, or have been influenced, by your disability?

As in religious beliefs? I'm not religious, and I wasn't before the accident, so I wouldn't say it affected me. My values were changed, in the sense that I have a deeper appreciation for conveniences than I did before.

&gt;--What skills (motor, cognitive, communication) did you find most difficult due to your disability?

Motor.

&gt;--What routines or habits did you form to help you maintain a fuller life?

So my injury affects bowel/bladder control, which can be a massive problem if not managed properly. Getting on a consistent diet and bathroom schedule allowed me to actually live life without a considerable risk of an ""accident"".

&gt;--What impact has your disability had on your family? (relationships, financial, logistical, etc)

Financially, we were okay. My dad's job offered us excellent health insurance and we lucked out with the house being reasonably accessible already. It took some time to figure out how to balance independence and convenience, but we got back to a reasonable normalcy rather fast. 

&gt;Could you share what your experience was to approach common tasks you would engage in, without thought before the accident, with the new challenges of your disability?

The biggest challenges were physical, so considerations of accessibility, bathroom needs, my own ability to manage a wheelchair, etc. were the primary concern. If we wanted to go to dinner, we needed to know if it was actually accessible, if I would be able to use the bathroom if I needed it, if I could get in a booth and keep my chair next to the table, stuff like that. And then early on, I didn't have a ton of stamina and wasn't very good at transfers, so I also had to think of things like going to the mall, would I actually be able to push myself the whole time, or if I fell out of my chair, would I be able to get back in. But by and large, since the initial challenges *were* largely physical, they were things I could work on and see real improvements. So now, I really don't give much thought to what I'm doing.

236,"Thanks for the question!

I'll also start this answer with a definition, but this time it will be of a reasonable accommodation, which is a change to rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

If you are moving into a place that generally doesn't allow pets or has some other restrictions or deposits for pets, you should discuss your assistance animal with the housing provider up front. The reason we suggest this is because a housing provider is not required to allow a reasonable accommodation unless and until it is requested. Having an assistance animal, with no deposit and no pet rent, in a no-pets building is exactly the type of reasonable accommodation contemplated by the FHA.

If your housing provider generally allows pets with no deposit, no pet rent, and no size/breed restrictions, there is no need to disclose the nature of your assistance animal.

The lowest stress approach would be to discuss it up front. If the housing provider discovers the animal after the fact when pets aren't allowed, the landlord may start eviction proceedings. In that case, it will be a race with the clock to get the reasonable accommodation granted. 

We always recommend putting the request in writing, even though that is not technically required. The request should state that the animal is an assistance animal and that it provides x, y, z functions that ameliorate the effects of your disability. You do NOT need to state the nature or severity of your disability, but you do need to state what the animal does. Having a letter from your doctor, therapist, social worker, case worker, or other reliable third party definitely helps and, in fact, can be requested by the housing provider. That letter also does not need to state the nature or severity of your disability.

HUD has a memo about assistance animals that is quite helpful:

284,"From my perspective these characterizations seem to follow the general narrative ""Pull Yourself Up By Your Bootstraps!"" storyline, and that minimal governance strategies (like vouchers) will miraculously ""cure"" the disabled body.  

Seems to me that the neoliberals in power assume that disability functions in capitalistic societies as another way to make money. As Paur (in Davis, 2013) writes, “within the broader context of neoliberal demands for bodily capacity as well as the profitability of debility, both functioning as central routes through which finance capital seeks to sustain itself.” (p. 180).

Tables:  Are there regular tables available?  Are the chairs movable/removable? How close are the tables?  Could a wheeled mobility device get between them easily?   Is there a place where, say, a mobility scooter or a walker can be parked near by a convenient table without blocking the way for others?

Bathrooms:  Are the handicapped stalls or bathrooms big enough for a wheelchair to turn around?  Can someone in a mobility device get to the taps and the soap easily?

334,"Hey,
I'm really sorry to hear about your story, it sounds like a nightmare.
I don't know the ins and outs of the system in which you're operating in, perhaps someone else does, but I want to say this for now:

If you haven't started collecting evidence, start doing it now and try to backdate and obtain as much previous evidence to support what you've said here. Ideally, you want things like emails, contracts, written statements from other people. If you can't get those things then write a brief note about what they said and the date they said it (exact date is preferable, approximate will be ok though). If your doctor, wife, a previous client or partner in your business can confirm things in writing, even better. Do not include any emotive language. Just a clear recollection of what was said. If you haven't been diagnosed with major depression I suggest you seek a diagnosis and add it to your evidence. Compile this all into a document and take it with you to a lawyer.

End all correspondence with the disability office and other such offices by phone if possible and communicate by email so that you can log responses in evidence. If you don't know how to do this, ring them up and ask for an email for correspondence. When you have an email, explain nobody will hire you and ask what evidence they need from you to prove this or what appeals process there is. The response to these types of questions is usually interesting and can provide somewhere to start.

In summary: log, log, log and start building a case. Use words like 'human rights' and 'discrimination' when talking to officials, sometimes this elicits a response that can add to your evidence against them. Be strong and firm when you communicate but be calm and polite. Keep your emails to them as concise as possible and express clearly to them what your problem is and what you want. The goal is for them to look incompetent or negligent if you end up in court. The goal is for you to look calm, rational, deserving of help. 

I hope some of what I've said might be relevant and helpful to you. I know how hard it sucks, know that you're not alone. I hope someone else can offer some insight into the particular system you're working in.

It's almost like a sleeping bag that's shaped to fit when sitting in a chair and it comes up to about mid-chest so gives plenty of coverage. It has straps to secure it to the chair and prevent slipping as well as a drawstring top to tighten it to your body and prevent drafts. 

The bottom section that rests on the footplates has a textured rubber patch to prevent your feet slipping off the footplates as well as protecting from tearing if you catch it/bump it. 

The zip goes all the way from one side of your chest, down the legs and all the way back up to the other side of your chest so it can be opened up like a large flap. It makes it easy to get in and out, plus the zip is chunky with a large zip-pull if your hands are unreliable.

I often put a hot water bottle or a battery powered heating pad inside to rest my feet on if it's really cold but the cosy itself is usually plenty warm enough.

As to why they sent you to an exam despite numbers 1-4 I can't really hazard a guess. But 90% of disability examiners are not going to just order exams for the fun of it. There was obviously *something* that wasn't making sense or consistent in your file. But the exam really is not the be-all-end all of your claim. Its just part of the evidence that is gathered. Again, the doctor you saw is **not** making the decision. 

And as far as what she was ""assessing"" you for, she wasn't looking at just one thing. There may have been specific back-related issues that the disability examiner asked her to look at but she is still taking everything into account. As for your gait, it will make it into the file. Just because she doesn't make  a big production about it doesn't mean its not observed. You were observed from the moment you got there. Those are the best gait observations (when you think no one is looking). Its more accurate and will also help to spot the people who are malingerers. 

You are more than welcome to call and complain but I doubt it will really get you anywhere. Usually what happens is there is one person in the office who is the liason between the DDS and the CE providers.

370,"This makes me so conflicted.

Because the ""it may sound a bit airy-fairy"" is. IT IS. To me. It plays into the notion that people see disability as inherently bad, and it's why the Deaf Community had pushed away the label. And that's not to say they are wrong, or anything. But they understand that the way their body works isn't an inherently bad thing and so they've separated themselves from the term, even if it frustrates me that they ended up doing that instead of fighting to change the tone behind the term.

Yes, labels can be used against people with negative consequences. But labels are also a big part of being able to discuss things, identify areas that are thematic (positive &amp; problematic ones). Similar to the fact that ""just because a decision has some negative outcomes, doesn't mean it is the wrong thing to do,"" just because something can be used negatively doesn't mean it shouldn't be used.

It also has roots in the ""I am colourblind"" movement - which people are railing against now. It erases problems, by denying differences. Those differences can be positive or problematic. However, when they are the problematic ones it can make it more difficult for the person experiencing them to have them addressed or acknowledged. For example, studies have shown that if you take two identical resumes and submit them with a ""white name"" and an ""non-white"" name, the person with the ""white"" sounding name is a lot more likely to get the job.

It's the things like ""I don't see you as disabled"" that deny part of your experience of the world, because while the person saying it might not 
hold the opinion that all people who have disabilities are to be pitied, or are helpless, or are weak, or incapable, or any of the other negative stereotypes that people place upon us, that is not how the world works. It's naive. It implies that the wrong definition of disability is not going to change, and also that they don't want to address the problematic side to disability. People who use wheelchairs have a markedly different time getting around than people who walk unaided. That doesn't neccesarily mean they are aware of it at all times, or that they are overwhelmed whenever they have an issue with it. But that it is part of the fabric of their lives.

A lot of it boils down to: don't pity me, but don't deny my differences/problems and not everything you define as a problem is a problem to me.

On the positive side, the website services he provides sound pretty damn cool. So, therein lies my conflicted feelings. We also have a young man who is visibly disabled standing up for being full members of society, with confidence, getting coverage for it, and having success at it. He has a great point about not having enough good role models for people with disabilities to look to. Yes, you can spout the ""be your own"" - but not everybody is the same and some people need a hand up.

He also DOES have the mindset that disability is not inherently bad, it's just that he's going about addressing it differently than other people.

373,"I obtained disability on a second appeal and so I thought I might mention a few things. It's already been said that an SSDI lawyer can only take up to 25% of your backpay. That will be in the contract. It will also indicate a flat sum, stating that the attorney will take (once you've won your case) whichever of the two amounts is less. Whether or not you win your case you will be liable for office costs incurred while working your case, such as printing, copying, and mailing. You can request an itemized list for that when the time comes to pony up, but the chances are that it will be accurate if somewhat pricey. 

A free consultation with the attorney is expected, so don't go to one who would charge you for sitting down in his office. And just about any attorney out there will want to know what medical records you have at your disposal. The ambulance chasers will take on any case, but attorneys with busy schedules who will only take on cases they know they can win will want to see what evidence you have on hand that they can present in court. So when you go to your consult, have the names and contact info of all pertinent medical personnel available, and a summary of what each of them would be willing to say in written testimony. 

In court you will face two major hurdles: the court's pet doctor and their pet vocational expert. The administrative law judge will have the prerogative to call on either/both of them without informing your attorney prior, so you must be prepared. That means having doctors' statements indicating that your medical condition precludes the possibility of working (the judge gets pissed if the doctor uses the word ""disabled"" because that's the judge's call and not the doctor's) as well as a residual capacity questionnaire filled out which will defeat any alternative vocations the vocational expert would suggest. There is no uniform residual capacity questionnaire out there, so it's a good idea to find several and then cobble them together in a fashion which is tailored to your particular disability.

430,"This just highlights the problem with the workforce and how we treat humans like machines. If someone (able bodied) comes into work hungover, or distracted from personal problems at home, and their production is lower than average, their pay isn't docked for making too few widgets on those days. Someone who works with superhuman speed doesn't usually get paid more. The productivity expectations for workers has increased significantly over the years. Even what's expected of TAB workers is unrealistic, so PWDs just continue to get left behind as the gap widens. 

The problem is also that if maximum production is a deciding factor in placing someone in a job, then just don't offer that job to a PWD. Find us jobs that are a better fit for us where we are valued as our TAB counterparts. It's disgusting how these employers get to look all progressive and openminded for hiring PWDs... But it's okay to pay them a slave's wages. In fact, the employee is blamed for their slave wages, because if they could just stop being disabled, then they could have the privilege of being paid what their coworkers get paid. 

This article ends with a quote about how employers are doing us a favor by giving us something to do. Working isn't about having something to do. It's about contributing to society and earning a living like everyone else does. A pity job with slave wages isn't bettering society OR the employee busting their ass for pennies an hour.

In *Deaf Gain*, there is a chapter, ""Manual Signs and Gestures of the Inuit of Baffin Island"" that looks into one of the earlier contact between Old World and New World. They communicated through visual means and curiously, it is implied that it wasn't unheard of in either societies.

Before sign languages was stigmatized, anthropologists frequently bought a deaf person to aid them with communicating across the language barriers. The gist of what happens, is the tribes often had a deaf person among them. Both deaf people would start with simple visual communication. And then as both of them understand each other more and more, the visual communication became more complex, to the point where both of them are able to act as interpreters for both sides. 

There is International Sign Language. The international sign language is not just a dominant international language (like English is), but a language that formed from frequent international deaf gatherings. The deaf community is an international one and the fluidity of visual communication plays a big part in that.

With the increasing inward collapsing of the world, wouldn't it be wise to start learning a language that can easily cross language barriers, to look toward a smaller world where we are able to communicate and understand each other on a level?

501,"Hello, I am not a wheelchair user but I am an engineer who is interested in the design of wheelchair modifications and accessories. I might not be the person you're looking for to respond but I figured I would give you my input. 

I like all of your designs, and it shows a lot of diversity in the ways the the user is able to interact with the device. I really like the third design, for the interchangeable seat, it would be really amazing if you could make it compatible with already existing ""government approved"" car seats, that would be a huge hurdle to overcome if you were thinking of making this product feasible and cheap (it costs a lot to apply for approval). I also like how in all of your designs you considered height adjustability, the ability to collapse and be stored, and that in the second and third one you added storage (you'll probably have to carry around more than just a baby). I think you should try to combine the best elements of all of your designs to create one great design.

I found that all of the designs were similar to each other in the way that the device interacts with the environment, they all had a tricycle setup. The more contact points the device has with the ground the harder it will be to maneuver (more specifically steering and turning the device). You could probably minimize maneuverability issues by doing more of a wheelbarrow set up where the back wheels are actually lifted off the ground as those wheels aren't really necessary for stability when they're attached to the wheelchair. Another option to increase maneuverability is to make all of the wheels swivelling casters, that way you could steer the wheelchair normally and just let the stroller do its own thing (which I think you may have done in design 1&amp;2).

Also, another thing to consider is the length of your device. The longer the device is, the harder it would be to take inclines. If you added a hinge point of some sort between the wheelchair and the stroller (think of the connections between train cars) you'll be able to take inclines more easily as they will ""fold"" at the connection point. Finally, be sure to use lightweight materials, that's going to be a lot of stuff to be pushing around! 

I didn't realize this was going to be such a wall of text... Best of luck on your project OP!

There are great elements in all of your designs and you should combine them all. Be sure to design for maneuverability.",False,False,t1_cnfjy5y,Mish-Mish,Assistive Techie,0,1420498491,t5_2qhe8,t3_2rapt4,t3_2rapt4,2,1425040711,0,0,cnfjy5y,disability,2,,,,

506,"It is absolutely ridiculous. 

I worked for a mall retail store for a number of years. I started as a seasonal assistant manager at one of their kiosks, and got hired on as a sales associate after that. Of course that meant a cut in hours and pay, but it meant work and potential for moving up.

Another holiday season, another stint as a seasonal assistant manager, and back down to regular associate. In a job like that, you're waiting for someone to leave or get fired to move up.

Then came my break. The manager at the largest store in our district needed surgery, and the decision was made to run 4 assistant managers in her place. I was moved up and worked at that store. About a month and half go by, I'm doing my job, help open the newly renovated store, working hard, training new hires. Right before the Manager comes back, one of the Assistant Managers quits. Seeing as they usually run 1 store manager and 3 assistants, that meant a permanent position was open. 

I worked under the manager for a few weeks. It was decided by her and the district supervisor to move me back to my original store, not giving me the promotion. 

So like a good worker, I go back to my original store around holiday time. I'm a seasonal assistant manager again, splitting time between a kiosk at a mall 40 mins away and my home store. 

My home store manager realizes the holidays are coming to an end and thinks I should be getting more hours. He works it out with some other managers that I could ""float"" between 3 stores. 

Then an assistant manager gets fired at my home store. GREAT! An opening! And at my home store no less! They promote a girl that worked as a seasonal manager at one of the kiosks just that 1 christmas.
