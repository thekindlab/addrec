1,"Firstly, I am very sorry that your family is acting that way. Have you addressed this with them? You can let them know non-confrontationally that what they are saying is hurtful and that your relationship is just that - yours. It is not their business. I know that this is difficult when you rely on them for some of your care. However, that does not mean that you don't deserve respect or that your life is not your own. (Just my two cents on the matter.) 

It's scary as hell, but relationships are about trust. You have to let the other person in. You need to let them see all of your strengths and weaknesses. Do this at a pace you both are comfortable with. 

Whenever I have spoken to my partner about my disabilities and how I worry that she won't want to put up with them, will leave me, etc., she always responds with, ""Of course not!! How could you think that?? I always worry you'll leave me because of X..."" I can't say that these relationships will last. I don't know. I do know that it sounds like we are looking for reasons why we aren't ""good"" enough for the other person. But lots of people do this, able bodied and not.

Every relationship has its challenges. Trust each other. Keep working to let each other in. It sounds silly, but it works.

23,"I am in my early 20s with moderate Cerebral Palsy. I've used online dating sites (specifically okcupid and plenty of fish) for about 2 years now and I've been on 3 dates. I am very upfront about my disability, my profile pic is of me in my wheelchair and I always make sure guys know what they are getting into before meeting me. Yes, my forwardness might detract potential dates, but it saves that awkward conversation. 

While these dates didn't bloom into relationships of any kind, that was due to factors, I feel, other than my disability. 

As for dating sites specifically for disabled people (I've used disableddatingcanada.com) they are HORRIBLE. I find it is mostly men from elsewhere looking to scam women into getting them into the country.

40,"&gt; Whereas, the SS website says I can apply for both but only showing me a link for SSI. And my husband's income is only $1000/month so it's not much.

Here's the problem: Since you're married and only qualify for SSI, his assets &amp; income count against you.

So you two, together, can never have more than IIRC $3,000 in financial assets. That includes stocks, retirement accounts, savings accounts, bank CDs, bonds, etc. I do not know if his 401k, if he has one, will count against you or not but I suspect it would.

Neither of you can have a life insurance policy that will pay out more than $1,500.

The two of you are only allowed **one** vehicle.

The logic behind this is that if you're married, he is responsible for supporting you and not the government unless he is deeply impoverished. This is why so many people who are on SSI never get married, it ends up financially hurting them. A single individual can have 2,000 in money compared to 3,000 if married. So if two people act as if they are in a relationsip but keep it a secret and never get married, that gives them an extra 1,000 in potential savings to have on hand, an extra vehicle in case the one breaks down, etc.",False,False,t1_cu9o9f5,sg92i,,0,1440090964,t5_2qhe8,t3_3hojk2,t1_cu9dllj,1,1441367438,0,0,cu9o9f5,disability,1,,,,

67,"Hey there, I don't have much time, so sorry if this email is sorta scattered.

Alot of the issues you're dealing with remind me of my own biology degree. How can I get 2+ years of lab experience to work in a hospital or laboratory if I can't break into that initial position. I have found the answer lies with internships and volunteer positions. While in undergrad I volunteered in a research lab and after college I volunteered in a hospital until I meet the minimum qualifications to actually get hired at that very hospital. I was very friendly and personable, so alot of the connections I made volunteering and ""shadowing"" the doctors were the same ones doing the hiring.

So perhaps you can take that approach of getting an internship somewhere to get exposed to the skills you're missing. Its tough to work for free, but if you've identified the exact hurdle you need to overcome, I think half the battle is done and now you need to figure out how to get that experience. The experience doesn't specify paid/unpaid, experience is experience. If you can find someone's work that is exactly what you need to learn, you could offer to intern or ""shadow"" them in return for helping with some of the workload. If presented well, it could be a win-win for everyone.

The one other thing you have going for you is the disability. I fall in the same category, I've had 33 surgeries on my legs and while I can now walk, I can't feel or move my foot. So I am a functional normal human to the outside (laymen) eye, but I also fall into the partially disabled category, something that looks good in the eyes of ""equal employment"". I've found the trick is to downplay the disability so it is never questioned if I can perform my job or not, but that doesn't negate the experience I've been through. If you play your cards right, you may even be at an advantage looking for an internship by saying something along the lines like you're trying to further your knowledge because the challenges you faced in college limited the experience you could get.

The last thing I will mention, I really hope you don't take the wrong way. But I think you could benefit from separating your disability and your employment troubles. Perhaps I missed something reading your post, but it seems like you have two separate issues going on. The social anxiety is one thing and hopefully you can address it through support groups, therapy, or perhaps finally just having something go your way. But being under qualified after receiving your degree is something I see every one of our peers struggling with and I don't really know how a disability subreddit can help with that. If you were to separate the issues, maybe the questions about your degree would be more appropriate for a graphic design subreddit and this subreddit could help work through your social anxiety and social security insurance questions. I hope that makes sense, I see many of my peers dealing with the same problems post graduation and hunting for a job, I'm not sure your disability plays too much of a role in that (unless I misread and I'm very sorry if I did).

Also, don't worry, you certainly did not phrase it such that being disabled is inherently negative. You phrased it well. I think we're closer in agreement than what it might sound like from my previous response, my personal conflict aside! 

Also, I've actually witnessed this in people I know and felt truly very angry. In one case, my family had some close family friends who were having immense difficulty getting pregnant. They tried for over 5 years and had repeated treatments. The doctor suggested one final thing - to take multiple eggs, fertilize them and put them all in. They decided to do this because they ran out of money after numerous single implantation attempts and could only really afford one last go. The doctor told them that this would likely produce no results but that it might also mean that she would have multiple children. In the event of the latter, he said that he had to let them know that there was a risk that this might somehow lead to developmental problems or other disabilities. They agreed to do the procedure anyway. I thought that was pretty irresponsible and selfish. A few months later, much to their luck or bad lack, four took.

Dude, I took a look at your reddit profile and your comments are completely indistinguishable from people without brain injuries, so my completely uninformed opinion is that your rehab team just might be full of it.  I'm sorry you have to deal with unhelpful, shortsighted people who don't see your potential.  You should definitely check out some of the free online courses available to you; I like Coursera for this because all their lecture videos are captioned, you can watch them as many times as you need to, and (depending on the class) you can take the quizzes several times until you understand the material.  Not as good as a college course, but it would be a good way to ramp up to that again.  And once you're ready, Coursera would let you get their verified certificates for free, and then you could have the satisfaction of plunking them down on the desks of the naysaying bureaucrats. ;)

For those 3 years I was just stuck. The only way I could get out was when a parent or (rarely) a friend could take me out. It may not be the healthiest, but I did get pretty into video games, and that helped ease the pain a little bit. I was big into Rust, where I had a community of friends and would ""go out"" and do things in the game.

But you want to know what the most helpful thing was that I believe ultimately helped me recover... Flying kites. I tried RC planes, but when I crashed, I had no way of retrieving my plane. So I got into making kites and then flying them. The ancient Chinese used to actually prescribe kite flying for the sick. There was something very grounding about sitting on the grass/sand and getting in tune with the wind. I got into fighting kites and would always bring a second one with me for the rare time someone would come up and ask if that was a fighting kite. But once I made a new kite and wanted to test it, nothing would keep me inside. I didn't then just want to be outside, I had a purpose to get outside. And if there's a will, there's a way.

For me it was so much effort to get out of the house, I would get to the point where getting a friend or a taxi to take me out would work, but then I couldn't find anything worth the effort. I wasn't going to exhaust myself just to go sit on some street corner, I needed that purpose to get me out of the house. Not to mention the kites would attract lots of kids, who typically were so excited about my kites, they didn't notice my disability.

So I would crutch/wheel the 3 blocks to the park. Then when I was learning to drive again, for months, I only felt comfortable driving to that park and back. There were a few times I would take an uber, but with the cost involved, I would save that for when I was literally going stir crazy (and I mean actually going crazy).

Ur not alone. I used to hike, bike ride, surf, and that all ended. I was stuck laying on my beanbag chair watching people in the parking lot from my window for years. It does get better. I guess all I'm getting at with the kite thing is you need to find an excuse to get outside and do something. Only then would I absolutely push myself out of my comfort zone to find ways to get outside. If it wasn't for that hobby, the trip outside to get lunch or ""sunshine"" was just too much effort.

Sorry u feel trapped, I'll keep trying to think of more advice.

It's also worth nothing that being stuck put a strain on my brother and my relationship, as he was living with me (but not really helping all that much).

He was glad I told him and made sure to say that it didn't matter to him, that I didn't deserve the shit hand I was delt. He told me that he really liked me for who I was and no illness was going to change his feelings for me. We have been together for almost 4 years now.

165,"Great post(s). The one quibble I have is that it's not particularly safe for person or dog to just up and decide you're going to get a dog to pull your wheelchair (especially someone else's dog). Both dog and person need to be trained by someone with experience training service dogs, or put into a dog carting type arrangement and trained by someone with relevant experience. There are certain guidelines used by those with experience for matching size of handler and size of dog, special harnesses with correct padding, handles, and fit are used, and an ultralight wheelchair (or dog cart) is always strongly recommended, if not required, by programs placing service dogs in order to reduce the strain on the dog. And, if this is going to be a repeated thing, the dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to ensure that there are no conditions that would be exacerbated by the work of pulling. The OP may be able to get away with a somewhat cheaper setup than someone who is working their dog every day, but failure to train and use the right equipment may result in injury to the dog or handler.

However, I love the idea of offering to work with dogs in the neighborhood if the OP is able. Besides the emotional benefits of being with an animal, I have found dog training to be mentally stimulating and engaging in a completely different way from sitting and reading my textbooks. In order to be good at it, you have to constantly read the dog's body language to judge how they are doing emotionally and whether they are understanding what you want. It is interactive but you don't have to deal with other people. The OP could go over to /r/dogtraining and get started with some of the links in the sidebar; going to formal obedience class is helpful but not necessary if you're starting with a reasonably well behaved dog and trying to teach it new things.

170,"In the UK, we have a national healthcare service. It has historically been one of the best examples of an effective welfare state in general. But with the NHS specifically, it means citizens of the UK do not pay for medical treatment or service.

So, basic medical prescriptions aside, UK taxpayers are not paying directly for medication or medical service (though some do pay a unit fee for a prescription, often much cheaper than the medicine being prescribed).

B.How do we evaluate hearing loss?

1.What evidence do we need? 

 a. We need evidence showing that you have a medically determinable impairment that causes your hearing loss and audiometric measurements of the severity of your hearing loss. We generally require both a complete otologic examination and audiometric testing to establish that you have a medically determinable impairment that causes your hearing loss. You should have this audiometric testing within 2 months of the complete otologic examination. Once we have evidence that you have a medically determinable impairment, we can use the results of later audiometric testing to assess the severity of your hearing loss without another complete otologic examination. We will consider your test scores together with any other relevant information we have about your hearing, including information from outside of the test setting. 

b. The complete otologic examination must be performed by a licensed physician (medical or osteopathic doctor). It must include your medical history, your description of how your hearing loss affects you, and the physician's description of the appearance of the external ears (pinnae and external ear canals), evaluation of the tympanic membranes, and assessment of any middle ear abnormalities. 

c. Audiometric testing must be performed by, or under the direct supervision of, an otolaryngologist or by an audiologist qualified to perform such tests. We consider an audiologist to be qualified if he or she is currently and fully licensed or registered as a clinical audiologist by the State or U.S. territory in which he or she practices. If no licensure or registration is available, the audiologist must be currently certified by the American Board of Audiology or have a Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC-A) from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). 

 2. What audiometric testing do we need when you do not have a cochlear implant? 

a. We generally need pure tone air conduction and bone conduction testing, speech reception threshold (SRT) testing (also referred to as ""spondee threshold'' or ""ST""' testing), and word recognition testing (also referred to as ""word discrimination'' or ``speech discrimination'' testing). This testing must be conducted in a sound-treated booth or room and must be in accordance with the most recently published standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Each ear must be tested separately. 

b. You must not wear hearing aids during the testing. Additionally, a person described in 2.00B1c must perform an otoscopic examination immediately before the audiometric testing. (An otoscopic examination provides a description of the appearance of your external ear canals and an evaluation of the tympanic membranes. In these rules, we use the term to include otoscopic examinations performed by physicians and otoscopic inspections performed by audiologists and others.) The otoscopic examination must show that there are no conditions that would prevent valid audiometric testing, such as fluid in the ear, ear infection, or obstruction in an ear canal. The person performing the test should also report on any other factors, such as your cooperation with the test, that can affect the interpretation of the test results. 

c. To determine whether your hearing loss meets the air and bone conduction criteria in 2.10A, we will average your air and bone conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hertz (Hz). If you do not have a response at a particular frequency, we will use a threshold of 5 decibels (dB) over the limit of the audiometer. 
d. The SRT is the minimum dB level required for you to recognize 50 percent of the words on a standard list of spondee words. (Spondee words are two-syllable words that have equal stress on each syllable.) The SRT is usually within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. If the SRT is not within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction threshold, the reason for the discrepancy must be documented. If we cannot determine that there is a medical basis for the discrepancy, we will not use the results of the testing to determine whether your hearing loss meets a listing. 
e. Word recognition testing determines your ability to recognize a standardized list of phonetically balanced monosyllabic words in the absence of any visual cues. This testing must be performed in quiet. The list may be recorded or presented live, but in either case the words should be presented at a level of amplification that will measure your maximum ability to discriminate words, usually 35 to 40 dB above your SRT. However, the amplification level used in the testing must be medically appropriate, and you must be able to tolerate it. If you cannot be tested at 35 to 40 dB above your SRT, the person who performs the test should report your word recognition testing score at your highest comfortable level of amplification. 

 3.What audiometric testing do we need when you have a cochlear implant? 

a. If you have a cochlear implant, we will consider you to be disabled until 1 year after initial implantation. 

b. After that period, we need word recognition testing performed with any version of the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) to determine whether your impairment meets 2.11B. This testing must be conducted in quiet in a sound field. Your implant must be functioning properly and adjusted to your normal settings. The sentences should be presented at 60 dB HL (Hearing Level) and without any visual cues. 

 4.How do we evaluate your word recognition ability if you are not fluent in English?

If you are not fluent in English, you should have word recognition testing using an appropriate word list for the language in which you are most fluent. The person conducting the test should be fluent in the language used for the test. If there is no appropriate word list or no person who is fluent in the language and qualified to perform the test, it may not be possible to measure your word recognition ability. If your word recognition ability cannot be measured, your hearing loss cannot meet 2.10B or 2.11B. Instead, we will consider the facts of your case to determine whether you have difficulty understanding words in the language in which you are most fluent, and if so, whether that degree of difficulty medically equals 2.10B or 2.11B. For example, we will consider how you interact with family members, interpreters, and other persons who speak the language in which you are most fluent. 



C. How do we evaluate vertigo associated with disturbances of labyrinthine-vestibular function, including Ménière's disease? 

 1. Vertigo associated with disturbances of labyrinthine-vestibular function, including Ménière's disease. These disturbances of balance are characterized by a hallucination of motion or a loss of position sense and a sensation of dizziness which may be constant or may occur in paroxysmal attacks.  Nausea, vomiting, ataxia, and incapacitation are frequently observed, particularly during the acute attack.  It is important to differentiate the report of rotary vertigo from that of ""dizziness"" which is described as light-headedness, unsteadiness, confusion, or syncope. 

 2. Ménière's disease is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss.  Remissions are unpredictable and irregular, but may be long-lasting; hence, the severity of impairment is best determined after prolonged observation and serial reexaminations. 

 3. The diagnosis of a vestibular disorder requires a comprehensive neuro-otolaryngologic examination with a detailed description of the vertiginous episodes, including notation of frequency, severity, and duration of the attacks.  Pure tone and speech audiometry with the appropriate special examinations, such as Bekesy audiometry, are necessary.  Vestibular function is accessed by positional and caloric testing, preferably by electronystagmography.  When polytomograms, contrast radiography, or other special tests have been performed, copies of the reports of these tests should be obtained in addition to appropriate medically acceptable imaging reports of the skull and temporal bone.  Medically acceptable imaging includes, but is not limited to, x-ray imaging, computerized axial tomography (CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without contrast material, myelography, and radiocnuclear bone scans.  “Appropriate” means that the technique used is the proper one to support the evaluation and diagnosis of the impairment. .

The otoscopic examination must show that there are no conditions that would prevent valid audiometric testing, such as fluid in the ear, ear infection, or obstruction in an ear canal. The person performing the test should also report on any other factors, such as your cooperation with the test, that can affect the interpretation of the test results. 

c. To determine whether your hearing loss meets the air and bone conduction criteria in 2.10A, we will average your air and bone conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hertz (Hz). If you do not have a response at a particular frequency, we will use a threshold of 5 decibels (dB) over the limit of the audiometer. 
d. The SRT is the minimum dB level required for you to recognize 50 percent of the words on a standard list of spondee words. (Spondee words are two-syllable words that have equal stress on each syllable.) The SRT is usually within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. If the SRT is not within 10 dB of the average pure tone air conduction threshold, the reason for the discrepancy must be documented. If we cannot determine that there is a medical basis for the discrepancy, we will not use the results of the testing to determine whether your hearing loss meets a listing. 
e. Word recognition testing determines your ability to recognize a standardized list of phonetically balanced monosyllabic words in the absence of any visual cues. This testing must be performed in quiet. The list may be recorded or presented live, but in either case the words should be presented at a level of amplification that will measure your maximum ability to discriminate words, usually 35 to 40 dB above your SRT. However, the amplification level used in the testing must be medically appropriate, and you must be able to tolerate it. If you cannot be tested at 35 to 40 dB above your SRT, the person who performs the test should report your word recognition testing score at your highest comfortable level of amplification. 

 3.What audiometric testing do we need when you have a cochlear implant? 

a. If you have a cochlear implant, we will consider you to be disabled until 1 year after initial implantation. 

b. After that period, we need word recognition testing performed with any version of the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) to determine whether your impairment meets 2.11B. This testing must be conducted in quiet in a sound field. Your implant must be functioning properly and adjusted to your normal settings. The sentences should be presented at 60 dB HL (Hearing Level) and without any visual cues. 

 4.How do we evaluate your word recognition ability if you are not fluent in English?

If you are not fluent in English, you should have word recognition testing using an appropriate word list for the language in which you are most fluent. The person conducting the test should be fluent in the language used for the test. If there is no appropriate word list or no person who is fluent in the language and qualified to perform the test, it may not be possible to measure your word recognition ability. If your word recognition ability cannot be measured, your hearing loss cannot meet 2.10B or 2.11B. Instead, we will consider the facts of your case to determine whether you have difficulty understanding words in the language in which you are most fluent, and if so, whether that degree of difficulty medically equals 2.10B or 2.11B. For example, we will consider how you interact with family members, interpreters, and other persons who speak the language in which you are most fluent. 



C. How do we evaluate vertigo associated with disturbances of labyrinthine-vestibular function, including Ménière's disease? 

 1. Vertigo associated with disturbances of labyrinthine-vestibular function, including Ménière's disease. These disturbances of balance are characterized by a hallucination of motion or a loss of position sense and a sensation of dizziness which may be constant or may occur in paroxysmal attacks.  Nausea, vomiting, ataxia, and incapacitation are frequently observed, particularly during the acute attack.  It is important to differentiate the report of rotary vertigo from that of ""dizziness"" which is described as light-headedness, unsteadiness, confusion, or syncope. 

 2. Ménière's disease is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss.  Remissions are unpredictable and irregular, but may be long-lasting; hence, the severity of impairment is best determined after prolonged observation and serial reexaminations. 

 3. The diagnosis of a vestibular disorder requires a comprehensive neuro-otolaryngologic examination with a detailed description of the vertiginous episodes, including notation of frequency, severity, and duration of the attacks.  Pure tone and speech audiometry with the appropriate special examinations, such as Bekesy audiometry, are necessary.  Vestibular function is accessed by positional and caloric testing, preferably by electronystagmography.  When polytomograms, contrast radiography, or other special tests have been performed, copies of the reports of these tests should be obtained in addition to appropriate medically acceptable imaging reports of the skull and temporal bone.  Medically acceptable imaging includes, but is not limited to, x-ray imaging, computerized axial tomography (CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without contrast material, myelography, and radiocnuclear bone scans.  “Appropriate” means that the technique used is the proper one to support the evaluation and diagnosis of the impairment. .

218,"Everyone's entitled to feel how they feel. Personally, I'm now much more able to do an internal eye roll and get on with my day without giving two fucks whether I do or don't inspire someone by completing the most mundane task.

However, as a child, I found this deeply troubling. To my naive and immature 12 year old self, it felt that I wasn't allowed to have weak or vulnerable moments because if I did then people wouldn't think I was strong or inspirational any more and they'd stop liking me or caring about me. I felt like I always had to put on a strong, brave face even when things I was going through were awful because that's what the society I grew up in expected me to do. I was enormously confused by being labelled as an inspiration for doing quite simple things, it contributed greatly to my anxiety and depression throughout my teenage years because I bottled up all my fears and all my low moments in fear that I wasn't doing disability ""right"". I'd act completely normal during the day and cry myself to sleep every night because I felt like a weak, pathetic liar. When I had a traumatic surgical experience during my early teens I laughed it off and told the story as if it was some great achievement and soaked in the 'inspirational' praise because people around me had all decided I was the ideal poster child for bravery and inspiration for continuing to live my life. 10 years later my self worth imploded, I had a complete and total breakdown because I couldn't keep up the facade any longer. My therapist spent the first 2 years helping me accept that I didn't have to take on the role of the ""inspirational"" disabled person, that it was OK to feel vulnerable and weak sometimes. Coming to that realization took a huge amount of work.

4 years later, I now brush such comments from people aside and get on with my day instead of internalizing them, worrying about them and then trying to project them outwards. If someone likes that I managed to get out of bed and make it to the supermarket, good for them. It no longer has to affect how I perceive myself. However, I recognize that some disabled children in particular have difficulty reconciling being labelled as inspirational or brave with having moments of fear and weakness. And perhaps some disabled adults too. I wish someone at the time had expressed how such comments are silly, I would have taken them less seriously but unfortunately nobody did. Therefore, whilst some see it as nothing more than a bit of a joke, others might have had a more troubling experience with such language in their past and may be less inclined to brush it off as a joke.

At the end of the day we're all fighting some kind of fight, even if we don't know or understand all of each other's experiences or feelings about certain aspects of disability. I guess my point is that we should all try not to judge each other as we don't know what people might have been through that has shaped their opinions.

239,"You will ABSOLUTELY want health insurance in the US. I go to school and work with many foreign exchange students, and I know that, depending on your country of origin, it may seem weird to be expected to pay one or two thousand a year for medical insurance - but the way the American healthcare system is set up, you will not do well without it. Drugs here are very expensive (I am on three, and they are between 100$ and 300$ a month without insurance; with it it goes down to 5-15$ a month) and access to a doctor or hospital is extremely pricey - a doctor's visit can be 3-400$ a trip, and a hospital visit is usually thousands. Ambulances cost money too, and it can be thousands a trip without insurance, so if at all possible, get a friend or RA to drive you - even with insurance it will probably save you a few hundred bucks.

In America, there is a Deductable and a Co-pay. A deductable is the amount of money you must pay before your insurance pays at all. For example, you may find a cheap insurance with a 3000$ deductable - you must pay out of pocket the first 3000$, and then they will help by paying a percentage of the money spent above that. So a 5000$ hospital bill with a 3000$ deductable and then 80% coverage would cost you 3,400$ and save you 1,600$ - this is not good insurance for someone like you who will need potentially a lot of healthcare; insurance like this also usually doesn't cover medical devices like wheelchairs well.

The other type of insurance is more expensive than the first, but better. It has a co-pay - an amount you pay for everything - and the rest is covered by the insurance. The co-pay can be a percent - say, you cover 20% of doctor's visit costs, 20% of prescription meds, and 10% of hospital bills - or a dollar amount; for example, my insurance charges 30$ a doctor visit for doctors in their program, 200$ for ambulance, 45$ for specialist, 200$ for hospital emergency visits, and then charges 30% for a hospital stay more than 2 days... It also covers 50% of ""Durable Medical Equipment"", like your wheelchair.

You can see pretty easily that getting the right insurance is a big part of getting good care. My insurance is through a co-op, and costs 151$ a month; it's considered good but not best. Still, if you can afford the co-pays and aren't worried about long hospital stays, it may be close to what's right for you.

Another thing for you to consider is Emergency Student Repatriation Insurance. What this will do is let you repatriate home in case of an emergency - for example, it will cover your flight home and back in the event of an immediate family member's death or serious hospitalization, or your return to Tunesia in the event of a medical emergency requiring a long hospital stay - much better to be cared for by the Caisse Nationale than an American hospital at 30% a day if you will be hospitalized for a long period, since the bill can be thousands or tens of thousands a day. This insurance is fairly pricey, but those I know who have it like it; if you are unlikely to need longer-term hospitalization, however, it may be better to chance it if you can't afford the insurance.

I go to school and work with many foreign exchange students, and I know that, depending on your country of origin, it may seem weird to be expected to pay one or two thousand a year for medical insurance - but the way the American healthcare system is set up, you will not do well without it. Drugs here are very expensive (I am on three, and they are between 100$ and 300$ a month without insurance; with it it goes down to 5-15$ a month) and access to a doctor or hospital is extremely pricey - a doctor's visit can be 3-400$ a trip, and a hospital visit is usually thousands. Ambulances cost money too, and it can be thousands a trip without insurance, so if at all possible, get a friend or RA to drive you - even with insurance it will probably save you a few hundred bucks.

In <LOCATION>, there is a Deductable and a Co-pay. A deductable is the amount of money you must pay before your insurance pays at all. For example, you may find a cheap insurance with a 3000$ deductable - you must pay out of pocket the first 3000$, and then they will help by paying a percentage of the money spent above that. So a 5000$ hospital bill with a 3000$ deductable and then 80% coverage would cost you 3,400$ and save you 1,600$ - this is not good insurance for someone like you who will need potentially a lot of healthcare; insurance like this also usually doesn't cover medical devices like wheelchairs well.

The other type of insurance is more expensive than the first, but better. It has a co-pay - an amount you pay for everything - and the rest is covered by the insurance. The co-pay can be a percent - say, you cover 20% of doctor's visit costs, 20% of prescription meds, and 10% of hospital bills - or a dollar amount; for example, my insurance charges 30$ a doctor visit for doctors in their program, 200$ for ambulance, 45$ for specialist, 200$ for hospital emergency visits, and then charges 30% for a hospital stay more than 2 days... It also covers 50% of ""Durable Medical Equipment"", like your wheelchair.

You can see pretty easily that getting the right insurance is a big part of getting good care. My insurance is through a co-op, and costs 151$ a month; it's considered good but not best. Still, if you can afford the co-pays and aren't worried about long hospital stays, it may be close to what's right for you.

Another thing for you to consider is Emergency Student Repatriation Insurance. What this will do is let you repatriate home in case of an emergency - for example, it will cover your flight home and back in the event of an immediate family member's death or serious hospitalization, or your return to Tunesia in the event of a medical emergency requiring a long hospital stay - much better to be cared for by the Caisse Nationale than an American hospital at 30% a day if you will be hospitalized for a long period, since the bill can be thousands or tens of thousands a day. This insurance is fairly pricey, but those I know who have it like it; if you are unlikely to need longer-term hospitalization, however, it may be better to chance it if you can't afford the insurance.

Definitely think abortion should be legal for all, including those who discover their child will have a disability during pregnancy. Like you, I also feel it means we have failed as a society to support, include and accept disabled children to a large extent. Equally, I understand the costs involved and the time and the energy and stress. I know that not everyone can do it and that's OK.

There is one thing I cannot stand though and that's when people say they want to abort their disabled child and act like it's because they don't want their child to suffer being different when really it's because they can't handle it. There is nothing wrong in accepting that you can't handle or don't have the resources to raise a child with a disability. But it really pisses me off when I get into this conversation with people and they're like ""Yeah but knowing what your disability is like and how much you've suffered, would you bring a child like that into this world?"".

Like thanks, but I've actually had a pretty great life and I'm actually happy even if I sometimes have periods of difficulty. It really pisses me off when people just assume the suffering outweighs the fulfilling life that we can lead with the right support.

""Bound"" just doesn't have the right connotation. Its an exaggeration. It means you are tied to a wheelchair. Why not talk literally instead of using a word with an inaccurate implication? 

Thinking of being ""bound"" to a wheelchair draws such a negative picture. The wheelchair is an awesome tool that gives us back our mobility when we lose it. For many of us, the phrase ""wheelchair bound"" is just plain offensive.. But aside from that, it propagates the idea that everyone who uses a wheelchair is unable to move from it. While that is the case for many people who use wheelchairs, there are tons of people who use a wheelchair part time or all of the time that can stand or walk, etc. Wheelchair bound is such a catchphrase at this point that it gets used incorrectly by other people and spreads misconceptions about disability/mobility impairment.

270,"First let me say that I am not a fan of guns for protection....

That being said, here are some things you should address or consider for future videos (imo of course)

1. References! In this video you make a claim that people with disabilities are more likely to be victims of violent crime. For this and any future statements like that, it would be great to link to your information

2. I'm interested in how and if you'll be addressing various disabilities in relation to gun ownership, specifically those that aren't able to carry because of intellectual or physical limitations. 

3. If you are going to continue this series and your campaign, please address gun safety and responsibility. People with guns are far more likely to be shot with their own weapon then they are to defend themselves with it. 

4. Somewhat related to #3, people with disabilities suffer from a higher rate of depression and social anxiety than the general population. Access to a firearm could create a life ending decision. Maybe address this as well as the social benefits of being a gun owner. Maybe going to a gun range is a good stress reliever? I don't know but still I think just as important if not more so than defense.

285,"SSA is not based on logic, its a set of very complicated rules that have been cobbled together over the last 80 years. The rules are often confusing and don't make sense. And that's why so many people get cut off benefits, they don't understand the rules. So unfortunately ""gifts"" are considered income by SSA. But the good news is receiving ""gifts"" most likely will not result in you loosing your benefit check.  It depends on which SS benefit you are receiving. If you get SSI, when you receive any type of income , SSI does not count the first $85.00 dollars you get, you put it in your pocket and SSI will not count it. But, if you get more than $85.00 dollars in a month, SSI will reduce your next months check, by one dollar for every two you receive. As you can imagine it causes most folks, much stress and confusion. Also to make thing worse, extra income can affect food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing allotments. Now, if you are collecting SSDI benefits the rules are completely different! The short answer is SSDI is a all or nothing benefit. You can get up to $1090.00 per month and you won't lose your check.

I became disabled over a year ago and needing assistance with both a wheelchair and people for some basic functions.  No one hands you an instruction manual on what to do and say when your entire body stops cooperating with you and you have to adapt to a whole new life.  No one tells you what the accepted/offensive terminology for the disabled community is. And I am part of the community. If you took the time to watch any of my videos, I have also had impacts to my brain function, leaving some cognitive impacts and deductive reasoning issues.  It's been a lot to deal with.  I was not aware that the wheelchair user community found the term ""wheelchair bound"" offensive.  I have never been offended by the term and  now that I use a wheelchair daily, I am still not offended by the term. 
However, I will always be respectful and not use it if it's made aware to me that it is considered offensive. I have much bigger issues that I am dealing with, such as a disease that can kill me. While I appreciate that you brought to my attention that I was using a term that is considered offensive to the community, you may have approached how you initially addressed it differently. Your first comment was that I was saying something that was ""truly gross"".  I think that people tend to forget that there is an actual human being sitting on the other end of this thread.  Sure, it's important to have a discussion about terminology, but if you had said it for example as ""by the way, the term wheelchair bound is considered offensive to the disabled community"" I would have not come away feeling like I have been scolded for an issue I wasn't aware of or intentionally trying to be offensive.  I joined reddit just a few hours before I submitted my post. I thought it would be a good community to spread awareness and to provide and receive support from. I have so many questions as a person who is relatively newly disabled. Please see from my perspective that your comments were some of the first that I read and I must say I have to wonder if the rest of the community is also not as supportive.  I think how we speak to one another and assuming good intentions is important.  
I respect your opinion and I understand why you have that opinion.  But I was not trying to be offensive in any way.

325,"Hey there, I just wanted to say I have a similar situation. My disabilities are different in nature. I have so many medical diagnosis now I'm not even sure how to explain that anymore, most of them are probably considered hidden disabilities as I don't use any assistive technology but I do have quite a few functional limitations.

That said, everything else about your post reminds me of my own situation. I'm also 26 and live in a rural area with no jobs that fit my degree and/or limitations. I keep applying for jobs out of the area hoping someone will hire me and I will be able to move but haven't had any luck. My states VR agency is a joke, they refuse to help me, refuse to even accommodate my disability for meetings sometimes, refuse to acknowledge I have no cognitive limitations, refuse to help me with transportation...

Transportation is a major issue for me, I don't have a vehicle, don't have enough money to purchase or maintain a vehicle, and there is no public transpiration in my area. Basically the only way I can ever be employed is if I find a job that will pay enough that I can afford a car loan, or find a job in an area with good public transportation that's willing to hire someone out of the area.

I've made a lot of phone calls and e-mails to people asking for help and no one ever gets back to me with any useful information. When you mention you live in a rural area people tend to say, move and look for a job in your new location... This is insane! If I had the money to upend my entire life and move, I might not even need a job in the first place. 

Right now I'm considering going on to grad school, even though my VR agency keeps telling me not, because it's been four years of job searching and I have gotten literally two interviews out of over 400 applications and no job offers.

I said ""That's okay I've got it"" because it was a borrowed car and I didn't want to scratch the trunk and she huffed and said ""UGH!"" And all I could do was roll my eyes.

People just get weirdly disappointed when they can't help and feel deserving of their ""gold star for that day"".   
  
And the other experience I can think of is one time we were going to the hospital PT clinic. We parked in designated crip parking. I got out of the car to get his chair only for a man, presumably coming from the hospital, to come over to me and say ""You can't park here"" just as I was putting the key into the trunk. I just blinked at him, turned the key, and began to drag J's chair out of the trunk. After which the man turned his sour expression to ""Let me help you with that"" to which I answered ""NOPE. I've got it."" Probably rudely because, well, if you've got a problem with my parking there because I look too able bodied and you can't see my boyfriend or the placard in the car because you're too lazy -- it's really not my problem.

For all I know this man has some judgement damaging TBI he's recovering from and doesn't realize he's being a prick. I said in my most firm voice possible ""Have a good day dude"". Just slid the chair the rest of the way out of the trunk. Pressed it down so it locked open. And wheeled it over to the side door to get J out. I didn't even bother mentioning the experience to J. Because people say enough stupid shit to us as it ""God bless you"", ""You're so nice"", talking to me like I'm his nurse, etc -- it's just not worth both of us having to deal with continual annoyance. In general I try to protect him from the weird shit people say to me.   
  
&gt;He even starting in on an anti-feminist rant. He brought feminism up not me; I stayed silent for the most part.  
  
I don't know if any of the above experiences made you feel less alone but, to add just one more! (not disability related, but contained feminism rants) For a while I was selling antiques on ebay -- my grandma was moving out of her house and had a master cache of hummels, royal doulton and the like. I had a lot of packages to bring into the post office. Given the delicate nature of the packages, I wanted to carry them myself. ""Mr.Harry-the-helper-Joe-Schmoe on the street"", thought better of me carrying my packages myself. He wanted to ""help"". When I politely declined. He launched into a rant about how ""feminism is just enabling women to hurt themselves"". I just replied with ""Whatever you say honey"" and strolled on in to the post office.  
  
The thing I regret about my interaction with those types of men from a feminist standpoint - is it's said that women reply to intolerance with silence and placation. We cede to whatever asshole is present because of the real threat of physical violence or because silence is the path of least friction --- some men who say awful things go unreprimanded. Which to me is not ideal. But, when there's a child involved or a breakable boyfriend, safety to me, is more paramount than ""fighting the good fight"".

In general I try to protect him from the weird shit people say to me.   
  
&gt;He even starting in on an anti-feminist rant. He brought feminism up not me; I stayed silent for the most part.  
  
I don't know if any of the above experiences made you feel less alone but, to add just one more! (not disability related, but contained feminism rants) For a while I was selling antiques on ebay -- my grandma was moving out of her house and had a master cache of hummels, royal doulton and the like. I had a lot of packages to bring into the post office. Given the delicate nature of the packages, I wanted to carry them myself. ""Mr.<PERSON>-the-helper-Joe-Schmoe on the street"", thought better of me carrying my packages myself. He wanted to ""help"". When I politely declined. He launched into a rant about how ""feminism is just enabling women to hurt themselves"". I just replied with ""Whatever you say honey"" and strolled on in to the post office.  
  
The thing I regret about my interaction with those types of men from a feminist standpoint - is it's said that women reply to intolerance with silence and placation. We cede to whatever asshole is present because of the real threat of physical violence or because silence is the path of least friction --- some men who say awful things go unreprimanded. Which to me is not ideal. But, when there's a child involved or a breakable boyfriend, safety to me, is more paramount than ""fighting the good fight"". 
  
**tl;dr:** I'm sorry you had this experience. You're definitely not alone.

403,"Yeah, I feel like that frequently. To be honest, this may not be a part of your mind you'll ever be able to shut down completely - although you may get a lot better at ignoring it. This has been a fear and insecurity that has been with me from before I was in a relationship, so I know it runs deep. I don't know if that's maybe the same for you? 

The thing is though, you can only really take it one day at a time in any relationship (whether you're disabled or not). Nobody can ever guarantee that they will be happy with their partner forever, not even people who are married can look so far into the future (although they have probably thought about it and decided it's likely, at least I hope so, ha). 

I think you're definitely on the right track by splitting the care and relationship aspects. It probably works for some people but I've personally always seen relationships (romantic or otherwise) fall apart when care gets introduced. Have you ever reassured her that you do not intend to ever have her play that role? I once said this in my relationship and it lifted a weight off my shoulders because I think deep down I was worried my SO might think this could be a reality down the line. It turns out he didn't but I certainly felt so much better making that clear and it helped to know that my SO wasn't even worried about that. That was 4 years into the relationship, so you can get a sense of just how challenging I find dealing with these particular insecurities and fears. Something else you might want to talk about is whether your partner is worried about something bad happening to you. I don't know your disability but I'm willing to bet if it's severe and physical you might be more at risk for certain things? For example, chest infections are bad news for me. This year I had a really bad one, I thought I was going to end up in hospital. A few months later, I decided that I needed to know if he felt like the fear of something bad like that happening was a big deal to him. It turns out it was, but I think that he was also bottling that up inside and was afraid to express it which only makes things more difficult. It's OK for people to be afraid sometimes but it helps to get these things out in the open. My point is, sometimes you might have to have some tough conversations so that you can work through fears on both sides, together. However, you should try not to let it overshadow the relationship. Give your partner the opportunity to air her fears (if she has any) and air yours too by talking about your worries that she doesn't understand the cost and care involved. But don't keep at the same issues because that can drive people away. At some point you just gotta trust that she wants to be with you.

Something else you could try - What is it that you offer her in the relationship? We talk a lot about our needs and the burden we put on others but we never stop to think what we actually bring. That can be so detrimental to our self-esteem. Is it resilience? Sheer inner strength? Emotional maturity? A very dark sense of humour? Think about it. I'm sure there's something. And if you really are so insecure you have trouble with that (as I certainly have in the past), ask her. She may not have the exact words for it but she will have a sense of what it is.

Now, your parents. I don't even know what to do with them. Look, I mean some parents have difficulty with this. When I started my relationship my mum asked me if I'd considered the consequences of what I was doing (and by the way, she cares greatly about my partner so it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with me). Honestly, I love my mum and I know it came out of a good place, but I told her to fuck off and I walked/rolled away. I told her this was none of her business and to never bring it up again. I also told her that people like her, with that attitude, are the reason that disabled people don't feel they deserve to be or can be loved. I thanked her for the 19 years I spent feeling like I didn't deserve a relationship, that I would be alone forever. I told her to cut the fucking umbilical cord and that just because she still cared for me sometimes it didn't give her a right to question my decisions or get involved. It was a strong reaction on my part, perhaps others would think it was ridiculously overblown, but I was enraged and honestly I was sickened by her questioning because it made me realize that she viewed me as an asexual child. Do not let your parents bullshit get to you. I don't know if it's because they're afraid for you or if it's because they have some weird problem accepting that they might have to let go of you but that is not cool and if you are able to, you should tell them so. This kind of stuff would literally make my blood boil, they are totally out of line. You and your partner are more than capable of deciding who you do and don't want to be with and they should be under no illusions that it might be otherwise.

407,"One thing you may want to look into is babywearing. A good carrier could be a lifesaver if you do need to take the bus, that way you don't have to pack a stroller while working about your chair.

There are so many to choose from I am sure you could find One that would work. 

For the newborn stage I cannot recommend the Fisher Price Rock N Play enough. It does not take up a lot of room and it doesn't require you to do any reaching down.

413,"&gt; SSA is not based on logic, its a set of very complicated rules that have been cobbled together over the last 80 years. The rules are often confusing and don't make sense. And that's why so many people get cut off benefits, they don't understand the rules. So unfortunately ""gifts"" are considered income by SSA. But the good news is receiving ""gifts"" most likely will not result in you loosing your benefit check.  It depends on which SS benefit you are receiving. If you get SSI, when you receive any type of income , SSI does not count the first $85.00 dollars you get, you put it in your pocket and SSI will not count it. But, if you get more than $85.00 dollars in a month, SSI will reduce your next months check, by one dollar for every two you receive. As you can imagine it causes most folks, much stress and confusion. Also to make thing worse, extra income can affect food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing allotments. Now, if you are collecting SSDI benefits the rules are completely different! The short answer is SSDI is a all or nothing benefit. You can get up to $1090.00 per month and you won't lose your check. But, if you receive one dollar more than $1090.00 per month, you lose your whole benefit for the month. For the whole story on SSA benefits , PM me if you want more info. Hope this helps.

I imagine a lot of people born disabled would be more likely to decline a cure for their condition. For them, being cured might be experienced the same way we experienced becoming disabled later in life; they would have to adapt to a profoundly different lifestyle, and it could lead to grief over what they've always known. So while I would love a cure (or even just really effective treatment) I could understand how someone else could balk at the idea.

Of course, this law does none of these things. Even if the law were enforceable (which it isn't), and the abortion of downs kids stopped completely, then what? 

My gut feeling is that the would-have-been aborted ones would be pawned off on the state to care for. That's hardly a better scenario in a world where the gov's social services are intentionally underfunded and intentionally mismanaged.

Its not quite so clear cut IRL because of the way adoption has become so expensive and complicated, almost reserving it for only the middle &amp; upper classes.

515,"So in America we have something called the Americans with Disabilities act, which provides protection and rights to people with disabilities, including the right to education. As I am sure you are aware, just because something is in law doesn't mean it is perfect. There are a lot of schools out there with great programs for people with disabilities, but there are some that aren't so great. Do you need help with daily care, such as bathing or transferring to your chair? If so, there are very few schools that can support you, but there are a few. Let me know if that applies to you and I will add more on that.

If you are able to take care of yourself, there are a lot more options. I would suggest looking at state schools, because they have a lot more resources for disability support as they are state funded. There are some good private schools as well. 

Here is a list of possible accommodations that schools can give students with disabilities. This is not all inclusive, I include mostly things that apply to people that use wheelchairs, not people that are deaf/blind, etc:

* Housing: accessible dorm room/elevator access, accessible bathroom/shower, central location on campus
* Dining: help with selecting food in the dining hall
* Classroom/testing: extended time for exams, use of a computer, a scribe to write test answers as you say them out loud, student note taker, preferential seating, access to text-to-speech software

There are other accommodations available as well, as I said. All of this is determined in a meeting with your school's Office of Disability Services, based on documentation from a medical professional. As far as documentation goes, it is not enough to wheel into your appointment, although the disability certainly is obvious. You have to have a letter from a doctor stating what your disability is and what sort of accommodations you will need. You can call disability services ahead of time to figure out what they want as far as documentation. They may want you to see an American doctor, or you may be able to bring it from your home country. I'm not sure.

The most important thing I can tell you right now is this: **you are not legally required to disclose (share) your disability with the admissions offices at the schools you apply to.** And honestly, I would suggest not disclosing, although it is your decision. The problem is the admission officer might see it badly. After you are accepted is the time to contact disability services and work things out. I would also suggest reaching out to your school's international office at that point to figure out healthcare. I know very little about how it works for international students, but most American colleges have a health insurance plan you can buy into. Ours was about $1000 a year.

I hope this was helpful and I wish you the best of luck. If you have more questions feel free to ask. I'm also willing to help advise you on specific colleges reputations, etc. I know how hard that can be to determine from outside the country!

I didn't like him at all initially because he had a really posh British accent and being the judgmental dickface that I am, I instantly decided he must be a snob. However, he happened to become part of the same social group I was in and we had lots of classes together AND he was ginger (which I thought was hella cool because I had a teen crush on Ron Weasley) AND he said he liked Sigur Ros music (so I thought ok, this guy is basically alright).

So, we became friends for a few months and then decided we liked each other. Well, actually, a mutual friend decided for us because we were pretty shit at figuring it out for ourselves. Apparently, friends don't put on an Arcade Fire album and then hug for like half an hour or plan when their next hug will be. Apparently, friends who are apart during the Christmas holidays don't spend every evening chatting for hours online or talking about how much they miss hugging. Apparently that's something you should do with your SO or whatever. Yeah, in retrospect, I know we're both scientists and so like emotions aren't really supposed to be our thing but damn we were stupid.

Anyway, everyone knew we liked each other aside from the two of us. I couldn't really believe anyone could like me like that and he didn't believe I could like him and was scared to ask me out so we weren't getting anywhere on our own. Mutual friend convinced him to ask me and so he did. We then spent a week being like ""actually nah this is a bad idea, nah we don't like each other, we just like arcade fire or whatever, let's not do this"".

I'm pretty into gaming right now and youtubing. It's pretty much the only thing I do all day and I'm not a fan of it-- as in my eyes I see it as vegging out, which was always a big no-no in my book-- but I haven't been too bored luckily. It's just that I'm tired of just laying around doing nothing and being around no one other than my parents. 

I wouldn't mind heading out to the park, especially if I had something to do. Kite flying seems fun and very practical, so I'll look into that. 

I played sports in school and I miss that schedule of waking up early for 2-a-days then going back to my dorm to study.  I don't have that kind of structure. I literally go to bed around 2am and wake up at noon most days. I hate it, but I just have nothing to do... no one is willing to work with me to go out... so why the hell not sleep until noon? My only 'outside' time is heading over to PT and OT haha
