1,"It's federal - SSDI. I think I have her convinced to make an appointment with a new doctor, who can hopefully give her better treatment and deal with paperwork like this better if/when it's needed. 

Another part of the problem is that part of disability is severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. And after already having PTSD from several things earlier in life, she's been pretty traumatized by doctors - she woke up in the middle of major surgery, had another botched surgery that damaged a nerve in her hip pretty badly, has been yelled at or severely berated for crying in the office, told she's crazy and her pain isn't real, physically manhandled to some degree for not moving or talking fast enough for the doctor(not the current on, just past experiences). So for her to stand up for herself with a doctor and have to push them to do the right thing is extremely difficult for her... or for her to see a new doctor. 

I'm pretty sure she will be fine with what she's able to give them so far. The current doctor apparently told her at her last appointment(just found this out) that he couldn't see her anymore because her case was too complicated, which I would think would actually help her case in regards to them pulling records from him(I don't think there's any chance he'll do it on my friend's behalf honestly until SSA requests them). 

Anyway, I'm mostly just venting at this point. Sorry. Your advice has been very helpful and hopefully we/she can use the part about the doctor's letter with the new doctor that she will hopefully follow through and see.

3,"Good morning :) 
Getting approved for disability is exhausting. 
I was approved about a year ago (after three years), and would be happy to share some things I think help a whole lot. 

First, with systemic illness, we really have to illustrate for the SSA why we cannot predictably partake in ""gainful employment"". They have to hear the nitty gritty details about the unpredictable onset of disabling symptoms. They have to understand approximately how much of your day and week is taken up by managing said symptoms. If sedentary or modified work is not possible for you, you have to illustrate why that is the case, and back it up with medical records and ideally written testimony from doctors. Disabling pain, unexpected cramps/spasms, unpredictable exhaustion, etc. I think it can be a little more necessary to detail this for invisible disabilities versus something they can visually interpret on some level.

I organized my own case for my hearing judge. When I first applied for SSDI, they indicated they would pull my records and collate my case to match the testimony I was giving upon application. 

Ahh, naivet√©. 

I received my first denial letter and saw that they had failed to retrieve 90% of my relevant records and had listed symptoms as my disability. Okay fine. 

I appealed and began pulling ALL of my own records so that by the time they set a hearing, I had a beautifully organized binder, partitioned off by doctor and in reverse chronological order. 

At the front of the binder, I placed a testimony letter from two different therapists I have seen over the years, my primary treating physician, my husband, and myself. I included actual disc copies of MRI's, and a thick envelope of triage notes. 
For every statement in the testimony letters, there was a notated record to back it up. They approved me without continuation of the hearing, because I made it easy for them. Oh, I also made a copy of this binder for myself for reference, and kept a digital copy. 

What this taught me was that they WANT to expedite these things, but often do not have the proper case to do so. If you or your lawyer can really simply and quickly illustrate with multiple medical records how you are disabled, you will be approved MUCH more quickly than if you wait for them to put your case together for you. 

I think even a lawyer who is excellent with disability cases is unlikely to know as well as you do why it is you cannot work. I knew that no one knew better than I what was preventing me from being able to work, and I also had an idea of where in my records that would be indicated. A lawyer will be a huge relief for you, because putting together your own SSDI case is physically exhausting (I needed some serious time to recover after I did mine) and full of intricate laws and etiquette that the lawyer can help navigate.. but I would NOT just let them submit a case for you without your review. There could be a whole section of pertinent records missing, etc. 
*I can't speak on what an SSDI lawyer is like or how they operate since I did not use one, so I want to clarify that I am not criticizing them here, as I have no basis to do so- I just think probably no one will be able to explain how my disability impacts me better than I can ;)*

The testimonial letters, I asked for over time. I explained to each practitioner that I was applying for SSDI and could they give a summary from their own perspective of my health and character. The one from my husband was an account of things he helps me with and the symptoms he witnesses from a ""caretaker"" perspective. The ones from my psychotherapists indicated my character, motivation, ability to cope. The one from my doctor was symptom/treatment/prognosis oriented. 

If I had gotten this stuff to them earlier, it would have been scanned into ""exhibits"" for the reviewer to analyze and approve or deny or partially approve, etc. A binder at the SSDI hearing is WEIRD practice, but I was fed up with trying to get my records to them. I had set up sessions to ""update my file"" and these were cancelled due to flooding in the local office and some other similar but less memorable reason the second time. Apparently I could have just showed up and waited in the office, but I was trying to set an actual appointment so I didn't have to put myself through so much physically. Basically, turning this in at any earlier point is wise :) 

Your own education, past hobbies, and work history will also help with your approval. If it is clear you were driven and motivated to work for as long as possible, this is all part of the complete picture they take in while they establish that you are disabled. I think the same is true if a life history shows a longer history of disability or depression- basically  they need to see who you are and if there is any treatment or changes that could occur in your life that could make it possible for you to work again :) 

Sorry for the poor organization of this reply- If I can answer anything or be of help in some way, let me know. I found this process incredibly exhausting, but if I had just handed them exactly what they needed when I first went to apply, I MAY have been approved three years earlier... 

All the best luck :) Keep us posted, eh?

Btw, your writing is perfectly intelligible. I think you may just be hard on yourself because you are a lawyer and used to having to write things exceptionally well. 

This is all super helpful, and will hopefully make her feel better. After looking into it more, I'm feeling pretty confident that she will be fine and am more concerned about easing her stress until it is dealt with. It sounds like once you're approved initially that they have to actually prove that she CAN work, and have strong evidence that she has actually improved, as opposed to having to reprove that she can't. I'm not sure if I worded that properly, but as a lawyer, I imagine you know what I mean. 

The biggest problem currently is her doctor. She's had to find a new doctor since moving to a new state and deal with whole new state's terrible social services system. Long story short, she's had to see a doctor at a very busy low-income clinic and she doesn't even see the same doctor each time. He's been difficult about things, incompetent about other things, etc. And if you've ever been to a low-income clinic, it's hard to get the doctor to even focus on you or stay in the room for more than a minute or two. And when you leave, because they are even more overworked than other doctors, they forget things, don't follow through, etc. I suspect it may be difficult to get him to cooperate at all, much less do things right. 

I can normally help her more with these things, but we're in different states now, and the best I could do so far was having her teenage daughter read some of it to me over the phone and we helped fill it out the parts we legally could for her mom. But I don't remember it mentioning requiring a doctor's letter or signature. Is this required or just recommended? If the doctor won't do it/puts it off/etc, how bad is it to exclude this and just let SSA contact him themselves if they feel the need?

46,"&gt;Not necessarily. The potential for systematic abuse there is very high. That's not to say that help shouldn't be available, but instituationalization is often not help in any meaningful sense.

So it seems your problem is more with the abuse that can and does go on rather than instituanalizing people who are a danger to themselves/others. And I agree it is a problem but then shouldn't the issue be stopping those abuses rather than just letting people harm themselves/others with no intervention? 

&gt;You're jumping the gun. Besides the fact that brain mapping issue != mental disorder (If anything, they're talking about a neurological disorder), the fact of brain states itself doesn't make a disorder.

Fine, whatever you call it something is going wrong in their brain which answers your question whether it is a preference or not. And to be fair, I'm seeing a lot of people compare this to gender dysphoria which is a mental disorder.

&gt;I can definitely see the potential for this, but you don't seem to think that classifying it as a mental disorder will be detrimental to those of us who already have diagnoses for mental disabilities. Kind of unfair to say ""these people suck and will make things worse for us, so let's allow them to make things worse for those with psychiatric abilities instead.""

Like I said before, whatever you want to call it something is going wrong in their brain. There is nothing wrong with them physically (until they take it upon themselves to do something). I'm not exactly sure how it would make it worse for people with mental disabilities but if it would help call it something else. But it still is a problem in their brain.

62,"Hi! I had a stroke and did OT for a total of 2 years post stroke to learn how to use my left hand again. At first I hated it. I didn't want to admit that I couldn't use my arm, I acted like it wasn't there and just well, wanted it to be invisible and somehow just chop it off so I could use my right arm for everything. It took a lot of prompting and coaxing from my awesome OT's to get me to even recognize that I did indeed still have a left arm. Once I did, it was grueling. Lifting, squeezing, just moving was hard but the OT's were always there coming up with fun things to do to make me take my mind off of actual work. They were also there every time I couldn't quite do it and cried like a baby.... or just cried for no reason, because hey, that's what happens when you have a stroke. 

My therapists would always play great games and do fun things like cooking and play connect four. We even had a Wii hooked up to a little TV and would play bowling once a month or so. My favorite thing to do was stacking cups and seeing how fast I could do it. Granted, I am younger, I'm 33, so this may not work for an older, ""normal-ish"", stroke generation, but I liked it. I also liked learning how to crochet, although I never actually remembered it after I left. My least favorite thing was to use the exercise machines. It was extremely boring.

**What I have:**

Reflex Myoclonus.

---

**What happened:**

My teenage years could have been better. A chronic illness, a dead father, a disabled mother, two siblings that were dealing with their own severe issues. I got through every day by holding this holy grail up in front of me, that one day I would graduate, I'd go to a prestigious university, I'd study in the field I was passionate about and I'd escape from it all. Each morning would start with a mantra of ""Just one more day"". And somehow it happened. I got into the best University in my country, I got into the exact course that I wanted, I even got a decent scholarship. And then of course it all fell to pieces. The genetic lottery decided that it wasn't quite finished making my life complicated, and a bunch of other complications happened as well. Long story short my life fell apart.

And I lost it all. The dream was gone, all the power and independence I felt that I'd earned, my hopes for the future, this bright and shiny 'one day' that I'd always promised myself was gone. I couldn't bring myself to let go, even though deep down I knew I'd already lost it and wasted a good year or two on trying to continue my studies. And when I finally admitted to myself that I wasn't, and couldn't, reach my original goals in life I threw myself at trying to get a job instead. I simply replaced one obsession to 'prove my worth' with a different one. No surprise, but I failed and eventually ended up on a disability pension. And then I had nothing left. Every day I woke up feeling ashamed and lost. I'd look at my partner, my family and friends and in my head I saw pity instead of the empathy and caring that was actually there.

And like that I lost another two precious years of my life. 

It's hard to say what finally turned things around. I moved to a different country, that was a big step. It helped me to leave my past in the past. I got my first real job and promptly lost it two months later because my condition meant I couldn't continue the work. But having that job, even for just those two months, being able to prove to myself that I was still capable despite everything, it helped. I enrolled in University by correspondence (this time picking a degree that could lead to jobs I'm physically capable of doing) found some part time work more suited to my limitations, got re-diagnosed with a more accurate diagnosis and started on a medication that helps less than it hurts, and this year, for the first time in my life, actually had the energy and self esteem to make actual friends.

---

**My thoughts on your thoughts:**

* You are lucky. Treasure that love and support and remember that it, and the financial assistance you're receiving is what you, and anyone in your position, deserves, and it's neither charity nor pity. Loving and supporting your friends and family is what good people do by default. Looking after those in society who need help is what good societies do by default.

* I know that one. It took me years and several doctors to finally get a medication that made my life better rather than worse. I guess the one thing I'd say about it is that you should never take 'meh' for an answer. Push your doctor. Ask about alternatives. Ask for referrals. Make sure there aren't better options out there, because sometimes there are and you'll kick yourself if a few years down the track you find out that you could have been on a better medication or had a more precise diagnosis. I certainly did.

* Yeah, this is the big one. That stupid voice in your head that says ""Should, should, should, should, should"". For starters, don't let yourself get drawn into the cripple Olympics. No two people are the same, no two disabled people are the same, not even with the same medical conditions. Ignore all that bullshit about disabled people with A or B condition who can do X or Y. Don't start comparing yourself to other people, all that matters is what *you* can do and what you're dealing with. Maybe one day you'll be one of those people with a condition like yours that can hold down that full time job. Until then you aren't. As for the rest of the post, something to keep in mind: Guilt is for things you chose to do and choose to be. Every time you feel that try to remind yourself how little sense it makes to feel ashamed for something that you have no control over and that you didn't choose.

* Angry is okay. Just don't be angry at yourself. At the world. At your body. At a god if you believe in one. But not yourself. Don't count yourself out of the game. I did and it was some of the most miserable years of my life. Life has closed a door on you, which sucks. And there isn't a window that was opened in response like the cheezy saying states, which also sucks. Maybe in a while you'll have gotten a handle on things and you'll be able to break that old door down and continue where you left off, or work your way back up to it. Maybe you won't be able to and like me you're going to have to build yourself a new door, one that leads somewhere else. That's a hard thing to deal with, but when the time comes just keep in mind, yes it's embarrassing and exhausting to have to start all over again, but the alternative is going nowhere. And heck if my mum could restart her life and career at fifty why can't we in our late twenties?

* Make something. Learn something. That's how I dealt with feeling useless when I felt it all the time and it's how I deal with it now when it pops its ugly head back up. It doesn't matter what it is. Painting, drawing, writing, carving wood, knitting, programming, playing music, reading a book about something you've always wanted to know more about. At the end of the day it helps a lot to be able to say to yourself 'I made something' or 'I learned something'. Enjoy the little victories and accomplishments. Don't know how to make anything? Learn, practice. You'll appreciate the progress you make.

* Scared is okay. Scared is natural. Scared is actually pretty good, because it means you're confronting the issues that life is throwing at you and not trying to hide from them or ignore them. I don't know how things work in your country regarding disability pensions, you mentioned you have a attorney, talk to them and your doctor about what you need to do to get/keep it. Don't sacrifice your good days unless you absolutely have to, you earned them by making it through the bad ones. Your social life will be harder, that's pretty much a given. What I've learned there is that the answer to ""What do you do?"" is to tell them about your hobbies, your projects, your interests. If they insist on asking what your job is just tell them that you're not working at the moment because of a medical condition. If they ask it's up to you whether you tell them more, just remember that anyone who doesn't accept ""It's personal/It's not something I feel like talking about/It's a long story"" as an answer isn't someone who you should be wasting your time trying to be friends with. It's your choice when and how you tell people about your illness, no one has a right to know any more than you feel comfortable telling them. As for dating, I'm not sure I can offer much advice there. My partner and I started dating before my life got out of control. There have been some very hard parts. There have been times when I wished they'd leave me because I felt they deserved better. I'm sure there were times when they wanted to leave too. But we've become stronger, both of us, despite and because of my illness. There are people out there who will understand what you're going through and there are people out there who will be able to learn. Just think of it as a great filtering system, would you really want to date someone who rules someone out for having a chronic illness anyway?

* This one tears you apart. I'm sorry to say that it probably won't ever stop doing it. All I can say that in time you'll learn how to balance when to fight and when to hunker down and do your best to just make it through. It's a tough balancing act, but you'll figure it out eventually. Don't get taken in by the 'inspirational disabled person' thing that media loves to throw around. ""My doctors told me I'd never walk again, but I fought and now I'm an olympic blah, blah, blah"". It's not how it works for 99.9% of disabled people. Think of pushing yourself as throwing a punch and looking after yourself as dodging. No one wins a fight by doing nothing but throwing punches or by doing nothing but dodging, you need to learn when to do which to win.

**Your Questions:**

1) How did you handle things?

See above. So basically, poorly at first, but with love and support, and learning to love and support myself, I managed to learn how to live happily and reclaim my life a bit.

2) How do you help the people in your life understand?

With difficulty sometimes. Some people just get it, and they don't have to have gone through the same things to do so. Some people struggle to come to terms with it. Try to remember that the fault there is with them, sometimes it's just a misunderstanding, you can try to talk through exactly what's going on with them, help them to understand how things really are. But it's not something you have to do, remember that sometimes it's okay to just let things go. I don't think my brother or sister will ever really understand, but I have my mother, friends and my partner who do, so that's okay.

69,"Whoa, whoa, there are so many problems here.

&gt;All I know is that if I have a ""disabled"" woman a work who ""requires"" a wheelchair ramp and other accommodations; I'm going to be pretty pissed if I see her out playing volleyball somewhere.

You have no idea what my condition is. You have no idea how it affects me. That woman playing volleyball doesn't deserve your unfair, narrow-minded judgment, and neither do I.

&gt;I mean, should my workplace be able to get government benefits for hiring a ""disabled"" person? What if they're disabled because they cut off their own arm?

Obviously this comparison is far from perfect, but hopefully you see why there is a problem with this kind of argument. An element of choice is not necessarily a good reason to withhold benefits.

73,"i get a continued disability review once a year. i think that is the general protocol.  i would imagine that as long as she fills it in thoroughly, especially that last page that says, ""if you want to add any further information that you feel will help your case please tell us"", have her write EVERYTHING down. every little detail that supports her and how it affects her ability to work, etc.  every single doc appointment, prescription, etc. should be included in the paperwork.  

what i also do is before my doc signs off on it, i explain i'm up for disability review and i discuss with them, respectfully and politely, what i think should be in the doc's letter to disability to ensure there are no snags.  i happen to be a lawyer so its a bit easier, but you don't need a lawyer for this.  the doctor simply needs to state in professional terms your friend's disability, why it is now worse (this is important!), and how it affects her life and prevents her from working.  i include even how i can't sleep due to chronic pain and my  inability to focus or think straight (all of which is true and does affect one's ability to work).

many docs like to redo all the tests just to cover their asses.  if there is no need for it, or if its too expensive, or emotionally draining or physically painful, she shouldn't be forced into it.  the docs need a very good reason to make her go through all that testing again.  

i wouldn't worry about her disability benefits getting affected so long as she fills out that paperwork very thoroughly, and reviews the doc's letter before the doc sends it out in case you feel the doc left something out of the letter that you think will be helpful to be in there.

sometimes i've even written the letter for the doc, as an ""example"", and tell the doc that so long as he's comfortable with the contents of my 'sample' letter, then maybe that doc could write his own letter in a similar fashion to what i wrote to expedite the whole thing. some docs are lazy and will write two sentences and that won't help your friend at all.  hence, do a bit of the work for them, and they can be more cooperative.

83,"Hey Guys,

I'm so excited to have stumbled upon this thread - Have you ever heard of Open Style Lab?

We are a non-profit organization based at MIT ( Cambridge, MA) and we create more fashionable clothing for people with disabilities.

We actually are crowdfunding our first retail product called the Rayn Jacket on Betabrand.com. You guys should check it out! It is a waterproof hoodie that has a secret lap cover that pulls out easily to cover the lap in the rain. We also tailored it in a way that doesn't create that unattractive bunching at the waist.

We have 15 days left of crowdfunding and are trying to make this jacket a reality as a Betabrand product! It would really help so many people across the globe, and introduce inclusivity and accesibility into fashion.

After speaking with larger fashion companies like Woolmark, Polartec and PVH, local leaders and partners, we realized that the feelings associated with fashion and disability are mutual across many platforms. This mutually felt feeling and having this message conveyed to many people from friends who are disabled, to leaders, and businesses might just be the most powerful tool in making a more inclusive fashion design community.

So share the Rayn Jacket on your social media and with whomever you can! 

With only 15 days to go, the Rayn Jacket still needs 68 more supporters to reach our goal of 100. If you help fund it, we'll give you an additional 15% discount; just use the promo code ItsGonnaRayn.

103,"Hi /u/NeuroGeek,

I am so sorry you are struggling right now. We all have our own challenges when it comes to disability, but somehow the emotions seem to bring us together. I had a brainstem stroke 5 years ago at the age of 30, taking me from healthy and active one day to unable to hold my own head up the next. The blessing with stroke is the potential for recovery, especially in young patients, and today I am primarily walking again with forearm crutches and a leg brace. However, every day (and sometimes every task) is a reminder that I'm not the same. It's lots of little problems, like the weakness and clumsiness in my right arm and the lack of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of my body that make things like cooking dinner a real challenge. I live alone, with my family in a different state. My very supportive friends and coworkers are in town, but there is only so much that I can bring myself to ask of them. I love my independence, but it does come at a cost. Since that stroke, I have survived another, much smaller stroke, and other minor health issues that caused setbacks along the way.

All that being said, I am happy. I fully recommend you follow up with the specialized therapist. My rehab therapist has made a huge difference on how I have faced this new way of life. Immediately after the first stroke, I hated the phrase ""your new normal"" because it sounded like giving up. You asked if you should fight or accept your limitations, and my honest answer is both. At each step of the way, I have taken the time to assess my life as it truly is. My therapist and family have then helped me to look at what I have and find a way to be happy with what I have, even if it never gets better or even gets worse. Since I can't fix my disability, what can I change in my life to make me happy? Hobbies? Friends? Dating? (I don't have that last one figured out yet, btw). Once I have my plan for happiness in place, I fight like hell to move forward and gain every step I can to get improvements. I don't have to expect them, but that doesn't mean I can't try for them anyway. I was one of the freaks that wasn't supposed to walk again but did. I am greatful for that every moment. And then the next moment I test to see if now I can run. Maybe weird, but it's gotten me this far.

In terms of work, I was completely unable to do the work I had done before. Apparently working with potentially dangerous viruses with hands that don't work is considered unsafe. Anyway, my boss encouraged me to train in a field that allowed me to stay in virology, only working at it from data science and computers. I work partly at home and partly at the office, and I initially got more than a few snide comments about my flexible scheduling. But I knew I wasn't abusing the system. My job got done, my boss was happy, and we've built the program forward. I don't know how far I will be able to take this, but I can only take one day at a time. If I ever have to stop and go on disability (primarily if any more arteries decide to break-- here's hoping they don't), it will be because I had to make that choice, not because of what others think. I keep two quotes in mind: 1) ‚ÄúWhat other people think of me is none of my business.‚Äù Dr. Wayne Dyer, and 2) ""If you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."" Marilyn Monroe. 

Overall, take care of yourself. Take one day at a time-- one second at a time if that is what it takes. Don't waste your limited energy on guilt and self-doubt. We've all tried it. It didn't get us anywhere. Trust us. Also, your life will be focused on your illness and disability for awhile until you get things sorted out. But that changes. If you start focusing on things that make you feel happy or valuable or strong, you start finding new activities to fill your time and give you much more interesting topics for discussion. 

Also, you mentioned skiing-- many areas have adaptive sports of all kinds. I have participated in several. Often they are a chance to hang out with other people who if nothing else understand, so you can just hang out without being ""that handicapped girl"" for the day.

It's lots of little problems, like the weakness and clumsiness in my right arm and the lack of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of my body that make things like cooking dinner a real challenge. I live alone, with my family in a different state. My very supportive friends and coworkers are in town, but there is only so much that I can bring myself to ask of them. I love my independence, but it does come at a cost. Since that stroke, I have survived another, much smaller stroke, and other minor health issues that caused setbacks along the way.

All that being said, I am happy. I fully recommend you follow up with the specialized therapist. My rehab therapist has made a huge difference on how I have faced this new way of life. Immediately after the first stroke, I hated the phrase ""your new normal"" because it sounded like giving up. You asked if you should fight or accept your limitations, and my honest answer is both. At each step of the way, I have taken the time to assess my life as it truly is. My therapist and family have then helped me to look at what I have and find a way to be happy with what I have, even if it never gets better or even gets worse. Since I can't fix my disability, what can I change in my life to make me happy? Hobbies? Friends? <PERSON>? (I don't have that last one figured out yet, btw). Once I have my plan for happiness in place, I fight like hell to move forward and gain every step I can to get improvements. I don't have to expect them, but that doesn't mean I can't try for them anyway. I was one of the freaks that wasn't supposed to walk again but did. I am greatful for that every moment. And then the next moment I test to see if now I can run. Maybe weird, but it's gotten me this far.

In terms of work, I was completely unable to do the work I had done before. Apparently working with potentially dangerous viruses with hands that don't work is considered unsafe. Anyway, my boss encouraged me to train in a field that allowed me to stay in virology, only working at it from data science and computers. I work partly at home and partly at the office, and I initially got more than a few snide comments about my flexible scheduling. But I knew I wasn't abusing the system. My job got done, my boss was happy, and we've built the program forward. I don't know how far I will be able to take this, but I can only take one day at a time. If I ever have to stop and go on disability (primarily if any more arteries decide to break-- here's hoping they don't), it will be because I had to make that choice, not because of what others think. I keep two quotes in mind: 1) ‚ÄúWhat other people think of me is none of my business.‚Äù Dr. <PERSON>, and 2) ""If you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."" <PERSON>. 

Overall, take care of yourself. Take one day at a time-- one second at a time if that is what it takes. Don't waste your limited energy on guilt and self-doubt. We've all tried it. It didn't get us anywhere. Trust us. Also, your life will be focused on your illness and disability for awhile until you get things sorted out. But that changes. If you start focusing on things that make you feel happy or valuable or strong, you start finding new activities to fill your time and give you much more interesting topics for discussion. 

Also, you mentioned skiing-- many areas have adaptive sports of all kinds. I have participated in several. Often they are a chance to hang out with other people who if nothing else understand, so you can just hang out without being ""that handicapped girl"" for the day.

Sorry for rambling on. I wish you all the best, and let me know if there is anything I can do to help you along, even if it's just moral support!","[{'start': 3357, 'end': 3365, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3251, 'end': 3259, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1840, 'end': 1848, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 3, 'end': 9, 'entity_type': 'USER', 'text': '<USER>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

130,"I'm in a similar place. I know how it feels to have your life and your goals aligned how you think they should be, to work hard at achieving those goals and suddenly for everything you worked at to be crumbled to pieces. It is devastating especially for someone so young. I became disabled at a very young age too and hadn't yet gotten my professional life fully off the ground. I mourn the loss of that dream, to be the high powered, creative individual going to my dream job and working long days consistently, and being a reliable member of a group that solves problems. I wanted that badly, it's what I always saw for myself. But I've learned a lot from finding my limitations. My dad passed away young due to cancer and he was very bitter due to not reaching what he perceived as success. He had certain goals he wanted to reach at a certain age and when it didn't happen he turned to anger and self loathing which eventually killed him (he self medicated with alcohol and tobacco.) And I learned from his journey that sometimes we need to be objective about our own lives enough that our goals can adapt to who we are as people. For instance, maybe you wanted to be an astronaut as a child and that didn't happen. While it's true that the dream you had didn't come true, it doesn't mean all is lost or that the endeavor was a failure. It means the goals need to shift so that they make sense for the person you are now. So while your career may not be what you wanted it to be, you by no means need to stop reaching for the next level! Working part time isn't the same as full time, yes, but you can still find passion there. You are going to need to get creative yes, but that's part of the challenge being presented.

Another important employment support provided by the Ticket to Work Act is the Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach Program (BPAO). SSA awarded and maintains 114 cooperative agreements with community-based organizations in all states to provide all SSA disability beneficiaries (including transition-to-work aged youth) access to benefits planning and other assistance services. The goal of the BPAO program is to help SSA's disabled beneficiaries make better, informed choices about work and its potential effect on benefits. The projects provide each client with an individual analysis of the impact work and increased earnings might have not just on SSA benefits, but on other important benefits as well, such as Food Stamps, Medicaid and supported housing. This information is intended to allay fears about returning to work. In addition to benefits planning, the benefits specialists conduct outreach to beneficiaries and their families who potentially are eligible to participate in the many Federal and state work incentives programs. They also work with those Federal, state and private agencies and nonprofit organizations that serve beneficiaries with disabilities.

Effective September 30, 2006, the name of the BPAO program will change to the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) Program, reflecting an emphasis on work incentives. Benefits Specialists under the WIPA Program will be referred to as Community Work Incentives Coordinators (CWICs).

163,"Hi,

I am now in the accessibility market for almost 4 years and believe me when I tell you that this is the most corrupted and disgusting market you will ever see. People that are already in a tough spot are used for manipulation, false marketing and fund raising. 

So called ""advocates"" or ""consultants"" are most of the time nothing else than sales people. There are tons of organisations that present themselfes as non-profits. You will soon find out that there is always some connection to companies in the background making profit from sales. These accessibiltiy advocates have big interest to recommend only products where their share is biggest.

This situation has a serious effect on the whole market. Suddenly the most expensive products get most attractive for sales. Manufacturers are somehow forced to charge high prices so that the share for retail is big enough. No matter if the solution is good or bad for the customer, the only thing that counts is a big ass share for the retailers. 

Well but one would think customers demand affordable products? This is where stuff gets really ugly. These organisations then do fundraising, charity, hassle with ensurances and even make goverments pay for these way overpriced special equipment. If one is not that lucky to have someone pay for their equipment they are just left behind.

What could actually break this structure? I think the first thing that would need to change are funding scemes. People with disabilities should get their funding as a sort of fixed wage. They should be able to decide and choose the stuff they need. They will make more economic choices as they can keep the money thats left. They can used these funds to buy further equipment or just save it for other investments. This would immediatly put pressure on retail and manufacturers. Customers would immediatly care about the price as it is not just something that gets paid from a 3rd party.

In summer 2014, Ryan came to Open Style Lab with a challenge: As a wheelchair user, he couldn‚Äôt find a rain jacket that would protect his lap in the rain. Our designers, along with occupational therapists and engineers, worked with Ryan to come up with a somewhat eponymous solution: the Rayn Jacket.

A competitive biker before his injury, Ryan described himself as a ‚Äúhoodie‚Äù type of guy. So we made a jacket that looks like a hoodie, with one difference:¬≠ It features a pouch that doubles as a lap cover, which easily deploys in the rain through a simple, two-step folding mechanism.

Breathable fabric and a back vent allow for better temperature regulation. Raglan sleeves and stretch fabric mean freedom of movement. Zipper pulls and Velcro provide easy manipulation. Linings and elastic cuffs are eliminated to decrease hassle during dressing.

Best part? It‚Äôs for everyone: sports spectators, bikers, campers, or just someone waiting outside for a bus. The Rayn Jacket is designed to keep you dry and comfortable, regardless of ability.

I've had this battle too. The thing is with a supportive voluntary job you can be in a low-stress environment, call off sick if you need to, change hours easily and pick something 100% suited to your needs. If I had a bad day when I was doing voluntary, I could call up and go 'guys I didn't sleep last night and now I'm passing out every ten minutes, not up for it today' and they were cool.

300,"Benefit Advisor here. It depends on which SS benefit you are receiving. If you get SSI, when you start working, SSI does not count the first $85.00 dollars you earn, you put it in your pocket and SSI will not count it as income. But, if you earn more than $85.00 dollars in a month, SSI will reduce your current months check, by one dollar for every two you earn. This is a major pain in the ass! It works like this, you receive your benefit check in the beginning of the month, but you don't know how much you'll earn until the end of the month. You then need to call SSA and report your gross earnings for the month. It then takes SSA approximately three months to deduct the ""countable earned income"" from your benefit check for the month you earned it. SSA calls this an ""overpayment"". They then send you a letter telling you they will reduce your next benefit check by half of the amount of money you earned over the first $85.00 dollars. As you can imagine it causes most folks, much stress and confusion. Also to make thing worse, extra income can affect food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing allotment. Now, there are some exceptions, but it would take me the rest of the night to explain them. But, if you are collecting SSDI benefits the rules are completely different!  The short answer is SSDI is a all or nothing benefit. You can earn up to $1090.00 per month and you won't lose your check. But, if you earn one dollar more than $1090.00 per month, you lose your whole benefit for the month.

301,"I hear you bro. Years ago, I was driving cab and got a late night call for a pick up at the local airport. The fare was a regular and a generous tipper so I didn't mind. As I drive up, I see the place is a ghost town, just a couple of baggage handlers and a security guard reading the paper. I park at the hack stand and go in the terminal to look for my fare. The planes delayed and I have to wait, so I grab a coffee and a seat. As I sit there, I spot a glorious woman walking my way, she's in her early twenty's, strawberry blond hair, short sundress with a killer body and long beautiful legs reaching from the floor up to heaven. My first instinct was pure male, lust, desire and envy rushed thru my brain like a freight train. I instantly wanted her! But this foolish desire was quickly replaced buy the realistic part of my brain. There was no way on this green earth that someone so perfect would be attracted to me. That's because same as you, my disability effected me in ways that I believed made me ugly. I was ashamed of my appearance and knew that she would never even be my friend, let alone love me for who I am. I suddenly wanted to cry.  Disgusted by self loathing and wanting to escape before she looked my way, I stood up and headed to the door. Just as I was about to exit, I heard her call out, a mans name, in a voice that was a mixture excitement and passion, the kind of voice woman reserve for long absent lovers and significant others. I turned to see who this perfect woman could be calling after. Because, I knew it wasn't me. I turned as she broke into a run, raising her arms above her head an squealing in delight. She took maybe ten steps and collided full force into the embrace of her man. A full 30 seconds crawled by as she held on to this man with all her might. She held him as if she was afraid he would disappear. Just as I decided I'd seen enough, she takes a step back holding him at arms length, and I saw it. The man she was holding, the love of her life, was a monster. His face, his head was devoid of typical facial land marks. He was burnt beyond being recognizable, his lips, his nose, his ears and hair were gone. Left behind was a skull rapped in mottled pink flesh. The flesh was drawn tightly around the openings that serve as portals for his senses. I was horrified. As I stood half way out the door and half way in, I was struck by a bolt of compassion and understanding that changed my life. Never before in my life had I ever understood the depth of the human hart. All judgment, all prejudice, all self pity are self inflicted torcher.

302,"The benefit Advisor here. No you wont be kicked off for trying to work. SSA has a whole set of rules called ""the work incentive rules"". They know that most people who become disabled never try to return to work because they fear loosing that monthly check. So to encourage folks to try, they have set-up rules that protect you from failing to become self supporting again. So the short answer is, .... you can start working and earning any amount of money for 9 months in a future 5 year window and not loose your benefit. You could earn a million bucks a month and SSA will still send you your check. At the end of your 9 month ""trial work period"" SSA looks back on your earnings. If you earned more than $1090.00 dollars per month called ""substantial gainful employment"" or SGA in each of the 9 months, they say CONGRATULATIONS! you have overcome your disability and you can now support yourself, and they then stop sending you checks. BUT, if you did not earn more than $1090.00 dollars in each of the 9 months , they say ""good try"" we will keep sending you your full disability check each month, as long as you don't earn more than $1090.00 dollars in a single month. PLEASE understand this explanation is only one part of very un logical set of rules. If you think your ready to work, seek out your local CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. These not for profit groups have benefit advisors( like myself ) who will help you understand all aspects of the work incentive rules. Think of it this way, its like playing a game without knowing all the rules. If you don't know the rules how will you know if your being cheated.

414,"A little background: I was abused as a child, by 2 different men, so I was really messed up for a long time. Very depressed, anxious, a cutter who thought about suicide a lot. Bad times. I was around 20 when my sister had her first child and I realized if I was ever going to kill myself I had to do it before my niece was old enough to know me and be hurt by it. So it was either do it, or get help. I chose the latter. Medication, although useful, isn't a magical cure-all. I recognized that I had to change the way I thought about things. I started keeping a notebook with me and every time I had a negative thought I wrote it down and at the end of the day I would look over it, and figure out if any had merit. 9 times out of 10, they wouldn't. After a while the list grew shorter, because by being cognizant of those types of thoughts, the less I had them. I started drawing, painting and writing in place of cutting, and have not cut myself for 10 years. In social situations I remind myself that other people are usually too busy worrying about what other people think of them to spend time thinking critically of me. That's been a big help :)  It really boils down to training yourself to think differently, and in time your emotions sort of fall in line. A friend of mine uses an interesting trick: when she has a negative thought about herself she writes it on her body with marker and then when she takes a shower she focuses on washing those thoughts away. I've heard of people writing them on paper and then burning them. All these methods just train yourself to recognize and correct the negativity that's at the core of emotional dysfunction. So, to summarize; medication, retraining my thought patterns, and redirecting my anxiety into artistic expression. It kept me functioning quite well for the last ten years, and is helping me now as I'm coping with becoming physically disabled. I've also decided to believe there is a reason for this. Maybe the Universe is testing me, or toughening me up for whatever comes next after this mortal life. Or maybe I'll meet my soul mate while waiting at the doctor's office, or maybe I'm just meant to help other people by sharing my story. Who knows? Happiness is attainable for everyone.

425,"I used to work with special needs kids prior to becoming disabled myself, so I can give you some tips from both sides of the fence. First off, if you aren't comfortable with kids, you're going to run into some issues. I don't say that to scare you off, just giving a fair warning. Part of the reason is if you don't know a whole lot about the behavior patterns of average kids it's more difficult to gauge behavior patterns for kids with various issues. For example, consider Timmy. Timmy is 6 years old, but is delayed developmentally and functions at a 3 year old cognitive capacity. So if another kid takes a toy away from Timmy, he's not going to respond to it the way an average 6 year old would. Timmy is likely to respond with tantrum behavior because developmentally he's around toddler age. But because he's physically 6, he's much larger than a toddler, and could very easily injure someone. So it's the caretaker's responsibility to see the situation and be proactive, and intervene before Timmy gets into full meltdown tantrum mode. Another thing about children, both average and delayed, are actually very discerning when it comes to vocal tone. They can tell when they're being talked down to, and they don't like it. So approaching them with a falsely cheerful tone is likely to be met with resistance. Talk to them like you would an adult, as long as you use language they understand. Be gentle but firm with rules. Consistent rules are important, otherwise they'll figure out how to manipulate you. Kids are surprisingly good at that. And the one rule that has to be followed through with is hitting.

426,"Thanks for responding. My original diagnoses I had for my initial disability application were fibromyalgia, vertigo disorder, hand contracture, back injuries, anxiety and depression. The diagnoses are in the process of changing. My doctor is practicing as my GP but is actually a nephrologist. He's certain I have connective tissue disease and vasculitis, but we're waiting on a biopsy. I'm waiting on the results of an EEG to fully rule out a seizure disorder, and then my neurologist will make my dystonia diagnosis official. It's just kind of frustrating that I'm going to get these test results and finalized diagnoses right after my appeal deadline! 


I'm 30/f, and my symptoms: main one is pain. I have a lot of joint and nerve pain, being treated with pain medication and muscle relaxers. I have mobility issues and require a cane. So I can't do much of any crouching, bending, or carrying. I use a shower chair because if I lean my head back (to wash my hair) it triggers my vertigo. Flashing lights, too much movement on a tv screen, turning my head too fast, all of these trigger my vertigo, which makes me dizzy, disoriented and nauseated. I have medication for the nausea. My left hand is in a permanent state of contracture, with my left ring finger stuck laying against my palm. My neuro believes this is actually focal dystonia. I have seizure-like episodes where I have convulsions, and I have these usually at least once a week. I remain conscious during the episodes, and coupled with my joint problems, they are extremely painful. Because of them I am unable to drive. My neuro believes these are episodes of acute dystonia rather than seizures (just waiting on those EEG results!). I have photophobia, and can't be in direct sunlight for more than a few minutes because I develop sun poisoning rashes very quickly. I have prior back injuries due to a car accident and my hip was dislocated in a workcomp situation, so both are documented. I've had a diagnosis of anxiety and depression for 15 years, since I was 15 in fact. I am currently on medication for that as well.


I hope that's sufficient info. Thanks for taking the time to read it. Cheers!

I could see where it would be inviting to have an explanation that doesn't involve having a psychological or mental problem. I can also see that being dangerous in that if a person feels validated in having these types of feelings they would be more likely to act on them. I just envision someone finally acting on a lifelong impulse to hack off a limb, only to start experiencing phantom limb, and ending up disabled but still tormented by the same feeling of *wrongness*. Maybe they would amputate another limb, searching for relief that never comes. And man that's a depressing thought. I'm a writer, and actually have a character who went through this. My explanation was he was an amputee in a previous life, and that's the origin of those feelings. I'm not saying I genuinely believe that or anything.

That's a huge factor in getting your application approved for disability, that you are complying with treatment by a specialist who can confirm the severity of your issues. Another huge factor is age. I applied last year in June, and was just denied last month soon after turning 30. Most of the disability advocate programs I contacted wouldn't even talk to me until I turned 30. I know that's discouraging to hear. It was hard for me too. Keep in mind something like 80 to 90% of applicants are denied the first time, and the decision can take 6 months to a year. Then you have 60 days to appeal the decision, and it's a good idea to get a lawyer on board. Most take you on at no charge, and then just collect a percentage of your settlement.

438,"Hello, new kindred spirit! I'm 30/f and have been unable to work for one year now. I can relate with a lot of what you've described, feeling lucky in terms of family support yet struggling to accept the day to day reality of your new limitations, and feeling unproductive. That last one kind of took me by surprise, personally, because I never would have guessed I would have such a strong emotional reaction to not being a contributing member of society. The way I deal with a lot of those emotions is by maintaining a video blog and website chronicling my journey through diagnosis and attempting to get disability benefits (still not there yet). I also write, paint, and draw. Creative outlets have been a sanity saver for me. I also have a long term goal for when my disability is approved and I get back on financially even ground, and that's fostering abandoned kittens too young to be adopted out. I will contribute in that way. I've also toyed with the idea of taking in rescue dogs and training them to be service animals, as I have already had success in training my dog to help me. That will depend on how my illness progresses though, but I know I can handle bottle-feeding kittens. 


There is a definite fine line between accepting your limitations and giving up. The way I deal with it is by saying ""okay, I can't do that today"" rather than ""I can't do that."" It takes some time to learn what your body can and can't handle, and how to moderate that. For example I almost never use the electric buggies at the grocery store. However, if I'm already having a rough day and have some project I still need to do later (usually housework related) then I will allow myself to use the electric buggy. I set a goal every day, be it vacuumming, laundry, or getting to the bank. I almost always accomplish it, and anything else is extra credit. 


So, to sum up my advice: Set goals, but don't beat yourself up over them. Accept your limitations but be willing to go further on your good days. Find a creative outlet of some kind. Get your feelings out, journals and blogs are great for this. Find a new way to contribute to society in general. Also remember that it is normal to grieve the loss of your old lifestyle and abilities the same you would the loss of a loved one. You will most likely cycle through anger, depression, guilt, all of those emotions associated with grief. It's perfectly understandable. Keep looking for a therapist because it's a great idea. If you reach the point you need antidepressants, don't let *anyone* get on you for it, not even yourself. Depression can be just as debilitating as the original illness. You may benefit from trying support groups. Above all, I suggest maintaining a sense of humor. Finding humor in any situation is both a talent and a skill, and it can save your ass when nothing else will.

In traditional scopes, the eyepiece does a crazy dance all over the place. Even people without wheelchairs have to bend and contort to use them.

In traditional wheelchair-accesible scopes - of which there are roughly a hundred on Earth - the eyepiece stays at a *fixed* height, one that is presumably an average. These are large scopes at fixed installations, for the most part.

No amateur, beginner- to intermediate- level design exists because of those facts.

My design accounts for this by having an *adjustable* fixed height eyepiece. The telescope is set for an eyepiece height - say, 1.15 meters - and then adjusts accordingly. It can then look at any object in the sky, keeping the eyepiece at a convenient position for anyone, no matter personal ability.

My goal is to open the night sky to those who have been restricted from it at a cost that anyone can afford.

Now, that doesn't mean OP will be denied, since a person can get approved simply based on the severity of their symptoms, but a diagnosis can be very important for proving that a new symptom associated with a condition is expected to last in excess of one year.

Op should try to get a solid diagnosis (since getting approved so young for fibro and psych conditions is extremely difficult), but if he can't do that he should ensure that his symptoms, including their frequency and severity, are well documented for the DDS reviewers or ALJ (It's not clear to me whether this is a reconsideration or a hearing, which depends on whether OP is in a prototype state).",False,False,t1_cs312xa,DrMuffinPHD,SSA ODAR Attorney Advisor,0,1434032222,t5_2qhe8,t3_39e3dq,t1_cs2z02n,2,1436908172,0,0,cs312xa,disability,2,,,,

549,"Hi there.

I'm actually a bit confused by your story, and I'm not actually quite sure what you mean by your representative suggesting you take some sort of one-time payout.  That's not how disability benefits work (unless you are awarded disability for a closed period, which sounds unlikely in this case).

However, I can possibly clear up what your advocate meant regarding the recommendation that you amend your alleged onset date of disability and your age factoring in.  

It seems likely the ALJ recommended to your attorney that you amend your onset date.  When that happens, it's not a guarantee that you'll get a favorable decision, but it's a good sign.  However, it also means the ALJ has decided that (either for procedural or medical reasons) you have no chance of getting a favorable ruling prior to the date they suggest you amend to.  Even if you didn't amend, you'd still be denied for that period, and it's extra time and work for SSA attorney's.  Amending is usually the easiest and best option.

For my second point, [age matters in making disability determinations.](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-1563.htm)  This is especially true if the ALJ is making a fully favorable ruling based on the [medical vocational guidelines](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/02/SSR83-10-di-02.html).  If the ALJ decided you grid out (i.e., are disabled under the guidelines), then they'll find you disabled on a date close to when you change age categories.  Was the date your rep asked you to amend to near your 50th birthday?  If so, then this was the reason.

Hopefully this information helped.  I'm still a bit confused by some factors in your story; but I'm not convinced your rep was necessarily incompetent or did not do their job properly.  A lot of reps are incompetent, but almost never in the way that you're alleging in your comment.  They're bad because they have a poor understanding of what information we consider important, or because they annoy the ALJ with irrelevant questions and variations on hypothetical.  It's not unusual for the advocate to not say much during a hearing -honestly their main role is to make sure all the relevant information is in order for the hearing and help you navigate the process.  A hearing is not adversarial, so a rep is not expected to argue your case (and it would probably piss off the ALJ if they did).  Some ALJ's prefer to question reps instead of claimants, but many prefer to question the claimants directly.  However, it's 100% against a rep's interest to recommend an amended onset date closer to the hearing date (they get paid less when this happens if the decision is favorable), and they would only ever do that if the ALJ told them to amend it.",False,False,t1_csa7785,DrMuffinPHD,SSA ODAR Attorney Advisor,0,1434588664,t5_2qhe8,t3_3a7n8y,t3_3a7n8y,4,1437154734,0,0,csa7785,disability,4,,,"Hi there.

580,"So I'm a little late to this thread, but here is my two cents as someone who has read thousands upon thousands of those forms over the years. 

There really is no ""right"" way to fill out those forms. You just need to be truthful; don't exaggerate/lie but also be perfectly honest. In your situation saying exactly what you said is fine because it speaks to your depression. Trust me I've read just about everything over the years and I don't bat an eye to someone going into a page-long diatribe about not being able to wipe themselves or have sex. 

 The things that we look for with these forms are how these conditions affect your daily activities. The other thing we just these forms for is to give you a ""credibility assessment."" In other words, is your information consistent and does it match up with the medical records.   We can tell pretty quickly when someone is exaggerating (or just straight up telling lies) in those forms. The more credible we find your information to be to more weight we will give to your complaints. 

If you don't understand a question just call the examiner (you should have their phone number somewhere in the form on a cover letter) and ask. I would much rather someone call me to ask a question than fill the form out wrong. If you need extra space you can add some supplimental pages (singled sided typed, try not to make it more than 1 page) if you want to.

If they said that they sent you letters (and you didn't receive them) then you can go to the office and request additional copies; we have a system that keeps copies of all the letters that are sent.

583,"Have you gotten your actual decision letter yet? Once you do contact SSA and they can explain things better to you. Really there are no ""options"" for you. The judges decision will be what it will be. I do have a few thoughts. 

By ""one time payment"" they could be referencing a ""closed period"" of disability decision which means that the ALJ finds you disabled for a past period of time but not currently. That is most often seen in cancer cases (ie had cancer but went into remission and is no longer disabling). In situations like that a person just gets a lump sum payment but no ongoing payments. But, based on your post that doesn't seem like the case (plus closed periods are pretty rare)

As to the comments about you being 50. What that is referencing is the ""med/voc"" rules that we use to establish whether someone can adjust to other work based on their age, education,  and work experience. After aged 50 the rules change for every 5 years. So if the ALJ assigns you a sedentary RFC assessment (with no history of sedentary work) the chart dictates the decision. At 49 you would be denied but at50 you would be granted benefits. I think this is the more likely scenario. It is very common for someone to get an ""adverse onset"" decision due to a change in med/voc age categories. 

I hope that gives you at least a little more insight. I think that you should wait until you hear from SSA before overly concerning yourself with what your attorney has said and what transpired.

I *believe* then that the longer they stay working during that 40 quarters the longer that insurance becomes. There is no ""permanent"" insured status. If you work the full 40 quarters you would get the maximum DLI which would be several years (I think its 5) after the the person stops working.

586,"I've never heard that under the age of 31 the quarter coverages are different; so that is why my answer may seem off to you. Normally with DIB claims with someone that young they are CDB claims so I guess I never really thought too much about it.  A person's AOD can be whatever they want; what matters is the presumptive onset date (POD). So if someone applies at 32, alleges they were disabled at 21, but they weren't insured until 31 then the DFI supercedes what the claimant alleges and the onset is set administratively. 

Regarding your link about being permanently insured, I think that chart is for when someone is granted disability benefits.

Yeah, I think we pretty much agree here. I just tend to be more skeptical whenever I hear these kinds of claims because of the potential for abuse and the fact that institutionalization and the treatment of self-harm is considered solely a medical problem, rather than examining the hows and whys. For instance, maybe a person desiring to commit suicide has undergone a lot of harsh bullying. Maybe they're in such severe poverty that they feel hopeless.

&gt; Ok, here's the tl;dr/ELI5 version of the [Hypatia article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12113/full).

&gt; The author, Alexandre Baril, is a transexual man who sympathizes with transabled individuals because of their similar struggles. Transableism in his analysis includes only those who wish to physically modify their bodies.

&gt; According to Baril, disability studies and trans studies are both flawed because one focuses on an able-bodied trans identity and a cis-gender disability identity. These phenomena are not mutually exclusive, though, and a more accurate and nuanced version of each requires identification and analysis of both.

&gt; While we tend to make a distinction between changes in sex and changes in ability, though, Baril argues that these distinctions are founded on socially constructed norms of how the body should be. After undergoing sex reassignment surgery, many experience loss of fertility, sensation in errogenous zones, incontinence, etc., which could be interpreted as disability. But we tend to label it as change of sex because our perceptions of disabled people are genderless, sexless individuals - the implication being that a ""real"" man or woman must be able-bodied.

&gt; Further, all areas of the body can and are often gendered, so the difference lies largely in self-identification. The absence of a hand or leg qualifies someone as disabled. The absence of a penis or breasts qualifies them as transsexual. This shows a lack of continuity in our definitions, and reflects the reliance on historically normative conceptions of the body.

&gt; After reading the article, I fall a bit more on the pro-transability side of the issue. But I should probably point out that this relies on a philosophical acceptance of the identity, rather than a practical one. I'm not sure what effects transability might have on the disability community or transsexual community, and I'm not sure how I feel about the actual practice of physically disabling oneself. I think more research needs to be done and more narratives need to be examined before I make up my mind on the issue.

Relatable. I'm mentally disabled and I don't do well with the whole ""change your mindset"" and positivity kind of thing either.

Again, body mod is not a necessary part of identifying as transabled. And why is it necessary for it to be ""a deeply rooted need"" and who judges that? Why can't it be a deeply rooted need for transabled individuals to modify their bodies?

&gt; The danger here with all of this aggressive ""acceptance"" is when you have people with a temporary mental disorder (do I really need to make a list?) and are compelled to ""modify"" their body in a way that they or others will later regret.

It's not necessarily a mental disorder. It's not necessarily temporary. It's not necessarily something they will regret.

&gt; We institutionalize such people if we can get to them before they maim themselves.

But disabled individuals continually prove that these values are misplaces and ill-defined by living full lives and having successful careers.

625,"&gt; Cutting and suicidal tendencies are mental disorders (or symptoms of), yes. If somebody is a threat to themselves or others then assistance should be forced on them.

Not necessarily. The potential for systematic abuse there is very high. That's not to say that help shouldn't be available, but instituationalization is often not help in any meaningful sense.

&gt; Now onto transable people, it's a disorder, they even say it's a brain mapping issue which would classify under a mental disorder. I'm just not convinced at allthat enabling their disorder through surgery is going to help them. And how many of them are going to regret their decision.

You're jumping the gun. Besides the fact that brain mapping issue != mental disorder (If anything, they're talking about a neurological disorder), the fact of brain states itself doesn't make a disorder. If you go with a philosophically materialist perspective, everything you experience is a brain state.

Also, not everyone identifying as transabled is seeking surgery. And you can't conjecture on how many of those that do will regret it.

&gt; Also, people around here seem to think this may make things better for disabled people. It won't, it'll give people who already give us shit more ammunition.

I'm not going to quibble about percentages, mostly because I think they're kind of meaningless in this context. Do you mean how often people can be cured? Or how ""close"" to a cure they can get? Because both of those depend upon an objective definition of what a cure is. People with physical disabilities can sometimes get physical therapy which can help them experience less pain and greater mobility, but does that mean they are ""partially cured?""

Speaking from what knowledge I have on mental disability, things like depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar, etc. are pretty much considered incurable. Individuals can get therapy if they'd like (and sometimes when they don't, but I won't go there right now), but they never really get ""cured.""

Relatable. I'm mentally disabled and I don't do well with the whole ""change your mindset"" and positivity kind of thing either. I think one of the best things for me was to find communities of others like me - especially those with knowledge of neurodiversity, disability studies, etc. because they get nuance a whole lot better if they're educated and passionate about the stuff.

I definitely understand the whole counselor thing too - most of my experiences with them have not been great, but I did find one I really liked. It took a couple sessions and I told her the very first time I met her that I don't think my disability is a tragedy and I don't like the whole idea of just becoming more positive about all the shitty things that happen in life because that ignores that they do, in fact, happen. It took a few sessions, but she's the only one I ever really liked and I'm reluctant to go out and find another.

What might help if he's really intellectual is for him to start reading some disability studies material. Maybe start with the medical model vs social model stuff.

636,"Ok, here's the tl;dr/ELI5 version of the [Hypatia article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12113/full).

The author, Alexandre Baril, is a transexual man who sympathizes with transabled individuals because of their similar struggles. Transableism in his analysis includes only those who wish to physically modify their bodies.

According to Baril, disability studies and trans studies are both flawed because one focuses on an able-bodied trans identity and a cis-gender disability identity. These phenomena are not mutually exclusive, though, and a more accurate and nuanced version of each requires identification and analysis of both.

While we tend to make a distinction between changes in sex and changes in ability, though, Baril argues that these distinctions are founded on socially constructed norms of how the body should be. After undergoing sex reassignment surgery, many experience loss of fertility, sensation in errogenous zones, incontinence, etc., which could be interpreted as disability. But we tend to label it as change of sex because our perceptions of disabled people are genderless, sexless individuals - the implication being that a ""real"" man or woman must be able-bodied.

Further, all areas of the body can and are often gendered, so the difference lies largely in self-identification. The absence of a hand or leg qualifies someone as disabled. The absence of a penis or breasts qualifies them as transsexual. This shows a lack of continuity in our definitions, and reflects the reliance on historically normative conceptions of the body.

After reading the article, I fall a bit more on the pro-transability side of the issue. But I should probably point out that this relies on a philosophical acceptance of the identity, rather than a practical one. I'm not sure what effects transability might have on the disability community or transsexual community, and I'm not sure how I feel about the actual practice of physically disabling oneself.

Since they are abled, they wouldn't really know the true barriers that disabled people face because if they ever need to get up stairs or out of a situation where they'll be judged harshly and unfairly (like at a job interview), they can just get out of their chair or remove their braces.

Their course is more expensive, but it's worth it, in my opinion, because the better you're trained, the quicker you'll get up to speed, which means making more money.

It is possible to find full-time work as an MT. Some places even have health plans, retirement benefits, and paid vacations, which means you'll be an employee.

701,"I am a support worker and I remember a couple of years ago those people coming to assess one of the clients I supported.

They gave this gentleman with profound and complex disabiities (autism, learning disability, communication difficulties, challenging behaviours, sensory impairment, physical fragility) the third degree and we had to fight tooth and nail to convince them that he wasn't fit for work. Why? Because we had managed to find him a placement doing voluntary work and their reasoning was that if he could do voluntary work, why not paid employment?

He was already seriously underfunded and we had to battle with the Local Authority about that too, but thats another story.

The amount of 'evidence' that has to be produced through record keeping constantly, and then stored, and then analysed and reviewed and argued about regularly is immense; the work-load of this can sometimes be such that it will either a.) get in the way of providing the actual support or b.) mean that near-minimum-wage workers have to stay on for long periods of time UNPAID.

That they then hire in companies to come and contest this is another additional expense. I think that if we were to add up the cost of people 'fiddling the system' compared to the cost of assessing everyone within the system constantly we would find that just having a bit of faith in people COSTS LESS.

Why shouldn't it be possible for a doctor to be able to write a simple note saying 'If this person does not get 24/7 supervision they MAY DIE'; why is it mandatory to write down everything we do to support someone as 'evidence' that it is money well-spent (even when they abhor the idea of their day-by-day being recorded)?

The system is rife with pseudo-professional posturing and far too little rational examination. People who behave genuinely professional by operating within the agreed ways of working and in accordance with policy and procedure BUT dare to question the correctness of that practice are actively militated against and have their professionalism called into question.

And pity the person who tries to blow the whistle. The system is proliferating all manner of institutional abuses that can have dire consequences and there is little by way of accountability.

Some years ago corporate liability was brought in to hold to account boards of directors who acted negligently in their policy-making; such that if someone dies and their policy is proven inadequate they can be tried for corporate manslaughter.

It is about time this principle extended to the politicians, commissioners, regulators and other bodies who play a hand in creating the horror-show that exists within the support industry of 'Modern Britain'.",False,False,t1_cs9d1mg,IncredibleMulch,,0,1434529123,t5_2qhe8,t3_3a4t1u,t3_3a4t1u,5,1437132745,0,0,cs9d1mg,disability,5,,,,
702,"I worked to support a lady with MS. They took her power chair away from her because it was 'damaging the furnishings and fittings'. She was given a manual that she could not operate without assistance. She got roughly two hours of support per day and spent most of the rest of her time parked in front of the television.

718,"&gt; I had never heard the term ""transabled"" before this particular article, though I have seen the woman (who wears the braces/uses the chair but doesn't ""need"" them) in other articles.

Sadly, the reason for the new label is an attempt to mainstream this and paint it as just one of the many lifestyle choices out there. It is a tactical thing.  

&gt; It's a touchy subject, but many of these people aren't ""pretending"" to mock anyone with a disability, they genuinely feel like there's a body part that shouldn't be there, or whatever the case may be.  

I'd agree with that; but adding a label like ""transabled"" is part of a movement that will eventually allow people to do this for reasons that no one now would agree to.  

&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if we were to find out that it may partially be mental illness and partially be some kind of neurological mix up that we aren't sophisticated enough to understand at this point in the progress of medicine.  

This is almost certainly the case.  

&gt; It would definitely be interesting to do more studies on these individuals to see what exactly is going on with them, whether it's more on a physiological level or more in terms of brain chemistry, or what.  

The problem with attempting research like this is politics and political correctness. If you don't allow enough rational judgement to allow you to weed out the people making a ""choice"" from the people who have an all-consuming *need* to lop off their body parts; then you can't have a clean sample and all you'll get is contradictory and confusing results.  

Political correctness is the direct enemy of science. And if you want to research into subjects that has political connotations; you simply will never receive funding unless they know that the result is predetermined to their favor.  

Also, lifestyle choices require no research. How can you justify spending money researching something that simply is not a problem?  

That is an example of how people continue to suffer from obvious afflictions for no reason other than research into the condition is politically suppressed.  

And no, I'll not mention any of them so I don't get Pao-ed.

&gt; A different life-choice? Body modification?  

Accurate. But calling napalm *dry skin remover* is also accurate.  

&gt; Speaking from what knowledge I have on mental disability, things like depression, anxiety, OCD, bipolar, etc. are pretty much considered incurable.  

I had both OCD and severe depression. Both are 100% cured. My cure may not be the cure for others, but don't go thinking people don't get better. They're all around you - but they don't go around broadcasting it.  

Someone seeking sexual reassignment surgery has to go through a series of mental health professionals to make sure that they really have a deeply rooted need.  

The danger here with all of this aggressive ""acceptance"" is when you have people with a *temporary* mental disorder (do I really need to make a list?) and are compelled to ""modify"" their body in a way that they or others will later regret.  

We institutionalize such people if we can get to them before they maim themselves. Giving it a name and calling it a lifestyle choice changes not one part of the facts of the matter.

Can you make a new post for your AMA? It may not get the attention it deserves buried in this thread.  

Here are some questions to get you started:  

* What does it ""feel"" like to you? Revulsion? ""Wrongness""? Discomfort?  

* Do you still have the offending limb?  

* If so, what is your plan over the next few years? If no movement for a treatment or cure happens, are you going to seek amputation?  

* Has anyone thought to try temporarily numbing your leg via injection to see if there was any change in your feelings? This could help differentiate whether the source of the desire is rooted in the brain or in some anomaly in the leg itself.  

* I have a theory: I believe the mammals have a built in instinct to discard a limb to save its life. Example: A small animal chewing off its own leg to escape a trap. I'd say that something has neurologically turned that switch on for your offending limb. This does not help much with localizing the issue. It still could be a brain problem, or the limb could still be sending the ""I'm so damaged that I have to go"" signal.

Bingo; this is exactly how I wish I had worded it. I think most all who have this probably have some sort of mental / neurological issue; but others have mental issues that cause them to seek attention in increasingly radical ways.  

&gt; I also wonder if we could see two different groups of people emerge, those who are more of the ""pretenders"" and just like to ""dress up"" like a person with a disability (for lack of a better term) versus those who really want to be surgically altered to make the disability of their ""Desires"" permanent.

746,"I actually tried to do one a AMA a while back and the thread was closed because due to lack of verification. LOL, I cant actually provide proof of thoughts other than saying that I have them. 

What does it ""feel"" like to you? Revulsion? ""Wrongness""? Discomfort?
Do you still have the offending limb?

It can be discomforting at times, like when I'm laying down and my legs are touching each other. Or when my wife and I are intimate and she touches that leg. As far wrongness, yeah it does feel ""wrong"". 

If so, what is your plan over the next few years? If no movement for a treatment or cure happens, are you going to seek amputation?

There was doctor a couple of years ago that was doing these surgeries, that I was told could do amputate said limb. But from what I understand there was a little too much attention about the surgeries and he was feeling a little uncomfortable about doing them, so was asking for half of the money up front ($10,000). I backed out of the arrangement. As far as future plans, I'm not sure at the moment. 

Has anyone thought to try temporarily numbing your leg via injection to see if there was any change in your feelings? This could help differentiate whether the source of the desire is rooted in the brain or in some anomaly in the leg itself.

I had surgery on my ankle a while back to remove a cyst. My foot was pretty well numbed up then and that didn't make matters any better. 

I have read some studies that suggest that this could be an actual physical problem in the brain. There is a portion of your brain that basically has for a lack of better terminology, a map of your body. One of the theories is that portion of the brain is somehow damaged or otherwise defective, and that the limb is somehow missing from the map. So basically the opposite of phantom limbs, if that makes sense. It would kind of make sense because when I was a kid I had all kinds of coordination issues,  when I was the kid that would trip over his own feet. 

I'm sure there are those out there that desire to be special snow flakes, but that is not the case for me. Most of the time I will go out of my way to avoid attention and try to be the proverbial ""grey man"". If I ever had surgery I would probably opt to wear a prosthetic outside of the house to avoid attention, as much as I could.

749,"&gt; Do you remember a specific event that triggered these feelings or have you had them as long as you can remember?

I don't remember a specific event that caused this. I do remember having these feelings from as early as 6 or 7 though. I remember trying to pretend that I had one leg even then. 

Is this a feeling you have every day or just occasionally? 
It is not something that I experience everyday, but it is also alot more than occasionally. What is odd sometimes is that when it is not bugging me I start to wonder why ? It guess it is something that has always been there, so when it isn't it is very noticeable which causes me to think it about it. 

&gt;Do you feel like your quality of life has been significantly impaired by these thoughts?

 The biggest way it affects me is probably my self esteem and how I feel about myself. It's one huge irrational thought in an otherwise rational brain that I can't seem to rationalize away, if that makes sense. I totally get all the arguments everyone has against ""transabled"". If I'm not careful it will cause me to be very depressed, not because I'm not an amputee, but because I will start thinking that I must be some sort of monster to want this. 

Some days are worse than others, some days it is more of a nuisance.

There are times that it is uncomfortable when I want to touch a part of my body(stump) that isn't there. It sometimes actually feels like my leg should end just above my knee. But that is nothing compared to the feeling that I must be some sort of freak because of this.


&gt;What is it about amputation that makes it desirable? Do you feel like it would relieve you from psychological pain or something like that? 

It would mainly be to stop the psychological pain, yes.  I just want to stop feeling this way. I don't really care at this point how. If there were some sort of effective treatment I would go that route. But talking to a therapist only to get blank stares, doesn't really help, except drain me of cash. 

I have also talked to a few other people who have had amputations because of this. The only regrets that they have ever expressed to me is that they wish they had done this sooner. 

What really upsets me is the people who say that I or others with BIID should be locked up in a hospital. The main argument being that I'm a danger to myself. I'm 42 yo, and have been dealing with this since I was a kid. I would think that if I were a danger to myself that I would have harmed myself by now. Especially considering the fact that I spent 10 years in the Army, in the infantry and have played with plenty of explosives and such. 

I live a fairly normal life otherwise. I'm married, work, contribute to society, etc... What good would it do to for anyone to lock up people with BIID ? 

I guess I could be put on drugs to make me otherwise comatose, but how would that benefit anyone ?

&gt; Have you found doctors to be mostly supportive of you?

 As far as medical doctors I have not told any because honestly I fear that they will think that this is something to with self harm. I understand how it can seem that way, but it is not.

&gt; Have friends and family been supportive?

 I have only told a handful of people about this. My wife, and couple of other people. My wife is supportive of me, but not of me having an amputation. We have talked about it, and she has said that she wouldn't leave if I ever did have an amputation because of BIID, but she would be pretty pissed off at me.

&gt; What kind of treatments have you found helpful?

 I haven't really had any treatment other than anti-anxiety medication, which only calmed down the squirrel cage a bit. The anxiety mainly comes from the fact that I feel like I must be some sort of freak or monster to have these feelings/desires and that I shouldn't want this and then spirals from there.

&gt; Have you amputated your leg? 

No I have not. I almost had surgery a couple of years ago but I backed out of it. The thought of traveling to a foreign country to have this done under the table just doesn't sound like a very smart move. The smoke and mirrors of it just doesn't give me a very good feeling.

756,"&gt;What about your lifestyle would change if you amputated your leg?
I feel like most people who have issues with transability have cited worries about loss of functionality or productivity. 

Honestly, I think it would be better. I say this because when BIID is really bothering me I tend to withdrawal from people and it occupies a lot of my thoughts. When your so depressed that you don't want to talk to people or do anything is pretty limiting in and of it self. To be free from that would be really awesome. 

Yeah there would be things that I would have to do differently but I see those as practical problems that can be solved. Those sort of problems seem to be more tangible if that makes sense.

&gt;They worry that individuals who want to alter their body like that may no longer be able to work, and that they might actually be looking for that so they can draw disability checks, etc.

People have been scamming others since the dawn of time. So someone trying to figure out a way to draw a disability check wouldn't exactly be a new problem. If I was after a disability check, I could probably file a disability claim with the VA due to a back injury from when I was in the military. I would also think that there would be easier ways of getting a check without amputating a limb. Seems to be a whole lot of effort for not a whole lot of gain. 

I have talked to few people who are now amputees from BIID and only one of them does not have a good job, the only one that I do know that does not work is retired. 

Anyone that would do something like this to draw a disability check is probably not working and would probably have a hard time paying for any type of surgery to begin with.

I agree that there should be a vetting process. And I, too, would be interested in how many people with severe body modifications are happy 20 years later. Plenty of people with plastic surgery are happy even years later, but not all of them. I'm sure a similar thing would result from allowing amputations.

779,"Hey,

Your reaction is totally sane and there is a real problem regarding sensitivity training or inclusion of PWDs in programmes like these. I relate a lot to this because even though I didn't go through med school, my training was first in molecular biology and then in public health and epidemiology alongside doctors. In the latter two fields, people talk extensively about race, SES, sexual orientation and gender as being key inequality issues and therefore related to poor health or poor access to healthcare. However, I have never had a single lecture that has included disability in that list even though it is well established that disability is frequently correlated with poor access to healthcare and poor health outside of the disability that is directly linked to poverty. It infuriates me so I understand your frustration on an academic level very well and the problem certainly does exist. 

On a personal level - as a disabled person, I can't count the number of times a health professional has assumed things about me on the basis of my disability or simply talked to other people in the room with me about me instead of to me. I never thought much of this until at some point at university I took a course on healthcare evaluation and one of the topics was on assessing humanity and dignity of healthcare. I realized that just about every rule for dignity and humanity during my own treatment experiences had been broken in some way or other. I realized, listening to the experiences of my non-disabled classmates (because we were asked to share), that the way I was treated by most health professionals wasn't ""normal"". 

So, in short, the medical profession needs people like yourself. Whenever I have a doctor who treats me like a person, I am immeasurably relieved and grateful.

782,"I think these people either have some sort of neurological condition or a mental illness of some sort or perhaps even both. I'm not offended by what they're doing because I don't feel they have control over it. 

The only thing I'm offended by (and honestly, it's less about offense and more about concern) is the use of the word 'transabled' because I feel like it legitimizes what they're doing by attempting to paint it in the same light as the trans movement and I feel like trans people have struggled enough to get where they are, they don't need to be taken backwards by this sort of thing.

This is very different from being transgender or transsexual. The reason for that is that when you transition from being a man to a woman or vice versa, you are not actually harming the individual's well-being or health so to speak. That person is still a fully functioning person who is able to do all the things they were able to do before aside from perhaps being able to use their reproductive organs as before. But, the use of your reproductive organs is a choice. You can choose to have children or not and you can choose how you want to have sex (ie with your biological organs or with your surgically constructed ones). Not being able to use your legs or your arms or whatever, is an impairment. An impairment that will be borne by you and by society at large. When you choose to become disabled, whether we like it or not, you are impairing yourself. That is not the case with transitioning. That's the distinction and that is why it should not be painted in the same light as being transgender or transsexual. 

The other concern I have is that it gives room for some able-bodied people, who are already critical of disability fraud, the room to say ""you see? they're lying and cheating their way to welfare"". This sort of thing will be really inflammatory and divisive and will likely hurt the disabled movement if it becomes a normalized thing (which I doubt, because I think the medical community will recognize that these people have some sort of condition).

783,"I appreciate that you've made the (very brave) effort to come here and answer questions and share your perspective. My perspective of this is also that it's not a free choice but more of a compulsion or desire but I was surprised to hear you've felt this way since being a young child. I've heard of this occurring in people who have accidents and recover but never heard of it occurring from young age. That sounds like it is quite challenging to deal with.

I do have a few questions, although of course feel free not to answer any that you find difficult. Apologies in advance if any of these are insensitive or worded badly.

Do you remember a specific event that triggered these feelings or have you had them as long as you can remember? 

Is this a feeling you have every day or just occasionally? Do you feel like your quality of life has been significantly impaired by these thoughts?

What is it about amputation that makes it desirable? Do you feel like it would relieve you from psychological pain or something like that?

If you are new to the saga of welfare in the UK either because you are young or newly disabled then I strongly recommend you treat your interaction with any of these services as if you are going to court. Record any and all interactions (ie keep a log file of letters, emails, the dates they were sent, descriptions of any phonecalls). Try and keep any interactions such as phone calls to a minimum, get everything in writing if you can. If you have meetings, take another person along with you to act as a witness if possible. You don't need to tell them why this person is there if there isn't any problem but if there is a problem you can say your friend is acting as a witness (they can take notes for dramatic effect). Return anything they ask of you as soon as you can and record these things as well. If you are in a situation where there is communication between multiple servies (eg a social worker having to be in contact with a GP) then make sure that you cross-check what one is telling you about the other. If service A tells you they have requested information from service B and that service B hasn't given them the information then find out from service B when service A made the request, if they made it at all and why B hasn't sent the information. Don't leave things to sort themselves out, it may be fine but it may not be and in the event that you end up going to court or through an appeals process, the more evidence you have the better.

I'm not saying any of this because I think the people doing these jobs are evil and need to be automatically treated as such (in fact you should keep interactions with them neutral, brief and straight to the point and you should explicitly ask for clarification in writing if you need to). I'm saying it because it saved my life when the local council tried to cut my care. I consulted a lawyer and this is what they told me to do and it was enough for the council to change its mind about what they were going to do to me and it saved me having to go to court.
