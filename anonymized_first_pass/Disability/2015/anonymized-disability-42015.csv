The website says a room is accessible, but it may turn out that their definition of ""accessible"" is a few extra bars in the bathroom.  Then it turns out that the bed is too high, doors and elevators slam shut in your face, controls and switches are out of reach, etc.

There exists a site that lists accessible non-chain motels and B&amp;Bs, but I think it's become a bit out of date.  But I still think something more comprehensive would be great.

41,"Oh, nah, it's not that bad for me! Granted, I've never known the feeling that is to hear sounds without a cochlear implant so this might affect my experiences by a lot, but with time I do forget that I'm disabled until I'm reminded by something like the sound of fireworks or not being able to communicate with a stranger without a notepad and pen. But every little bit helps and I'm glad you at least know a little bit of sign. ;-) 

Mind you, sound is very very very important. So important, that in fact, deafness is a social disability for the most part. That, I think is one reason why I don't feel disabled most of the time: Because I'm a natural introvert and rarely leave the house. As for ambulances, we're actually extremely good at detecting them when we're on the road because of our side and rear mirrors paired with (usually) ""enhanced"" peripheral vision. 

Crohn's Disease is pretty nasty tho, but yeah, I'd rather have that than be deaf... lol. 

But for most D/deaf people, once they overcome or learn how to adapt the social barrier, especially since there are many communities for the deaf and hearing people are becoming more and more aware/accommodating; they actually get by really well.  I think this is where a lot of the resentment spills over. We have far less tough obstacles to face than someone with, say, partial/full blindness or in a wheelchair or cerebral palsy etc. I've seen my hearing sister slowly waste away not being able to walk well.

I had a really bad experience with online dating when I didnt mentioned my disability and my date noticed it and felt that I was keeping it a secret on purpose (it wasn't really noticeable in any of my pictures). For me, my disability doesnt make a huge difference, because it is all I have ever known. I don't see it as a major deal because of that and didn't even think about making a big deal about it, but the girl I was on a date with completely disagreed and things there did not end well. From that point on I have made sure to tell anyone that I have gone on a date with well ahead of time the full details of my CP (even though I really dislike talking about it). I started dating my current girlfriend about 6 months ago and she is completely wonderful about it.

74,"No you wont be kicked off for trying to work.  SSA  has a whole set of rules  called ""the work incentive rules"".  They know that most people who become disabled never try to return to work because they fear loosing that monthly check. So to encourage folks to try, they have set-up rules that protect you from failing to become self supporting again. So  the short answer is,   .... you can start working and earning any amount of money for 9 months in a future 5 year window and not loose your benefit. You could earn a million bucks a month and SSA will still send you your check. At the end of your 9 month ""trial work period"" SSA looks back on your earnings. If you earned more than $1090.00 dollars per month called ""substantial gainful employment"" or SGA in each of the 9 months, they say CONGRATULATIONS! you have overcome your disability and you can now support yourself, and they then stop sending you checks. BUT, if you did not earn more than $1090.00 dollars in each of the 9 months , they say ""good try"" we will keep sending you your full disability check each month, as long as you don't earn more than $1090.00 dollars in a single month.

75,"SSI and SSDI are basically ungarnishable. I believe that only debts owed to the Federal government (back taxes, over payments from SSI) and child support can be taken out of your Federal back payment.

Are you going to continue to receive benefits after the back payment or will you be working? This makes a big difference in how you should approach this.  

If you're going to continue receiving benefits, use the money to open an irrevocable trust and have your monthly expenses drawn from the trust. Your creditors can't touch your money while it is in a trust. You can then use your monthly benefits to pay out of pocket and miscellaneous expenses. 

If this is a one time payment, open an account with a credit union. As I said before, you shouldn't fear it being seized because Federal benefits can only be garnished for very specific reasons. Credit Unions are also typically more lenient when it comes to opening accounts for people with a poor credit history.

80,"That's kind of a big question, lol. Alright, I'll give it a shot. You're not going to believe me though.

I injured my knee in hand-to-hand combat training, and walked it off for about three years -- long enough to make it through pilot training, SERE school, and make the cut into special operations. I figured none of that would be possible if anyone saw me limping, so I learned how to hide the pain, and how to work out *just enough* to pass physical tests without ripping my remaining knee apart. That plan backfired when they sent me straight from the cockpit into SERE -- I was planning on getting treatment as soon as they pinned on my wings, but there was no time. I mean I could've refused, but I was *special* or something and I'd miss a chance. Anyway long story short, I had to go right away, and hike up mountains in snowshoes with a rucksack and evade capture and get slapped around a bit. Fun times. *It almost literally killed me* more than once -- the pain sent me into shock, which, at sub-zero on top of a mountain, is generally bad. My instructor kept me alive and called medivac, but since I technically outranked him (or because I'm dashing and charming and all that), I was able to talk him into letting me finish (they didn't admit it, at the time, but they totally toned it down for me). Then later, while we were on our own, evading the instructors, the knee collapsed while I was taking my team across a cliff -- I'm seriously not even making this up -- and while I did manage to catch myself before going over, I somehow jabbed a branch into my neck in the process. *Not that much blood*, but a few inches in either direction, that could've ended differently. Then some other stuff happened -- point is, like an idiot, I powered through and finished the course hopping. 

But that was just the beginning of the fun. Because it got a little better after SERE, but then it got a lot worse -- I couldn't hide the injury anymore, and I couldn't work the left rudder on my plane, so finally I took myself off flying status and got in line for surgery. Had to wait a few months while the pain got worse. Finally got an MRI -- ""Torn meniscus! Easy fix! We'll have you back in a cockpit in six weeks!"" Sure, why not. Well that didn't go so well. See there's this hereditary thing with knee alignment -- everyone's just a little bit different and it's not necessarily a problem, but then sometimes, it is. Guess who had a problem! They tried to fix it with something called a Lateral Release (never, ever, ever let them try that, it's bad -- google it). I thought I knew what pain was before, because I ripped my shoulder in half boxing one time (maybe the universe is telling me something about fighting, idunno). On a scale of 1-10, this was a new scale. Of course, hey, post-op pain is a thing, I'm good at walking off things, let's see how it works after a few months -- the answer is 'worse.' They order some more MRIs, can't figure it out, must be the alignment is still off -- so they give me a few options, either bide my time or go aggressive. I chose the latter. Fulkerson osteotomy, bone saws and metal screws and all that jazz. Sounded like a sure thing (spoiler alert -- it wasn't). 

So remember that bit where I said ""I thought I knew what pain was before, because X?"" That's sort of a recurring theme. We ultimately tried a total of four different orthopedic surgeries, including a consult from near-as-I-can-tell, real life Doctor House, who said and I quote ""I don't know what it is, but it's the worst one I've ever seen."" With each new surgery, I had to readjust what I thought ""Pain"" meant. Anyway they couldn't sort it out, and the Air Force wasn't all that happy about it, so they let me go (although, while I was still there in a wheelchair, I did play an integral role in building a new AFSOC capability from almost-scratch, so good on me I guess -- in thanks, they moved me to Paperwork Nightmare Squad). It hurt bad, and I mean like, literally knocked unconscious from pain alone if the knee flexed in the bath tub. If I took out the trash on Monday, I couldn't move until Friday. BAD. The only drugs that did anything were narcotics, and I'm not a fan of those, so I mostly skipped them (ah who am I kidding, 20mg at a time, but it sure FELT like skipping them). Sometimes the new doctors would ask ""How long have you been using the wheelchair?"" and I'd have to explain ""Look, I only use the wheelchair when I absolutely *have* to get all the way to the couch."" 

Lucky man that I am, I emerged from active duty straight into the VA crisis. You know the one where some people waited for an appointment for 6-8 months? Yeah, that one. And at the 8-month point, I finally roll screaming (figuratively) into my appointment only for the doctor to say ""Yeah, uh, they didn't put in your paperwork, so start over."" You can guess the rest of that conversation. Months later I get back in and ""Oh, hey, looks like you have a... knee problem? Is it the left or the right?"" Funny. When they couldn't find anything on a fresh set of imagery they decided they were done, and I decided they weren't, so I asked for an elective amputation. That got me the attention of the Head Supreme Chief Director Surgeon King or some such, who, damn it all, was *really freaking good at his job.* He treated the request as extreme as it was -- made me seek out his wizard companion in pain management, which, my experience to that point had mostly been total losers, but these two docs were freakin' genius. Not that it helped -- PM did basically nothing, again, for about eight months as we ran down the list of options, culminating in an electroshock implant which just overrides your spine with a constant electrocution. The thinking is basically ""Well it's better than pain, right?"" **It kind of is**. Cool, sci-fi stuff, but unfortunately it wasn't strong enough, and that was kind of the last resort. Then the PM guy found out about some secret trials of ketamine brain drips or something like that, and I drew the line, figuring I'd won the movie-supervillain lottery once already and I better not push my luck. Amputation for the win.

Now before I tell the last bit, I want you to imagine the most catastrophically ironic thing that's ever happened in your entire life. I'm on /r/disability, so I figure there's probably some good ones. See how this stacks up.... Well, first of all, turns out they had me on placebo at this point, but ignore that for a minute, this one's even better. I fly my mother down for the surgery, right, and she's just exactly the emotional wreck you might expect, given the circumstances, but damn it, she's fighting like a champion. I'm doing what I can to reassure her -- yes, I'm sure, yes, I'm REALLY sure, yes, I'm ready, yes, it's going to be okay, sure, let's pray about it. No, actually, I don't know what time they want me to be there, they're supposed to call me with..... well, look, we'll just wake up early and call as soon as they open. Sleepless night turns into the AM, I call a very confused operator and explain, ""Yes, I'm calling about my amputation today, on purpose."" She's looking at files. ""Oh, for..... sielingfan? OH! Okay, yeah, I found it. Let's see, it's..... cancelled."" lol.  I even took the shower with the special anti-bacterial baby wipes and everything. ""Someone was supposed to call you."" I bet! So some phone tag ensues, I finally get the doctor, it's not ""CANCELLED,"" just rescheduled -- gotta go pick up some new baby wipes. Anyway that's the bit, I don't know if ""Ironic"" is the word, but you get the point, here I am begging for over a year for someone to cut off my leg, and they just forgot.

Anyway, fast-forward about 48 hours, I'm in the waiting room about to dismember myself, and that seems like a pretty good opportunity to learn who you are. So that's what I did. And what I learned is, I'm not afraid of goddamn *anything*. Which was a little surprising, honestly, I'm probably the biggest chump I know (okay, second-biggest chump -- I have brothers). But I kicked its ass. And then post-op pain happened, and I kicked *its* ass, too. And phantom pain? A spot here and there, I gather I'm rather fortunate that I didn't have more -- but the bit that I had? You guessed it. 

And that's it. That's the end of the ordeal. All I have to do now is re-learn how to walk -- hell, babies do that. In six months, I'm already getting pretty close to a mile at a time, albeit with a crutch -- but that's mostly for style points. So my general thinking is, what's left? I mean, I slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god, I landed a plane on a semiprep runway with one foot tied behind my back, I practically ran 50% of the flying hours of a freaking SOCOM base, and after/during all that I went through seven years of hell and I came out the other side with a quip about weight loss. I don't think there's anything left on this planet that can stop me. Unless, you know, maybe eight years of hell is the magic number -- but based on experience, I doubt it. Not for me, anyway. 

That's my story. I think my chest hair grows a few inches every time I tell it, sorry, but that's as near to the gospel truth as I can make it.

EDIT: OH, right, the spiders. Uh, throw in a few black widow encounters -- one in the garage that my roommate managed to capture, but then lose; another set up a web on my dogs' food bowl, and I had to do her with a crutch. Oh and one more before, that dropped a web on me from over the door at my old place and had me shrieking like a belieber.

89,"I think most portrayal in the media are white, period. And when people try to include some diversity, well they usually only pick one category. So most portrayals of non-straight characters will be white too, most instance. Same goes with disabilities. They take the ""default"" model they have in stock and change one thing (in this case, give the character a disability) but because it's already ""different"" now, it's likely to otherwise be male, straight, white, cis, and so on.

For in public, I don't know. It might depend where you live? I know people with disabilities of a variety of ethnicities and races. I wouldn't think white people would have any reason to be disabled more often than any other race.

EDIT: I actually thought of a pretty terrible reason. In many places, white people are more likely to get access to good health care and care in general, so they'd be more likely to be disabled as opposed to dead, or have a care-taker that takes them out rather than be stuck in a home (depending on the disability).

I wasn't diagnosed until I took algebra in college, and of course by then it was too late to do anything about it. To be honest, from what you've said here I think you are more disabled by your anger than anything else. I fully understand the resentment and pain from having people say you aren't even trying when you're actually giving it all you have. I too got to the point where I gave up. I dropped out of school at 16, got my GED, and immediately started working. Math, telling time, judging distances, all of those things are still extremely difficult for me. But I've learned to accept it. I refuse to be made to feel stupid because my brain simply doesn't function that way. It's just part of my makeup, the same as my eyes are blue and I'm allergic to latex. I don't see it as a deficiency, just a difference. The fact just thinking about it still ""makes your blood boil"" makes me think you would benefit from sitting down with a therapist and really hashing through those feelings. Nothing you've mentioned is nearly as debilitating as anger. And believe me, I get it. While dealing with that stuff I was also being abused, so I had *plenty* of anger issues to work through. I felt very wronged in that I wasn't helped, that no one paid attention to the red flags. And I *was* wronged. But that kind of anger is emotional cancer, and will metastasize is left unchecked. Despite your difficulties you appear to be fairly articulate, and there are plenty of people without learning issues who can't compose half as well as you. That's an intellectual asset you have that some others don't. Writing is very cathartic, and it's the tool I've used to heal myself. My suggestion is to embrace your gifts, and it will lead to accepting your ""deficiencies"" as simply differences. I'm a 30 year old who has to use a calculator to do even simple math, but I can write entire novels and can paint or draw the scenes in my stories. That's just the way my brain works. And even though your parents hurt you by assuming you were lazy or lacked motivation when you were actually trying, that kind of parental harping comes from a place of love. They thought they were doing what they needed to do to help you.

I try to provide them with a sense of empathy by returning the stares because I feel like there's too much *hypothetical* empathy between the disabled and the able-bodied that doesn't always maintain a good understanding (e.g, *If* I *were* *this* then I *would* feel *that*).  They stare at most things, but people with disabilities shouldn't have to put up with staring or be responsible on a daily basis for educating the public with regard to personal, medical information, especially in an age of information during which anyone may Google anything.  I've always felt that the stares themselves are the isolating factors.  There's an element of fear or fascination (or both) that leads inevitably to isolation.  Differences are differences.  Though I dislike staring, it is an inevitability rather than a conscious act, and I think that this guy (who seems way too nice to live up to his title) has a point.

127,"That's part of what's hard.  As I stated before, ableism shouldn't be lumped with racism and homophobia, but not just for the reason I previously stated.  Ableism can be a lot more complicated.  Not to say racism and homophobia are simple topics, but in truth they are a little more primitive than ableism in my opinion.  Racism and homophobia have their roots in hate.  But, what makes it so hard is that like with groups of race and sexuality, there is a lot of diversity in the disabled community.  Mental disabilities.  Physical disabilities.  And all the parts that those can be broken down into.  I'm in a wheelchair.  I'm a paraplegic paralyzed from the chest down in a manual wheelchair.  Someone else here might be a quad in a power chair.  Someone else might be a para with a different level of injury.  Someone might have MS.  Another has brain trauma.  Another has kidney issues.  Etc. Etc.  It's hard to find a unifying voice.  And, as we've seen, it's hard to agree upon what is offensive to everyone as a group or on an individual basis.  Just like racism and homophobia, ableism will never completely go away.  What has to be fought for is a certain level of acceptance and anti-discrimination.  There are already laws for some of it.  And to be honest, I'm not sure there is a lot more movement that can be made on a legal front.  It's more of a social acceptance.  Right now we are kind of asking to be given the benefit of the doubt in most situations.  We need to try to remove the doubt.  I don't know if the war can be won.  But I'm also not giving up on it.  But for my part, I try to live my life as normal as possible and break down the barriers of traditional feelings and reservations people have against disabled individuals.  One of the things that always sticks in my mind is something a good friend of mine told me one night.  We used to work at a college radio station together.  The station was in this tiny three room office smaller than my bedroom.  Some shows had multiple hosts and she and her friend had the show before me.  I'd come in and do my thing and she'd always try to help and awkwardly clear the way and move the extra chairs for me and stuff like that.  After knowing her for a few years she told me, ""You now.  I used to be scared and nervous to be around disabled people.  I wasn't sure how to act or what to do.  But you showed me that you're just like me and everyone else.  There's nothing different or wrong about you.  You helped me realize that.""  And after a little pause she said, ""And it made me realize that you can move your own damn chairs!""  Maybe it's stupid, and maybe it's small.  But that's what I try to be.  I don't see myself as someone in a wheelchair.  There's no denying that it's part of me.  But I am who I am.  No different than others.  Nobody is perfect.  ",False,False,t1_cqqgfep,mewithoutCthulhu,,0,1430157113,t5_2qhe8,t3_340vde,t1_cqqere7,3,1432634323,0,0,cqqgfep,disability,3,,,,

140,"I'm a disability attorney for the SSA.

Let me start by saying that, yes!  It is possible to qualify for disability with only major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder as mental impairments.  However, whether or not your anxiety and depression meet the creiteria of a ""severe impairment"" is up to the DDS examiners, and if appealed, an administrative law judge.

[Here are the critera considered in determining whether a mental impairment qualifies as a ""severe impairment""](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR85-28-di-01.html)

[Additionally, even if you are found to have severe impairments, you could still be found ""not disabled"" despite your condition depending on the relative severity of your impairment.](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR85-16-di-01.html).  

I'm going to level with you here, the fact that you don't have any significant treatment records will be a real problem for you if you decide to apply for disability, espeically since you're alleging conditions which can't be objectively measured (objective tests like MRI's, X-rays, and CT scans are given a lot of weight in making determinations).  Even though you may have been experiencing those symptoms for 13+ years, allegations of symtpoms by the calimant which aren't supported by the medical record are given basically no weight in making a determination.  Because impairments can't be considered ""severe"" unless they've lasted or are expected to last at least 12 continuous months, it's possible you won't even be found to have severe impairments until you have medical documentation of depression and anxiety for at least one year.  Additionally, the fact that you're young and have no physical impairements will weigh heavily against your chances for a favorable ruling.  


That said, it won't hurt you to apply.  Even if you apply and get rejected numerous times, there's always a possiblity that years down the road, after you've build up a substantial medical record, you'll get approved and your case will be reopened back to your intial filing date.

167,"Hey, ok will try to summarize as best as possible.

1) Bedroom Tax - So basically, if you receive housing benefit because you can't afford housing, there's now a policy that basically reduces that benefit IF you are deemed to have a spare ""bedroom"" and you either have to make up for it from your own income or you face eviction. This has disproportionately affected disabled people because a lot of disabled people might need that spare room to store their equipment like a hoist or a wheelchair OR because they need a spare room for an overnight carer to sleep in OR if they have a partner perhaps they're not able to sleep in the same room because of the disability. To make it worse, 40% of people in the UK who are disabled live in poverty so it's quite hard for them to make up that extra amount of money from their own non-existent income. This has led to people having to give up their heating or food in order to prevent becoming homeless. Furthermore, a lot of houses in the UK are simply unaccessible so disabled people don't actually have much choice about housing. If they get given a house with an extra room from social services it's not that easy to find somewhere else if evicted, even if they don't need that spare room. 

2) This government abolished the Independent Living Fund. That was a pot of money for people who have very severe care needs that was centralized. Now what happens is that your local authority (your constituency, if you like) has to approve your care. The issue here is it's a total lottery based on how rich or poor your constituency is and it's not really based on your needs. So I recently moved from a ""rich"" to a ""poor"" area and suddenly I faced losing my care package and not being able to get out of my house and carry on with my career. Every time you move to a new place, you need to be reapproved for care and it can take months. I risked becoming homeless as a result of this. Other people I knew had their local authority tell them that they could not fund their care and that their teenage children would have to be their carers. When these disabled parents objected and said they would not allow their underage children to take on roles as carers, social services threatened to take their children away.

3) The privatization and subsequent collapse of direct payment systems in local authorities. So for young, independent individuals like myself who work or study , you normally get a direct payment to help fund your care. Otherwise, you're basically given some random who comes to your house in the morning and afternoon to get you in and out of bed but nothing else. In some areas, the direct payment service became privatized. When these companies decided it was no longer profitable, they just left. So one day I received a call telling me that anyone under 65 would no longer receive direct payments because the system had collapsed. This took months to sort out and was very distressing every single day. 

4) The replacement of Disability Living Allowance with another system called PIP. So DLA is basically an allowance you can receive monthly to help cover extra transport costs etc and it is split. There's a high rate for those with very severe disabilities and lower rates for those with less severe conditioons. I have been waiting to receive PIP for over 2 years. A very large number (I think the last time I checked it was something like 60-70%, but that was about a year ago) have not been processed and as a result are not able to afford transport or other disability related things. They've also made it much harder for people who have moderate disabilities to be successful and this has not really been based on reason. For example, someone who can walk but might only be able to walk unaided for a few metres is not classed as severe anymore.

5) There was a scandal over Work Capability assessments. Basically, the government hired a private company, ATOS, to carry them out (ATOS was also hired to implement the PIP programme described above and they have faced scrutiny over that too). Now, this is not something I know about because I'm not unemployed. But, my understanding is that they were extremely unfair and many people who were terminally ill or severely disabled were judged to be fit to work. This led to a number of deaths and suicides and outrage by the disabled community. ATOS has now been replaced by another private company, MAXIMUS. This is a US company,which has been responsible for the following: Falsified Medicaid claims and was sued for fraud, has been sued for disability discrimination by one of its own employees, has had numerous discrimination complaints filed against it.

There are other policy changes too, such as changes to our health system and housing but I won't go into them because it will just take forever and I know less about them.

Outside of this, there is some outrage in the disabled community here because of the silence the media has played in talking about these issues. For example, about a month ago, there were protests across the UK regarding the treatment of disabled people and not a single media outlet reported it. On international disabled peoples day, there were almost no reports on the Britain of today for disabled people. Few stories make it out. For example, I've been in contact with a journalist for over 4 months now. She is keen to publish my experience but is having difficulty getting her editors to give her the space. 

All in all, it's a very concerning time for the disabled community here. So much so that there have been leaks about the UK possibly being the first Western country to be investigated by the UN for violation of disabled peoples human rights. This has not been talked about a lot but there have been some indications that we are being investigated. Time will tell I suppose...

SSDI is, arguably, the better plan. It requires that you have paid a certain amount into the system before you can apply.  The Social Security Administration should have been sending you statements from time to time (or, I think, you can request them?) to find out if you've hit the threshold.

After that it's a matter of applying and then having the documentation to show your cause. The application is fairly long (I did it online and it took around 5 hours, no joke).  Make sure to have all the details of your situation before you start, things like the date when you became unable to work and all the relevant contact information for your doctors.

I've also heard of, but never met someone on it, what is basically ""short term SSDI"" for situations where you cannot work at this time but the situation is treatable and you are expected to get better.

181,"As lawyer working with people applying for Social Security Disability Insurance my standard recommendation is take the paper check to whatever bank you want to open up an account up at and deposit and bank will more than happy to open up an account for you.  I recommend to my clients they consider using a credit union, since as not-for-profit financial institutions their service charges are usually less than banks.  The reason I recommend you use your first check to open an account is that the Social Security Administration any more requires everyone have direct deposit.  Therefore, the paper checks will not continue.  Most states have laws prohibiting creditors from garnishing Social Security (or any other government benefit program) funds (I would be surprised if your did not), so make a photocopy of the check before going to the bank as proof as to the origin of the funds. Hereafter, diligently keep it as a ""Social Security"" only account and do not intermingle any other funds (deposit of birthday or Christmas check) into it.  This is very important in case a creditor ever did try to attach the funds in it, so that you can file an objection and prove your only of funds comes from Social Security.  Since it is unlikely any of your creditors would ever be able to find out what bank or credit union you have decided to do business at before you can take your sister in and make an in-person withdrawal or write a check to her that she can cash at her bank, your funds are probably safer on deposit in the bank than carried around as cash in your pocket.

If your state does not have a statute exempting Social Security and other government benefit payments from creditors than check with the bank where you are opening your new accounts as to the minimum balance required to avoid service fees and have the bank issue you a cashier's check for all the money in the account over the required minimum balance.  Then hang onto your cashier's check until you need to pay a bill. Take cashier's check back to the bank deposit it into your account withdraw whatever sum you need to pay your the bill with and purchase a new cashier's for the new amount over the minimum bank balance.  Just keep continuing doing this every time you need to pay a bill.  The problem is some banks have a steep fee for issuing cashier's checks, however, customers at some credit unions get free cashier's checks as a fringe benefit of being a ""share holder"" of the business enterprise.

196,"Sorry, not trying to be rude or anything, genuinely interested in your perspective here. Can you explain to me more about why you don't consider it a disease? 

You see, from my perspective, autism does affect physical health for example by making some autistic individuals hypersensitive to sound. To me, when I see an autistic person grimacing at a sound that other people might find ordinary, it seems like they are experiencing a form of physical harm as a result of their condition. Of course it is a spectrum and people experience their condition differently but I think one could argue that it can affect physical health. I suppose someone might then argue that sensory conditions are a co-morbidity and separate to autism but then you can probably argue that autism appears to be associated with a number of comorbidities and is therefore predisposing individuals to the comorbidities so can be considered a disease in the same indirect way that a lot of other conditions are. For example, there are neurological conditions which in themselves don't cause physical harm but when you start adding compounding issues like respiratory issues (which biologically, is not actually caused by the underlying neuropathy) they do. I think you can probably say the same for a lot of conditions that don't have a direct route from cause to effect but they still affect physical health by a number of complex and indirect pathways.

248,"Aside from calling on ads and asking landlords directly or to setup appointments here are a few ideas. One idea is to find realtors in your area who are property managers as well and ask them if they have any rentals that are totally flat or have wider bathroom doors or if they know of any buildings that may. Then you have a few different people keeping you in mind. You could also post an ad on craigslist under housing wanted and say exactly what you want/need. Another idea would be to post to a subreddit for your area and ask people who live in condos to let you know if their building and units seem accessible and let you know the building names, even if they're not accessible so that you can ignore those as well. Another trick I learned to help with telling if bathrooms might be accessible from photos is that a typical large floor tile is usually (not always) is 12"" so if you see a pic that includes the doorway you can look at the tiles and guesstimate if the width will be wide enough for your chair (i.e. 2.5 tiles=30""). Another possibility is to search for buildings by name and include ""floorplan"" in your search. Sometimes you can look at these and decide if a place might be worth exploring further. Lastly, you can look for condos or apartments for sale and find open houses in your area and go to them.

Have you considered therapy? I've been in therapy for 4 years for something completely different but it has helped so much. Is this a financial reality? It might help you come to terms with what you're grieving for, which is a loss of independence and previous sense of self in a way. If not therapy then perhaps a support group?

271,"I relate to this so so much. My life was full of weird little paradoxes like this. I remember all the parents at my school giving me a standing ovation on graduation night, there were people in the first row wiping tears away. I mean, it was embarrassing. I just wanted to die on the spot. Granted, I graduated top of my year and got into a very prestigious university but christ there's no need to cry over a child you don't even know. And then people would come up to me and put two arms around my shoulders and just get all emotional. People I didn't even know! Then they'd turn to my parents and go ""Isn't she wonderful? You're so blessed!"" and I'm thinking I'm not fucking wonderful, I'm quite a little shit actually, if only you knew what a little shit I could be.

Then, the other side of my life was attending these ""X for kids with disabilities"" things. I used to go to an art class once a week. I was terrible at art and I was terrible at acting like a grateful disabled child. All the instructors would constantly tell my parents how miserable I was all the time and it made no sense to my parents because I wasn't that person at all in any other aspect of my life. I just hated these bullshit events and the way we were treated with the ""everyone wins"" mentality like you said. I didn't feel like one of them and the instructors would just tell my parents that I was in denial about my condition. I wasn't in denial at all, I just didn't relate to that stuff.

About helping the community, it took so long for me to wrap my head around this. I wanted nothing to do with it, I too didn't want to be ""the cripple who obviously cares about cripple issues"". Wouldn't touch that stuff with a ten foot pole if you paid me. Couldn't even use the word ""disabled"" without cringing at hearing myself use it. However, I went through some serious discriminatory stuff at university. This was some next level shit and I lived in a developing country for a while before university, I wasn't exactly a sheltered puppy. For the first time, I was actually made to feel subhuman and this coincided with some local council care related issues that threatened my independence. It took about 2 years for me to get angry enough to stand up for myself and it took about another 2 years for me to realize that there were others I could help with my anger. I even went to counselling because that's how bad I didn't want to be that crip that cares about crip issues. To me, now, it's not so much about not feeling like one of them. It's about the fact that I don't feel like it should be my job to help others. I shouldn't have to do it just because I'm disabled. I resent that aspect of it still. But, honestly, as much as I hate the cliche I'm also a fighter and I know I'm a good one. I know I have the energy and anger to get stuff done, at least for myself and for others around me. Maybe not on a bigger level and certainly not all the time but I try when I'm able to. I don't judge anyone who doesn't though, that's just my story I suppose.

283,"For a year of care I needed about £30,000. That was the cheapest option as well. It really depends on your condition though. I need full-time, 24 hour care. Are you able to sleep alone or do you need help turning at night for example? If you're able to sleep alone then care costs can be significantly reduced. The way I raised the money was to write letters to any large corporations I could think of in my own country and in the country I was going to. I wrote a cover letter, explaining my situation and my background and why I was passionate to study my course. I included transcripts of all my results to demonstrate I had a lot of potential. I included copies of my acceptance letters too. The vast, vast majority didn't reply to me. A small handful did and that handful guaranteed me money for every year of university attendance under the condition that I sent them proof of the expenses. This is an option that is not easy or nice to have to do, but I wouldn't be where I am if I hadn't done it. I also recommend you email your university disability team (i would be very surprised if a US university didn't have one). Ask them what sources of funding are available to disabled students. There was 1 such option for me in the country I went to, it was only for £2000 but every little amount adds up.

If you're going to a university in the USA, I would also find out what help the university offers disabled people. Would they be willing to get you a personal assistant to help you during the entire time you are on campus (by that I mean during ""educational"" time in the lab or in lectures or whatever)? This would greatly reduce costs because then you might only need to fund a carer who works during the hours you are not on campus (ie in the mornings, evenings, potentially overnight and on the weekends).

Initially, I used a volunteer organization (volunteer in the loosest term, I still paid an incredible amount of money) to find my carers because this was the cheapest option. This was problematic because the people they gave me were not trained and honestly caused me a lot of stress. I used this system until I became entitled to get my care funded by the country I was living in. After that I switched to a more professional company.

Maybe someone from the USA can give you some information on what criteria you need to fulfill in order to become eligible for care. It may be that you have to be in the country for a certain amount of time and maybe even work. In which case, I would suggest you find whatever way possible to fulfill these criteria. For example if they say you need to have been living and working in the country for a year perhaps consider working part-time whilst you study. I have no idea what the criteria are, but the best way to go about this is to be as creative as possible in the beginning and be aware that it might involve a few unpleasant sacrifices for a while but that it is all part of a long-term plan.

Over the last 5 years I've had 11 different carers. 4 of them stayed with me for the first year (I had a team of 4 in the beginning because they were ""volunteers"" so couldn't work for more than 25 hours a week each). In my second, third and fourth years I had 2 carers each year because I was on an intense course and it was too much for 1 person to handle. Now I have 1 carer because my life is less complicated and it works well. The amount they stay really depends on whether you're happy with them and how circumstances in your life and their life change.

If you do decided to find care, you need to also consider the possibility of unexpected events. I had one carer who slipped and banged her head very badly, she ended up in hospital. If one of them gets sick or has a family emergency you need to have some kind of reassurance that if something like this happens you'll have a backup. So that's something to consider. 

You should also consider whether you will use a voluntary agency, a proffesional agency or whether you will self-employ but that is a question for further down the line.

In terms of carer conditions, these are the ones that are agreed on by all the carers I have had:
- I will pay for their accommodation (this of course only applies because they are 24 hour carers, meaning they have to stay overnight. If you do not need overnight care this is unlikely to be an issue for you).
- I will provide them with a weekly food allowance (I spend £30 a week on this)

That was the cheapest option as well. It really depends on your condition though. I need full-time, 24 hour care. Are you able to sleep alone or do you need help turning at night for example? If you're able to sleep alone then care costs can be significantly reduced. The way I raised the money was to write letters to any large corporations I could think of in my own country and in the country I was going to. I wrote a cover letter, explaining my situation and my background and why I was passionate to study my course. I included transcripts of all my results to demonstrate I had a lot of potential. I included copies of my acceptance letters too. The vast, vast majority didn't reply to me. A small handful did and that handful guaranteed me money for every year of university attendance under the condition that I sent them proof of the expenses. This is an option that is not easy or nice to have to do, but I wouldn't be where I am if I hadn't done it. I also recommend you email your university disability team (i would be very surprised if a <LOCATION> university didn't have one). Ask them what sources of funding are available to disabled students. There was 1 such option for me in the country I went to, it was only for £2000 but every little amount adds up.

If you're going to a university in the <LOCATION>, I would also find out what help the university offers disabled people. Would they be willing to get you a personal assistant to help you during the entire time you are on campus (by that I mean during ""educational"" time in the lab or in lectures or whatever)? This would greatly reduce costs because then you might only need to fund a carer who works during the hours you are not on campus (ie in the mornings, evenings, potentially overnight and on the weekends).

Initially, I used a volunteer organization (volunteer in the loosest term, I still paid an incredible amount of money) to find my carers because this was the cheapest option. This was problematic because the people they gave me were not trained and honestly caused me a lot of stress. I used this system until I became entitled to get my care funded by the country I was living in. After that I switched to a more professional company.

Maybe someone from the <LOCATION> can give you some information on what criteria you need to fulfill in order to become eligible for care. It may be that you have to be in the country for a certain amount of time and maybe even work. In which case, I would suggest you find whatever way possible to fulfill these criteria. For example if they say you need to have been living and working in the country for a year perhaps consider working part-time whilst you study. I have no idea what the criteria are, but the best way to go about this is to be as creative as possible in the beginning and be aware that it might involve a few unpleasant sacrifices for a while but that it is all part of a long-term plan.

Over the last 5 years I've had 11 different carers. 4 of them stayed with me for the first year (I had a team of 4 in the beginning because they were ""volunteers"" so couldn't work for more than 25 hours a week each). In my second, third and fourth years I had 2 carers each year because I was on an intense course and it was too much for 1 person to handle. Now I have 1 carer because my life is less complicated and it works well. The amount they stay really depends on whether you're happy with them and how circumstances in your life and their life change.

If you do decided to find care, you need to also consider the possibility of unexpected events. I had one carer who slipped and banged her head very badly, she ended up in hospital. If one of them gets sick or has a family emergency you need to have some kind of reassurance that if something like this happens you'll have a backup. So that's something to consider. 

You should also consider whether you will use a voluntary agency, a proffesional agency or whether you will self-employ but that is a question for further down the line.

In terms of carer conditions, these are the ones that are agreed on by all the carers I have had:
- I will pay for their accommodation (this of course only applies because they are 24 hour carers, meaning they have to stay overnight. If you do not need overnight care this is unlikely to be an issue for you).
- I will provide them with a weekly food allowance (I spend £30 a week on this)
- I will pay for their transport when they are with me
- They work in 8-10 week blocks and are then entitled to 3-4 weeks off. Someone else will take their place whilst they are off.

In terms of travel - yes and no. It really depends on whether you self-employ or use an agency. An agency will have its own rules based on insurance reasons.

*Any* housing that accepts HUD money to be built or run *must* accept disabled people of any age.  That means you can apply for disabled housing in any HUD-related senior housing.  (They should advertise as something like ""seniors over 65 and any age qualified disabled."")  

Waiting lists for disabled housing tend to be long, and longer the better the neighborhood.  In areas I have lived, disabled housing in fairly awful neighborhoods has waiting lists of about 6 months.  Good housing in good neighborhoods can have wait lists of 3-4 years.

339,"It sounds like you're on a great start!  I went through a similar program in Colorado.  I was still on government support for paying my caregivers, but I was allowed to hire them and decide their pay rate (within the bounds of my monthly budget).

Finding reliable people can be tough!  The personal care industry seems to be notorious for having unreliable workers.  Nursing homes have huge turnover because the employees are either unreliable or sick of filling in for all of the unreliable people.

The best starting point is to make sure that your three primary assistants will mostly show up.  I try my best to screen for reliable people during interviews.  Look for employees who have had steady employment, and make sure to check their work-related references to verify this!  I try to avoid hiring people who might be regularly unavailable (students from out of town, people who travel regularly, etc.).  Also try to find primary assistants who are willing to fill in for each other.  This might require some cross training between shifts, but it can be well worth it!

It's great that you have a list of 12 backups, but most people tend to be pretty unreliable if they are just on call.  No one likes getting a phone call out of the blue to come and help out.  Of course, there are some people that are kindhearted and would help in anyway possible, but it could become tiresome long-term if you have to call on them often.  All that said, go through your list and really make sure that they are okay being on call.

Most recently, I have taken the approach of requiring each caregiver/assistant to find their own sub if they will ever be out.

I went through a similar program in <LOCATION>.  I was still on government support for paying my caregivers, but I was allowed to hire them and decide their pay rate (within the bounds of my monthly budget).

Finding reliable people can be tough!  The personal care industry seems to be notorious for having unreliable workers.  Nursing homes have huge turnover because the employees are either unreliable or sick of filling in for all of the unreliable people.

The best starting point is to make sure that your three primary assistants will mostly show up.  I try my best to screen for reliable people during interviews.  Look for employees who have had steady employment, and make sure to check their work-related references to verify this!  I try to avoid hiring people who might be regularly unavailable (students from out of town, people who travel regularly, etc.).  Also try to find primary assistants who are willing to fill in for each other.  This might require some cross training between shifts, but it can be well worth it!

It's great that you have a list of 12 backups, but most people tend to be pretty unreliable if they are just on call.  No one likes getting a phone call out of the blue to come and help out.  Of course, there are some people that are kindhearted and would help in anyway possible, but it could become tiresome long-term if you have to call on them often.  All that said, go through your list and really make sure that they are okay being on call.

Most recently, I have taken the approach of requiring each caregiver/assistant to find their own sub if they will ever be out.  I find that this tends to reduce the number of times that a caregiver will call in.  They are more likely to call in if they know I'll take the burden of finding replacements.  Generally, if they can't find a fill in, I require that they come in.

348,"Hey there :)
I'm sorry you are going through this. It sucks, and that's. legitimate reaction. Actually, all of your feels are legitimate; you can't leap right to acceptance which every single loss, ya know? 
Things is, we have an extra challenge with progressive disabilities (I have a form of idiopathic progressive polyneuropathy caused by severe CRPS complicated by EDS 3). 
We are constantly having to accept new losses and feeling pressure to act all hunky dory about it. 
But it's scary! I remember I used to feel a swell of utter panic when I lost the ability to move a new muscle independently, or do someone that I used to take for granted or that was an important aspect of participating in a hobby, etc. 

But stress, panic, fear, depression and devastation feed one another and they aren't good to your body or your mind longterm. It's important to learn how to process feelings efficiently for anyone, but we have to learn how to do it at sort of a super hero level for our own sanity. 

As others have mentioned, a good therapist is imperative. I see a clinical psychologist with a doctorate and fifteen years of clinical experience. I went through several therapists before I found one I really wanted to work with. It's awesome to have a place where I can vent and compartmentalize the shitty stuff. And she offers lots of helpful tools for dealing with self-confidence/disability/fear/panic etc. 

I also make a ton of lists. I experience flares where I am much more disabled than usual. I keep lists of things I can do no matter what. 
I know that I still have to process each loss as it comes, but it's less of a hit emotionally when I have already come up with valuable ways to spend my time even with highly limited physical ability. I have notebooks a filled with fears, losses, wishes, objectives, things to do in bed, things to do on the couch, things to do when I can't move my arm, things to do when I can't use my crutches, things to do when i'm sensitive to light, things to do when my ears are ringing, things to do when I'm having sever spasticity, etc etc. 

I know that progression is scary, but it isn't the end of the world. I think you have to be easy on yourself and take some time and tools to process not only what you are going go through, but what you already HAVE gone through.

412,"&gt;However, if you are disabled and you have an assitive device that allows you to do what you need to do, you are on par with your peers.

You may be on par with your peers in doing what YOU need to do, but you still are not able to do everything THEY can do. So, one is still at a deficit compared to what is possible on the entire spectrum of ability. So, just as he has above average physical ability, on the spectrum of physical ability, he has below average emotional ability, on the spectrum of emotional ability. This doesn't make him less of a person for having this limitation, just as it doesn't make someone less of a person if they have a disability which requires use of a wheelchair. If he were able to get medical assistance which improved upon his emotional health, he has the potential to increase his ability on the emotional spectrum. If a person whose disability requires a wheelchair could have a medical intervention which allowed greater physical use of their body, they would have the potential to increase their ability on the physical spectrum.

&gt;To follow this metaphor to it's conclusion, if you had an emotional wheelchair, you had coping strategies and tools allowing you to have the same emotional resiliency as your peers.

Would you? Or would you have a tool that improved upon it, but still left you at a deficit in some ways?

&gt;i would also agree that from a certain standpoint, the infrastructure required to accommodate a wheelchair and the physical effort require to locomote in a wheelchair exceeds those of a person wearing glasses.

Which is why I would guess when someone is trying to compare one type of disability to another, they would use the more extreme example, to compare his level of disability. In other words, I don't think comparing his disability to the need for glasses, would have been sufficient to describe the level of impairment.

521,"I think if a person chooses to wear a bracelet to alert others about medications then that's totally cool and up to them. I think there are also bracelets for penicillin allergies and other important things that one might want someone to know if they were in an emergency situation.

I do agree with this MP that we need to train our police, lawyers, educators and generally anyone in a position of power to be more aware of other peoples needs. However, I don't necessarily think advocating for this kind of thing is helpful or really relevant to the issues of diagnosis or service provisions. 

Having lived in Cambridge for 4 years and having PTSD I have to say the mental health provisions are awful. Absolutely awful. I think the outrage really started because people living there know just how bad the provisions are (not for everyone of course, but for many people) and over the last few years there has been an increasing feeling in Cambridge that nobody is listening. There have been numerous new movements that started up since 2013 calling for an end to the stigma of having mental health problems in the area and better services. I think people might be feeling that this is just a step in the opposite direction. It also doesn't help that this was said by a conservative MP and they're not exactly considered to be doing anything helpful for the disabled at the moment.

That being said, I think this was just a bit of  a slip up. She was probably just unprepared for the question and she acknowledged that there are better ideas out there. I don't think she was actually suggesting we should all be tagged against our will. I see where she is coming from in terms of people in positions in power being able to tailor their approach to the individual and their needs, she just hasn't thought through how that might make people feel or the repercussions regarding stigma.

525,"We really need an FAQ :-/

SSI is not the same thing as SSDI.   Your friend is applying for SSI because she didn't put enough Social Security taxes.  

SSI *and* SSDI are both Federal programs. It doesn't matter what state you live in, the programs are identical and are run by the Social Security office.  

There ARE state-based programs in most states. They are often even more restrictive than the Federal programs and have very strict guidelines for assets, income, and need.  

To find out if she's eligible for SSI she needs to contact the Social Security Administration. This can be done in person at a local office, by phone (call early; the wait times can be insane), or online.

To find out if she's eligible for state-based programs, she'll need to find the local version of a Department of Human Resources (called something different in every state, I think), that covers things like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid (or whatever it's locally called), and cash assistance for disabled people.
