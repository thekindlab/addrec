0,"The best way is to get an exact weight of your wheelchair.   Once you have that weight, request that the nurse write it down.   Keep the chair weight accessible, for my son we wrote it on a label and stuck it on the back of his wheelchair.   After that any time they weight you on the wheelchair scale all you have to do is tell them the exact weight of your wheelchair and they can then subtract it out to get your weight.   

I suppose if you have a base model with no custom seating options or custom wheels etc. you could use the manufacturer's weight but if you have any supports or customization at all it is going to throw the accuracy of your weight off.

I talked to one of our product specialists and while it's not a super common adaptation i.e. getting a stroller into the trunk, we've done one or two of them. He suggested using a wheelchair hoist or crane. They come in all shapes and sizes with different functions such as telescopic and folding arms. Some of them are static and fit in larger vehicles while others can be folded down or taken apart in between uses to fit in smaller trunks. I'd say that except for hand controls, wheelchair hoists are perhaps the most wide spread solution among manufacturers, so finding one shouldn't be a problem regardless of what car you drive.

A bunch of paras I know have sedans or other small cars where they can disassemble and lift the chair after transferring into the driver's seat. They don't use adapted vehicles mainly for cost efficiency, although part of it is car preference and not wanting to rely on a ramp to be able to get in/out.

74,"Social Security disability is a federal program. It typically doesn't matter from state to state when you apply. What state you're in only matters when (if) you appeal.  That's mostly because of the wait times due to how much of a case load exists.

SSDI vs SSI (both are run by Social Security Administration) are two different programs. SSDI is based on how long you worked and how much you made during that time. The formula is a bit confusing but the work has to be fairly recent and for more than 4-5 years.  SSDI payments are based in the same way you get Social Security payments after 65, only it's about 2/3 of what you'd get if you turned 65.  With SSDI, you can have unlimited resources (both money and possessions) and can even work part-time, on a limited basis.  After two years on SSDI you automatically get Medicare.  There are federal and sometimes state programs to help pay for Medicare costs if the income level is low enough.


SSI is for those who have not worked enough or recently to qualify for SSDI. SSI assumes poverty. You are limited to how much possessions you can own (outside of a house and car) and any other income is calculated differently. SSI does not include Medicare but the payments are fixed (and at an amount less than you would get with SSDI) so it's likely the recipient can qualify for state-based support such as Medicaid and SNAP.

The best thing your girlfriend and aunt can do before getting to the SSA office is to have their ducks in a row.  Put together data on every doctor the aunt has seen, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. Get the exact date of diagnosis, and the dates (and locations, if different) of any tests run that are related to the diagnosis.

92,"My husband receives regular medical attention/medication for his severe anxiety disorder, and schizoid personality disorder.  
My husband will be filling out his SSA-454-BK shortly as soon as we verify when blood tests were completed/emergency room visit dates/etc.  

Back in Fall of 2013, my husband tried to attend a community college.  I accompanied him that day (because I knew he might go batshit), and he decided the same day, after the very first class that he could not continue any of his on-campus courses.  He tried switching to an online setup, and found that the stress from the homework was too much.  
He was a ""student"" for less than two weeks.  Does he include this information on Section 7?  Or should we just note it in Section 11?  (Or both?)

*EDIT:  I thought of another question.  What's the easiest way for us to obtain Emergency Room records?  I know he has a few, but I also know my husband will have to personally talk to someone in order to get them.  I know he will freak out when I tell him he needs to talk to someone to get these.  (I would do it for him if I could, but I know they're going to cite privacy laws, and HIPA and all that.)  Can he sign something giving the SSI office full disclosure to obtain any and all records?  We have nothing to hide.  (Would having him fill out a Power of Attorney form help us, making it so he wouldn't have to talk to anyone, and I could obtain his records for him?  Would we just have to go get it notarized, or do you know if it costs more than that because a lawyer would need to draft said form?  Our bank has a notary, I think he could manage to sit there with me while a form like that was notarized as long as I went with him.)

100,"You have to go to that appointment. It is extremely rare that someone will get approved for benefits while failing to go to the examination. While you have some historical documentation of your condition what SSA is going to look for is how you are CURRENTLY functioning. Without current treatment they will have to rely on that exam. 

While they can still deny you even if you go to the exam it is important to note that if you do not go to the exam they will do a ""failure"" denial of your claim. There are essentially two types of denials: medical and technical. Medical denials are the typical ones (ie your condition isn't severe enough to prevent you from working). Technical denials include things like being over-resources, not insured, and all 'failure to cooperate' situations. Medical denials, for SSI, can be reopened and reversed for 2 years after the decision. Technical denials cannot.

 Why is this important? Well lets say that you are denied this time and you don't appeal. Next year you apply again and they decide you are disabled and the medical records support reopening the previous claim and allowing you back to 2015. You'll get a whole chunk of back-pay from that.

So not just you OP, everyone reading this. Go to the exams. Even if you think that they are unnecessary or you don't understand why they want you to go or whatever the reason is. And if you happen to miss it (it happens, people forget, cars break down, etc) call the DDS office (not the doctor's office) RIGHT AWAY to let them know.

125,"Disability is a complex category whose definition can shift somewhat wildly based on context. Through the ADA (and the Rehab Act before that) disability exists in large part as a *legal* definition. It sounds silly but these days we ""exist"" in a number of ways. In so far as people know and concepualize *you*, you exist as an idea in their head where your level of (dis) ability has varying significance, you exist to them physically though perhaps digitally as well if you have a Facebook profile where your photos, posts, and other information about yourself are curated to construct a version of  ""you"". You also ""exist"" as a person on paper to the a variety of institutions and bureaucracies.  

There is always a gap between these though. Any photo on your profile is inevitably from the past and thus does not perfectly represent you as you presently are. Maybe you've acquired a disability through age, accident, or otherwise. You may subjectively experience the physical challenges and limitations that come with your condition, and furthermore your friends and family may see you differently placing your condition at varying levels of importance in their overall understanding of you,  yet it may take your insurance six months or more to recognize you as someone with a disability. 
 
It's interesting because while ability exists on a spectrum, the legal infrastructure and insurance has added a binary categorization which often overtakes our thinking; too often we are goaded into thinking of disability as something you either do or do not have when the reality is far murkier. In a legal sense you may qualify, though it sounds like at a subjective level it's just not hitting home for you right now. I'd ask you though, even if disability is not effecting you presently, how does it effect you *potentially*? You may have no interest whatsoever in military service, but does your disability eliminate that as an option you could *ever* consider? Have you ever rehearsed explaining it to a real or potential lover? How might this condition serve to complicate your life as the inevitable changes of age and life in general take effect? Would it add complexity to managing diabetes? Does it create a different heirarchy of options for you when it comes to cardio training? 

Even if these are not current  issues in your life and never have been, they *may* be, and the odds are that in some ways these are things you have considered and integrated into the story you tell yourself about yourself. These are the more subtle effects of disability. ",,,,deepsoulfunk,,,1450878536,t5_2qhe8,t3_3xybrk,t3_3xybrk,5,1451814096,0,0,cy8wumg,disability,5,,,,

Users can select a broad category (vision impairment, motor skills, etc) and provide feedback on various categories (ability to navigate, organization, etc) as well as add tags (resizable text, color based instructions) while writing a review, which other users can then search upon.

152,"Okay so I know this post is two months old and I don't even know how I got here but...

You're not pathetic. I know, I'm just a stranger on the net, what the fuck do I know right? The thing is, that when you have a disability that severely affects your life, your life is different. What a lot of people do, including myself, is measure ourselves up to this template of other people the same age and torture ourselves with what society expects of us by that age.

But the problem is that society doesn't yet have a template for 'my joints suck and nerve pain makes me want to jump in a freezer'. And because everyone's disability is a little different, we all need slightly different templates. Society can't make something realistic for us to compete against, it only has the standard 'by X age you should have a career, y age a house, z age a family' etc etc. And we realistically have to do things differently.

You make your own template based on *you*, not on what society thinks you should be compared to others. And you take that template and go right the fuck ahead and compete with it as hard as you can, because that's how we improve. Your template is living with family and getting help with finances, and all the other things you do in life. So take the other things you do in life and compete with them to do better, a little bit at a time. For me, that's exercising. I hate it, I'm much slower than probably everyone else I know, but compared to my template, I'm doing fucking awesome. I'm improving, I'm helping my body, and I'm slowly but surely getting faster. I don't want to assume what's in your life but I'm damn sure there are things you can kick the arse out of. 

Your life is different. That's cool. Don't beat yourself up about it.  Stop comparing yourself to what you think you should have done by 40. Use the time you spend thinking about that to think about your own template, to do your own fucking thing and OWN it. Because you damn well can.

The only problem is its a bit of the wrong season for them! As a teen I used to pick up pairs at the end of the summer season on clearance for my dad's auto shop. XS for my kid brothers and XL for a guy with small hands (I'd unsew the tags for vanity.) The work gloves wouldn't fit them either, though that's what they needed. You might be able to sort through them online, many of the gloves are cloth and can be immediately eliminated. You'd just need to google and read up on the different types of leathers to hopefully find some that will be good to your hands without the benefit of feeling them in store.

(Two actually walked out in the middle of a date, never to be heard from again!)

I spoke with some friends, and someone suggested that I put a short word about my history right in my dating profile.  So I found a way to do this without making it seem like I was still emotionally involved with my late wife.

What happened?  My response rate dropped off a cliff.  I was used to getting 7-10 responses a week, after I did that I got 1 response every 1-2 weeks.  But you know what?  The women that did respond were *much* more emotionally mature, even though they were younger than me by a year or two.  I had a lot more fun and a lot deeper connection with all of them, and I ended up marrying one of them three years ago.

239,"Interesting question. I mean, the WHO definition for impairment and disability are the following:

Impairment: a loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function.

Disability: any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of the ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.

So, if we're going by these definitions, you'd almost definitely fall into the impairment category due to having what is classed as a ""congenital malformation"". But having an impairment isn't the same as having a disability.

As for the disability definition - it would really depend on how much not having a prosthetic would affect you. And then there's the question of how do you define ""an activity"" and what sorts of activities are included. Is running an activity? Or by activity do we just mean whatever you do in your daily life - perhaps running is not something you've ever had to do and therefore should not be included as an activity. Do you see what I mean? I use running as an example because I imagine it might be harder or more tiring to run a few laps around the pitch without a prosthetic in comparison to someone without a limb deficiency (apologies if i'm wrong about this). My point is you might not be a great runner but that doesn't change the fact that you're obviously very capable of carrying out most daily tasks without a prosthetic like you wrote.

There are actually standardized disability tests, used to determine whether something is classed as a disability or not. Even though these have been developed and refined over long periods of time, they actually aren't very good as far as I remember - though it has been a long time since I learnt about them. 

I mean, ultimately, in grey areas like yours I think the individual should have some of a say in whether or not something gets classed as a disability. If someone truly feels they aren't disabled by an impairment then they're probably better placed to decide that than an ambiguous definition. It's obviously different in more black and white cases where there's less room for ambiguity.

i feel like librarians may be keenly aware of this, but perhaps they are just as clueless as the general public - how incredibly high the adult illiteracy rate in the united states is. depends on who you cite, but the consensus seems to be that ~20% of american adults read below a 5th grade level.

i feel this sub tends to focus more on physical disabilities than emotional or learning ones (could be wrong on that, not super active here), and that may be more what you're asking about, but i have direct experience with this sort of thing. i used to volunteer for a wonderful non-profit called [learn to read jax](http://www.learntoreadjax.org/) that trained literacy tutors for work in classroom settings, as well as one-on-one tutoring. they asked me to be a one-on-one tutor, and my student was autistic, severely dyslexic and had pretty heavy emotional issues. as a tutor i felt i was properly trained and given good workbooks to use, and the people (literally i think 2 actual employees) who ran the place were a great resource.

this non-profit was a bit separate from the jacksonville public library system (though their office was in the main downtown library), but they operated though the library and their facilities.

tl;dr - adult illiteracy is a major problem almost anywhere you go in the country, rural or city. it's something that isn't talked about very much because people learn to cope and most illiterate adults are functionally illiterate - they get by. but it's a major source of shame for them and we can make it easier. many of these people are learning and/or emotionally disabled, and adult illiteracy is a worthy cause that i think every public library should consider addressing.

i feel this sub tends to focus more on physical disabilities than emotional or learning ones (could be wrong on that, not super active here), and that may be more what you're asking about, but i have direct experience with this sort of thing. i used to volunteer for a wonderful non-profit called [learn to read jax](<URL>) that trained literacy tutors for work in classroom settings, as well as one-on-one tutoring. they asked me to be a one-on-one tutor, and my student was autistic, severely dyslexic and had pretty heavy emotional issues. as a tutor i felt i was properly trained and given good workbooks to use, and the people (literally i think 2 actual employees) who ran the place were a great resource.

this non-profit was a bit separate from the jacksonville public library system (though their office was in the main downtown library), but they operated though the library and their facilities.

tl;dr - adult illiteracy is a major problem almost anywhere you go in the country, rural or city. it's something that isn't talked about very much because people learn to cope and most illiterate adults are functionally illiterate - they get by. but it's a major source of shame for them and we can make it easier. many of these people are learning and/or emotionally disabled, and adult illiteracy is a worthy cause that i think every public library should consider addressing.

thanks for asking, and good luck on all future endeavors.","[{'start': 657, 'end': 662, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 210, 'end': 220, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I also think that companion seating should be guaranteed for those who are *necessary* companions of a disabled person.

However.

If a non-disabled person goes to the movie theater, there is *no guarantee* that he will be able to find seats next to his friends and/or date.  If they pre-purchase tickets with assigned seating, there's no guarantee they be able to purchase seats next to each other.

If we demand that disabled people must be allowed to sit with their friends, then non-disabled people may start claiming to be disabled to use those seats.   (Similar to what happened at Disney parks where non-disabled people started pretending to be disabled, or actually *hiring disabled people to go with them*, just to line jump.)

The one on the lease collects the other's share of the rent, and issues a handwritten receipt. 

Write up a simple subleasing agreement, noting that all parties are responsible for their own food, care, cleaning, etc. 

Have the roommate write and sign a handwritten note to the case manager stating that one of you is renting a room from the other, and that for all intents and purposes, you are your own household, and live alone in a shared space.

312,"I didn't notice how many non-disabled people think it's okay to buy handicapped seats until my area got an Alamo Drafthouse (movie theater with assigned seating). They have prime location spots clearly marked for wheelchairs on the ticketing system. People buy them, arrive to find -surprise- a ""missing seat"" and summon the manager. I've heard more than one complain that they bought the ticket days ago, before the other seats sold out, and how come they don't have a chair there?!? They are kindly offered the choice between a folding chair and a refund. (Or an escort outside if they get belligerent as Alamo is known for their intolerance of inconsiderate people.)

This is probably why venues raise the prices on disability seating, to discourage this kind of abuse. The price increase to people who actually need these seats isn't an ethical solution, but its hard to find an effective ethical solution when combating unethical people.

Holding the tickets for phone sales only seems like a reasonable decision. Perhaps they could also collect the raised ticket price, but return the excess if the ticket holder arrives well before the show start time (which corresponds with the necessary pre-seating time) to receive their refund.",,,,ClassyUser,,,1449218494,t5_2qhe8,t3_3uk4jt,t3_3uk4jt,1,1451431370,0,0,cxmr30k,disability,1,,,,

That said, I feel like there are way more opportunities for undergrad waivers. With an implication that once you have a bachelors you must be loaded? I'm not really sure what it is.. I suspect it has to do with bachelors degrees having far more subsidies from the government so there is an incentive to attract as large of a net of students as possible.

460,"Depression, anxiety and migraines can be a disability by social security standards, but she is right that proving it is *very* difficult.

If she can, it would likely take 2-3 years of 

a) consistently seeing her doctor with consistent, detailed notes about exactly *how* her symptoms prevent her from working 

b) being entirely unable to work and entirely unemployed

c) making appeals until she gets a hearing with a judge, and hiring a disability lawyer, who will be able to claim some of the initial lump sum intended to pay back her debts from sitting around fighting social security for 2-3 years while bringing in no money. (I forget the exact percentage, it's not much, but it's still a sizable bit) 

Additionally, some states have a state disability you can get while applying for SSI/SSDI, but this may have to be payed back out of your back payment or if you lose your final appeal. In my state it was only ~$200/month, and between that and the lawyer, I got less than 1/3rd of my total back payment. 

You need to prove that she is too disabled to do *any* significant work *anywhere in the country*, with *any reasonable accommodations*, including work requiring further education or retraining if she is under 50, with specific examples of her limitations in that regard, and how they would affect her ability to work. Social security does not care whether you can afford further schooling or to relocate. If you could work if you were able to afford it, you are not considered ""disabled"" by their standards. They don't care if the ""reasonable accommodations"" are such that no employer would hire you when they can hire someone who is less trouble, as to them that is a matter for ADA and the courts. If theoretically you could work if the employer would allow you the accommodations, your aren't considered ""disabled"" by their standards. 

It's totally possible, and she would likely win her appeal eventually. She's right about how hard it would be though.

I don't agree that this is a situation of ridiculous injustice.    


  
It seems perfectly reasonable to have to buy tickets far in advance for big shows (no matter what your mobility status).     
It seems reasonable to sell companion seats without vetting purchasers.  (Especially because most of the time people buy those seats knowing that they may need to give up that seat if someone needs it for it's intended purpose.)   
 It seems reasonable for it to fall to PWD to ask others who don't need the seat to move for people who do.    
For non-assigned seating, it seems reasonable for any movie goer to have to come early if they want to make sure they sit with their friends (and in a seating location that isn't horrible).    
   
  
Yeah, we have less seating options than able bodied people, but with a little planning and flexibility on our part, that really shouldn't be a problem.  If we want the same movie experience as everyone else we have to take the same responsibility as everyone else.

536,"I don't know what exactly you are looking for.  I can tell you the biggest problem I have when dealing with other people in general.

People nearly always fail to fully grasp the idea of *uneven ability* and *presumption of competence*. They also commonly mistake a difference of perspective as a lack of rationality or competence. 

You can't know what someone can't tell you unless you look hard. Most people don't, even some parents miss signs of hidden competence. People get the stereotype of the kid doing advanced theoretical physics, but can't tie his shoes. Fewer know of the man who can't talk and whose body language is so far from normal no one sees his attempts to communicate as anything more than more stimming/weirdness of his ""usual sort"". 

Or the woman in the NICU trying not to cry, who lost her words from stress and has to sit there listening to nurses asking her husband if he'd like to look into residential options for her, and if she knows how to shower and eat by herself while he tries to explain she's not retarded before she can go see her baby.

You can't see what goes into the apparently ""irrational"" decision a person is making. 

Why would a *sane* person refuse to see a doctor about a mild concern with an easy cure, but a time difference of several days with prescription versus several months of careful home care, especially when they *know* they have executive functioning skills and it will be a large burden on them to keep up with home care? 

I went through 14 years of misdiagnosis and mistaken treatment. I lose the ability to talk around doctors. I go from almost fully verbal to the communication ability of a toddler. It's not far after that to go fully non-verbal and overload/meltdown. That simple prescription run or checkup could cost me everything if that doctor thinks it's in my best interest to insist on further investigation into the question of my competence. The ER is worth it only if I risk slow death, the doctor only if it can't be treated at home. The ER isn't even worth it for quick death for me. No sense in saving me from a quick death for the life of suffering if my parents could sue for custody of an incompetent. 

I don't really want to explain that to the person pressuring me to get some bug bites checked out. I very much dislike people implying that since I can('t) do *X*, I *must* be (in)capable of *Y*. 

I know this is not anyone's fault. These kind of assumptions seem to happen naturally for people. I just think that this is where some of the most horrific things that still happen to disabled people most often originate, and that it is a good thing to keep in mind.

I see what you mean about the regulation that would get in the way of an agency being able to approve your care. As I've learnt over the last few weeks, having an agency doesn't necessarily provide that much more stability anyway.  

What's your relationship like with your full time carers and your back ups? Is this something you could have an open discussion about and express how worried you are? I know you said they can't work more than 40hr weeks but they will have lots of insight into your life and may have ideas as to how to approach an emergency situation? Might also be worth trying to get the backups to provide their class schedule for March as soon as they can so that you at least have info on when theyre definitely not available.

If not, you may find it difficult to find funding support, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

If you do have medicaid, I would ask your doctor's office to help you. I know medicaid does provide some respite/home health care, but I don't really know the details. 

There may be agencies that work directly with medicaid to provide these workers. If it is up to you to find a person and then medicaid will pay for it, I would try local colleges that have nursing, physical/occupational/speech therapy, or special education as majors.

Bipolarity, Autism, OCD, blindness, Deafness, psychological disability, in general, ADHD, Tourette's, obesity, etc. are used as insults in one way or another, sometimes against people without that disability and sometimes against the people with that disability.

It boils down to a lack of respect for disabled people. We need to accept (whether or not the disabled person likes their disability) that disability is a fact of life that, if you don't die prematurely, will happen to you in one way or another if it hasn't happened already.

562,"u/ TroubleHoldingOn, I would recommend freelancing. If you have access to a computer (public library) than you can freelance by offering some sort of service (writing, graphics design, whatever your talent is). It's really hard to build a reputation, but you just gotta push through it and work at it like any businesss. Like all freelance sites, a commission is taken off &amp; you do have to wait for each transaction to come through. Keep in mind its very nontraditional in terms of work hours; you're  offering your services to the globalized world of the internet, after all. There are many nights where I have stayed up late working on projects! 

Surviving with a disability is hard because no matter what you'll always be on a fixed income, but over time you get used to it. You learn tips and tricks to stretch every dollar. For me, it keeps me focused in that I feel that I am less of a material-person in the society we live in today. Even from the time I was a kid, I never really had much so I don't feel like I miss much, you know? If I have nice things it's because I got them as gifts from family or friends. Back when I was employed, I tried to be just as generous as these friends (as few as they were) had been to me, but now my situation has changed because I'm in school &amp; can't work. Still, my expenses in life haven't changed, but I try to stay positive. 

If you can, get in touch with a local organization in your area. They may be able to guide you more specifically in what resources you are seeking. I would definitely use the time your friend has offered you a place to stay to look for ANY and ALL work. Everyday, make it your mission to be at at your local workforce commission's job fair. Go to interviews and be on the look out for anything job-related. If you go somewhere always as if they are hiring! Ideally, you should never walk out the door without copies of you resume in hand ready to go. You never know who you might meet so treat everybody you meet like they might be a potential employer!

- Don't make assumptions about level of ability.

- Being friendly and having a good relationship with your client is one thing, the client may not want to talk all the time or want to know all about your personal life (this is absolutely nothing to do with you as a person). Boundaries are important! 

- If you assist them socially be cool with it but careful not to take over in social situations.

- Trust (depending on disability) that your client really does know how to best do things, they also don't necessarily have to explain why they want things done a certain way. As you become more experienced it's ok to occasionally suggest ways you think tasks could be improved to make things easier for the client but always ask what they think first.

- Respect the individual, their privacy, their lives and the difficulties they might face on a daily basis.  You are there to assist the individual to gain control over their lives, not to control their lives.

- Be positive, be dynamic, pay attention to detail and show that you're really listening.

I'm a male amputee and I've never had any issues with dating or relationships.  But, I think a big part of that is my attitude and I take care of myself.  My number one priority is me and my recovery. It's been nearly eighteen years, but in my mind I have to continue to improve.  The relationships are a by product of that.  I've had some bad relationships, and some good ones.

Rejection is just part of the dating scene for dudes, amputee or otherwise, we develop a thick skin for it.  Have I experienced more now that I'm an amputee?  No.  Only because i find the amputation tends to keep the superficial women away.  I'd say 99% of the women I've encountered are positive, happy, women with a healthy curiosity about me and what I've achieved. The other 1% are gold diggers or into really kinky stuff.

I feel for women who have disabilities as they're more likely to be generalized as weaker, or in need of rescue.  Which isn't a good foundation for a healthy relationship.  You may have to develop a sense for identifying this in the people you choose to date.

He is not working (because of his disability) and I am just getting back to regularly working. Luckily I have managed to keep my job. I suffer from chronic daily migraines and narcolepsy, so I have my days I am not well too. 

We get a LOT of help. We go to the food pantry weekly. We go each week to a little community dinner that is free, that is for people who are struggling like us. Our families help tremendously, but even they are getting stretched thin. Our church has been such a blessing. They have paid our mortgage and utilities several times. We also work with two local charity organizations that set us up with a variety of kinds of assistance. One was a frozen meat food pantry, a cleaning supply charity, and a personal care charity. 

We made a GoFundMe page, which helped so so much. We were overwhelmed with people's generosity. 

My dads cousin actually created a foundation to help underprivileged kids get to preschool, and our daughter began preschool today thanks to the foundation. 

Obviously everything depends on what is available in your area. Most of the assistance we rely on is all local. We get no food stamps or welfare. 

As much as I hate to say this, even if you aren't religious, take advantage of the free meals that churches offer. We have a ""coffee hour"" after church every Sunday but it can be as little as a breakfast casserole or as much as a full brunch depending on who is providing it. They also serve dinner at ladies night every other Thursday, so it's one more meal I don't have to worry about. More often than not, I go to church for the food. I love my church and am very involved in many aspects, but the food gets us there. 

Sometimes I have as little as $20 a week to use towards food. I shop at Aldi because that's where I get the best deals. If I don't shop there, I only use coupons. 

One thing you could do is figure out what kind of things you are capable of. Could you clean houses for money?  Could you be an after school nanny just for a few hours a day until parents get home from work?  What about a dog walker or someone who checks on animals while people are away?  Try to find things that you can do that are low energy and at your own pace. If it's house cleaning I wouldn't charge by the hour but by the room, since it may take you longer, or maybe consider a flat fee for every service.

607,"People often buy tickets separately, so perhaps the theater did not want to ""bundle"" companion tickets with handicap spots. Also, a friend in a wheelchair actually sits in the theater seats and just parks his chair next to the seat. So he could be viewed as someone just buying a companion ticket. It just seems that it may be complicated for the ticket issuer to make sure that those who need these seats are given a preference. 
    
On that note, however, I think it would be REALLY simple to include a CAPITAL, in BOLD disclaimer for anyone purchasing companion seats which says that if they are not disabled or accompanying a disabled person, they may be required to move to accommodate a disabled person. That way, you can buy a ticket as long as tickets are still available and then just show up at the theater.

It also implies that Disabilities are medical conditions like you say a person has cancer, but you don't say a person has homosexuality. It is also why I don't call Autism, ""ASD"" or Bipolarity, ""Bipolar disorder"" (although for OCD, ADHD, etc. there aren't good alternatives).

The trouble here is, Fandango doesn't care what seats are what (well that's putting it strongly -- they don't go around inspecting every theater and classifying every moviegoer, that's all). Regal at Destiny does not have handicapped seating -- it has handicap spaces where you can park a chair (these were my home for several years). Other theaters I've been to have both, or just seats (you park your chair in the open spot and one of the seats, for the ticket you bought, goes unsat). 

I don't know if it's a fire code thing, or a Destiny thing, or a Fandango thing, or what. 

Here's what I do know -- reserving one seat for companions won't help MUCH. It would totally cover your situation for Star Wars -- but what about when I took the whole family out for Django Unchained? Is the theater supposed to sit on five seats in case I roll up? **At some point**, and I am **NOT** making any guesses at which, this becomes an unreasonable burden.

A nation-wide phenomenon like Star Wars 7 is one of those situations. Understand -- people would sell their children to get into a theater on opening night. Destiny IMAX is *still* sold out round-the-clock. They have to let those tickets go -- maybe not IMMEDIATELY, but eventually, yes, it has to happen.

648,"Before I get into SSI and SSDI, I'd recommend checking to see what vocational rehabilitative services are available in your state that may be able to help you keep working. In the state of Connecticut, for example, there is the Bureau of Rehab Services. They provide various services and accommodations to help you keep working such as home or vehicle mods. There are other services they provide as well, but the main ones I've been trying to get help with personally are the mods.

In regards to your transportation situation, if you can't drive or take the bus, you should be eligible for your state's paratransit services. It's a door to door shared ride service for people who can't take the bus due to a disability. As long as you live not too far from a bus route, they will be able to pick you up.

Now, you could get SSI if you literally cannot work at all. However, SSI is very draconian. It's purely based on financial need. If you live with anyone, or have any income whatsoever, they'd deduct it from your SSI benefit. You could only have up to 2k in savings with them as well. SSI, if I'm not mistaken, could at most be $733 per month.

If, however, you worked enough in the past, you would have enough work credits to be eligible for SSDI, which is far better. It tends to pay more than SSI, and they don't constantly monitor your funds and income as much as for SSI.

Also, a word of advice, when trying to apply for any of these programs, they will try to discourage you from applying by saying you're not eligible. Do your own research beforehand and be assertive with them. At the very least, you'll be able to get a meeting with some kind of caseworker hopefully. Also, from what I heard, most applications for SSI/SSDI tend to be rejected on the first try. If you do get rejected, reapply and get a lawyer.

You are, technically, disabled. But you're not necessarily significantly impaired by your disability.

Anyway, I'm in a power wheelchair, on a ventilator, with pretty bad speech. A lot of people don't know how to react to me, it feels like. Just talk to me like I'm anyone else. My reading and writing abilities are/were above average, but being treated as mentally handicapped is a frustrating, common experience. Don't do that ;)

If you don't understand my speech, please don't act like you know what I said or try to brush me off. Everyone has their own solution to speech... Mine is to start off talking and, when you can't understand me, either pull out my tablet to use as a speechboard or write what I said on paper. But I prefer speaking; it's faster, generally easier, and more ""natural."" One great tactic is telling me where in the sentence you misunderstood, as it lets me (and you!) focus on repeating one word or one part. 

Other than that, I don't need many accommodations or help beyond the typical wheelchair ones (door buttons, lower books, etc.). I use computers with ease...
