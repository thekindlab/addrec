13,"Wheelchair Sports Coach here:

As a person who has been using a wheelchair for my entire life, I would suggest that you don't use gloves if you are going to be in a wheelchair for the long run.  If this is a temporary situation where you are going to not need the chair after a certain period of time, then I would suggest that you go ahead and use the gloves.

If you are going to be using the chair for a long time and its going to be an integral part of your life, then I would suggest that you get rid of the gloves and start strengthening up your hands.  Also, as someone else mentioned, you should also start looking into getting a wheelchair thats better suited for your needs.  The wheelchair in your photo is a hospital chair where its designed to fit anyone and withstand a large amount of weight.  Also, its designed to have someone be able to push you from behind so the main wheels are a little bit farther back which makes it harder to push.  plus the tires are solid rubber and your chair wont move as nicely as it would on tires that are full of air.

Wheelchairs are generally designed to fit a persons waist width, and leg lengths ( from waist to knee and from knee down).  This maximises the push that one can get and makes for easier maneuvering.  They are made with lighter materials ( ranging from Aluminum to Titanium) and are designed so they can be broken down ( wheels taken off, seat folds down) and easily be carried and fit into a trunk of a car.

If you are in the chair for the long run, then you might want to look into some adaptive sports which will keep you active and thus, help maintain your physical mobility throughout the rest of your life.  Some examples of Adaptive sports are:  Rugby, Tennis, Archery, Basketball and Cycling.

When someone is new to using a wheelchair, I often tell them to get in the chair and go to the store.  Learning to maneuver their chair around curb cuts, through grass, pavement, dirt, carrying items, balancing things on your lap are all skills that will help you in the long run, and the sooner that you adapt to these skills, the better off you will be.  Plus it will constantly strengthen your hands and shoulders.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

1.  Do you need VR to pursue college?  If you are seeking VR to pay for it, then we will have asked if you have applied for the Federal Pell Grant first.  Most folks who are low income will be approved or this.  VR expects you to use all comparable benefits first.  

2.   Have you been in treatment for you mental health consistently and following your treatment plan? This is one thing VR would look for as far as being stable for work or school.  

3.  Most folks no matter what the disability don't require VR services to purse school.  We are typically used once you finish school to help with job placement or accommodations.  Not to say we never sponsor college for applicants however not always.  If you receive SSI then you haven't worked enough to earn credits for SSDI.  This is typical for young people.  If you are 25 or under, your chances for VR supporting college is more likely because you are more likely not to have any work history.  This plays to your benefit because if you have transferable skills which you have learned from another job, then we cannot support college.  

I hope this helps and good luck!",,,,krrasor,,,1443488676,t5_2qhe8,t3_3mrdh1,t3_3mrdh1,4,1444640490,0,0,cvhkimx,disability,4,,,,

No one has to fight for 3 years unless they have very little medical proof of a disabling condition. #4 A MS diagnosis is not considered a disability. She would have needed to have over a year of documented symptoms which prevented her from doing ANY TYPE of work, before it being considered disabling.

59,"You've touched on a couple of different topics that are separate yet related. 

First, as for SSDI, typically with any brain injury/CVA/TBI adjudication cannot take place for at least 3-6 months after the incident as this is when the most improvement is seen and one can get a good sense of life moving forward. If you apply before the 3 month mark the case gets put into ""medical hold"" until that time which just basically puts ""pause"" on the application until then. So if this is a very recent thing you don't need to apply *right away* but I would still get the ball rolling. 

now, your guardianship question. I would get that settled PRIOR to you applying for SSDI for her. Guardianship is determined by the state and has nothing to do with SSA. However, guardianship papers are looked upon very favorably by SSA and it really is the only way to ensure that you will be able to do all of the SSA application business, sign for her, etc without any issue. If she is still married but separated then you should be able to get guardianship for her. If the husband fights you on it (which I can't think of why as there is no real incentive) then you'll have to go to court and a judge will determine the best person to be her guardian (and if she really needs one).  You would need to contact a local family law attorney for help with this (or if she is in some sort of rehab facility/hospital they should have a social worker that can help).  If you are her guardian then typically, by default, they will set you as her payee for benefits should she get approved.

61,"Thanks for the thoughtful post. In regards to internships, I have tried. Most of the jobs I applied to were internships and I didn't meet the minimum qualifications to work for them. Now that I've graduated most internship listings require you to be still be a student currently enrolled, which I no longer am. This is because companies only receive certain tax incentives if they give you college credit, etc.

I've been trying to downplay my disability in much of the way you suggested for the last year or so. The Department of Labor has new standards that require federal contractors to hire roughly 7% of their workforce within the disabled pool. I've been trying to take advantage of that by self identifying and downplaying my functional limitations (I do have some functional limitations as well but they aren't relevant for this field of employment.).

In regards to being under qualified, that's somewhat intertwined to my disability issues. I knew about halfway through completing my program I wasn't going to be employable since the internships I applied to were all rejected on that basis. As I explained MRS discouraged me from transferring to another school on the basis that they would help me finish up my training elsewhere. When I say discourage, I want to clarify they were going to cut me from the program if I did not return to this university and finish my degree. From what I understand they have certain goals they need to meet by certain deadlines and my leaving would have taken them off track. This is the only rational I can come up with for why they pushed me into finishing a degree that wasn't going to find me employment. 

Additionally, MRS has done literally nothing to help me find internships as you suggested. They claim to have business relationships with thousands of companies, yet when I ask for help finding an internship the best they can do is send me random links on SimplyHired that 90% of the time I don't qualify for. When I did get a job interview for an internship four years ago I asked for help with practice interviews because I have social anxiety, this was denied. I recently had a phone interview for a full time job at a university and asked for a practice interview for the same reason, it was also denied. I've asked for help writing a resume and not once, but twice, I was sent to individuals who straight up told me they only help low functioning autistic children get jobs at McDonald's (I'm not even kidding, they volunteered this information without me even prompting it.).

Honestly, I'm not sure what the problem is with the job application process. I suspect some of it is likely under qualifications, since I have been told that on a number of occasions. I suspect some of it has to be that I live in a rural area and no one wants to hire an intern from halfway across the county when they can hire locally. However I do know that a large part of it is tied to my disability. 

My disability prevents me from doing low skill jobs like retail or manual labor. Which means I didn't have saved up money to own a car in high school, college, or even now. It also means I lack work experience, which could also be a barrier. That's the most glaring example I can think of right now but there are many systematic problems that have become extra barriers because of my disability that someone else would not face. 

This is all tied together, and that was why I felt it was better to post about it here and not elsewhere. I have tried asking more specific questions regarding help learning the skills I need for employment on subreddit's geared towards those topics. However I can't ask members on those forums about finding resources for the disabled.

I don't know if she would qualify for SSI, because I don't know the income limits. Right now, I bring home $500 a week after taxes and insurance. This is why I am hoping she would qualify for Medicaid or CHIP or something, to alleviate that financial strain. She will need those services on an ongoing basis. I don't think she has failed to meet milestones, though. She is actually at the top of her class still, grades are good, no behavior problems, etc. She does have some physical limitations caused by the blindness but I don't know how quantifiable they are, as she is cognitively sound. It sounds like they would want to see that she is failing in some way to qualify. I wouldn't need SSI for her if she was able to get state health insurance to cover some of the gaps in coverage. Anyway, it sounds like I need to look at DCF for that instead of SSI, correct?

I know those doctors were included on the application and appeal. It could be that the doctors' offices didn't respond until we hired a lawyer, and they scapegoated the SSA, claiming SSA never contacted them until we had a lawyer. Our lawyer, however, has collected all the medical records so I don't imagine this will be a problem in the next phase, so fingers crossed it goes more smoothly. 

I thought only total blindness was considered an automatic allowance, I didn't realize 20/400 was as well. It's good to know that even if she doesn't qualify now based on the household income, she can try getting it with what sounds like relative ease when she enters adulthood.

First of all, I'm really sorry you are going through this. I can relate and it really is absolutely exhausting. You really have to work out how to manage your energy. Some people use the spoon system. I just balance out things that help me restore myself versus things that lay me out so that I don't over commit. 

I highly recommend picking up a copy of Dr Margaret Caudill's book, 'Managing Pain Before it Manages You'. It's a nice little roadmap for living a fulfilling life despite chronic illness. It's an easy read, but full of valuable pain management skills. I would grab a fuzzy blanket and read it over the weekend :) 

I think it's really good that you are still pursuing better treatment and possibly a more accurate diagnosis. But no matter what you have, your pain and symptoms are real. You have to fortify your mind and body to cope with pain, make sure that you living realistically, protect your immune system, etc. 

I very much hope you will feel better soon. Knowing your body,  accepting what it needs (ahem, rest?), and following through is a solid first step :)

As far as school is concerned, consider just taking one class at a time and then building up to more classes if you can physically handle it. You will get worse instead of better if you put too much pressure on yourself. There is no reason to set yourself up for failure of any kind. There is nothing wrong with taking longer to graduate even if it goofs up your initial life plans. If you don't take care of yourself, it will mess your plans up further, so out your health first and everything else second :) 

Also try to take classes during your ""best"" part of the day. See aside scheduled rest before and after class/es. Consider talking to a clinical psychologist and doing some CBT work for pain management. 
There are lots of tips/tricks/treatments that might make your life better and it sounds like overall you are doing a great job pursuing them. Just don't push yourself too hard. Life is no competition- just enjoy :)

99,"I was able to get SSDI without a lawyer (with help filling out forms from family) on the first try.  That said, I have some pretty profound brain and nerve damage which is quantitatively measurable. And I've heard that getting SSDI for mental illness is an entirely different kettle of fish.

First, I'll definitely let you know that you're not alone with the anxiety!  I don't have anxiety as a diagnosis, but the process can be stressful and feel confusing.  It is purposely designed to be very thorough in order to reduce fraud.  Going through all the questions and hoops can be overwhelming, particularly for someone with reduced ability (just about everyone applying, of course).

Second, you will definitely need a current, supportive doctor on your side when doing the application.  Aside from needing up to date medical records, part of the evaluation is reliant on a patient complying with ongoing treatment plans.  Which means current doc with current plan.

Third, I recommend searching for a disabilities services office/organization in your current city.  This is not the Social Security office, but an office that is there to help disabled people find serviced.  They can often help fill out forms, give tips, and help out in other ways. They may also be able to refer you to a low-cost doctor.

I actually do *not* recommend that you use the online application.  I found it much easier to print off an application, then you can write out a draft, mark it up, skip a question and put a little post-it flag to go back later, even take a break for a few days, etc.  In the online application, it was much easier to get stuck on a question and just give up, then feel lost about getting back to some web page ten questions deep.  With paper, just mark it and skip it.  You can fill out one question a day, or whatever works for you.  And if you really want to do online at the end, then you can just copy from the written version.

Another alternative is, if you're okay on the phone, do a phone application/interview with your local SSDI office.  This might be a good alternative for you if you have agoraphobia, but need to talk to a live SSA agent to ask questions.  Just call them and tell them you want to apply.  They'll schedule a phone appt and send any supporting documents to your house.  You will not have to leave except for dr appts.

For a detailed walkthrough, honestly, the process is a little different for every applicant.  Some people apply online, others by paper, and others in person...some applicants get sent for second opinions (sounds like this happened to you last time? I think that was actually a good sign, wish you'd gotten to go), some don't...  

If I were you, I'd do this in this order: start by contacting a local disability service office and describe your situation, get a recommendation for a local doc, set up an appointment with that doc and see if they're supportive, if they are then initiate an SSDI application using the method you prefer.

Also, if the anxiety is so bad that even applying is beyond your ability, I recommend getting a lawyer to help. AFTER getting a new doc, though, because chances are the lawyer will insist you do that first so they can make the case.  There are federal limits on how much a lawyer can charge you, and it is a percentage of your back benefits.  If you're unable to do the initial application yourself, it is worth getting help.

And if you really want to do online at the end, then you can just copy from the written version.

Another alternative is, if you're okay on the phone, do a phone application/interview with your local SSDI office.  This might be a good alternative for you if you have agoraphobia, but need to talk to a live SSA agent to ask questions.  Just call them and tell them you want to apply.  They'll schedule a phone appt and send any supporting documents to your house.  You will not have to leave except for dr appts.

For a detailed walkthrough, honestly, the process is a little different for every applicant.  Some people apply online, others by paper, and others in <URL>me applicants get sent for second opinions (sounds like this happened to you last time? I think that was actually a good sign, wish you'd gotten to go), some don't...  

If I were you, I'd do this in this order: start by contacting a local disability service office and describe your situation, get a recommendation for a local doc, set up an appointment with that doc and see if they're supportive, if they are then initiate an SSDI application using the method you prefer.

Also, if the anxiety is so bad that even applying is beyond your ability, I recommend getting a lawyer to help. AFTER getting a new doc, though, because chances are the lawyer will insist you do that first so they can make the case.  There are federal limits on how much a lawyer can charge you, and it is a percentage of your back benefits.  If you're unable to do the initial application yourself, it is worth getting help.

125,"I filed for disability when I was 18 years old, reasons: agoraphobia, general anxiety disorder, major depression. I was accepted on my first application, I believe it took 3 months. I could be wrong.

I believe the following things helped me make it through:

- My sister and mother both wrote separate, highly detailed accounts of how my disability effected my life (I believe there are forms that are given to the applicant specifically for requesting family members opinions/observations) - check and make sure if I am right about this, my mother told me that was important once when I asked how lucky it was that I got through.

- I had a history of depression and anxiety starting at the age of 9, medical records going back 9 years. You sound like you have quite a paper trail yourself.

- I made one suicide attempt a couple months prior to filing.

- I had at least one hour long appointment with a special psychologist who examines people for SSI - I do not recall the details of this encounter though, or what I said. Obviously our reasons for being disabled are very different - it could be that mental health reasons have different criteria for passing.

Honestly, when I tell people I got through on the first try, for having depression and anxiety problems, they all tell me it was a fluke, or somebody in the system felt sorry for me and pushed extra hard.

I wish you the best of luck, you sound like you are seriously disabled and in need of this assistance. I am trying to get off disability and work for the first time in my life. Perhaps, in some way, the universe will give us an exchange, and you can ""take my place"" and I can try and create a life for myself.

I am sorry for what you're going through and the anxiety you feel right now with all of this uncertainty. My feeling is that you will pass. It is only a feeling based on 'they are close to making a determination' - this sounds to me like they are taking considerations and not just tossing you into a rejection pile.

155,"So I'm aware this a week old but I see you haven't had any applicable replies yet. I now live in Edinburgh but was under WestMARC until about six months ago so I feel I can give you a decent perspective.

I will point out right at the start that within the UK, Scotland's wheelchair services are the best, and in my experience, having lived under four different Scottish Trusts, WestMARC are the best by a very long way. In one trust I lived in I was refused a chair at all and expected to be housebound. In England you're given something like £200 towards the cost of a chair which doesn't make a dent in the bucket. Everyone I've spoken to who uses WestMARC, including those who've been refused an active chair, finds them pretty reasonable considering the unideal circumstances they have regarding budgets etc.

To explain to you how WestMARC works. They have a budget like any other area of the NHS, and people are awarded a chair depending on where they rank on WestMARC's system. To be eligible for an active user chair you must 1. require it both indoors and outdoors and 2. have sufficient mobility to be able to control the chair without injury to yourself or others. It sounds like you cover 1, but not 2. Active user chairs are more tippy and you are more liable to injure yourself with one, so if you do not have or will in the near future lose the ability to have full control of your chair, you will not be awarded one. Some people have been given active user chairs by WestMARC only to have them downgraded when their condition deteriorates, because it's not considered safe to leave them with one. If your arms are going to start to fail soon, you wouldn't be considered a good candidate for an active chair as you could be a danger to yourself and others if you lose the control to move it safely. 

Now although you may be able to use it for a certain amount of time, giving a 2k chair to someone who may only use it for a year (by the time you've showed you can use it and it's ordered) would no doubt be frowned upon from a budget point of view. Yes it would be nice if they could hand out chairs to anyone who needed one for any length of time, but active user chairs are as you know very expensive. The expected life of one is about five years. You say you expect your life to be another two years, and presumably you'll start to lose function before your arms completely fail, and with that the ability to use the chair safely. So say a year of full use. That's not within WestMARC's budget. I'm surprised they'd give you an active chair at all, but I'm presuming you didn't tell them you plan to off yourself in a couple of years. Their active chairs are not all bulky and steel framed, but it may be that the only ones she considered suitable for you were.

Regarding the time frame, yes that sounds about the same as my experience. I had to go in repeatedly and show them that I could safely use an active chair, do jumps up kerbs, down kerbs, balance, go up and down ramps etc. Once I'd done that over a few months, my chair was ordered and I had to wait for it to be made up and arrive, which was another couple of months. If you have never used an active chair before I can see why this would take as long as nine months, especially if you have a deteriorative condition. I was around the seven month mark myself. 

Regarding prescriptions, it's possible you just got someone who's never had to deal with that before. Everyone I know who's used WestMARC has either gotten an active chair or taken the non-active chair recommended to them. I suspect she just hadn't encountered a situation like yours before and didn't know anything about it. The NHS is not infalliable and I can't really blame her for not knowing much about a private service.

I have an active user chair via WestMARC and no, it is not my ideal chair, but it works and gets me about which is a lot better than before. A LOT of people buy their chairs privately, NHS wheelchair services are chronically underfunded. Scotland is the only place you will get any type of wheelchair fully funded. The only bit where I can see she didn't listen to you and gave you wrong info was regarding getting a private wheelchair, which I mentioned above. If I went to my GP and asked about a private service I bet he'd have no idea either, so as I said I don't think that's an unreasonable point of confusion.

163,"Self-employment with SSDI is extremely complicated so there is no ""yes"" or ""no"" answer that we will be able to give you. Generally speaking, if you aren't working at all (perhaps like a silent partner) then it is not considered work activity. 

However, if you are involved in the business at all, even if you are paying yourself less than SGA amounts it can be considered SGA. Most people don't realize that you can be declared doing substantial work even if your earnings are low. As an owner you are in the position to conceal/deflate your income which can be considered fraud/similar fault by SSA. If your involvement in the company is the same as before but you just pay yourself less in order to qualify that is a big 'no-no'. 

So really it has nothing to do with how your company is structured using an IRS-type framework. SSA is going to look at how much involvement you have in the day-to-day operations and whether that can be considered substantial work.

That's what I said. And it can be no more than some amount of back pay. 18 months I think. That is, if you apply 2 years after you become disabled you get for all the 2 years minus the 6 months. If you apply 3 years after you still only get the 18 months.

To simplify the question, yes, you do need a diagnosis/reason for pain complaints for SSDI purposes. However, even if they do not know the exact cause of your pain your failed back/radiculopathy is a ""medically reasonable"" link to your pain. You could have developed CRPS from it.

I am married so there is that, even if we have grown apart over 15 years and don't talk much. I find that the more disabled I become the harder it is for me to connect to able bodied people and I often find socializing leaves me feeling sucked dry since they have no interest in my actual life but just want to dump their problems on me, or just talk about themselves. I agree, it seems to not be worth it to me anymore and has gotten to the point that my socializing interest is almost zero now. So I guess I arrived at my isolation partly by choice.

194,"Hi there,


Thank you very much. You've added plenty! It really helps to have some support and direction. It seems easy to end up on the wrong websites for this. And as luck would have it I am indeed a Hoosier.


I can't really say much about lung/live issues. My dad's rather healthy and comes from a long-lived family. My mom has smoked since for about 40 years now but she is amazingly quite a bit better in the lung department. She does have emphysema and a much lighter form of chronic bronchitis but she can take Nyquil and such for hers. She never hurts herself or gets sick from coughing and she doesn't have to miss work to recover.


I have several siblings but they're more or less fine. One brother has sleep apnea but he lives a very unhealthy lifestyle, smokes, and if I remember right the apnea came on after he became increasingly overweight. I don't think he's ever been awake when it affects him, either.


I think I saw something in what I was reading about Alpha-1 COPD, but I figured it'd be costly. I'll definitely look into it now.


I don't really have any specific questions at the moment. I've been this way for so long and my mom and doctors have seemed to always just toss inhalers or cough suppressants at it that I never even researched it thinking there was no more to it.

Thank you very much. You've added plenty! It really helps to have some support and direction. It seems easy to end up on the wrong websites for this. And as luck would have it I am indeed a Hoosier.


I can't really say much about lung/live issues. My dad's rather healthy and comes from a long-lived family. My mom has smoked since for about 40 years now but she is amazingly quite a bit better in the lung department. She does have emphysema and a much lighter form of chronic bronchitis but she can take Nyquil and such for hers. She never hurts herself or gets sick from coughing and she doesn't have to miss work to recover.


I have several siblings but they're more or less fine. One brother has sleep apnea but he lives a very unhealthy lifestyle, smokes, and if I remember right the apnea came on after he became increasingly overweight. I don't think he's ever been awake when it affects him, either.


I think I saw something in what I was reading about Alpha-1 COPD, but I figured it'd be costly. I'll definitely look into it now.


I don't really have any specific questions at the moment. I've been this way for so long and my mom and doctors have seemed to always just toss inhalers or cough suppressants at it that I never even researched it thinking there was no more to it. Neither doctor ever mentioned most of what you have or what I've found myself.

We know that even with pain meds a person has restrictions based on their condition. The more we see people trying new meds, treatments, etc the more believable that persons statements are. one way that people try to fraudulently get benefits (to be clear I'm not suggesting you) is to avoid treatments in order to make themselves appear worse. 

To your original question there is no way to give you a guess without your records. There are SO MANY factors that go into a determination. There are lots of objective criteria that you must meet but really almost all cases are a judgment to a high degree. 

On a personal note, if narcotics work for you and help control your pain then by all means utilize them. The more functional you are the better for your overall well-being.

212,"Wow, have you gone through the process?  Because my experience was not like this at all.  Specifically this statement makes no sense to me.

&gt; A doctor cannot determine if you can work. They can only render the diagnosis.

A critical part of the application is at least one current doctor evaluating your overall abilities and how they relate to your ability to do any sort of work.  Yes, the doctor provides a diagnosis, but they can also provide an evaluation of how your diagnosis effects your [ADLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living), which is a critical part of what the SSA uses to make their determination.  I suspect this is even more critical in a mental health case than one that involves obvious physical injury.

It is true that more *good* evidence helps your case.  So four doctors supporting you is better than one, but it actually isn't critical if your disability is measurable.  That said, more isn't always better, particularly if there are conflicts in what different doctors say.  Muddying the waters is detrimental overall.

I have no idea where the 90 days thing is coming from.  That doesn't seem true at all.  Some states have huge backlogs, and that is just not how they work.  Also, if an applicant gets sent by the SSA to see a doctor, that increases the time.  It takes how long it takes.  If the applicant has a strong case, they'll get approved, they just have to jump through the hoops.

I also disagree with the hiring of a lawyer.  The only reason I was able to do it without is because I have very supportive family who basically did the work for me.  For applicants that don't have a strong support network, which isn't unusual as a lot of crappy people bail when you become disabled, the lawyer serves that role.  Also, they're very experienced with the process and can help if the applicant isn't capable of understanding all parts of the process.

Things like:
Maybe I could lift it but how far could I carry it?
Are there stairs?
What is parking like at the client's site?
What do I do when it snows?
and on, and on

I was constantly talking myself out of applying. But then I started asking for help. I would explain that I can do the mental labor, but the physical is a problem for me. And sometimes the response I got was ""we'll get back to you"" and sometimes the reply was ""We can work with you on that"".

Second, you should file for SSDI. You can do it in person at a Social Security office or you can file online.  [Be warned: The application takes hours (took me nearly 5) and you want to have EVERY piece of data lined up before you start:  Doctors' contact info, date when you were diagnosed, dates and locations of every test done.]

The process of filing for SSDI is long. It will be a few months before they start processing your application (it was 6 months for me) and then up to a year until they make their decision. *IF* you are turned down, you can then appeal - at that point, you'll want an attorney who specializes in social security claims.  They do not charge a fee up front; instead they take a cut from your initial payment (a lump sum of all monthly payments going back to when you first applied).

Note that if you do not qualify for SSDI (if you didn't work enough hours in enough time, likely), the application also automatically applies you for SSI.  SSI is a different program with stricter rules (you have a tighter limit on assets) and the payments are lower.

Next, you need to go to the nearest office of your state's ""Human Services"" (it's called various things in various states) - they're the folks who handle Medicaid and other things. They can see if you qualify for other things, like SNAP (food stamps) or state-based disability payments, and can help you look for *affordable* housing, where your rent payments are determined by your income.  You can also ask if they can assign a social worker to help you with your (local) case.  If you cannot go in person you should be able to call - and in some states, you can apply for things online and then they'll call *you*.

265,"I'm rather ""lucky"" (for a disabled person that is). My disability is a result of medical malpractice, so I was able to sue the doctor. So I actually own the house I live in. I live in the ground-entry suite and I have roommates who live upstairs. I rent it out for a meager amount (I could charge double what I am charging, but it's still enough to pay all the bills and have some money left over for me) and in exchange my roommates give me the part-time care I need for free. They save money on rent and I save money on caregivers. We all win. 

The downside is that I am 22. I've been living on my own now for just over a year and I'm already on my second set of roommates (a friend from high school and his wife), and they only plan to be here a year or so (and I kinda lucked out in finding them because my old roommates decided to go to school elsewhere). My friends are great, but no one has a clue what they want to do with their lives, so no one is set to settle down (in a way, I don't either, but I may be stuck).

275,"I also have a genetic disorder - there's a 50% chance that I pass it along and while it's not a particularly terrible disease (there's a very high chance that I'll need at least one transplant in my lifetime, and my dad is in the process of trying to get his second transplant now) I've definitely had the thought that bringing a child into the world with a high chance of an uncurable genetic disease is not a great gamble for me to take. 

So here are some thoughts I've collected over my life, in case some of them resonate with you or your partner. 

Technically, deliberately choosing not to have kids because they have ""bad genes"" is a form of eugenics. I would not say it's an unethical form of eugenics and it's definitely not on the level of permanently sterilizing or killing people because of their heredity, but it is a choice you're making because of human gene mutations. 

The reason this is important is that, while on the one hand life is not easy for people with disabilities, it won't get better if more and more people try to tip the balance toward genetically ""superior"" people. In fact, I would say that a hereditary disability is a better place to be, because at least you would have family members who know what it's like and you can learn from their experiences. So in some ways, bringing more people into the world with different abilities and perceptions increases human diversity and allows more people to interact with a disabled person, leading to overall tolerance and advocacy. 

I also think there are some important things to think about when it comes to adoption (and also to explore other means of having kids). It sounds like your partner may have some preconceived notion that raising an adopted child means that the child isn't ""his"" or is somehow different. Honestly, that's a really shitty attitude to have and I'm sure most people who were adopted would disagree. Depending on the exact circumstances, adoption can literally occur before a child is even born (the ""Juno"" scenario) and as far as anyone knows, the child is indistinguishable from one you biologically brought into the world. It's understandable to have concerns about bonding when adopting older children (although in many cases this can still be extremely successful!) but there really is not much of a concern for infant adoption. 

Another possibility is surrogacy or egg donation. Since the genetic concerns are only on your side, your partner could contribute to fertilizing a donated egg which you could either carry (if you're willing to do so) or a surrogate mother could carry. That way, the child would still have his genetic material. If you have a relative who is *not* a carrier for your deafness genes, you could also potentially seek that donation and still have a more distant genetic connection to your child. Again, I want to stress that genetic connection is not the be-all-end-all, but if that is an important factor for you or your partner, it is an option. 

There are also some tests available for some genes (depending on whether your genetic mutation has been mapped) in fertilized embryos, so you could selectively implant only embryos that do not have the mutation. This process is really expensive right now and generally not covered by insurance, and there are some people who have ethical concerns (again, it is a mild form of eugenics and also the pro-life world feels that discarding fertilized embryos is unethical). But again, maybe an option. 

Finally, I would encourage you to have an open mind about your experience with deafness and your hypothetical future child's experience with the same. Actually, this really applies to all parents, not just those with genetic disorders. We all want our future children to live happier, better lives than what we grew up with. We want to shield them from pain and torment. And we are quick to highlight a few things about ourselves that led to our torment and pain growing up. 

I think this is an admirable goal, but it's also somewhat impossible. We can never ensure that a child, ablebodied or not, will be happy or have a good life. And we also can't be sure that something we see as a disability will necessarily be felt that way by our children. It is unfortunate that your experience with your deafness was not positive, and I really feel for you on that. But it's impossible to say whether your hypothetical future child will experience it the same way, and while the fear of the worst is normal, sometimes it is okay to push beyond that and just give it a chance.

So, Doc changed the prescription from service dog to therapy dog.

But yeah, even with a good support system it's normal to feel that way sometimes. Loneliness is part of depression and if you are dealing with really difficult stuff, there's a good chance you have some degree of ""clinical"" depression, which means it's not particularly based on what's happening externally in your life. Just try to remember that the loneliness/depression/fear/etc are just temporary feelings flowing through you and they aren't ""who you are"". If you keep working at finding solutions, you can still find happiness and peace despite where your physical health is at. It's not permanent. 

Try joining some support groups (online or local) of people going through the same kinds of disabilities you're going through. It might help. 

Also, keep trying new things to feel better physically even if it's outside your comfort zone.

320,"Thank you for the reply! It was very helpful to know there is a difference between a service animal and an emotional support animal, I am going to look up the difference after I post this. 

I am calling the psychiatrist who prescribed the animal for me today and I am going to ask a few questions, like did she mean for me to have an emotional support animal, or was she certain when she wrote 'service animal'. And I am going to ask for resources, phone numbers, and what she meant the animal to mean for me and my diagnosis.

She did make it very clear that the animal would be able to go with me *anywhere* - that this was what she wanted for me. And that it would be unlawful for my landlords to give me any harassment about it, since I live in a no-pet apartment.

I have strong fear in public, and I believe the service animal is meant to help prevent me from experiencing panic and anxiety by being a guardian, so to speak, but that is another clarification I'll need to make over the the phone. I am not sure at all what the animals function would *specifically* be in regards to my panic disorder and depression, but my goal for today is to find out.

330,"Not quite a similar situation but my dad suffered a brain injury in 2012. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. My family is in WI, and WI does not automatically grant medical power of attorney to spouses. My parents are married nearly 40 years at the point of this injury but we simply didn't know of the laws. You may have to check into your individual state laws. Good news is as family you may have more pull than her spouse. Does she have any adult children that could petition for her?

While in rehab my father was deemed incompetent. We had this done because the situation was very precarious for weeks, he could have passed or remained in a very fragile state, we just had no way of knowing. My mother also had to petition his family (my grand parents and his 8 brothers and sisters) so that she could obtain guardianship. Thankfully our family are all amicable so of course they agreed. 

She did not apply for disability on his behalf right away because we were unsure how much recovery he would make. He is also a veteran and was nearly of retirement age so we had to wait and see how all that unfolded. He ended up retiring and is now on medicare. 

Not sure of your sister's age but this could play a role. It sounds like your sister's condition is significant enough to apply for disability (I am also a special ed teacher), but it can be a long process. I would hope that her (ex?) Husband would fianalize a divorce simply for the relief of not being financially liable for your sister, but I am not sure where a divorce step would occur among all the other steps. 

Sidenote, I had a friend whose parents divorced because her mother had numerous mental illnesses as she aged and needed 24/7 care. Her dad had to divorce and she became a ward of the state. Again, this would probably be an option determined by state law. 

Anyway, my dad's condition improved enough that about a year later they had guardianship lifted. He was deemed competent, they went to court, etc. All in all it did cost my mom a few thousand dollars, mostly in attorney fees. For her the hardest part (as far as she told me) was balancing all the finances for my dad. She is knowledgeable about finances but the paperwork did overwhelm her because she had to separate all their finances and expenses which had been combined for decades. It may be a bit easier to monitor for your sister! 

Also my mother was under the stress of her life changing drastically from an equal partnership (in terms of household work load) to a care taker/spouse so that was difficult for her. Hopefully if you took guardianship of your sister it would be a bit more of a foreseen/predictable circumstance. I do tell my student's parents to get these items such as guardiaship and long term/residential care taken care of ASAP as it is better to do it in control and on your own terms rather than having it thrust upon you if the situation suddenly becomes urgent. 

If you have more questions I can try to find out more of what happened, but I would strongly recommend getting a lawyer asap and have them advise you on your options. Guardianship is very important, and I believe you can list a 2nd person if you are unable to carry out the duties involved. 

Another side note, if your parents are aging I would strongly recommend getting power of attorney over each other if you do not have it yet. My mother would have saved a lot of money had they been aware and done this in advance. My family now all have medical power of attorney established because we do not want to go through that again.

My mother also had to petition his family (my grand parents and his 8 brothers and sisters) so that she could obtain guardianship. Thankfully our family are all amicable so of course they agreed. 

She did not apply for disability on his behalf right away because we were unsure how much recovery he would make. He is also a veteran and was nearly of retirement age so we had to wait and see how all that unfolded. He ended up retiring and is now on medicare. 

Not sure of your sister's age but this could play a role. It sounds like your sister's condition is significant enough to apply for disability (I am also a special ed teacher), but it can be a long process. I would hope that her (ex?) Husband would fianalize a divorce simply for the relief of not being financially liable for your sister, but I am not sure where a divorce step would occur among all the other steps. 

Sidenote, I had a friend whose parents divorced because her mother had numerous mental illnesses as she aged and needed 24/7 care. Her dad had to divorce and she became a ward of the state. Again, this would probably be an option determined by state law. 

Anyway, my dad's condition improved enough that about a year later they had guardianship lifted. He was deemed competent, they went to court, etc. All in all it did cost my mom a few thousand dollars, mostly in attorney fees. For her the hardest part (as far as she told me) was balancing all the finances for my dad. She is knowledgeable about finances but the paperwork did overwhelm her because she had to separate all their finances and expenses which had been combined for decades. It may be a bit easier to monitor for your sister! 

Also my mother was under the stress of her life changing drastically from an equal partnership (in terms of household work load) to a care taker/spouse so that was difficult for her. Hopefully if you took guardianship of your sister it would be a bit more of a foreseen/predictable circumstance. I do tell my student's parents to get these items such as guardiaship and long term/residential care taken care of ASAP as it is better to do it in control and on your own terms rather than having it thrust upon you if the situation suddenly becomes urgent. 

If you have more questions I can try to find out more of what happened, but I would strongly recommend getting a lawyer asap and have them advise you on your options. Guardianship is very important, and I believe you can list a 2nd person if you are unable to carry out the duties involved. 

Another side note, if your parents are aging I would strongly recommend getting power of attorney over each other if you do not have it yet. My mother would have saved a lot of money had they been aware and done this in advance. My family now all have medical power of attorney established because we do not want to go through that again. 

Best of luck with any course that you choose with your family. ","[{'start': 121, 'end': 131, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

350,"I think that's a fair request on her part. I'm getting married in three weeks, and I can understand the anxiety. I think this is one of those situations where it'd be fine to buck tradition and have your wedding party seated in the front row without having them do a whole procession in. They're still present, they're still supporting you, and if it makes your sister more comfortable, so be it. If she's all right with being present, she should be fine with that. I know with our wedding, I've had to repeat time and time again that the words ""It's what most people do"" or ""It's traditional"" are not valid reasons for anything with regard to our wedding. 

In short, skip the parading of the bridesmaids and groomsmen, have them all seated for the whole ceremony. 

Now, pictures are another matter. Even if your sister isn't ""in"" the wedding, she's still probably going to be present, and you'll likely get your picture taken with your family members, regardless of which ones were playing a role in the ceremony itself. If she's so uncomfortable with her disability that she doesn't want to even be in pictures, I think you should try to honor her request but there might be a more serious coping issue at hand.

418,"First, how long ago did you get your award letter? Sometimes there are final calculations that need to be made with regards to your back pay sum and monthly checks going forward. Typically you should get your backpay within a few weeks unless there are some unresolved financial issues (or administrative issues) with your case.   DO NOT try to do a cash award advance loan. They will take a good chunk of your money and those are designed for people with monthly annuities not lump sums.  What you need to do is keep contacting SSA to find out if they need more information. There is a chance they are waiting for documentation from you, the judge, or a former employer.  You've gotten through all the hard parts of the process. you were approved when the vast majority of people aren't; you just need to hang in there a little longer. 

I know that you are frustrated, and I debated on whether to even say anything, but I'm going to. This is not just to you but others who lament about the speed at which disability cases are processed. There are literally HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of disability claims in various stages of processing at any given time. Medically right now, in the country, I would guess that there are probably about 100,000 currently waiting on medical decision at the first/second levels. That doesn't include cases waiting for hearings, waiting for financial eligibility, etc.  There are only so many workers to go around and we are all over-worked. Most of us not only do disability claims but post-adjudicative work as well. So on top of those 100,000+ claims we have to work on the millions of people's cases who are already on disability. Are all government workers great? Absolutely not. We are just like any other work environment. But to think that we all just sit around eating donuts and stalling work just because is unfair.

As for your question on working. Yes, you can work and be on SSDI.  If you haven't worked since you were granted benefits you are entitled to a ""trial work period"" of 9 months were you can earn as much as you want and still get your disability check. After that, you can't earn more than $1040 per month (this number goes up each year by about $20). As long as you are under the 1040 you're fine. If you go over for that month, you wouldn't be entitled to a disability check.  Now that is just a basic explanation.

460,"In the US, you are not required to say that you have a disability, anymore than you are required to mention your race or married status.  (It's a myth, mind you, that they cannot *ask* about these things. They can ask, but with things like race or marital status, they cannot use it to decide who gets a job - so most places avoid the issue by simply not asking.)

There are a few reasons why they might ask about disability. One is for a diversity issue (ex. saying ""X% of our applicants said they are disabled""), and, yes, there are some companies that give hiring preference to the disabled, recognizing that many qualified people don't get hired merely for a disability.  Another reason could be for identifying whether an applicant might need an accommodation for interviewing.  They also might be trying to short-circuit the issue of whether someone is actually capable of performing a job, but this can be an issue.

In the US, however, an employer cannot also not require you to state *what* your disability is.  They can ask, ""Are you capable of doing the duties of this job?"" and they can also require you to get a doctor to certify that you're able to do what's required.

482,"A few things:

You do not need a disability attorney until and if you are turned down.  There is nothing an attorney can do for you once the SSA starts evaluating your claim.    While the attorney will not ask for money up front, they'll likely tell you exactly what I just said.

I've read in the past that about 17% of applicants are accepted on the first try, although I've also heard up to 30%.  Of those who have to appeal, roughly half of those are accepted after that. Some people wind up appealing again.

First application acceptances typically come within 2 years (total).  I filed right at the front of the big wave of applications when the economy tanked in 2008.  Because of a lack of medical records (not my fault, and long story), the SSA paid for me to be evaluated by doctors of their choosing.  The evaluations were done roughly 6 months after applying, and it was just over a year until I got the first round notification (which, in my case, was an acceptance).

If you need to appeal make sure to get an attorney asap.  You have a limited amount of time (2 months, I think) to file your appeal, or you have to re-apply all over again.   It can be roughly a year until your hearing.  Because the hearings are done locally, the amount of time varies from place to place. 

If things are very difficult you might try applying for state-based disability.  In some states you can get assistance for being disabled; however, the payments tend to be very small and sometimes have to be paid back when you qualify for SSDI/SSI (which is typically done automatically).  If you're unable to work you may also qualify for Medicaid and other assistance, if you're not already on them.

498,"I'm sad that your experiences have led you to feel that way. My experiences have led to be believe otherwise (partly my own personal experiences, and partly from talking to my mother about how things used to be). 

This is an issue with a lot of different minority groups. Some of the progress is though that it is no longer socially acceptable to espouse those behaviours/attitudes. We do have a lot more allies who are onside with us. And yes, that does mean that the fight has gotten harder, because you have to work a lot harder to prove discrimination. Feminism is having that problem, the people fighting for racial equality in the western world are having that problem, and I'm sure others are as well. And we're still learning how to convince people, and it's not an easy thing. If you just yell at people and say how they're wrong and awful people then they tend to get more entrenched in their opinions. And that's difficult because we are right to feel angry and upset about it, so it's a delicate balancing act.

I'm not going to say things are perfect now, because they are far from it. But things have changed, and they are still changing. It is going to depend on where you live, and larger cosmopolitan areas tend to change quicker than the rural areas because of the visibility or lack thereof of different types of people (which is how you change minds, when you've never met anyone of a group and you're told things about them it's much easier to believe untrue things).

It's also hard to see changes on the day to day, and there are the differences between the day to day experience and the changes there, and the systemic changes. Sometimes you can get caught up in either. Systemic changes can take decades to see an overall effect, and day to day stuff may not affect anything systemically.

Anyway. Bit of a ramble. But the way we keep changing things? Keep speaking up, and keep learning from how you speak up. Figure out what works, and what doesn't work, try different things. Yes, if you point something out to 10 people only one person may change their mind/realize it's a problem, but that's still one more person on our side.",,,,themooninthesky,,,1442802282,t5_2qhe8,t3_3loqi7,t1_cv8kxi1,2,1444485896,0,0,cv8m0h7,disability,2,,,,

502,"First, childhood disability (DC) and adult disability (SSDI), while run by the same program, have very different ways of being evaluated. SSDI looks at whether that person is capable of working. DC claims look at whether the child has mental/physical impairments that cause ""marked and severe functional limitations"" which essentially boils down to developmental milestones. 

As for your two case studies, it is next to impossible to compare cases to each other. There are so many factors that go into a case. You mention that they never tried to get Spouse's records. Two things could have happened: either they got left off the first applications OR the letters/requests to the doctors were never received or processed (I would say in 75% of cases there is at least one medical source that will not send us the records and we can't force them to). 

It is also difficult to compare SSDI and DC claims because the criteria is so different. Adult cases are typically harder to be allowed on since proving that you cannot work is more difficult than proving severe functional limitations. A lot of it depends on the person's age, education, and what kind of work they've done before. 

As for questions 1-2--yes two people in the same household can receive benefits. The household will still be under the same income requirements.

He told me that no matter what he stands by me and when he said that he did not know if it was a dealbreaker, he had been overwhelmed by emotion and a little fear at the time but after his mind cleared, he realized that no matter what, we'll be a great team to our children. 

He also told me about his feelings on the donor egg, and how he prefers to have a kid that's half both of us (other than the 10% new genetic material during gestation but I digress haha). I actually brought it up 'cuz of your comment about it. So in the end, I said I don't think I'll be steadfast about only having adopted kids and I want to have biological children, at least one anyway and maybe one adopted kid too, but either way I changed my mind and am more than happy to have a bio kid now...

535,"I totally get what you're talking about. I'm 48/M and have had multiple chronic issues for years and have feel the same way. The bad news is that there are a lot of times that I still feel lonely but the good news is that it isn't all of the time and that I do manage to have a life. 

For me part of the issue with loneliness is that there is so much going on and so many pressures for me in just trying to do normal things from day to day that I feel like no one would understand or believe everything that I have to go through on a regular basis just to exist. The other is that I feel like if I open up to someone who can't relate that they'll be overloaded with what I have to go through or not get the effort involved and just say something like 'hey, just buck up and stay positive' not knowing that hearing that is just going to gut me emotionally because I would LOVE it if I could do that but that it's simply not an option in my circumstances.

I agree with midwestcreative, join a support group or get involved with someone or some organization. Believe me it helps. Over the years I have lost some friends that couldn't understand what I go through or just didn't get it. I also tried to throw myself into being as normal as I could at work which took up so much of my time and energy that I lost more of my friends from neglect. When it all caught up with me because I'm playing with a deck that's stacked against me I didn't have much of a support group left so I joined a choir because I love music and like to sing. It was the best decision I could have made. Being around other people that share a passion makes reaching out and talking easier.

It hasn't filled the void completely and I still don't really have a place to talk about all of the medical issues and the resulting psychological baggage that comes with them but I'm looking for a support group where unloading that type of burden is what it's all about.

I guess the bottom line is make lemonade. If you're stuck with this for life make it work for you. Don't kill yourself by trying to keep up appearances or doing what everyone else does. Instead reach out to other people that share your passions or conditions because they'll appreciate and understand you and what you're going though. They also may have a better way to cope or know someone who does. Just take the time to asses where you are and what you can do with what you've got and then apply it to something that you really love. It might not be easy but doing something you have a passion for helps and - it - will - get - better!

548,"Hey there- I'm sorry you are going through this. First off, I am in total agreement with u/RambleRamble and just wanted to add some notes. 

I don't know what kinds of doctors you have been seeing over the years, but either way, many doctors are very vague. ""I don't see anything wrong"" in Doctor speak often means they don't see something that needs to be surgically repaired or is obviously physically damaged. It doesn't mean you don't have serious nerve pain that can't be seen. 
Have you had nerve conduction testing? Spinal and brain MRI's? 
You will want to pull ALL of your medical records including test results and use them to plan your next move. When there is something chronic going on, you want to have it defined for you as clearly as possible so you can pursue good treatment as well as SSDI as necessary. Since you have not been properly diagnosed, you are probably not on an optimized treatment regiment. You want a record of said treatment record for SSDI as well. Otherwise they may presume you could get better with treatment and are therefore not yet eligible for disability. 

Pain itself can absolutely be a reason for disability hit it still needs to be well defined and treated. It also needs to be clear from your medical records how the pain impacts your life and ability to function. Seeing a psychologist for a period of time can be a great resource and they may be willing to write a letter of testimony for your SSDI case. 

Since you are clearly dealing with something chronic and most likely central nerve damage from your back injury, you may want to see a doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation. They are pros at helping people with chronic systemic issues, musculoskeletal problems, spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, pain disorders, etc. There might not be a simple surgery or quick fix for you, but there are lots of types of medications and treatments that can make your life better AND improve your SSDI case at the same time. 

All the best wishes- keep us posted?",,,,ponyfarmer,,,1442931016,t5_2qhe8,t3_3lxic8,t3_3lxic8,2,1444512881,0,0,cva6b1h,disability,2,,,,

It can often help you in your job search, but if you are not comfortable self-identifying as a person with a disability, you won't be forced to disclose as such. If you are hoping to begin a career path with the federal government, though, it would definitely serve to your advantage to self-identify on the form. Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act was amended to mandate that federal contractors and subcontractors implement a 7% utilization goal for people with disabilities. Also, if you require any accommodations on the job, self-identifying on the form would be a wise move. At any rate, an employer cannot legally ask you to disclose your specific disability; they can only ask if you are capable of doing the job at hand (with or without reasonable accommodation).
