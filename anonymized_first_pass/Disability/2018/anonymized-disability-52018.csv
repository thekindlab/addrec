16,"So your post is pretty vague, with more information I can give you more specific advice. Generally though, getting disability for a physical condition, at your age, is going to be extremely difficult. 

Disability is going to look at your medical condition, its impact on your functioning (despite treatment) and what vocational options would be available.

You say that you're on medication and it doesn't help - but what kinds of medications? pain meds only? what about muscle relaxers, SSRIs, gabapentin derivatives (nerve pain)? Have you had surgery or any other procedures (epidural injections, nerve blocks, etc)? SSA has to look at your condition *despite treatment* and one thing that you need to be considered disabled is be able to show that you've tried **everything** and it hasn't helped. 

Are you currently working? What kinds of jobs have you had in the past? Where they full or part time? How long did you last at each? You mention finding low impact employment - but what does that look like? Have you tried sedentary jobs? Did you go to college?

At your age, you likely haven't worked enough to qualify for SSDI (and if you have, its gonna be a real low amount). That means you can only qualify for SSI - which is the means tested program and pays, max $730ish per month. Not really enough to support yourself or have a good quality of life. Obviously if its an issue of homelessness vs SSI, do what you need to do to pay your bills.

As a fellow back pain sufferer, reasonable accommodations can be your best friend if you can find a flexible employer. Especially in an office type setting. Being able to switch from sitting to standing as needed, or getting up and walking around the building for a few minutes can really help.

This is because I will be moving soon for grad school – and Ohio does not have a residency requirement. The downside of course is that come tax time – there is no additional benefit for someone like me.

The point however is that you don't necessarily need to be a resident of a particular state program in order to take advantage of it.

It is correct that any money placed into it must be used for what is called Qualified Disability Expenses – or QDEs. However, the qualifications for what a QDE is is being kept deliberately vague. Because disability affects each individual differently.

Per the SSA website:

a QDE includes, but is not limited to, an expense for:

* Education;
* Housing;
* Transportation;
* Employment training and support;
* Assistive technology and related services;
* Personal support services;
* Health;
* Prevention and wellness;
* Financial management and administrative services;
* Legal fees;
* Expenses for ABLE account oversight and monitoring;
* Funeral and burial; and,
* Basic living expenses.
* The ABLE national resource center also list food expenditures as qualifying expenses.

As to the yearly contribution limit – that is supposedly adjusted year to year as the cost\-of\-living changes. Currently, in the Ohio program, I believe the year limit is $15,000.

As I have said, I have not withdrawn much money at this point. The small amount that I have used was used to pay for a replacement hard drive in my main laptop. Because I use the computer so extensively as a direct result of my disability – it counts as a technology related QDE.

As I understand it, if I were to use the money in that account to pay for housing, which is something that can be done \(see above\), the rules are slightly different.

134,"This is all highly contingent on your ability and type of WC rim/tire you have but a few tips to hopefully help improve what was seen in the video:

Using the tire bars, when you have two of them in under the bead, you can use one of them like a zipper and slide it around the rest of the rim. Like she said in the video, this should be easier than removing it and reinserting it every few inches.

If you can, try and take the tire off the rim completely. I didn't catch why she didn't in the video so your rim/tire may differ. But taking it off completely allows you to inspect both sides of tire's beads (the metal ring that gives shape and reinforcement to the tire against rim).

When you have the tire completely off, slightly inflate the new tube (or repaired one) just enough that it maintains shape without kinks. Then you can insert the tube into the tire make sure it doesn't bunch. Often if you insert it flat, it can bunch which will lead to tearing the tube. After that, find the stem, insert that first and make sure it is straight through before doing the reverse of step 1 (seating the tire back onto the rim.)

Bike pumps can be cumbersome and not offer the right amount of leverage. If money permits, you can purchase a handheld device that uses CO2 cartridges that require no pumping. If you want to use an electric pump, just make sure to slowly inflate the tub so that it allows itself to naturally conform between tire and rim.

Finally, like she said, it is often easier to take it to a bike shop. If you'd still like to try it yourself, watch some youtube videos on how to change bike tires and see if they can offer any relevant tips and tricks.

224,"I second the idea of Voc Rehab, they have the best connections to training and employment. There are also many other work-from jobs. Most are writing jobs, some customer service. If you know are willing to learn to code, web development can be a good source of income. HTML5 isn't that hard to learn. There are plenty of free resources online. Your local library may also have some free classes that teach you job skills. Some even have volunteers to help you get a job. Community college is also not a bad idea to start getting some credits towards a degree. Even an associates degree, in the long run, will be better than a high school diploma or GED. Additionally, a lot of 4-year schools will accept most courses as transfer credit if you decide you want to go further with your education. 

Beyond trying to find a job, getting on the right treatment is very important. Medication can be helpful if you are on the right ones. Look around for the right psychiatrist. You want to be on medication that can help you, but not on those who impair your function further. Therapy is also an important part of the equation. I found DBT the most helpful. Exposure therapy is also very useful for managing OCD symptoms as well as social anxiety. I don't know your treatment history, but if you haven't had CBT from someone who is trained, that is the place to start. Other types of therapy can augment CBT, but in many ways the skills you learn there are needed for the other therapies to be successful. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with and who has experience. If the first one you go to doesn't work out, try another one. Telling the therapist that the relationship isn't working is hard, but you have to get effective treatment. My one warning is that talk therapy by itself will not help you. Because of the chronic nature and the severity of your conditions that you described, it won't help you. 

You also need to build a support system. Having people to rely on helps with managing stress. Also, as you build relationships people around you can begin to tell when your conditions are getting worse. This feedback can help you get treatment before they get too out of control.

234,"Are you asking if CP inherently prevents all children with CP from walking? no, CP can manifest in different ways and some patients are capable of walking in childhood and adulthood, for some people it may change over their lifetime. The motor skills CP impacts can be diffrent for every single patient.

Do you mean can children who's CP manifests in a way that prevents them walking in childhood- can they develop the ability to walk later in life?

It depends, there is some room for motor skills to improve with correct symptom management, but not always, and perhaps not enough to help every child with CP learn to walk. Every case is different and it's up to each individual medical team to decide what goals are realistic for each unique CP patient.

246,"I have an open ABLE account and I highly recommend the program, especially for your situation. Before I give some info regarding ABLE, I figured I'd give you a rundown on SSI rules. I'm also assuming that the money isn't going to a special needs trust, which is a whole other thing I don't know much about. In the month you get the inheritance, you will not be eligible for SSI for that given month and you will owe back SSI money you received for that month. Then, if you still have money in any account after that month is up, any left over money will be countable assets. The straight asset limit for SSI is 2k, so you could only keep up to 2k in regular checking or savings account.

With an ABLE account, the yearly contribution limit is 14k. The max overall amount you could have in an ABLE account without it in any way effecting SSI benefits is 100k. ABLE accounts are run by states along with probably other private companies they partner with to administer the program. Most states allow out of staters to open an ABLE account. This will give you an opportunity to shop around for the program with the best investment options and the lowest costs \(some of them have a yearly fee\).

248,"I got my disability (OH) a decade ago so I can’t speak to exactly how things are now but I can tell you about my experiences. 

I had been seeing doctors and therapists for a couple years since my disability (I lost my job after I was hospitalized) so I had a large paper trail that helped immensely. I applied and was told I would probably be denied for the first time. If I was I should get a lawyer who handles disability claims she told me. 

I did get denied, I did get a lawyer, I had an interview with him over the phone, signed some releases and was told it would take 2 years to get a hearing. 9 months later to my surprise I got a call that I had a court date. I went down to the courthouse, spoke with him for a couple minutes, then went in a small room overstuffed with a table, a judge, my lawyer, and 4 old guys who apparently were all experts who were to assess my case (psychiatrist, doctor, workers comp guy, and a 4th I can’t remember.) I’d felt like the lawyer was going to do a little to help but when I got there I found that everyone had a 2-inch binder completely full of all my medical records and everything else under the sun (not literally but you get the idea.)

I talked to them, answered questions for about 10-20 minutes, then we all agreed on the date when I was ‘officially’ disabled (it was a couple years) to establish how far back my backpay went. The gavel was hit, everything was put through, the lawyer was paid his percentage of the backpay for his services (I think it was 20% but I could be wrong) and things have been ok since then.

I’ll add a caveat to this because I was getting paid well at my last job and the determination was based on my pay from that job so I can’t speak to how much you’d get in the end. I can say that I was enrolled in Medicare after put on disability (I think I had to provide some personal information and sign a few forms but it wasn’t hard) and was made eligible for public assistance programs which I was mostly able to get with some visits to job and family services.

Look up info on how it all works in PA and see what the initial denial rate is right now (I think it was like 75% at the time) and find someone to help you navigate the paperwork. I had a social worker at the time and she helped me but I think disability lawyers can do it and I’m sure there’s others. I’m not sure if you can do it online now but it was not really as hard as I thought the application would be. I had a friend I was staying with at the time and he understood that I was at least working on getting disability (it took me a year or so to apply) so I was at least sheltered and relatively comfortable while I waited for my court date.

I can’t say your experience will be exactly the same but hopefully it will be. If you look up what specifically you can expect from applying in PA at this point in time and have someone help you prepare the application I think you'll be able to get this worked out. Also, make sure your roommate understands what is happening so they can be supportive on one level or another. You can do this. Take care. 

Edit-I just reread your post. I’m still waking up so I misunderstood what you were asking. It will definitely not hurt to see if you can get the back pay, and they may grant you partial disability.

I do have college education but no degree. 

I’m looking into it because currently I can work and I would prefer to keep working, my issue and worry is the pain is getting worse and I don’t want to do any damage to myself.

I'd say that this is a problem more and more people are going to face. this notion that a persons value etc is defined by their job is pretty absurd. (I'm not saying its you... its society, its ""old-fashioned"")

If you think a Walmart cashier that works 40 hours a week and just gets constantly bitched at has it any better I'd urge you to reconsider.

Perhaps the issue is more or less that you are frustrated that you don't have that freedom that is bothering you. Chances are pretty good if you won the lottery etc you would be perfectly happy voluntarily not working, but you would find something to do that you enjoy.

In today's corporate landscape most people are replaceable cogs because thats what its all about. Nothing good or special. Ask yourself whats the difference between a great cashier and a mediocre one? A ""great"" one may smash fewer loaves of bread and be slightly faster and more pleasant, but at the end of the day I'd submit unless something truly egregious is going on, the average person don't give a shit and don't pay enough attention to even notice the difference.

This is all to say that trying  find value/meaning/fulfillment/self worth through employment is a bad idea.

People seem to find those things in part through their interactions/connections with other people, and even as a fairly antisocial person thats what I miss about work, but if I hit the lottery don't for a minute think that I'd even give one second of thought to wishing I had a job. so even if you do manage to find a job you can get some small bit of enjoyment out of, its quite small.

I've had jobs I was quite good at and did significantly better than others, but at the end of the day it didn't matter much when I left, because most situations are not life of death, the machine keeps on running.

If I could make a recommendation though, it'd be nice if your autism section had more things for autistic adults too. It's a struggle to find things that help us, but I know there are things out there. Including autistic owned businesses that are more focused on adults would be a good step. I can help with a list if you'd like :)

Also puzzle pieces are not well liked in the autism community. It gives the idea that we are incomplete or missing pieces. Most of us prefer things like the neurodiversity symbol or Autisticat(there's others too).
Atypical is a controversial thing too. This ones more up for debate in the community on whether the show hurts us or not. I figure its worth mentioning.

It’s taken me years but I’ve finally found a great therapist who I feel good talking to about everything. Sometimes she’s the highlight of my week.

If you’ve been to psychotherapy it was probably with a psychologist at the least but they’ve really gone the way of the dodo. Almost all therapists I know of now are LISWs and liscenced therapists (they have the degrees but hadn’t necessarily kept on a strict psychology track and specialize in related fields.)

Mine hold degrees and focused on child development but she’s whip smart and a huge LGBTQ advocate who also focuses on mental health care for non-heteros too.

This is a difficult task when individuals feel misunderstood and underrepresented, I get that.

Absolutely, couldn't have put it better.

&gt;what do you, or anyone reading this, think the common goals of the disability community should be?

To be honest, this is something I've been thinking about for a while and I have not come to a solid list of goals but what I do keep coming back to over and over again (it seems to underpin so many other issues) is financial empowerment. In my personal experience, money has bought me opportunities. My intellectual ability has mattered and my work experience has mattered in getting those opportunities but the biggest determinant of whether or not I could get a really good education or a job (aside from discrimination, possibly)? Money. Money to cover the extra cost of having a disability. And it's not just about accessing education or the workplace because we also have to think about those for whom accessing those things is impossible due to the nature or type of disability they have. I think financial power is important across the disability spectrum - it's one of the biggest barriers in accessing good quality healthcare, one of the biggest barriers in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the biggest barrier in maintaining dignity and independence, the biggest barrier in affording a decent quality of life, the biggest barrier in being able to fight for yourself when you *are* discriminated against or your rights are being violated etc. We need spending power in order to become visible in society, in order to have power in how the communities we live in are shaped.

I'm not saying anything new, I think every disabled person knows that money is important. But I do think that the community is not pushing hard enough or thinking big enough. We're so focused on keeping the little that we get through government programs, so focused on surviving the day to day financially. It's not enough. We're being reactive to issues and cuts as they come rather than trying to scope out what we need and fighting for it. I'm hugely thankful for what the disabled people who came before us fought for and the independence and inclusion they've passed down to us but times have changed and we need to think about what we need now and what the upcoming generations are going to need going forward. The fight before us was about getting us into the community and now I think the focus has to be on lifting us out of poverty so that we can be true members of society. I think that's something we can do in partnership with other minorities who also face similar issues.

477,"Wheelchair user with severe limp here. I might be a bit radical, but I don't find the word cripple to be inherently offensive, and I'll often use it to describe my condition.

Over the years I've seen these other terms come in and out of fashion, handicapped, disabled, physically challenged, and the like, and the only consistent thing I can see is that no matter what the new term is, eventually ""society"" decides even that term is too offensive, and we need a new one. It seems like every few years disabled people get a new euphemism.

This is when I realized that the problem people have with these terms is not that they are inherently offensive in any way. What makes people uncomfortable is that you are talking about disability in the first place. 

A lot of able-bodied people just get uncomfortable with discussing disability. I've seen firsthand when young children out in the world get curious about my wheelchair, and then their parents shoo them away, tell them not to bother me, and then the parents apologize to me for their nosy kid.

This is the kind of attitude that produces adults who are uncomfortable with disabled people, and who now have this weird uncomfy feeling with talking about disability. So they think, well this must be an offensive topic, or word. And when they try to replace the word, inevitably that word becomes ""offensive"" too, because the underlying topic is the same, and its the underlying topic that they can't handle.

So cripple becomes handicapped, which becomes disabled, which becomes physically challenged, and the parade of euphemisms goes on and on because no matter what the term, its the topic that makes people uncomfortable.

Which is why I prefer to use the term cripple. There is nothing inherently offensive about the word. My joke is that ""its in the bible.""

Because she is on SSI (I'm assuming not SSDI due to low monthly amount) she can qualify for HUD housing assistance, which caps rent at 30% of income. Is she on Medicaid? If a group home is medically necessary, they will pay for it. 

I would start by looking for any sort of community mental health center or independent living center. They should have resources to help. Or contact whatever state agency administers the Medicaid program, they can help explain options. 

It sounds like a group home, or a 24-7 residential habilitation program (where she lives in an apartment with a few people and they have a staff 24hrs/day) is going to be what she needs. You could also try looking for those programs in your area (google or try 2-1-1).

And this goes for practically everyone who may ever have to interact with you regarding your disability. I've had occupational therapists ask the wrong kind of questions for the type of information they actually require. It's a communication issue that stems from able bodied people not understanding the reality of life with a disability but understanding it can be a private and personal topic. So they stumble around their questions, they try to beat around the bush and make assumptions thinking it's more respectful than asking direct questions, or they ask direct questions that are the wrong questions. Sometimes it's because our disability defies expectations. Someone who's only ever met wheelchair users who are full time users or experience permanent paralysis, they might not expect a customer to be a part time user for fatigue or pain or orthostatic intolerance, they might miss important questions like ""do you require additional fluid during the flight?"" because they've assumed they know enough about disability. 

I've had doctors assume I'm fully continent since I haven't directly mentioned my continence issues since childhood because I manage well enough.

But he doesn't ask if I need specific equipment or tools or reminders, I've now learned that I need to tell him directly regardless of the specific questions he asks. Otherwise I arrive at hospital for surgery and sneak a peak at my care plan and say"" oh, I'm not continent, I have alarms on my phone to remind me because the sensation is dull""

However it's illegal for most places in UK, Aus and US to ask ""what is your condition?"" or ""what is your diagnosis"" or anything allong those lines. It's a private medical quesyion and they have no right to that information.

The information an airlines needs:

* What tasks might you need help with
* How can they help you

""I have a mobility issue, I have a cane in carry-on, But I require a wheelchair and wheelchair assistance for the terminal"" or ""I have a sensory impairment, I don't have equipment, I need a visual guide whilst I'm in the airport"" or whatever it is you need.

795,"&gt; Could you apply for school and support yourself that way for a time?

How does student loan debt help you support yourself? You can’t usually borrow much more than what covers tuition—and there are lifetime limits. 

Also, you’d need to be full-time to qualify for enough federal loan money to even dream of using it to supplement your income.

804,"Okay, I'm going to give you the unvarnished truth here. It is not at all clear that you have a permanent inability to live independently as a self-supporting adult. At 22 years of age you are barely out of childhood and are not even close to being qualified for SSDI. In order to qualify, you would have to have a lot more work history. [Explanation here.](https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/glossary/fully-insured-status) 

There is another program, SSI, which might possibly help you in the short term but again, based on the information you've provided, I don't think you would be approved. Here's why: 

You were a straight-A student in high school so that tells me that even though college didn't work out, you probably have the IQ points to do many, many different kids of jobs. Would a college degree open up the possibilities even more? Probably, but that is no reason not to even try.

I understand that you didn't do well in customer service type jobs (go carts, food service) but there is customer service, and there is everything else, and that ""everything else"" is practically infinite. **Please, please do not base your self-image regarding your ability to hold down a job on this very minimal work experience.**

You have not had a lot of treatment, and you're not in treatment at all right now. That is a problem. It's an especially big problem because you have conditions which by their very nature make adulting more difficult. So until you find the right psychiatrist, get on the right meds (if that's something they recommend), and get some therapy under your belt, all this is going to look like an insurmountable obstacle, and you will have no idea what you're capable of. So I 100% understand that this advice might be hard to take. But you are just going to have to trust me when I tell you that getting the right help WILL make all these things easier.

Let me be clear, and yes I'm aware I'm repeating myself. **Both psychiatric treatment and counseling are a must for you.** You dismiss the idea of meds because you are afraid of ""Big Pharma,"" but what's scarier: medication side effects or the permanent inability to become a functioning adult? You dismiss the idea of counseling, saying that it's a ""waste of time,"" because of the focus on coping skills, but **your entire response to my questions is a testament to your need for help with coping skills.** Coping with a lack of transportation. Coping with co-workers you don't like. Coping with managers who don't like you and give you all the shit work. Coping with work that is boring and shitty. Dealing with all these things without throwing your hands up and saying, ""I can't do it! Fuck this! I'm going back to bed!""

Yes, therapy is painful, and it is a lot of work. And yes, you might go into a therapy session in a good mood and leave in a bad mood because it's bringing up stuff you'd rather not think about. *This means that the therapy is working.* If you do not learn to recognize and process the shit that therapy brings up, and that is bumming you out (which is one of the most important coping skills they teach you in therapy by the way), your treatment will not help. In therapy, you make progress, and you have setbacks. You will feel invincible some days and depressed and hopeless on other days. That's a completely normal part of the process. So is trying a medication and having it make you feel worse. Or having it work, but only for a couple months. That's no reason to abandon treatment; it's just an indication that you haven't found the right treatment *yet.* So you try again. And again. And again. Because this is your LIFE we're talking about, and the effort and pain and discouragement is worth the end result of figuring out what works and helps you be functional.

You mention that you are currently self-medicating with weed. This is a very bad idea. At age 22 your brain development is still ongoing, and using weed can hinder that development. Now, I am VERY pro-medicinal weed when it's appropriate. But don't fool yourself: habitual weed use before the age of 25 is not medication. It's self-sabotage.

Now, about your home environment: It's reasonable as an adult man (or at any age really) to expect that your living space include a private area where you can close the door and meditate or read a book or even a titty magazine, as long as it's legal and you don't disturb other members of the household. I 100% believe you that you need this, and if you can't get it at your parents' house, you should be looking at other options.

Speaking of which, you haven't gone into a lot of detail about your living situation -- I understand about the layout of your living space and the lack of door but you don't talk about your father or other family members living there. If your parents are abusive in some way, talk about it with a counselor. There are resources for vulnerable young adults who are trapped in abusive environments, whether that's due to financial or other reasons. If that's the case, consider contacting Adult Protective Services or a Domestic Abuse Hotline in your state.

Regarding your debts: Your financial situation sucks but it is not insurmountable. Yes, you will probably be required to pay back the loans, and if you are, it will take a bite out of your budget for quite awhile. This is not a reason not to try to get a job -- quite the opposite. My cousin, who went a little crazy in her 20s and incurred about $50,000 in credit card debt, is fond of this riddle: How do you eat an elephant? Answer: One bite at a time.

So what's next? If you are uninsured, you need health insurance, because IMO treatment should be priority one with you right now, and you will not be able to get good treatment without insurance. If you have a parent who works in a place that offers group insurance, you can get on their plan until age 26. If that is not an option for you, and you live in a state that opted in to the Obamacare Medicaid Expansion, get signed up *immediately* and get yourself back into treatment. If your state does not have the Medicaid Expansion, try to sign up for public assistance which should qualify you for Medicaid. 

Once you're insured, you will need a psychiatrist to evaluate your need for meds if any, and a therapist to help you with coping skills. Once you're back in treatment, you can re-start Vocational Rehab and get some help determining what would be the right job or training program for you based on your particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Vocational Rehab is also an area where a trained professional is going to tell you to do shit you don't necessarily want to do. *Do it anyway.*

Above all, do not give up hope. For every problem you've talked about, there is help. All you have to do is accept that help and that's going to mean doing shit that you don't want to do. Get used to that: it's practically the definition of being an adult.

TL;DR: The sooner you accept the fact that trained professionals CAN and WILL help you *if you follow their advice,* the sooner you can get control of your own life.",False,False,,TyrionsRedCoat,TAB.

Yes, you will probably be required to pay back the loans, and if you are, it will take a bite out of your budget for quite awhile. This is not a reason not to try to get a job -- quite the opposite. My cousin, who went a little crazy in her 20s and incurred about $50,000 in credit card debt, is fond of this riddle: How do you eat an elephant? Answer: One bite at a time.

So what's next? If you are uninsured, you need health insurance, because IMO treatment should be priority one with you right now, and you will not be able to get good treatment without insurance. If you have a parent who works in a place that offers group insurance, you can get on their plan until age 26. If that is not an option for you, and you live in a state that opted in to the Obamacare Medicaid Expansion, get signed up *immediately* and get yourself back into treatment. If your state does not have the Medicaid Expansion, try to sign up for public assistance which should qualify you for Medicaid. 

Once you're insured, you will need a psychiatrist to evaluate your need for meds if any, and a therapist to help you with coping skills. Once you're back in treatment, you can re-start Vocational Rehab and get some help determining what would be the right job or training program for you based on your particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. <PERSON> is also an area where a trained professional is going to tell you to do shit you don't necessarily want to do. *Do it anyway.*

Above all, do not give up hope. For every problem you've talked about, there is help. All you have to do is accept that help and that's going to mean doing shit that you don't want to do. Get used to that: it's practically the definition of being an adult.

TL;DR: The sooner you accept the fact that trained professionals CAN and WILL help you *if you follow their advice,* the sooner you can get control of your own life.","[{'start': 6472, 'end': 6480, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 357, 'end': 362, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
805,"The difference between can’t and don’t want to is a fine, and grey line. One thing I always look at is what kind of support system is needed. If you’re to the point that the discussion of caregivers is coming up, that falls into the can’t category. 

I also look at what has that person done to attempt to work, and to deal with their symptoms. We see it more with younger folks, but sometimes a person will just throw up their arms and say “there is no way I can do it!” Now, that is on them to work with shift their perception, and if that is how they want to continue to view their life, that is their choice. However, one cannot expect the government to set up lifetime payments for it. 

In your situation? It sounds like you have a good support system and people around you looking out for you. I would listen to what they are telling you. You’re doing everything you can, and you are still falling short, then it may be time to adjust your plan. Sometimes taking time off to really focus on yourself can help improve a person to more sustainable levels.

808,"So /tyrionsredcoat covered just about everything, and gave real spot-on answers. 

It can be real difficult to understand, but disability is based on someone's complete inability to work and function. A lot of people struggle with work, but that doesn't mean they are disabled. 

&gt; I don't want my life to be 8 hours work, 1 hour commute, 7 hours mental-illness suffering, 1 hour eating/showering, 7 hours sleep.  That leaves time for nothing (not even friends, family, hobbies, exercise, pets, shopping, errands) and isn't even enough sleep for me (I only do well at 8.5 hours.  It used to be 10 in high school).

To be real blunt - that is being an adult. Nobody likes working for 8 hours a day and not having time for things they would much rather be doing. 

You seem to have a history of customer service or customer facing jobs - which is probably the worst thing for someone with your spectrum of mental illness. You'd be better off focusing on something more suited to your symptoms. 

The other big red flag for you is your lack of any sort of treatment. Anxiety and depression typically respond well to treatment, including therapy and medications. SSA can tell if you just get into treatment to try to bolster your disability claim (and it is not looked upon favorably).

809,"That's a lot of questions. I'll provide info.  I hope you can still submit your guess/speculation of sorts. I don't have *too* much time to write too much more though.

 ***What is your age?*** ~22.7 y/o.

***What kinds of treatments have you had?*** 3 years of counseling as a child. Then,  2 more years of counseling.  After another break, 3 more years of counseling. (I stopped because they were helping me learn to cope, not help with solutions, and it wasted time, they'd get me into  bad moods on good days, and not be available when I really needed them, and a whole plethora of other reasons)

***What kind of treatment are you undergoing right now?*** None right now, but because I'm literally fallen under a pile of bullshit.  Im like stuck.  Willing to get more help on my own.  Not only that, even if I wasn't for my own benefit, I'd enroll in counseling again to help my case for getting disability

***Are you following your doctor's advice/taking all prescribed meds? If not, why not?*** I tried the meds, none worked.  they only worked for the first 2 months.  i am scared AF by big pharma and dont want to try more.  between you and me, marijuana has helped me more than anything, but i wont mention that to the feds.  i legit mean it is a medical *miracle* for me. idec about the recreational effects.  It cures like half of the issues within me.  Even like 12 hours after smoking. i smoked for a year, quit for 9 months, then resumed for 2 more months.  the 9 months i *wasn't* smoking i could actually notice my life was worse and less healthy.  i'd like to get a medical card and try and not smoke but take pills or eat it someday down the line.

***What jobs have you had, and for how long?*** I had a job for  4 months at a go kart place.  mgmt was horrible.  they had lead in the water supply, made ppl stand in sun 4 hours, 15 min break, 5 more hours; no devices, no umbrellas, *no talking*, 9 hour shifts. i got fired for getting a flat tire on my way biking to work on a 45mph road/freeway of sorts.  he said the flat + being 10 min late twice before was enough, lol.  this was over 4 months.  but yeah my dad might have aspergers too, but he wont look into it.  one symptom of aspergers is tardiness, believe it or not, since time mgmt is so difficult, even perception of time might be different at times. he drove me to school in elementary school. i was tardy 55/180 days and almost got truancy court on me. they didn't care since i was getting straight a's i think. they even said ""if ur late more, ur going to court"" and I was late like 15 more times. so, late 55 times in one school year and absent like 12.  this was the most severe year, but my lateness for school extended throughout all years. when i started bussing in high school, the tardiness was cut by like 70%, but between my dad getting me into bad habits, our conditions, and just struggling with time mgmt in general, i was still late like 25 times  a year in hs.

then i worked at a sandwich shop which was severely understaffed.  i had it for 3 years.  they started lowering my hours from like 25 hour to 13 hour to 6 hour a week.  i had various meetings with them and HR and they were an evil work place.  even the coworkers would gossip about me and my aspergers and gang up on me, even assigning me over quintuple amount of tasks, LOL.  they'd have the shift leaders do one 10 min task and hand me a list with 5 half-hour tasks at close. i struggled every day, i began falling apart when my life was work 6-7 hr, commute, document their mistreatment, talk with dad about taking legal action, bed, repeat.............. miserable every day.  like my life started actually falling apart, got far behind on bills, payments, debts, collections, hygiene, sleep, everything. like *everything*. haven't worked in the last 9 months.  My best friend was a 21 year old cyclist. A car hit him on his street and he died 9 months ago.  He was the closest creature to me in the world, surpassing all animals and family and friends.  I called out for his funeral and got fired the day after I called out. Not even kidding.  Didn't even bother with it after that and couldn't afford legal action. And my mother who offered to help me with the legal action procedure is too unstable herself. Been trying to sort legal and health stuff out ever since, and also did community service.

***Educational background:*** finished HS.  Went to a state uni for one semester. long story short, they dispatched a loan 2 weeks late :DDDDDDDDD So i was on campus for 3 days waiting for my schedule.  got billed $6000 for the 3 days since i was using their housing.  never fought it because of the shit i was behind from listed above. overwhelming.  you dont know you're truly overwhelmed until the overwhelming aspects make you say ""fuck it, i can't handle this' and instantly cose you 6,000$. now it's in collection.  so 3 days cost me 6 grand.  then, because i cant finish university, i now owe for the first semester - in cash - now - WITHOUT A DEGREE.  *id have no trouble paying it off with a degree*, but now? no fucking way

Hell, I need some time just to straighten this out. gonna be a lot of calls and a lawyer. before the taxes add up orw whatever its called.  it gets more expensive the more you wait.

So yeah, owe $13,000 for 1 semester + 3 days.  And no chance to return to school to get a degree to pay that off.  I know disability doesnt forgive loans btw, but you asked about my schooling history, so there.  i was straight a's up till 12th grade and semester 1 in uni where i got b's and c's.  mostly c's semster 1 in college, but thats because i was just learning study patterns / how it works blah blha blha. like seriously i didnt know that the whole concept was that study time should like, double class time. ha. i rly didnt know till after that semester. but then it was too late.

also, even if i was 100% healthy and not disabled, my life would be: work 40 hours, but only get paid for 30 after garnishment.  at 40 hour workweeks most americans cant even rent a house, so 30 is pretty nifty.

also, 3 out of 4 ppl that enroll in college aren't able to complete it in america, from an old statistic video I watched 5 years ago.


***Have you had any vocational evaluation or training?*** Yes, worked with something called ORS (Office of Rehabilitation Services / Vocational Rehabilitation Office).  I spend like $40 in gas, getting lost without a gps (never ever owned a smartphone), etc, made it on time, got my flu shots, did the training, did my first 'shift', then got a flat tire.  had to miss 3 consecutive shifts in a row for my flat tire since it was on a weekend and i 'worked' on weekends for this internship.  it was such a far drive and busses wouldn't work. day 4, i got the tire fixed on the sonnest day i could, ASAP, and the lady canceled the whole thing, no warning.  i think she was mad i texted her too late at one point, even tho i said id never text her at 10pm ever again.  she was buggin.  so she canceled it for me. i lost like so much gas and time from this.  went back to my ors counselor, she said it's a 2 month wait.  2 months passed and i got sick and missed an appointment with her, then just never followed up. didnt check my email for 2 months and when i did found out it was canceled.  i also have about a million unread emails across various sites right now from the stuff i got set back on.  i dont even feel human anymore.  i feel like a pawn in an impossible time crunch, day after day. i'd re-enroll right now but ive been handling kidney stones, and family issues,  aLOT, lately.  im being swallowed time-wise from my illnesses too, remember that.  anxiety can manifest WITH OCD to make a small task seem daunting, and you grow more anxious/fearful form it.

***Why don't you have a bedroom door?*** **tl;dr version at bottom.** I don't have a bedroom door. Partially parental reasons, partially limited room.  But mostly parental.  Here's the bedroom door response.  I'll include a **tl;dr** version of this bedroom door segment at the bottom. 

What does it really mean to not have a door? Most people in threads just say ""Oh, that sucks"". I want people here to discuss as many reasons why it sucks as possible and extrapolate. Also, coping methods are desirable, and hopefully we can huddle together for some possible solutions and mindsets that explain how we can turn this into a good thing or something somehow.   
 What does it mean to me, in brief, on a whim?  It means you can't be who you are. Your personality is set back, constantly open to judgement. Can't speak too critically or impolitely; showing excitement around friends but un-excitement around parents = you hate them in some twisted minds? You can't be sexually open. Sexuality is one of the aspects of life that makes humans human. It also elicits lots of happiness and people have sexual thoughts on average 6 times a minute IIRC. To have that hindered is cruel. You can't express yourself in front of friends properly. (this is REALLY bad in my case because I have asperger's syndrome, so fleshing myself out socially is something dear to me...) You have to be saying the right things. You cannot concentrate or have silence due to no sound barrier. There is always the chance for daily interruptions of people just walking by. No true meditation. Lessened peace. By the way, I said ""no concentration"". Do you know how massive that is? I have suffered 500+ individual times form frustration due to lack of concentration, totaling hours and hours and hours. 

**tl;dr version of the bedroom door segment:** PS: I don't have a door because my bedroom is a loft attached to a staircase (and bathroom), not because it was removed. My dad's master bedroom has a door and is empty 99.9% of the time he is awake. No, for once, that is not a fake number! He's actually never in it besides to sleep, which makes this more infuriating.

811,"Can I ask you a question as an examiner?

Your exact experience might not be relevant as I am not american, But you have touched on something I need to better understand as I come to yet another crisis at yet another job and once again think about applying for disability in my country.

&gt;Nobody likes working for 8 hours a day and not having time for things they would much rather be doing.

How do you draw the line between ""don't want to"" and ""can't""

Right now, I'm managing 10 hours a fortnight at work, I am able to shower every 3 days, and I'm managing to cook dinner 4/7 days. laundry is a problem, My partner and I both had to buy more clothes so I can do it fortnightly instead of weekly.

I'm surviving. But I would much rather shower daily and cook daily and wear clean clothes every week like I used to back when I wasn't working at all. I was able to really stay on top of my personal hygiene (I can't remember the last time I shaved my legs) and nutrition, I was able to keep up with my prescribed physical therapy (it's been a few weeks since I did a full routine)

On the one hand, Life is about compromises, No one gets to have things go perfectly their way. You can't have yoiur cake and eat it too, On the other hand, sometimes it feels like work is the reason I can't manage to cook or clean, and part of me thinks ""If i'm only healthy enough to do one, I want to take care of myself and my house, not work"" 

But right now I'm in an awkward middle ground. My partner is worried that if my condition deteriorates or if i need to pick up more hours to be financially secure, I'll need actual help around the home. As it is, I can only get away with showering every other day and cooking every other day because I have days off work where I can be gross and sweaty, and I'm overweight so having days where I don't really eat is basically just like lazy intermittent fasting.

But I don't feel like it's sustainable, My Disability Emmployment consultant agrees, and has suggested I ask my doctor about getting on the roster for a district nurse and meal delivery so that I can have someone help me shower and clean so that I am prepared and ready for work.

But I just can't wrap my head around hiring a carer 3 days a week to help me shower so that I have enough energy to go to work for 5 hours a week. How is that more resource efficient than me just using my energy to shower every single day and then not working at all?


What would you suggest, Do I need to just get my head around the idea that contributing to society is my responsibility and a carer is just another tool yp help me so I should embrace that?

Or should I really be asking people if they would support yet another claim for partial disability payments (I would still like to try and work 2 shifts a month, but 4 is too much right now, and even pusging myself as I am, I can't afford to live - My housemate pays my utilities)",False,False,,DearyDairy,"Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, POTS, MCAS",,1526721630,t5_2qhe8,t3_8jmicy,t1_dz189g8,1,1527695573,0,0,dz8agpr,disability,,,,,

893,"&gt;will not answer me when I ask.

Don't mater what they have to say. There is actual diagnostic testing involved. You don't need family involvement if they don't want to be involved \(mine were not\). The only input came from my fiancee \- nobody from my blood relatives wanted to be involved. Open Google and do a search for Autism testing in your area. From the results, look for a doc that has experience with diagnosing adult autism and make an appointment.

The process took me about a month, but I was indeed diagnosed with HF Autism \(aspergers is not a term used in medical literature anymore\). It is just called High Functioning autism now.

The process looks like this:

1. Initial consult. Will ask you a series of high level questions about your concerns, family life, mental health history, etc.
2. Second consult. Testing will begin. You will be tested on a wide array of psychological and personality based topics. You will have your IQ tested. You will have your memory tested. You will be asked some really bizarre questions at time. You will be shown photos/slides of various people making facial expressions and you will have to identify the mood they are expressing \(I failed this miserably\). You will be asked to try to make up stories on the fly using various props provided by the person administrating the testing \(man, I failed that one miserably too...\). This all took me about 3 \- 4 hours.
3. Final Consult. Based on the testing, an assessment will be made by the test administrator if you meet the conditions to be considered on the autism spectrum. Getting diagnosed as an adult is a weird thing and brings on lots of emotions \- especially if you have been struggling undiagnosed your entire life. Alternately, you may be found to not be on the spectrum and referred to continue meeting with a licensed mental health provider to continue your diagnosis and possible treatment.

Great. Stress the importance of remaining in treatment. It cannot be overstated. A 6 month medication gap isn't great if it was against medical advise, but it isn't the end of the world. A 3 month doctor gap isn't either depending on the nature of her limitations and which doctor that 3 month gap was for. 3 month gap for a primary, who cares. Three month gap for a therapist, more significant if that is the primary reason she is disabled. Your father's opinion will not really be taken into account.

Our company openly does nothing for disabilities and most requests get denied, but as you're probably already well aware that doesn't mean the people stop existing or their problems go away.

The most important topic / issue to deal with is open acceptance that just because someone does a job differently that doesn't make it inherently wrong as long as the outcome is the same (or within acceptable parameters). Limiting a person's avenues to succeed is by far the fastest way to stop anyone with a disability, and likewise making sure there are enough options openly available without requiring requests is equally critical.

Small example is open work rooms. We have little cubbies that anyone in the office can work in. They can dim the lights, put on music without headphones, lay down and work, etc without putting in any kind of request. 

Most people, myself included, will not openly admit to having a disability because of the stigma and high probability of being fired in at-will states. It is very common.

I always try to 1 on 1 as many of my team as possible and write down all their pain points. Honestly disability or not just working with your team is smart. If someone is very poor at communication don't make them point person for emailing out important information. It doesn't matter if its because they're on the spectrum and suck at communicating or just someone that genuinely sucks at communicating. The outcome just won't be good. Sometimes it can't be avoided but putting someone on the spot to speak in front of a group with social anxiety is a great way to shoot down their confidence and guarantee they never perform at their best. It could be as simple as being forced to talk at a stand up when they aren't prepared. Try to remember this for daily stand ups / scrum master roles / activities and education. 

Now on the largest of teams this is nearly impossible and instead I rely on their immediate managers to do this, which means it won't get done right. I'll usually have to have some kind of follow up or SOP written to make sure it gets done correctly - I can hold them accountable then. The bigger the team, the harder it gets to make sure immediate managers are accommodating their employees.

Which brings us to the hardest thing to overcome - office culture. In the end, good office culture enables employees more than anything else. A positive and supportive environment will take ""ok"" employees and make them great, ""great"" employees become amazing, and ""amazing"" employees become rock stars. Unfortunately this isn't something you can just change. Often it starts at hiring the right people in the first place and having rules designed to reward good behaviors and dissuade bad ones. Making it clear that ""just joking"" is never an excuse to make fun of how someone is doing something, and that being supportive is always better.

951,"EDS or not, if this is the first time this has happened, it's important to at least get it documented.

You can use ice packs, take anti-inflamatories, try and massage the muscles then stretch out the joint to relocate it, that's all well and good, but if this is your first time experiencing this exact type of injury, don't risk it, you could cause nerve entrapment or vascular dissection. Call your doctor, or call your physio, tell them what has happened, ask if they can see you today or if they are comfortable for you to go to the ER. If it's outside hours, just go straight to the ER.

If you go to the doctors, ask your doctor for patient transport - someone to come get you since you can't weight bear. 

If you go to the ER, it would not be inappropriate to use an ambulance service for a hip injury. Please use one if it's an option to you. 

If you are experiencing numbness, you should go to the ER.

Even though with EDS, numbness and subluxation are common and usually harmless, ER staff will take numbness seriously, they will help relocate the joint, you can then learn how to do it properly if it happens again in the future. You can guarantee you won't accidentally injure yourself more by playing with the hip, you can get better pain management, maybe even some tape or instructions on how to perform certain tasks while you heal.

You can get it documented so if it happens again your doctor understands your history, if you're working or studying the paperwork will help you with any accommodations you will need like time off or a better chair.

Call your doctor or go to the ER. It doesn't matter that this isn't uncommon for EDS, this is a new symptom for you, and ""new injury followed by unusual sensation of numbness = ER""

Please trust me on this - I know that as EDS patients we have far to many experiences visiting the ER for a partial dislocation that can't be detected on xray, we're treated poorly and sent home, still dislocated and still in pain, only to have it finally pop back in on its own after a nap at home. The ER is historically a complete waste of time when you have EDS and a dislocation. It's the reason I talk myself out of going to hospital almost every time.

""I'll be more comfortable in bed with an ice pack just waiting than I will in a stiff hospital waiting room constantly explaining myself, I'll just wait, it usually fixes itself""

But I have regretted doing that almost every time. I have almost no documentation for many of my most problematic joints, and now I need more comprehensive treatment but were starting with zero information on my exact injuries. I wish I'd gone to the ER all the times I knew I'd fully dislocated something, at least just so they'd believe me when I tell them how often it happens when I'm home alone.

955,"7 seizures in 7 days is enough for some assessors to agree you are experiencing levels of disability that make it difficult or impossible to work.

However once they agree you are currently disabled, the real questions they ask to determine if you're eligible for disability welfare or benefits are: 

* how long have you experienced this level of disability? 

* for how much longer can you forsee experiencing this level of disability?


Your epilepsy used to have less impact, 1 seizure every 6 months. Historically, you did not have a disability.

You've had an increase in seizures this last week, you're trying a new med regime. It might take a few weeks to level out, but there's a chance this is just a rare bad week, and you'll go back to having more infrequent and manageable seizures and you won't be considered disabled.

Get as much information on your condition as you can. If you're going to experience 7 seizures a week for the foreseeable future, you may have a case for disability (depending on your exact location)

But if this is just a rare flare up, there may be temporary support, so you can always ask your local welfare office what services they have for temporary severe illness, otherwise you may just have to tough it out until it passes and you go back to your old baseline health.

Casserole is great. Look for recipes that have rice or noodles (though gf noodles can cook differently) as a base, there’ll probably be soup and water, and then dump in all the frozen veg you want.

Also, easy to add tuna for protien.

Bean-based casseroles are also a possibility. Use canned beans for no bean prep. 

Having a batch of hard boiled eggs in the fridge is a good backup. That requires minimal cleanup and is a good quick protien shot. They can also be crumbled over precut salad greens. Or just peel the egg and takes bites of it while you’re eating the salad.

If you are going to get only $550/month of SSDI, there may only be a few dollars left for minor children.  Since he is entitled to more off of his father's record, he will receive that instead of the smaller benefits from your record.  Though he will be listed on your record, just in case his father's benefit stops, he will then be entitled on your record, though it will be the smaller amount at that time.  

Half of your wages after the first $65 will be deducted from the total allowable SSI benefit (check with SSA for what that is in your area).     So if you make $465 a month in wages, SSA will reduce your SSI by $200 (465-65/2=200) so if you are receiving $550 from SSDI, wages of $465, and SSI maximum potential payment of $780, then your SSI payment will actually be, after all reductions for earned and unearned income, $50.  (780-(550-20)-(465-65/2)=50)
  Your ex-husbands income will count only during the times he was living in your household.  Since you did not file a concurrent claim (SSDI and SSI) back when you became disabled, the SSI will only go back to when you filed the SSI application.  If he was out of your household before you filed for SSI then his income will not affect your SSI at any time.
If you used an attorney service and they did not have you file a concurrent claim, then they have caused you harm in your application process, and you may be able to file a claim against their malpractice insurance for all lost income due to their error.

Soak your dishes.

For really tough, baked on gunk, add a dryer sheet to the water. Sounds weird, but it helps soften up the crusty blackened burnt on food and it comes off easily.

For food that's stuck on the inside of the microwave, take a cup of water, add some lemon juice, and microwave it on full power for 6 minutes. The food will wipe right off.

Tbh, we all go through self-hatred at your age, and for disabled people that's a bit more personal and acute. Partly because we look back and realise that we were treated differently because we are disabled. All I can say is you do come out the other side and start to accept yourself for who you are.

They provide some basic function for people who don't have anything (ex.: if you were missing a hand and part of an arm), but you probably can do as much with your hand (even if it's just to hold something still) as you would do with a mechanical arm. 

Technically, the few labs experiments I have seen were done one people who were missing an arm, at least below the elbow. One of the reasons is that they basically use the forearm to hide all the batteries and equipment needed for the 2 or 3 fingers that move independently.

Besides that, apart from the geeky factor, you would look even more unique than you do at the moment. I'm not saying it won't happen in your lifetime, I'm just saying it's not ready yet.

As far as going through life, I don't really have any specifics to say except, maybe, not to hide it.

If other people make it a big thing, screw them. You don't need people like that in your life! Talk to your parents and ask for help from a psychologist.

I cant think of many things the average person can do that you cant. So maybe you wont be a concert pianist, but neither will most people.

IMO think of the list of things you think will give your life meaning and see how many things on that list require two hands. Likely not many. You probably do a shitty job of bagging groceries though!

I've adopted the matrix philosophy on things... ""There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.""

Telling you that its probably not going to matter much in the grand scheme of things is unsatisfying and belittling, telling you to be thankful for what you have sounds like some hallmark card bullshit, Instead I'll ask can you find moments of joy in your life? sure with both hands it might be easier or greater in variety, but as long as you can find things you enjoy things will be ok. Yeah its kind of a make your own meaning cliche sort of thing, but everyone struggles with that IMO.

as far as not interacting with other people, I'd say don't hide it. easy for me to say, but I think most people wont really care. People can be really self conscious about canes, but that's mostly in their head. In general people don't give a shit about others or what they are going through. Use that apathy to your advantage. the self conscious aspect is self sustaining, so let it go. Maybe little bits at a time. People are going to relate to you based on what you can do for them more than anything else.

Short of having something like tentacles for fingers you probably wont attract too much attention.

I'm not, nor ever have been in your position. However, I work in a School where many people are in the same, similar, or worse off in terms of physical disabilities.   
   
Some are ashamed. Some don't care at all. That's life, different people feel differently. You can't control how you currently feel, but you can work on how you feel in the future.   
   
Your body is one tiny part of what makes you you. Your hand is a small part of that body. Some people can't spell. Some can't read. Some can't use their hands. Some can't use their legs. None of them are less people than anyone else. You may have some restrictions in life, but everyone does, just to different extents.   
   
My recommendation would be find a group of people, especially other young ones, who are in similar positions to you. Meet them, realise that they can be cool, awesome, intelligent, funny, and all sorts of other things. Your hand may be a focus for you right now than makes you feel bad. So focus on other things. Learn a skill, get good at one hand typing and write a book. Get really into learning about science. Teach yourself a magic trick. Life is a million small things that come to make existence. Focus on the ones that make you happy.

Here’s my armchair diagnosis: when you started the application online, it opened a window called a protective filing. This means that the date that you started the application is the filing date whether the claim is completed next week or ten years from now, unless the protective filing is closed out.

When the application was taken in your office, that closed out the protective filing. However, in the computer system, you still have one open from either the appointment or the online application.

This person can give you a definitive answer of, “Don’t worry about it, our system is wack,” or “Yes worry about it, here’s how you file an appeal.” Don’t bother with the national number, they probably won’t understand the issue.

1274,"The world health organisation defines disability as ""any limitation or restriction that prevents someone from performing about activity within the range comsodered normal""

Having a disability and being disabled are the same thing.

The problem is that the pension provided to people who have a disability that impacts them to the point they can't work is called ""the disability pension"" in most countries, so colloquially, general society starts using phrases like ""he's on disability"" to explain that someone is disabled to the point they can't work. Over time, that gets shortened to ""he's disabled"" 

Likewise, when someone asks what you you do for a living, a person who has a disability and can't work because of it might say ""oh, I have a disability""/""I'm disabled"" as a way of explaining quickly why they are not working.

1293,"I'm getting sick of hearing ""think of people with disabilities, don't ban plastic straws""

We have a disability, but we're not completely incapable of autonomy. I know I need a straw, so I take a reusable straw everywhere I go, I have a shorter, spare one threaded through the chain of my medical alert lanyard. My water bottle has a built in straw, as long as I remember it, I will never get dehydrated.

I don't understand why other people with disabilities (the ones who support articles like this) suddenly expect the able-bodied world to provide everything we could ever need when they never have before.

Public toilets don't have free pads and tampons even though some women need them. Women have always had a responsibility to bring them.

If I expect a bar or restaurant to serve me a drink that's 100% accessible when I know I need a speciality tool (straw) should I also expect them to provide me arthritis friendly cutlery and a hip precaution chair? No, restaurants have always had whatever cutlery and the world's most uncomfortable stools.

I plan ahead, I bring my straw, I bring my cutlery, I bring my walking frame to sit on.

Having a disability means taking care of yourself. That means bringing a straw if you can't possibly go without a straw.

It's harsh but it's life. ""disability"" covers such a wide range, we all have incredibly varying, sometimes contraindicated needs (eg: low sensory spaces for people with ASD, bright well lit spaces for people with mild visual impairments). It's simply not practical for the world to always cater to our needs. 


#ALTERNATIVELY

Bars and restaurants can have a stash of reusable straws (silicone, pyrex, metal, there's a lots of options - they can be cleaned and sterilised in industrial dish washers just like cutlery, or washed out out with a pipe cleaner in the the sink.) keep them behind the counter until someone says ""do you have straws? I need one"" et viola, they use the straw and return it to the bar along with the glassware to be washed for next time.

1334,"This is definitely an issue for me. I have a couple strategies. First, I have a Costco membership for this reason only. They have an attendant at their stations who will pump, no problem. When they’re an option, they’re my first choice.

Second, I’m very purposeful about gas station choices. I only go to larger gas stations, because the smaller ones have the issue of only one employee. This limits me from many stations in my area, and I had to actively scope out options to find the bigger ones. But after research, I’ve found enough larger ones locally for this to not be a big deal. When I travel on longer trips, I just try to keep an eye out for good-looking larger stations. Big stops off the interstate are good. If I’m in a town, I’ll look up a couple stations beforehand and find one that is bigger. A little premeditation goes a long way. I always scope out options, and I try not to get myself low enough on gas that I’d have to try a bad station.

My third strategy is that I don’t honk for help like the signs all say (the exception to this is Costco, where that really does work fine). Those signs mostly seem like bullshit to me. No one inside the gas station is going to respond to a honk...plus no one likes honking. So I just pull up the gas station on my phone and call and ask for help when I’m there. If for some reason I can’t call, or I know I’m going inside anyway, I’ll ask in person.

1337,"It honestly depends on the place/situation. I have mild cp in which only my walking is affected. I don't use anything for assistance but my gait is very noticeable. Some places will give me a discount just on my appearance alone while others require documentation in order to grant access to those service/benefits. If I get a discount, great. If not, no biggie..I just pay full price.

I know the inconsistencies can suck. Back home I was able to get a disabled bus pass by just showing up and filling out an application at  local transportation HQ. No questions asked. A few years later I moved to a major city. And in order for me to get a discounted transportation card, l had to get my doctor to fill out some paperwork. Just walking into the transportation agency and telling them I have cp wasn't enough even though physically it's very obvious.  They needed it documented.  I've also had another organization tell me I had to be on SSI or have some kind of medical card in order to use their services(none of which I had). I very quickly learned that there is huge difference between being disabled and being disabled with documentation. 

Even with paperwork, not all disablilities are covered. For example, I think alcoholism can be considered a disability in CA but I highly doubt it's a covered conditon under most disabled discount policies that businesses chose to  provide. However, since they can't ask just carry some kind of proof with you(paperwork for your dog?Medicaid card?). Otherwise they have no way of knowing if people are just taking advantage of them.

I do think it's good that you are trying to clear this policy up with the zoo though.
