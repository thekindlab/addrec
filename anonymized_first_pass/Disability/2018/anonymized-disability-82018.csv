The trial work period that you described is for work, or earned income. The easy way to figure this out is if you pay Social Security taxes on the income, then it is earned, and it could potentially affect your benefits (or take up one of your trial work period months. 

Now for SSI (Supplemental Security Income), all income and all resources can affect your payment amount. This program is a needs based program, not a program based on your work history. 

The easy way to figure out which program you receive is to look a letter with your claim number at the top. If it ends in DI, then it is SSI. If it ends in HA, then it is Social Security Disability. It gets confusing because both programs have the same medical criteria, and they frequently work together. 

Sometimes, people receive benefits from both programs. If this is the case, then you would get SSI on the 1st of the month and Social Security Disability on the 3rd of the month. 

TLDR: Check your claim number, which should be your SSN followed by a letter code.
999-99-9999DI is SSI, and gifts could affect that
999-99-9999HA is Social Security Disability, and unearned Income has no effect.

It's not something that's done on purpose. A good example is American Sniper. He was doing his job. He did it well. It still causes PTSD. 

People with borderline characteristic are particularly susceptible. Borderline refers to Borderline Personality Disorder. It's more of an emotional control disorder that is poorly named and definitely not understood by the general population. The areas behind your temples have your emotional processing. It's call the Anterior Cingular Gyrus or Cortex. The brain has white matter and grey matter. More white matter in this area means less emotional control. The grey part has less connections because it's not as thick as average.

That’s a bit of a unicorn though. Definitely ask about backrest height, if there’s an adjustable camber bar, or what the centre of gravity is, if the back folds (a rigid back can be very difficult to load/unload from a car independent as I found out the hard way) if the footplate is adjustable, if the bearings are new or when they were last replaced, what size the wheels are - 24 inch wheels are much easier to find tyres for - the distance from the seat sling to the footplate, taking into account how thick your cushion is, how much bucket the seat has. 

TiLite tends to be really adjustable and the frames don’t have pre-drilled holes, so you have way more flexibility with making adjustments.

Also a few of them were posted by those close to the disabled people so if they are comfortable to show them in that sub then who are we to judge. 

I see you point and agree with you about the people making the disability the focus of the cuteness but I think that a little exposure and discussion around the disability that these posts make is more worth while than the demeaning attitude that may be created.

Its a complicated thing. 
On one hand, you deserve love just as much as any human being upon this earth. Your heart was made for this very thing. Your heart deserves love as much as flowers deserve sun. 

On the other hand, one must make the effort to procure this love. Deserving does not mean having. Like a flower that by misfortune or fate settles itself into a dark corner will surely die, “deserving” is a factor that matters little in what follows.

But see how even a flower, a simple little thing, strives with all its efforts to reach the light. It does not think whether it deserves the sun or not, it only follows what it was made to cherish. 

But you are not like a flower. For all its tender and delicate beauty, you are better, and far, far more powerful then a flower... For you do not have to be whim to capricious fate, like a flower helplessly doomed to die in a dark corner.

378,"Here's what I can remember from applying..... As many have told me, it is super difficult to get approved w/o a lawyer because sooo many people are applying for disability and they normally get rejected after their first attempt. So I had to get a lawyer after my disability was denied and I then requested to have my hearing in front of a judge. My lawyer was super helpful during this part since she knew exactly what to expect and what was needed. This particular lawyer was also recommend by the social worker who helped me fill out the initial forms. That's another thing - there's a lot of free resources who will help you with forms and terminology and all the stuff disability people will be looking for. But I understand you are housebound (I've been there myself) but it is super important you go to any and all dr. appointments so you have documented proof. Same with the mental health. That's so important. I dealt w/ both the physical and mental aspects myself. You can go to discounted clinics if you have no insurance (this is what I had to do) and the info they provided to disability was just as legit. Has disability contacted you and sent you to their approved doctor(s) to be evaluated yet? The hardship letter sounds new to me... But I did fill out tons and tons of forms so I don't remember everything. I had the same problems with gabapentin (and more) so I understand the suicide stuff. That's why I recommend addressing the mental health aspect too. I mean the judge at my hearing even asked if I was hospitalized for suicide attempts. So its sounds like it's not something they gloss over. But attending dr. appointments (physical and mental), taking all prescribed meds and documenting doses, along w/ their side effects, contacting your local ssi office to see if someone can help you with the forms, and finding a social worker to help you with the forms (and maybe they can help you find a lawyer if/when needed) is some of the best things you can do to help yourself and what was recommend to me by everyone. I went through this a year ago and will have to go through it all again next year so some of this is still fresh and I'm doing my best to jog my memory (despite all the side effects of my meds) so hopefully I've given you some decent advice and I'm sorry this got so long but I wish you all the best in this.

Things that would not have bothered me before loom much larger because I'm essentially trapped.

It seems older people struggle with not having things their way. My grandmother who is 90 couldn't handle the slightest bit of compromise, and my late 60s parents struggle with what appear to be reasonable requests. I think its just the result of decades of making all of the decisions.

Not only do they dislike compromise, they certainly don't like feeling that they need to justify themselves. I had the argument over half gallon vs full gallon, and it literally took 6 months to make the folks see that we were pouring milk down the drain because it would go bad before it was used, them we'd be out, It was a constant source of irritation if we had room for another full gallon etc.

To someone that has not been in this position, it might seem silly, but combine 15 or 20 of these issues and its death by a thousand paper cuts, it makes for an unpleasant time for all involved.

437,"Yes, unless it is retirement. Sometimes the letters omit the ""H"" which is just a way to note that the benefit is paid based on disability, not age. The way that claims numbers work is that the number (or SSN) refers to the earnings record that the benefit is based on. The letter after the number refers to the beneficiary's relationship to that earnings record. Ex: ""A"" means that the earnings record belongs to the beneficiary. ""C"" means that the earnings record belongs to the parent of the beneficiary. These are Beneficiary Identification Codes (BICs).

I couldn't find the exact POMS reference for the list of BICs, but the state of Washington has a list that appears accurate: https://www.dshs.wa.gov/book/export/html/1901

This applies to the Title 2 Program of the Social Security Act, or more commonly known and the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. The easy way to keep Disability and Retirement (Old Age) straight in your head is that the Disability benefit is roughly equal to the Retirement benefit at full retirement age and adjusted for the fact that an individual receiving disability benefits was not able to work as long as an individual who was not receiving disability.

Title 16 of the Social Security Act (Supplemental Security Income or SSI) is not related to an individual's work history. The claim number will always be the beneficiary's SSN followed by DI (Disabled Individual), BI (Blind Individual), AI (Aged Individual), DC (Disabled Child), or BC (Blind Child). Take that list with a grain of salt because it is based on my bad memory, so I am probably missing something.

Since Title 16 (SSI) is paid from general tax revenue, it is not necessary to link the claim to the earnings record. Since Title 2 (OASDI) is paid from a fund that is based on the contributions of workers from taxes on their wages, it is necessary to link the benefit to an earnings record in order to calculate the payment.

TLDR: Title 2 and Title 16 are very different programs with a few key similarities that really confuse people.

455,"Yeah I'm gonna break this down for you as simply as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your claim:  ""Being disabled doesn't make you 'bad.'""
   1. My opinion:  We agree.
2. Your claim:  ""People use religious arguments to shame disabled people.""
   1. My opinion:  We agree.
3. Your absurd conditionals:  ""IF someone is cursed, THEN that person deserves to be cursed.  People don't deserved to be cursed because they're disabled; therefore, they are not cursed.""
   1. My opinion:  **Disagree with your premise**.  I can conceive of a metaphysical entity - including but not limited to a deity - that is cruel, bigoted, and goes about cursing people for all sorts of reasons.  (One source:  The Bible.  Motivation:  To win a bet.)
4. Your claim (as you outlined it):  "" 'Cursed is not the same as bad luck.  Therefore, we are not cursed; we simply have bad luck.'""
   1. My opinion  **Disagree with your inference.**  Let's roll with ""cursed is not the same as bad luck.""  K, whatever.  What do we call it when some entity imposes bad luck on some other entity?  Would the word ""curse"" be a fair word for that?  That would mean that 'curse' is not \*synonymous\* with 'bad luck,' but it also isn't mutually exclusive, yes?  Check out this sentence:  ""I hereby curse you with bad luck.""  Could a deity say that?  Yuh-huh!  Would that deity have my respect?  Nope.

Unfortunately, you are so hell bent on your entitlement to these conflations that you simply won't address the actual points of contention.  Don't believe in God?  Okay.  If I do, does that mean that I like him?  Obviously not.  Since a belief in God doesn't entail a belief that God is morally legit, theism v. atheism is irrelevant to the conditional you're asserting.

You just cannot wrap your head around the idea that a metaphysically influential entity could ""curse someone with bad luck,"" because omg, if we imagine that, we must agree that Job is a bad dude.  Even the shitty authors of Job made it pretty clear that they don't think that.  I mean, there is an actual case study in the actual Bible of all texts, and it actually flat out says that Job was a decent, cursed dude.

Has it occurred to you that in all your carping about religion, a handful of moral entrepreneur a couple of millenia ago were somehow able to make a distinction that you're unable to make here?

Sure, those people took God's side.  Whether I believe in God or not, I don't, and I think that Job's a bit of a shmuck for going groveling back to this tyrant who tortured him for no good reason.

How do I feel about the 10 lepers?  Not so great.  Seems pretty shitty to ""curse"" 10 people with leprosy, cure them, and then belittle them for not thanking you for that.

This is all lost on you though, because of your absolutely unflappable assumption that the condition of being ""cursed"" necessarily entails the condition of being ""bad,"" as opposed to persecuted.

If you don't happen to believe in divine persecution, that's a metaphysical claim, not a moral one.  Yet, here you are, presuming to disagree with me on moral grounds, getting all worked up about all the ""spam"" and such.

This is not hard.  It's one inference.  One.  Your knee-jerk conflation of metaphysical shit with ethical shit is just something you pulled out of your ass, and ironically, for someone who has such a problem with religion, *even religious people widely accept the idea that one can be cursed without placing any kind of value judgment on that person whatsoever*.

Since you obviously did not even read the single Wikipedia article that I cited as a super introductory reference to this idea that you just cannot wrap your head around, I am copying and pasting part of it here:

Dystheists may themselves be theists or [atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists), and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of [Abrahamic faiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religion), will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, [malevolent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malevolent), particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in his [*Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God) (1741), [Jonathan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)),  a devout theist, describes a God full of vengeful rage and contempt,  seemingly different from one with Christ-like omnibenevolence. Such  absence of omnibenevolence is one kind of theist counterargument to the  notion that the [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) poses any great logical challenge to theism.

​

One particular view of dystheism, an atheistic approach, is summarized by the prominent [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary) [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), who wrote in [*God and the State*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_and_the_State)  that ""if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him"".  Bakunin argued that, as a ""jealous lover of human liberty, and deeming  it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in  humanity"", the ""idea of God"" constituted of metaphysical [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression) of the idea of human choice.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-3) Said argument is an inversion of [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)'s phrase ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary for man to invent Him"".

​

Political theorist and activist [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) similarly wrote in [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason),  ""Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the  cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with  which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent  that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God."" He added,  ""It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize  mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest  everything that is cruel.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-4)  Unlike Bakunin, however, Paine's condemnation of the purported nature  of the divine from his time didn't extent to outright atheism and  disbelief in all spirituality, Paine stating that he accepted the [deistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deistic) notion of an almighty mover behind all things.",,False,,SpanishPenisPenis,,,1535109995,t5_2qhe8,t3_99hk8b,t1_e4orv0e,1,1537878227,0,0,e4qwkem,disability,,,,"Yeah I'm gonna break this down for you as simply as I can.

488,"I really think you could have included a further comments section, but I guess I'll put it here. 

I did finally go back and complete it, still had the same difficulties with ""mental illness"" being used to describe Autism and that causing me confusion on some questions, like the one I said previously where I don't expect mentally ill people OR NT people to have much hope of understanding me, but I got through.

A few things:

I was misdiagnosed and horribly mismedicated as a kid. Due to the wiring differences that cause autism, it is not unusual for medication to have unpredictable, atypical, and often horrific affects and side affects for people with autism. 

I specifically and purposely avoid what ""mental health care"" is accessible at my income in my location because I'm practically guarenteed to be misdiagnosed and mismedicated, and if I won't take a med I know I don't need for a condition I know I don't have (I have had a private evaluation done by a leading neuropsychologist, so I know I do not have the things they try to dx me with) and I know will make me very physically ill or extremely mentally unstable, I will lose my SSI for refusal of medical treatment, and myself, my carer, and my cats will all die. If I take the med, I may kill us all in a fit of crazy, or be entirely unable to keep up on my obligations and we all die anyway. I must be incredibly careful with medication, even non-psychiatric medication. I've gone entirely mentally unstable from migraine meds, thyroid meds, and a variety of other things that should not have caused the reactions they did, but nearly cost me my life or everything I love. 

I avoid ERs and unfamiliar medical professionals for the same reasons. I have a wonderful primary physician, who very much lets me walk in, tell him what we believe to be wrong based on my very atypical sensory processing, we talk, rule anything else out, and then we discuss which options are available and would work, and just as often as the doctor I'm the one picking the treatment. If it doesn't work, I discontinue use and book another appointment. 

We recently (over the course of a few discussions and through much research by both parties) realized I have developed hypermobility due to my issues with proprioception. He suggested a similar condition, I went home and researched for about 60 hours total over the course of a couple weeks, I came back and told him I believed he was *almost* right, and why I thought it was hypermobility (can be caused by proprioception difficulties) and not the other condition (believed to be genetic), showed him the criteria and screening tests and pointed out where I definitely exceeded the diagnostic criteria. 

I asked if he had any ideas on mobility aids and supports, he said he wasn't sure, I said how about we start with x, y, and z? I got the supports I wanted, and have been able to do more than I have in years since I got them, and now I've got a few ideas for others that might be helpful next time I'm in. 

This is entirely indicative of our overall relationship. He trusts my carer and I to make sound decisions and to have an idea of what's wrong and what might help in a way I haven't seen other doctors do. He allows me to have my carer in the room as a reasonable accommodation, despite the huge push to ban people from bringing friends, relatives, or supports of the opposite sex because of the potential for hiding abuse, allows us to speak interchangeably, if I'm semi or non verbal, my carer can speak, and I can chime in or not as needed. 

These are all things that have been major issues elsewhere and why I will only see two medical professionals, my doctor, and when I can afford $400 and $100 to bribe a ride my neuropsych. The results of seeing other doctors have universally been worse than the original problem, and in my opinion, in some cases worse than death.

*From N8theGr8[M]:*

There are a range of posts that would be allowed, and a range of posts that wouldn't be allowed under our current rules. ""This person has X"" solely as the title would get removed, for example. ""This person has X and is going to Disney world!"" might get removed, but might not. ""This person is going to Disney world!"" would not get removed. It's all about how they frame the title.

No one posts ""awww, look at this disabled person"". There's always some kind of feel-good/uplifting backstory to go along with it. If we entirely banned the topic of disabled people under rule 1, then we would be declaring that everything about disabled people is inherently sad. We'd be excluding them from the subreddit entirely. Personally, I think that's much worse.

*To N8theGr8[M]:*

I'm not sure how modmail works entirely. Are you able to see my conversation with the other mod? I'm only asking because you said ""this person has x disability and is doing x activity"" might be removed, but I linked 6(?) posts with titles like that and none of them were removed (with one exception because of a fundraising issue). I'm not really sure where you guys draw the line.

I'm not looking to ban disabled people, but I think a rule being in place about posts having to be cute outside of the disability would be helpful. I'm fine if it's a post about someone's pet and the person happens to be disabled, but I think it's harmful to have the disability be the focus of the post. An example of a ""bad"" post would be one I saw(/linked if you can see that) of a disabled person going to prom. In that post, the ""cuteness"" is pretty directly just him being disabled.

*From N8theGr8[M]:*

&gt;Are you able to see my conversation with the other mod?

Yes, all of us can see the entire thing. This is a difficult topic and I assume that most of us are unsure how to respond, myself included.

&gt;might be removed, but I linked 6(?) posts with titles like that and none of them were removed

Emphasis on might be removed. The ones you can see weren't removed. There are ones you can't see that were removed.

&gt;I'm not looking to ban disabled people

Sorry, but that's the impression that you're giving.

&gt;but I think it's harmful to have the disability be the focus of the post.

We actually agree with you here. Like I said, if the title were just ""This person has X"" then it would get removed.

Sometimes it's not entirely clear, and sometimes there is something else in the title to give it further consideration. It's very difficult to us to create a hard and fast objective rule for something as subjective as what ""sad"" means. We try very hard to thread the needle between what's sad and what's not. It's usually up to moderator discretion. Sometimes we have backroom discussions when we're unsure or something isn't clear. We're unpaid volunteers doing this in our free time.

We get thousands of posts a day, and when it's not clearly focusing on a disability, we usually err on the side of leaving up the content and allowing community discussion and education. If you see a post that you think is exploitative, feel free to leave a comment in the thread educating people about it with sources for further reading.

*To N8theGr8[M]:*

I think part of the problem is that it falls under ""sad"" content. I didn't think these posts were even reportable because to me, disabilities aren't sad, they're just my life.

I'm curious, though, if I made a post saying ""my gay/Mexican/trans/etc friend did x mundane activity"" would that also be expected to be reported as sad content?

*From N8theGr8[M]:*

It would probably get reported, but it doesn't mean we'd remove it. Like I said, it would depend on the title and the image content. I don't think there's anything sad about being gay, Mexican, or trans, but obviously the topics themselves are all controversial to one degree or another.

Both my daughters have special needs as well, so to a small degree I understand where you're coming from, but we try to be impartial and maintain objective standards. Sometimes we just prefer to let the community decide what content gets upvoted.

*To N8theGr8[M]:*

To me and countless others, there's nothing sad about being disabled either, so I don't understand why those posts should be reported as such.

The problem many of us have with that is that we're a small community that's easily talked over. A lot of us can't speak up for ourselves and those of us who can are constantly infantilized/talked down to to the point of not being taken seriously. That's why these posts are so dangerous to us.

It's two sides of the same messed up coin, which is why I always say that it's even better to ask than to assume--but then even that presents its own slew of problems.

Even though I am wary of these types of presentations because of the danger of generalization, I do still believe they should exist, if for no other reason than to allow someone to express what they feel can't be understood.

The main problem with disability, as well as it’s negative connotations, is that when someone or something is disabled in one sense, it means they’re unable to, or are being stopped from, being able to do anything. So when able people who haven’t had anything to do with disabled people think of a disabled person, they’ll think of a paralysed person in a wheelchair who’s dependent on a carer rather than someone visually impaired, or someone deaf, or someone autistic who are certainly intelligent and independent enough to lead normal lives, despite the challenges their disability throws at them.",,False,,ymca_destroyer,,,1534837805,t5_2qhe8,t3_98v59x,t1_e4k6180,1,1537765227,0,0,e4k6dn8,disability,,,,,

691,"I think if you no longer love her or even if you do love her but are genuinely worried this is an abusive relationship you should break up. Painful as it is, you don't actually need a reason to break up with someone and how her life develops after that is not on you - harsh as that sounds. You sound like you genuinely care about what happens to her after, I mean you guys have been together for 8 years, of course you care. 

Having said that, a couple of things stood out to me. The way you've written (apologies if I've misinterpreted) sounds like she didn't display abusive traits for the majority of your 8 year relationship and that this behaviour is new. It sounds like it may actually be possible that the change in meds is really having some sort of effect on her mood - perhaps by increasing irritability and decreasing her ability to stay in a stable/rational emotional state. I think she has given the meds 3 months and it's possible these side-effects are not going away so she really needs to see a doctor, probably a different one, and tell them that this is 100% not working for her. 

The other thing is your care-giving. Mixing an intimate relationship with the expectation of care-giving is tough. I'm sure there are people who make it work but for the most part it's a really difficult path to navigate and a huge responsibility. If she is unable to function in her daily life, which it kind of sounds like she is, then she needs to look into getting the support she needs for that. She needs to learn how to achieve whatever independence she has on her own, within the confines of her disability. I have a very severe disability and sometimes I suffer from long periods of chronic pain or fatigue. It sucks but I still have to fight for the care I need so I can get up and go to the bathroom. That's not my SO's responsibility. Just because a person is disabled and has serious limitations doesn't mean they're not responsible for taking charge of their life and independence. You are doing her a favour but you are not her employee or her care-giver and there is clearly a blurring of the lines here that is too much for you. I hope that makes sense.

If you decide you want to work on it, it's only going to work if a) she takes active steps to deal with the meds issue b) you take a step back from the care-giving and make it clear that she clearly needs more help than you are able to give and c) you set in place a time limit for how long you want to try that feels fair.",,False,,TinyLittleStormCloud,,,1533460914,t5_2qhe8,t3_94o5xp,t3_94o5xp,4,1537098679,0,0,e3n0ur7,disability,,,,,

704," u/edwardrotik mentioned you are looking for perspectives on disability and sexuality.

Looking at the theme you're wanting, there could be a lot of ground to cover, but I'll try and stay focused on the perception of disability that you mentioned to ed.

I think that the perception of disabled people as sexual beings  is difficult for not just the able bodied, but the disabled. My disability came later in life through injury, so I can't speak for those born disabled. That being said, one I of the biggest hurdles I faced in regaining my sexuality was the previous destruction of my identity.

In a span of three years I went from being strong and healthy to laying in a bed in pain. I lost the ability to work. I couldn't play with my dog. Couldn't clean up after myself. I couldn't even read a book because I just couldn't focus.

Sex was so far down the list of priorities I can't say that I even thought about it until months after I got access to reliable treatment.

The change from being a self determined adult male (known as a grown ass man in my area) to a lump of bloated flesh was not one that left room for the idea that I could ever find a partner. Why would anyone want to tie themselves to that for the long term? And it's not like someone looking for a hookup is going to deal with the hassles involved in getting the right positions, being careful to avoid injury, and all the other crap that goes with unreliable bodies.

Until I got past that, there was no possibility that someone would because I'd never encounter them.

My disability isn't visible if I'm careful and don't want it to be. If Im not on my cane, or I'm sitting comfortably, it doesn't interfere in anything. So the views of others isn't the same as it is for a visible disability. I don't have to deal with the stares or pitying condescension. I can be myself and interact with others in a way that by the time they see me hobbling around, they're past that barrier of pity, or fear.

And that's the biggest barrier on the part of others. You can't catch disability, but that fear is still there. When it isn't, the sickly pity usually is. You aren't a person, you're a disease or injury with a body.

By the time sexuality enters the picture, you've already got a heavy strike against the opportunity of finding a partner. Whatever other flaws you may have may be less glaring, but they're a darn good excuse for a person to flee.

So I had to turn it into something positive. By the time I met my now wife, I had accepted that if I ever had a partner, I could be certain it wasn't because of looks, or money, or infatuation and lust. You don't decide to go long term with a middle aged disabled guy unless it's real.

But that dread of being alone didn't fade until after I had sex for the first time with her. So much could go wrong. I couldn't do the athletic, bouncy type of sex big guys tend to get chosen for.  What if things don't work at all?  What if, what if, what if. 

What's silly is my wife is disabled too, so is not like she wasn't afraid of similar things.

It took a few months of rediscovering how to share bodies with the limitations. But sex is so much better than when I was younger and healthy. I *know* how important and powerful  that human connection is in a way that I couldn't before facing decades of pain filled solitude. It made me a better partner.

That's why the only way to really change how people think about disability and sexuality is to make it a subject open for discussion. When someone asks how does it work, you tell them. You field the silly questions and ignore the condescension until they get that aha  moment that we aren't disabilities with bodies.",,False,,southsamurai,,,1535664765,t5_2qhe8,t3_9bluu1,t3_9bluu1,7,1538498213,0,0,e54cq8q,disability,,,,,

793,"I had to switch primary care doctors a little bit ago and we went to one expecting they would follow the care instructions outlined by my specialist out of state and that was not the case. They wouldn't support a single thing that was prescribed. We were livid and tried for almost two weeks to convince them this is what I need to survive. Eventually we decided that we weren't going to be able to get the care I needed from them and I had to start over with another doctor. 

I remember feeling so defeated. What if we go through this whole thing again and the doctor still won't help. You also start believing you are never going to get better because you aren't getting the help you need. 

For me the switch was amazing. I couldn't ask for a better doctor. We are on the same page about everything and she really likes to learn. I told her office before I came in that I had POTS and she actually read up on the condition before I came in and has done so much research since. 

It is so important that you have a positive relationship with your primary care doctor.

803,"It's very, very difficult to get disability. It can take years to get approved during which time you can be financially disqualified for receiving private assistance or even just *trying* to work so you can maybe eat something, you need a ton of medical and other documentation, and if you are under 50, you have to prove you're completely incapable of any available job in the entire country even with retraining. Most people have to appeal at least once, and twice is not uncommon. Then you have to reprove it every few years (the exact number based on their opinion of your prognosis, which is very different from your actual prognosis. I have a disability that has absolutely zero chance of ever improving, and I have to reprove that, yes, I haven't gotten a brain transplant or been magically neurologically rewired every 2-3 years. If I don't have substantial medical evidence that I haven't been magically cured of something incurable, I will be assumed to have been magically cured and rejected) 

If she's on disability, she's simply not capable of working enough to earn any sort of livable income. 

The thing with epilepsy is you are ok, until you aren't, and while there are things you can do to reduce seizure occurance (avoiding your triggers, which can include things people don't mention as often as lights, like temperature and stress) there's no universal way to entirely prevent them, and very little advance notice/few good ways of predicting an oncoming seizure. An ounce of prevention, and all that, it may be essential to her health to spend a good amount of time around the house. It may be exactly *why* she's capable of appearing able to you. 

Also, she may require very expensive seizure meds or other ongoing care she'd be unable to afford with employment, and be qualified for medicaid or medicare solely on the basis of receiving disability. If she were disqualified, she would no longer qualify for medicaid or medicare and lose the coverage she needs to remain alive and capable of appearing able to you.  

None of that really matters, what matters is can they pay what ya'll agreed upon or not. If they're making their share, how they make their share is irrelevant. If you are doing weekly or bi-weekly payments, perhaps she needs to pay what she is able out of her disability once a month, and then he pays the difference on schedule, or some other more agreeable arrangement, but if they are attempting to live beyond their means and not able to pay what you asked, it isn't your obligation as  to accommodate that, disability or not. 

If, however, you mean ""struggling"" as in they can't afford everything you think is necessary after paying you, that's pretty typical for people on disability and not any of your business, honestly, unless they're expecting you to feed them when they can't afford it or some shit. Disability is simply not enough to meet the standards some people think of as basic needs and comforts. 

Your rent is never going to be the 30% of your income they say it ought to be, and you're never going to be affording everything you need, let alone everything you want, but if you can budget to meet major needs like rent, bills, and enough food to remain alive, then you are doing alright comparatively.

If you have had stomach issues with the Naproxen I'd really advise against taking it at all until you have seen your new doc, though I do completely understand if you have to. I was in exactly your position about 15 years ago with another NSAID, was dismissed by my doctor, kept taking it, fucked up my stomach permanently. Whole class of useful drugs gone like that. A certain amount of damage is reversible but once you get past that point you're a tad fucked. 

There are other options, there are a class of NSAID's called 'selective COX-2 inhibitors' which are still NSAID's but without the risk of ulcers that come with more traditional drugs like Naproxen. Ask your doc and make sure to emphasise that you've had stomach pain on the Naproxen before. 

Ah this was the paragraph I got to before. Man I was absolutely hammering my keyboard I was so fucking furious at reading this the first time. Not only did a neuro remove you from an established routine apparently 'just because', they threw you cold turkey off Ropinerole (a fucking horrible drug to withdraw from) and then put you on a whacking great dose of Gabapentin...and then cold turkey again off that...

I was legitimately shouting inside my head reading this the first time. I've been on Gabapentin and while I found it very useful for pain it absolutely messed with me sense of reality until I settled. And that was me on a very slow titration. I just cannot imagine the suffering you must have been through and I want to give you the biggest, squishiest hug reading all that. I cannot in a million years imagine. That neuro needs a swift kick to the face every morning for the rest of their life because that's so far from good practice it's unreal. Thank goodness for your PCP.

I'd imagine the shot mentioned was probably an epidural steroid or similar, where a steroid is injected directly into the disk space to help reduce inflammation and reduce your immune response to that injury. They last a varying amount of time dependant on the person but my clinic does them every six months. There are also trigger point injections which are muscle focused, many small injections of an anaesthetic, steroid or botox into the affected area. That's not going to do much for your crushed discs but might help depending on your dystonia. I don't know what your long term options would be really as with osteoperosis, long term steroid use is a concern. 

Is there another pain clinic in the area you could see? Or if you had a better idea of what treatment was available, would you be willing to discuss it with your PCP and be referred back to the same one? Have you ever looked into therapies that can be used at home like a TeNS machine, these can be a great relief and are very cheap nowadays to try even if it doesn't work out for you.  

That's great that you're already aware of the manual chairs. Have you thought about trying it on a good day, rather than waiting for the day you're completely worn out and need assistance half way through? Moving as long as possible without help can still be a goal, but it doesn't need to be something you're doing 100% of the time. If you're walking from your kitchen to your bathroom that's moving unaided but in a safe environment, rather than in a supermarket where you've got a whole long way to go and the mental focus of shopping too. 

I appreciate what you're saying about your daughter, it's a lot for a kid that age to see. Having been in that situation I was also in the 'must do all the things in front of the preteen' camp which as you've discovered doesn't do either of you any favours in the long term.

 * Accommodations. Okay you don't feel you need them now, but if you end up with an extra duty or a promotion you might in the future. Your boss is likely to be unhappy you've kept your disability private even if it hasn't affected your work. 

 * Safety. If something happens to you at work and you are carted off in an ambulance, it's useful for them to be able to give an outline of major medical issues. A historical TBI is a major medical issue. 

 * Honesty. If you've been upfront about your disability from the start you don't have to worry about hiding it from co-workers and bosses. I've kept my epilepsy quiet from people before (social group, not work) and it's hard to completely shut off things that impact your life. With other people I'd missed x major event/gained an injury/was feeling a bit off due to illness. With that group I had to evade or lie, and it was not worth it. It can come up in completely unrelated and unexpected situations. 

Cons to disclosing;

* Some people are judgemental fucks. The person hiring and firing ***should not know*** about your disability disclosure on your application, however...out here in the real world people talk. Legal or not, sometimes it happens.

* Questions in interview. You are right that they are not allowed to ask about your disability but you may get some questions skirting around the issue, asking without asking. Decide in advance how you'd like to address these and if you want to be with a company that hovers around the rules that way. Sometimes it's relevant depending on the job duties. Other times it's a 'people with disabilities are unreliable and we're trying to gauge how sick you are' attitude. I address it upfront with a two liner explaining that I have closely examined the job description and though I have some mobility restrictions, I am fully capable of all skills required. Generally does the job. 

* Issues that you have may be blamed on your disability where on others they'd be having a 'bad day' or 'issues at home'. This is harder to deal with long term as a disability is not short term and people are more likely to remember. Largely down to your boss' attitude. 


A final point. If a workplace will illegally discriminate against you for your disability, there's going to be some bleed into other company attitudes. You're going to be spending a very large amount of your week with these people. Unless it's a job you do mostly alone or a quick stop on the way to something better, that's going to have an impact on your emotional well-being. If a company discriminates and you disclose, they won't even be on your radar as you won't hear back.

953,"Well crap. I'd never, ever recommend hopping up stairs without a stable railing, not with my luck. I'd suspect the bum is the way to go here. Save your clothes and carry a beach towel for wet weather; I remember rain and mud was a particular horror on stairs, even discounting the slippage possibilities. Fold the mess on the underside of the towel (if you use one) in an 'inside' manner before stuffing it in a plastic bag, that way you can use it to get back inside the house, saves towels. Won't be much help in a downpour but for some light snow or rain, worked okay. Pretty sure I wouldn't rec a garbage bag on the stairs to protect your behind during nasty days; I know it seems like a good idea at the time but slippery is slippery when plastic is involved.  

Have you thought about how to get a wheelchair up the stairs?  If you're approved, definitely look into how to fold the models available up before requesting one, otherwise it could be exceedingly difficult to get it up and down the stairs, particilarly with no leverage and nothing to prop yourself up with. I used a walker at a snails pace and the roomie had to be my eyes (actually, at the time I'm certain some of the snails could've left me in their dust) but wheelchairs tend to be a mite heavier, obviously, and more bulky than a walker. Questions you should be asking yourself are ""How do I carry a wheelchair up a flight of stairs with a broken leg when there's no railing to lean on for leverage?""

The walker I could handle myself with quite a bit of practice, barring both detail and anything that I'd need to see more than a couple feet in front of me, but I think a wheelchair might cause  issues if you're not used to handling one by yourself.  I'd stick with something you can move with one hand, personally, since a ramp is not in your immediate future.

*To /r/aww:*

Hi,

I noticed there's been seemingly more and more posts about disabled people in the subreddit recently. Posts about disabled people in a subreddit for cute animals and babies are extremely patronizing, especially if the person in the post is an adult. I'll admit there's a bit of a gray area when it comes to posts about people doing nice things for disabled people, but in other posts (https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/97cdjl/my_friend_duncan_qualified_for_the_2018_world/?utm_source=reddit-android), it seems the cutesy factor is simply that the person is disabled. Being disabled isn't cute and treating us as nothing more than inspirational stories to gawk at on the internet detracts from our ability to be taken seriously as people/adults. As a 21 year old woman in a wheelchair, I don't think it's fair for me or people like me to be seen on the same level as puppies simply for existing. If you would like to read a couple of other opinions on this, here is a post from r/disability -- https://np.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/95dcgb/does_anyone_else_feel_frustrated_whenever_a_story/?utm_source=reddit-android. I would love to talk to you guys more about this, if you'd like.

Thank you

We have 10 rules on this sub, in addition to Reddit's TOS. If you spot a post which breaks one of those rules, please report it so we can deal w/ it on a case by case basis. Otherwise, people post what they want and we don't want to stop them. If you don't feel a post belongs in this sub, downvote it. If it breaks the rules, report it.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

The problem is that it currently doesn't break any rules, so there's nothing to report. The question is whether or not there should be a rule against it. In the post that I linked, the only ""cute"" thing in the post was the fact that he's disabled. That's something disabled people generally aren't comfortable with.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

I'm sorry, but we can't make customized rules for every single person, or even every single group.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Part of the problem is that other groups of people don't get posted there. You'd know better than I would because I'm not a mod so I don't see every single post, but I don't think I've ever seen a post about someone's black/female/Asian/gay/etc friend running a marathon or getting their nails done. We're the only group that's held on the same level as pets and babies.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

Stick around. We get posts like that on occasion. They usually end up locked because someone will see the very presence of a person of color or any kind of LGBT material as ""virtue signaling."" I've personally seen comments like ""black person; prepare for front page."" Give me a minute and I'll find examples.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/8xcvrs/16_year_old_finds_out_hes_accepted_to_harvard/

Thread locked and comments crying tokenism deleted.

https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7xw35c/they_both_had_a_plan_to_propose_to_each_other/

Reported over 100 times and I was accused of virtue signaling for defending them against homophobic comments in the thread.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

First post: the cute aspect was his reaction, not the fact that he's black (despite what the comments might have said) since the OP didn't even mention the fact that he's black.

Second post: the cute aspect was again their reactions and the fact that they proposed at the same time, not the fact that they were gay -- which, again, the OP didn't mention them being gay.

The difference between those posts and the ones I'm talking about is the fact that one's featuring disabled people specifically make a point of highlighting the fact that they're disabled. In the post I linked, outside of the fact that his friend had down syndrome, what was cute about that post?

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

You want to know the real point of that post? Fundraising. OP was trying to raise money for his friend to be in the Special Olympics. So no, he was not exploiting the guy, but the post still broke our rules and was pulled for that reason.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Which is why I reported it. Here's a few other posts that for some reason needed to highlight the fact that these people are disabled.

At this point I feel like this discussion is going nowhere and I'm not sure what you want out of it. If we ban posts of disabled people, then we'll be accused of ableism (i.e. pretending the disabled don't exist). If we don't ban them, we get accused of exploiting the disabled, as you've done. As a mod team, we can't win either way. What would you do in our situation?

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

If you get accused of ableism, you can point out that this was a concern brought up by actual disabled people who felt strongly enough about it to message you and make their own post at r/disability. It's actually seen as ableist by a lot of us to allow the kinds of posts that infantilize disabled people. Posts like ""my disabled mom has a cat"" shouldn't be any more acceptable or ""cute"" than ""my black friend has a dog"". Would a post like ""my friend took my Asian brother to prom"" be acceptable for the sub? Mentioning that we're disabled isn't necessary and adds nothing to the conversation/subreddit other than to normalize gawking at disabled people. It's less about banning disabled people and more about us not being the subject of a bunch of people fawning over us for no reason.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

But in practice it would essentially involve singling out disabled people and banning them from being featured on the sub. I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything we can do. As I said, we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. We're never going to agree, so this will be my final word on the matter.

*To /r/aww:*

Hi,

I noticed there's been seemingly more and more posts about disabled people in the subreddit recently. Posts about disabled people in a subreddit for cute animals and babies are extremely patronizing, especially if the person in the post is an adult. I'll admit there's a bit of a gray area when it comes to posts about people doing nice things for disabled people, but in other posts (<URL>), it seems the cutesy factor is simply that the person is disabled. Being disabled isn't cute and treating us as nothing more than inspirational stories to gawk at on the internet detracts from our ability to be taken seriously as people/adults. As a 21 year old woman in a wheelchair, I don't think it's fair for me or people like me to be seen on the same level as puppies simply for existing. If you would like to read a couple of other opinions on this, here is a post from r/disability -- <URL> I would love to talk to you guys more about this, if you'd like.

Thank you

We have 10 rules on this sub, in addition to Reddit's TOS. If you spot a post which breaks one of those rules, please report it so we can deal w/ it on a case by case basis. Otherwise, people post what they want and we don't want to stop them. If you don't feel a post belongs in this sub, downvote it. If it breaks the rules, report it.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

The problem is that it currently doesn't break any rules, so there's nothing to report. The question is whether or not there should be a rule against it. In the post that I linked, the only ""cute"" thing in the post was the fact that he's disabled. That's something disabled people generally aren't comfortable with.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

I'm sorry, but we can't make customized rules for every single person, or even every single group.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Part of the problem is that other groups of people don't get posted there. You'd know better than I would because I'm not a mod so I don't see every single post, but I don't think I've ever seen a post about someone's black/female/Asian/gay/etc friend running a marathon or getting their nails done. We're the only group that's held on the same level as pets and babies.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

Stick around. We get posts like that on occasion. They usually end up locked because someone will see the very presence of a person of color or any kind of <LOCATION> material as ""virtue signaling."" I've personally seen comments like ""black person; prepare for front page."" Give me a minute and I'll find examples.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

<URL>

Thread locked and comments crying tokenism deleted.

<URL>

Reported over 100 times and I was accused of virtue signaling for defending them against homophobic comments in the thread.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

First post: the cute aspect was his reaction, not the fact that he's black (despite what the comments might have said) since the OP didn't even mention the fact that he's black.

Second post: the cute aspect was again their reactions and the fact that they proposed at the same time, not the fact that they were gay -- which, again, the OP didn't mention them being gay.

The difference between those posts and the ones I'm talking about is the fact that one's featuring disabled people specifically make a point of highlighting the fact that they're disabled. In the post I linked, outside of the fact that his friend had down syndrome, what was cute about that post?

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

You want to know the real point of that post? Fundraising. OP was trying to raise money for his friend to be in the Special Olympics. So no, he was not exploiting the guy, but the post still broke our rules and was pulled for that reason.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Which is why I reported it. Here's a few other posts that for some reason needed to highlight the fact that these people are disabled.

1049,"I'm super lucky and have MS along with visual issues, which is fun because MSers have insane mental illness rates. Including me. I'd say the difference is that there are things you can try for most mental illnesses (like, one of the major issues is bipolar people not being taken seriously/treated properly). For the depression, anxiety, etc. there are so many things we can try. I have agency and hope: Maybe we can balance my brain and this won't be forever! 

MS itself, on the other hand, is incurable and currently the drugs are to slow progression, not stop it. Generally, once I lose function, it's gone forever. There's nothing I can do about it. Things are only going to get worse. Like, one focus in suicide prevention is the idea that things can change/be better. Well... for some of us, it doesn't.  There's no better. **EVER**. Even if we all had healthcare access tomorrow and society stopped being asshats about disability, we wouldn't be better.

The reason I take detailed lists is that I had a therapist, a very nice individual, that I don't believe took my complaints of miscommunication very seriously despite that I tried to paint a broad picture of general difficulties. I'm guessing he also forgot the list of disabilities, because I suggested I mimic typing as I'm better at the written word than verbal communication - to be clear, I was using mimicry in an attempt to order my thoughts in a clearer manner.  I got nerves, it didn't make anything clearer that session, and so he spent the rest of the totality of our time together casually dismissing everything I said out of therapy. (He also ran a support group for trans people, is how there was contact outside of therapy). When I requested ideas for communication support I was referred to support for basic living, which had nothing to do with communication and the anxiety issues therein. How he described the place involved considerably more communication than was actually in evidence. I was indescribably displeased.

So now I take *detailed* lists.

For applying for disability, I usually answered that question when the pcp asks if I'm working.

\-It also helps to take detailed lists because I tend to overfocus, both face to face and in font.

1260,"Ask your doctor and PT if you have one please. No-one here will be able to give you as good advice as they can as we are all different. 

As a full-time wheelchair user, heading to the weight room does *not* make up for sitting on your arse all day. Going from cane (support on one side, standing) to chair (full support, seated) is a very big jump. You're looking at changes to your BP, lung capacity, muscle tone, bone density (no weight bearing), skin issues and so on. 

With the given information if you are currently managing with a cane I'd suggest crutches or a rollator before a wheelchair. Crutches allow you to put weight on both sides of your body, make your disability visible and you can sit or lean whenever you reach a wall or seat. A rollator allows you to walk with minimal support when you can, walk with support on the frame when needed, and provides both a seat when you are tired and a place to carry your shopping. Both allow you far more mobility overall than a manual wheelchair. 

You are very sensible to worry about long term atrophy (muscle loss). It's not just your legs that go, any muscle capacity affected by posture is damaged by long-term wheelchair use as are the issues above. My wheelchair use is obligatory and I've lost a scary amount of lung function despite all my efforts. I have an imbalance in my upper body from always moving one way despite being fit because our bodies didn't evolve for an upper body pushing motion. There are a whole tonne of issues from long term wheelchair use that many people don't consider and it seriously concerns me when I see people who can physically move their legs changing to a wheelchair without trying the inbetween options. 

Keep moving on your legs as long as your doctors approve, even when it is difficult or part time. Ask them about different pain relief; trigger point injections, nerve blocks, TeNS machines, NMS, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy. Alternative therapies like actupuncture are also helpful for some people. 

I don't give a fuck what your parents think and neither should you. I appreciate it's hard to ignore them, even more so if you are young (you don't mention your age) but don't put their opinions above your health. DO put your doctor and PT's opinions way up high. I joke that the Spanish Inquisition is alive and well in the form of physiotherapists but most of them do an excellent job at keeping us at as high capacity as we can expect to be.

1348,"I do the same, but having no expectations is far more reasonable. When you stop expecting people to behave is when you are truly free. I'm not talking outlandish behavior in expectations, no matter how close we are to them, we aren't chimps any longer and no one will tolerate a certain amount of behavior.

To expect people to be mindful of what they see and have ingrained human response too is much to ask. You don't matter, I don't matter. You don't step on me, and I don't step on you. You will always have that mutual respect with me. And if I get to know you as a person, I will never treat you infantile unless I feel it is deserved.

But to ask a complete stranger to have personal empathy with you, is asking too much. If you have a physical disability and it's obvious, there is a certain amount of empathy ingrained to treat this person in a delicate manner. Sometimes people personalize that as treating a child, delicate empathic and caring. Yes, that marginalizes you in a certain manner, but if that behavior continues as person gets to know you, then they would be completely out of line.

But, as a whole, it's a very good sign that people would want to treat you in a delicate and empathic manner. Take solace that your plate is so full that you can pick and chose when your empathic actions can and should take place. I got no such treatment. When you aren't visibly disabled, and you can rationalize the way I can, it's  a hard sell at a glance. And to expect people to treat me in a special manner, without any sort of clue, is asking too much.

I need help with managing my life on a daily basis. I forget to take a shit somedays and wonder why my stomach has been hurting all day. I'm that disconnected from my personal self.

My life was cold hard and uncaring. I was treated as a normal child, when I was anything but. But I had parents that gave a shit and wasn't abused like I didn't matter, forced into parameters that weren't me, boxed and caged like an animals at times. Then maybe I could have better expectations of people. So, yeah, I find it hard to rationalize that people should have the magical expectation and go against the grain of what is obvious human behavior in everyday life. So you see, that how, in my shoes, your complaint might see a bit ridiculous. I know what people are like. I have seen that best and worst of humanity, and committed both acts.

Yeah, it's hard for me to rationalize personal empathy when you have so much of it. Your telling me your plate is so full that it's an insult to add more. I'm starving over here, and you're complaint is having too much. Do understand the disconnect?

Cursory glance you might mistake me for any joe blow without a care in the world. You might think I'm privileged for walking as I do, with both my legs and arms. What you don't see is an emotional scarring so deep that it has driven a wedge between myself and society in general.

And there are millions and millions of people like me and worse, yet I somehow don't have the correct take on people. Yeah, I guess. 

On the surface a vast majority might treat you a bit too kindly, but I'm almost sure that if anyone get to know you for any personal amount of time, doesn't continue to treat you that way. And if I was present, it wouldn't fly. But it's too much to ask complete strangers to be mindful in minor social interactions of no consequence. The world is too big and to large for you to matter enough get special treatment in that regards.

Take solace in those that do, they are special people. For the vast majority care for you like those bugs you kill on the way to your car. That is how I was raised, in a cold hard world of that reality. So I expect it out of you. I treat you as I expect to be treated.

There are no laws or rules about it and you really shouldn’t feel bad because it’s not like you’re an able bodied person using a chair just to get an advantage like skipping ques. Aids like wheelchairs are about quality of life not just a last resort and if that’s the way to enable you to get as much enjoyment out of the day as the rest of your family with being held back by your disability then it’s absolutely a valid choice. 

You will probably find you get some funny looks by some other members of the public if they see you getting out of the chair to stand or walk a short distance (say onto a ride or something) but that’s just because many people are sadly uneducated about disabilities and don’t understand how disabilities that effect mobility without completely paralysingly your legs work. Don’t let their ignorance effect you. I don’t know any statistics on it but I would say a pretty high proportion of wheelchair users can technically stand and/or walk to an extent but are enabled to access many areas of life (anything from any trip outside their house to only longer excursions like you) that they would otherwise not be able to do or struggle a great deal with if they didn’t have the option of a wheelchair.

1460,"Dude. Empathy is not the same thing as treating someone like a child. It just isn't. Empathy is the ability to understand/relate to someone else's situation. That's it. No where in that definition is the requirement that they baby me when they don't even know me.

I'm sorry you were abused, but a lot of disabled people are. Unfortunately, we're easy to abuse because oftentimes we physically/verbally/financially can't help ourselves. My parents weren't the best either. That does not mean disabled people want infantilization packaged as ""empathy"". The majority of us do not. That's why you keep seeing that complaint. It is not empathy to us. It's a way to silence us. When you tell other disabled people not to complain about able bodied people patronizing us and treating us like literal children, you are silencing your own community. Able bodied people infantilizing us is effectively silencing us because *no one takes children seriously*. I'm a goddamn adult. I deserve the respect of not being treated like a child, just like I would if I could walk.

You keep saying visibly disabled people are asking for special treatment in asking not to be infantilized, but we're literally doing the opposite. The whole point is that we want to be treated normally, unless otherwise stated. Able bodied people are afforded the privilege of being treated with basic respect and disabled people should be too. That isn't too much to ask of anyone. And just like with any other social issue, I will continue to ask that of people until I no longer have to.

This isn't about me or you. I know we don't matter in the grand scheme if things. This is about how an entire community of people is treated by society, so your r/im14andthisisdeep logic of ""nothing matters, man"" will never apply here.

I find water and food so painful I simply puke and have repeatedly had incidences of severe dehydration/heat exhaustion/nearly starving to death. I frequently lose speech to stress.

If you had said 'I struggle very severely with my autism' I'd have been all behind you. 110%. I'd have championed you to the end gate through any protesters and well beyond. I'd have shouted people down for you to have your say.

1514,"I feel like this article ignores the inconvenience, stress and anger that arises when you need a disability spot and can't find one. So many places have too few spaces to start with, so drivers with legitimate disabilities are already competing with each other to find a space. Anyone who has had the experience of driving to a store or office to find that you have to turn around and leave because you can't park there knows the kind of frustration that engenders. Even with the ADA, it still feels so often like public buildings are designed to exclude us.

So it's no wonder that some of us get angry enough to confront someone who misuses those spaces. And I've gotten into the ""invisible"" disability discussion with people. When you're using a wheelchair and you can't park in a normal space, watching someone who seems to be walking just fine take the only space you can use can be crazy making, even when they have a tag. I remind myself that the real object of my anger should be the parking lot owners who haven't put in enough handicapped spaces. But that never makes me feel better.

Power chairs and manual chairs work a little differently I believe (all my experience is with manual). The gist is, when you make your reservations, there are various accessibility options to notify them of (like, have wheelchair, or can’t walk on to plane). With a manual chair, you gate check it (that means you go all the way to the door of the plane in it, and then right board, they take the chair). Power chairs might have to check them earlier. You get from your chair, to a tiny airplane chair. If you need assistance transferring, they can lift you. The employees push the dinky, tiny airport chair down the aisle of the plane to your seat. Then you get in seat. When you get to your destination, you get your chair back. With manuals, you get the back immediately at plane door and on all layovers. Not sure about power chairs.

1569,"You're very welcome. Rollators are a fantastic option for people past sticks but not quite in need of a chair. The fact that you can stick a bag on them with easy access is invaluable according to friends who use them. Definitely ask your doctor and be prepared with pics in case they're not aware of what a rollator is! This is much more a PT's area of interest and docs are a bit hit or miss with mobility aid knowledge. If your doc is unsure you can ask to see a PT specifically or have them consult with one.

Regarding college particularly have you spoken to their disability office? If not give them a quick call or email, they can make changes for disabled students with enough notice. Mine for example ensured that all of my lectures were in accessible halls. They may also be able to help you with carrying less stuff if that would help with walking, by providing a locker near your regular classroom. 

You could consider a provided manual wheelchair indoors on bad days. They are readily available to borrow from many places and easy to push indoors on flat slick floors. Regarding strength I don't know your disability but everyone struggles with strength in a wheelchair at first. If you can build muscle it is something you gain very quickly. 

Managing a large bag for college books and shopping is much harder in a chair than a rollator and they can be more temperamental as there are more bits to break. Your chair would likely not fit properly, an active user chair is the ideal but they cost thousands for even a basic model. Standard wheelchairs are the norm for part time users but they are heavier and harder to use, you'd feel that on top of other wheelchair issues.

I'm surprised if people ask me questions that don't relate to my disability.  Dating became difficult and sex even more so.

  I learned to joke about my disability shortly after meeting people so they stopped walking on eggshells around me.  My easy dating life turned sparse and I met women that just seemed interested in banging a disabled dude.  I finally met a wonderful woman I'm still with now though, so I count myself lucky.

  I constantly worry about my sexual performance because I'm simply unable to do a lot of things.  Beyond the loss of my legs, I also suffer terrible nerve damage pain that can kill the mood fast.
