Hopefully she is pregnant and you can get your pup soon �� Sometimes there are even basically scam service dog *organizations* (aka makes the individual or their family fundraise thousands of dollars to pay for SD, then the person with the SD ends up with a dog that is not suitable to be a SD for a myriad of reasons, often aggression or being overly fearful). People can be great at talking and promising things, but sadly some don't even properly train the dogs and all they see is dollar signs. So it's not even just limited to private trainers, it is some orgs as well. I always advise people to ask a lot of questions and meet dogs that have been trained by said trainer or organization before forking over money, etc. Sounds like you definitely did that, which is great!

113,"SSDI is only for people who worked a significant portion of their adult life before becoming disabled, and unwed people the SSA declared disabled prior to 22 with dead or disabled parents who worked a significant portion of their adult lives.

SSI is for the very, very poor, with no other means of support. Other than the able account for those declared disabled by the SSA before 26 and limited in use, and a few possible ticket-to-work type things I'm not very familiar with, there's nothing.

There is a HARD asset limit of $2000. If at any time you go above $2000 in assets, they will cut you off, go after you for overpay, and I've heard many stories about how long it takes to get them to turn it back on once you've done so. They say save,  but they do not mean it. Do not save. 

The program is not for those with a good family of even moderate income. It's intended for nothing more than just barely surviving, for those with no other means of survival or assistance. You don't ""thrive"" on $750/month, but you may not die. 

As to how, it's not easy but is doable. You go someplace with decent EBT and medicaid rules and a low cost of living. You save (in cash) each month for $100-$900 items that will last the years and make surviving on so little possible. You learn to buy in parts and assemble yourself, make from scratch, repair, and make good use of good will and yard sales. My husband, two cats, and I live entrely off my $736 SSI as our sole income. It's doable, and we have a decent and relatively comfortable life, better than many of our working poor and/or SSDI-receiving neighbors, by using a bit of planning and forethought. You can have a really nice computer, if you buy it one part at a time during the times of the year when each part goes on sale, over the course of 2 years or so. You can make 2 loaves of bread for $0.17 instead of the stores $1 for one, and a good stand mixer or breadmaker from goodwill or a yard sale makes it as easy as and sometimes faster than riding the bus out to go buy some. We pay $50 extra rent a month until we get a 3 month surplus. Then if a big expense comes up, or something goes wrong with distribution or the bank or anything, or we're too sick to make it to the bank and the money order store, we're good, we go collect our receipt and use the extra $425 we didn't spend on rent to fix the problem. 

 Yes it sucks. No it's not fair. It is, however, significantly better than being dead, which is the other alternative for those who absolutely can not work and truly have no other means of support or assistance, no family, friends, or others who are able or willing to help.

156,"After you get the court decree of a name change, the next step is to change your name with SSA and have them ship you a new card with your new name. 

Here’s the key thing: the system where your name is updated with your SSN is a different system than the one that pays your benefits. When you get your name changed and order a new card, explicitly tell the individual that you are receiving Title 2 (Social Security Disability), Title 16 (Supplemental Security Income), or a combination of both.

Generally, most folks getting a name change are not receiving benefits, and the person doing the name change doesn’t think to check the MBR (Master Beneficiary Record, for Title 2) or the SSID (I don’t remember what that stands for, but it is the Title 16 payment record). 

Another consideration is when you get your bank account updated with the new name and when you receive your benefit payment. There are a lot of moving parts, and I recommend getting your name updated with SSA on the day (or a few days after) that you receive your benefit. You will probably need to wait at least a day before you can get a new state issued license from MVD or DMV.

Then, head to the bank as soon as possible to get that information updated. It might make sense to check with your bank ahead of time to figure out what they require from you.

251,"So, realistically any sort of disability payment will not come even close to what you are making now. The average SSDI payment is roughly $1,200/mo, or about $14,400 year. Some states will have state disability programs too, but that still won't get you to where you probably are. 

Aside from the payments not being enough, the chances that you would qualify for disability are slim; making the assumption that you are under 50 years old. If you are capable of doing any other work (regardless of whether you are trained for it or how much it pays), then you don't qualify for disability. 

As another person with back issues - I totally feel for your situation. But, as a word of advice - your back health needs to be your #1 priority. Long term, you are better off starting from the bottom in a different job, and working your way up to a better salary.

Don't believe everything you hear. Also EBT/foodstamps can vary a lot state to state, but in many, this would not be unusual. 

In some states the person who doesn't own the house can get a letter saying they rent a room in return for chores but are responsible for purchasing, storing, and prepping their food separately, but they still wouldn't get much.

My husband and I live entirely off just my $736 SSI, no other income, subsidies,or other assistance aside from EBT and we only get $163. He's deathly allergic to chicken and I have severe sensory issues that make most foods extremely painful and unswallowable. I have to make all our bread products myself to afford to feed us even at least once a day.

326,"Not stupid abd can definitely happen. Few ideas:

Ask the pool when they've got a slot available for a weekly training session.
Figure out cost. Figure out cost of a trainer that's disability friendly (not competitive, knows how to spot someone who's doing more than they should. A PT looking for a second job would be great! They can read up on water polo while you get a group together)

Calculate cost per person to not get into debt. If you want to make it truly disability friendly maybe consider variable/adjustable fees, the more people join, the lower the fees will get. (Cheap is a good incentive!)

Then put up a flyer at the pool.

Disabled? Old? Fed up with the same old laps?
Join our slow, relaxed and friendly waterpolo team! 
First 2 times are free! (If there are already enough people to afford a trainer, otherwise say you're establishing a group and it's free until fees are determined, or mention the variable fees plan, more people means a lower fee per person )

Add a website that has more info, add a QR code, add tear off strips at the bottom.

Start a Facebook group for your area.

In the beginning if it's a (too) small group it's probably too expensive to pay for pool space and a trainer, so just DIY agree on a time where most people can come, and throw a ball around until you've got more people. Or only pay for the trainer and use a small/empty corner of the pool until someone stars complaining.


Looks like as soon as you've got 14 you can play a proper game. (Much) More is better so you'll always have enough players, and they can take a break when needed, that way everyone can play how much they can.

If you've got enough people, start a point system like wheelchair rugby has. The more disabled you are the higher you score. Two teams need to have roughly equal total scores. This way you can have people with little/no leg mobility join with some floaties to keep them from drowning. Put on flyer wheelchair users are welcome.

It's easier to keep team total point counts even if you don't see it as two separate teams, someone on the sidelines can swap places with someone on either team.

Contact local physical therapy/doctors/rehab for people interested in training you, and put up some flyers there too.

Maybe see if trainer (and pool) is willing to volunteer for free until you have enough people where everyone can pay/chip in.

328,"What state are you in? How willing are you to accept help from religious charities? There's really not a lot of help. A lot of people assume that there's help available if you really truly need it, and are shocked to learn that isn't necessarily true. 

Beyond the need based and work based disability programs the SSA runs, there aren't any federal programs or assistance available nationwide. Different states vary radically on how much and what sort of help they provide. Some will provide a monthly disability, that may or may not be a pittance, and sometimes is taken back out of your backpay once you get SSI. Non-governmental help from United Way or other similar help may help with electricity or rent, or may not. 

If you aren't opposed to religious help, some churches go above and beyond in support of those needy who are willing to attend regularly, and may provide temporary help to nonattendees in desperate need.  The Mormons provide a fuckton of help to attendees and members. The Catholics are also pretty decent at help and are more likely to offer the same assistance whether you attend or not.

I would recommend getting that Dx. asap. Without a dx, you're gonna have a real hard time with the SSA regardless of symptoms. If your Dx is serious enough, it could even be on the SSA's auto-approve list, making this a month sorta thing instead of a years sorta thing.

Most I knew (including myself) traded home chores and sometimes food for a place to stay, getting the letters saying you prep and buy your food separately for EBT and saying you owe $350/month passdue rent upon approval for SSI, and barely survived the years it took.

356,"I can guess at what your point is -- and in a moment I will -- but I'd rather not have to guess. Perhaps you could just state your point in a way that is clear and direct, rather than asking me to assume what you think.

My guess, since you ask, is that your point is something like the following:

&gt;The people on this sub have no misconceptions about having a disability. They live with disabilities every day, and we are the victims of those misconceptions, not the perpetrators. Therefore, /u/scartol , your post does not belong here. It belongs in a different forum, such as /r/TodayILearned or /r/videos, where the small-minded able-bodied people who make our lives more difficult -- and close us into capsules of oppression with their assumptions -- would gain enlightenment and understanding.

If that's inaccurate in any way, please let me know. (Again, I don't like having to guess or assume these things.) If this hypothesis of mine is correct, however, allow me to provide the following rejoinder. Let me preface it, however, by saying that I don't want to drag this exchange out any longer, so this could very well be the last thing I post in this thread.

Everybody, everywhere -- regardless of background or situation -- has the potential to misconceive things. I am a teacher, but I have misconceptions about the nature of education. I live in Wisconsin, but I have misconceptions about what life in my state is like. I am a guy, but I have misconceptions about guys. I am an American, but I don't know everything there is to know about this country. 

Even about myself, as an individual, there are things I don't recognize or understand in the deep recesses of my mind. The human brain -- at least my own -- is an infinite labyrinth of mystery and confusion. One of the most important revelations any person can achieve (I speak mostly of my own experience, and the experiences I've observed in my students) is the awareness of how little we truly understand. As Socrates said: ""The more I learn, the more I know I know nothing.""

The most difficult thing for me about this lack of understanding is the way it holds me back. I hesitate to try new things, because I am afraid of what those attempts might mean. I am reluctant to think of myself in certain ways, because I have not seen those things lived by others. I am loath to experiment with art forms, because I don't understand how they could exist. 

But when I see someone do a thing about which I have a misconception, it opens a fragment of possibility for me. When I had a really great English teacher in high school, it convinced me that there were other possibilities for how a person might approach the profession. This understanding grew when I read Paulo Freire's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*. It grew more when I did my student teaching.

All of this is to say, to the one and only person who appears to have even seen or noticed this post: I thought maybe this video might be useful or helpful to anyone who felt trapped by a disability. I do not suffer from any disabilities myself (aside from minor chronic leg pains and a slightly mutilated thumb inflicted by a dog fight one year ago). Therefore I confess to an attempted humility when I post in this /r/. Nevertheless I thought I might take a chance and post this, on the off chance that it could be useful to anyone looking in.

Obviously I was wrong. I am not wounded by the downvotes. It happens. 

My whole life is a series of similar chances. I put books in front of my students on the off chance that they might read them. Usually they don't. I share music with my students, in the hope that the lyrics might inspire some deep conversations. Usually they don't. I write stories and books, on the off chance that people might be interested or helped by them. Usually they are met with silence. 

Even in this moment, I am obviously babbling with my usual logorrhea, in the hope that explaining myself might build some kind of bridge between you, /u/reaper_2 , and myself. I will not be surprised or wounded if you reply with ""TLDR"" or ""yeah whatever go away dude"" or some similar truncated response. It's par for the course. 

I would hope, however, that we could have some other conversation. Maybe you could share something personal -- as I have done -- and explain why the video has caused such a negative reaction. The more honest and specific you can be, the more I can learn about the nature of my misstep.

471,"I don't have club foot, but I have an arthritic left foot that's had a couple surgeries, and I've had arthritis in my foot since I was 21 (broke it very badly at age 18, all metatarsals were broken or displaced, it didn't heal right for a variety of reasons). It has some obvious scarring, is kinda lumpy looking (really lumpy when it's swollen) and generally disqualifies me from ever dating a foot fetishist lol. I'm now 28, nearly 29. I do have chronic pain. I have to wear special shoes, either expensive neutral running shoes or expensive comfort shoes. I do work full time, but it's a desk job. However some days the pain is just really bad. I'm allergic to opioid painkillers and have a bad reaction to NSAIDs if I take strong ones more than one or two days in a row. Tylenol is not helpful. So I'm frequently SOL on pain relief.

The biggest helpers for me have been water aerobics and regular massage. Both are kinda pricey (aerobics through a higher end gym, massage out of pocket) and of course not covered by insurance or anything. Massage helps me release my IT band, which I expect you may also have issues with (outside of leg, especially the outer thigh) since any kind of gate issue can mess it up. The massage is uh... Not fun. It's frequently painful, but it makes a huge difference. I think people think of massage as relaxing and chill but therapeutic massage is frequently painful and my therapist will have me give movie synopses or tell a story while he works my IT band so I remember to breathe. Take a rolling pin and push it up and down your outer leg, hard, like you're rolling out dough. That will give you an idea of how tight your IT band is. My therapist puts his elbow against mine to help work it loose and uuuuugh it hurts but it's so helpful in the long run.

 Water aerobics has been a life changer. Just being in the water, not having weight on my foot is such a relief. I had no idea it would help this much. And truly water aerobics helps more than just swimming or sitting in a hot tub. No idea why. I will say that my knee frequently gets water on it due to the foot causing me to walk incorrectly, so water aerobics helps that too. I'm the only person under 40 in the class but I don't even care. The ladies are all very nice though lol.

I will say, I was quite athletic until the arthritis, running 5-10K mostly days and lifting, and I remain as active as I can, working out 3-4 days a week lifting and doing low impact activities. I think that has helped. Having stronger bones and muscles helps support my joints. But I do get tired easier and have to be more careful.

Being young with a mobility problem that will never go away fucking sucks. Like, I cried when I was diagnosed. I just sat in my car and cried. And I still cry sometimes because I'm in pain and I hate it and I did everything ""right"" and I'm still in pain. I have to wear an ugly brace at night (sexy I know) and have inserts which I can't really afford so I buy cheap versions. I own a cane but if I'm going to water aerobics I rarely need it. I get depressed when I'm in pain. But, ultimately, I think my life isn't that much different than other people's. Mainly my medical/medical related expenses are higher. Occasionally I have really good days where I will out-walk my friends with ease. Other days I'm leaning nearly all my body weight on a grocery cart and limping through the produce section. Other days I don't even make it that far and just don't eat or order food because the idea of shopping or cooking is too much. 

But, most of the time, if I'm going to water aerobics, wearing good shoes, getting massages, stretching, and wearing my brace, I do fine. I'm lucky to make enough money to have all those supports in place, though I can't afford to see an orthopedist (and they just always recommend surgery because they're greedy af honestly).

The answer for questions like this is always maybe. Does he have Medicaid? Is he also on disability? Then it depends on his limitations and what he needs help with. 

If he isn’t already declared disabled then it’s unlikely that Medicaid (if he even has Medicaid) would pay for a caregiver. 

It happens but if it were that easy then everyone’s mom or dad or friend or sibling or roommate would get paid to be their caregiver. Sorry, probably not what you wanted to hear :(

480,"First off, it costs nothing to file so there is nothing to lose.

Next, I've seen enough people (even young people like you) get approved due to anxiety to know that it's absolutely possible with the right set of facts.

The problem (as I see it) with depression/anxiety (they invariably go together) is that pretty much anyone can get a diagnosis. I've never put this to the test, but I would bet that any sufficiently-motivated person could get a diagnosis and rx for depression/anxiety within 24hrs. I don't say that to downplay the severity of those conditions. I say it so that you'll stop thinking that you're noteworthy because you have a stack of papers with ""recurrent severe major depressive disorder"" and/or ""severe anxiety"". In my experience with these conditions, the diagnosis is a formality and the treatment records in the aggregate make the case.

Too often I've seen people claiming severe depression and every record indicates alcohol use. This tends to erode their credibility because alcohol counteracts anti-depressants. Or the patient will go through alternating periods of consistent and inconsistent treatment. It's understandable that you wouldn't adhere as strictly to a treatment regime when things start to turn around, but mental health issues tend to have an ebb and flow and so if you stop treatment when things are good, they tend to get worse later on. Or, as I suspect to be the case with you, they hardly have any treatment history. Millions of people are diagnosed with depression/anxiety. The vast vast majority of them get treated and are able to engage in substantially gainful activity. If you want to prevail on a claim of depression/anxiety, you need to show that you have put in the time to get appropriate treatment and that you've put forth a good faith effort to comply with the treatment and that, despite your best efforts, you haven't seen any improvement. A ""few months"" of treatment records is nothing even if your symptoms were to go back two decades.

There's nothing wrong with filing now. You probably won't prevail on the initial or reconsideration reviews because of a lack of treatment records. Appeal up to the hearing level and use the time between now and your hearing to pursue treatment. It'll probably be 2 years before you get in front of a judge so you should have plenty of time to show how serious you are about doing everything you can to treat your conditions. Two years of treatment isn't that much, but it might be enough. Might be smart to get treatment for at least a year before filing. No way to know what's best.

Also, keep in mind that the standard is whether or not you can perform a job. You're ability to get a job doesn't matter. A subtle, and perhaps unfair, distinction, but something you need to keep in mind.

Also, you'd probably do yourself a huge favor to check out a vocational rehabilitation service. Just do an online search for ""\[your state\] vocational rehabilitation"". I've never been involved with a case where someone had done this, but I would expect it to go a long way towards showing that you've tried to find suitable work and that an expert has failed to find any suitable employment for you. I can think of no better evidence for a disability hearing than a report from a vocational expert saying that she performed an evaluation and determined that you were not suitable for any position.

Plus, if you do all this, it might work. You might get better and then you can support yourself. Again, nothing to lose.",,False,,Thirdrawn,,,1544392341,t5_2qhe8,t3_a4mhk5,t3_a4mhk5,6,1547405477,0,0,ebgf5y7,disability,,,,,

I dislike the use of any and all mental health slurs (crazy, insane, nutcase, lunatic, schizo, mental case, etc etc). I reserve a particular dislike for the use of the word ""disorder"" , and have utter disdain for clinicians who feel the need to use this sort of language with clients, especially when speaking to them about their experience of mental distress.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tolerate the words, ""mental health"" and ""mental illness"" but I know a lot of people who disregard these terms entirely because they resent the medical metaphor. Personally, I can live with it, but I think we need to educate people that it is a metaphor and not an objective fact.

Thanks for the tips. As far as cost of maintenance of the lift, is there any way to know besides hoping the seller is telling the truth? If you have one, could you give an estimate of what it's costing you?

I'm sure other posters will tell you this as well. My qualification is a B.A. in Psychology, with plenty of education in developmental psychology. I also work/worked in the field of developmental disabilities.

One of the reasons that we've moved away from the ""mental age"" concept is because an adult with learning and developmental disabilities still has more life experiences and learning than your average three year-old.

We do still use education levels as some kind of benchmark, but, again, it suffers from similar problems to mental age. There are many forms of intelligence, and someone can function quite well in one area while not doing so well in others. And, no, I'm not referring to savants. Savants are rare, but people that have learning/developmental disabilities who have skills that function at the average or just below average level aren't rare.

I wouldn't worry about the IQ test much. It can help if you need extra resources and supports to remain independent, but it's not going, or shouldn't be a barrier of access for most things.

I'll give you an example: my mom teaches special education, and has had students who scored weirdly low on a couple areas of the test, bringing down their overall score. At first she thought maybe they did just struggle to comprehend information, but then she spoke to speech pathologist. The areas of low scoring indicated that the students had a language processing issue, meaning they would hear things in their native language and then their brain just jumbled it, almost like aural dyslexia. After intensive speech therapy, a few students were retested. They jumped up 30 points to ""normal"" IQ range. Their speech processing issue had so drastically affected their comprehension in a timed, oddly structured environment that their score came out totally different. Having worked with a kid with an issue like this, I can tell you he was 100% capable of doing the same things as everyone else, but it took him longer to catch on. That's it. He just needed more time and practice.

Second, IQ tests are timed and based on the idea that processing information quickly shows someone's ability to learn, which... Isn't really true or accurate. Some people just process things slower or need more practice. We accept that in basically every other area of life, and praise hard work and dedication, then turn around and pretend speed and a sort of natural ability is magically better when it comes to ""intelligence."" But it's not. You see all the time the hard working student out classing the ""smart"" kid who doesn't put in the effort. So really all that score says, especially if you know you have a learning disability, is that you need more time to do things. There were kids in law school with me who had learning disabilities and therefore got extra time on tests. They graduated same as me. Some did better than me! 

Finally IQ tests are like, notoriously racist so you know, screw them anyway lol. Seriously people of color always score lower on them, they're a very flawed test. But they're easy to administer and give people a number, so they're used anyway, just like BMI is still used to indicate health even though there's tons of information about how inaccurate it is.",,False,,amoebab,,,1543977568,t5_2qhe8,t3_a335kr,t3_a335kr,13,1547031762,0,0,eb42h78,disability,,,,,

First- ask your insurance about a patient care advocate- someone they can provide to get you the services you need and avoid all the headaches you are going through on your end. Hopefully they will find doctors and make appointments for you as well as provide other services that you should be receiving. 

If you find this person to also be unhelpful, consider hiring a private patient/health advocate- ask them how they think they can help you off the bat and what the fees will be. It may be something you can bill to your insurance.

Second- if needed, consider taking some FMLA time off from your job. It will likely be unpaid, however it could give you some time to focus on gathering your health team and getting things set so that you aren’t juggling so many things at once. During this time, even considering finding help with housework and meal prep could be hugely beneficial to the quality of your life.  Looking for services and working out a system is all it takes and once you get your team in place, it becomes so much less chaotic.

You sound like the kind of person who isn’t willing to let your health problems defeat you. You’ve made an amazing life, so I think it’s all about finding people to do the legwork when it comes to your healthcare. Trust me, if you try to tackle it alone, it can quickly become a second full time job.

812,"I would talk to your HR/benefits administrator and an insurance broker in your state.

It's likely that the University has already selected their health plan for 2019, but it's open enrollment right now (until December 15th) and discussing some of these pitfalls might help encourage them to get a more comprehensive plan and network for 2020.

Talking to a broker can help you find more options. They'll know more about local network coverage, coinsurance and copays, and how responsive customer service is for the different insurance provider in your area. They'll also be able to make sure that specific necessary items are covered. It would suck to sign up for an insurance plan that doesn't cover catheters or physical therapy.

An FSA or HSA may also help by giving you lower premiums and helping you save more money for later. My husband is in a power wheelchair and I'll be maxing out our HSA and limited purpose FSA next year because I have a pretty good idea of what our insurance will cover next year and what our expenses will be. I also know that we may be paying for some physical therapy sessions on our own since insuranse will cover a third of the number of sessions my husband needs (but I'm still hoping we'll qualify for a grant.)

931,"Accessibility is one thing that's already been talked about but it's a problem for me, too. Especially getting my own family to understand my difficulties. Summer boat rides? I can't do them. I have a bad leg and use a cane (I have access to a walker if I need it) so the boat launch is inaccessible, staying on a boat for hours is not something I can tolerate, and then getting up out the boat is not something I can guarantee I can do. I missed a trip my family just took to a reindeer farm. The walkways weren't paved, everything was rough and natural then toss snow on top of that. There was no seating I could see in online photos so I couldn't even sit and watch my niece interact with the animals. So instead of my family understanding that I'm explaining that I CAN'T go, they just think I'm lazy and antisocial. I need to cheer up and be happy. That won't make my leg work better!

Also when I check to see if a place I want to go actually is accessible, I usually can't find the information I'm looking for. Yes, they may have a tab about accessibility that says they have disabled bathrooms, disabled parking, and maybe a couple other things. But I don't know about terrain, distances between parking and seating, if there's room to navigate my walker, if there are elevators, how steep stairs are, if there are ramps. It's usually a very lacking area on websites. Most times I go to Google and try to piece together a complete image of a venue with user photos. Unfortunately I live pretty rural so often times there's not a lot to work with. It's really helpful when users post all kinds of pictures. I wish that happened more.

And this hasn't been touched on, but the government help in my state is a joke. I spent a little over two years in Vocational Rehab trying to get assistance in getting a job. My first counselor told me that the average stent was a year, one contract, but I was very hireable so she didn't expect me to wait that long. But she left, her parting gift was getting me two weeks as a temp for work experience for my resume after it having a five year gap. After all the hoops I jumped through to get into the program, the evaluations I did, the appointments, the paperwork, the waiting for their office to restructure... I got stuck with people who didn't really care about me. 

My job advocate stopped advocating for me pretty quickly. Her perceptions of the working world were horribly outdated (I needed a feminine font for my resume, I needed to wear my hair pulled back in a bun to look like a secretary, etc), and she didn't listen to my wants or needs. My counselor was inept, must have gotten the most minimal training possible, and she steered me in the wrong direction a few times with incorrect information.

It was the last straw for me with Vocational Rehab when they not once but twice sent me to interviews for jobs I could not perform with my disability. They were supposed to go in, find out about the job, tell them about me and the program, advocate, then the job would choose whether or not to interview. Both times the person interviewing me had no idea who I was or that I was disabled. The second one didn't even know about the program. I cannot express how embarrassing and dehumanizing it is to sit in an interview and explain how you're not able to perform duties for the job you're asking to get! I apologized profusely for wasting their time. Both people were very nice about the whole thing. Even encouraging. I couldn't work with those people anymore.

Then my counselor lied to me about closing my case and about a month after we parted ways, she called trying to keep me on. Even though she didn't really address any of my problems and didn't even apologize for the last horrible interview. She had no information for me about housing, my main concern, or mental health solutions. So I quit for good that time and actually got paperwork. It was just such a mess that wasted time and resources for nothing. I'm still incredibly angry about and frustrated by the whole ordeal. I would not work with Michigan Rehabilitation Services in this area again. Maybe not at all. I filled out a survey and asked to be contacted by a manager but nobody ever reached out. I guess they want to ignore the bad stuff!

Instead of job hunting now I'm working on obtaining housing. An apartment somewhere not so rural. That has yet to work out. Housing is another issue but I have a roof over my head so I can't complain too much. I'd rather be away from a situation/people who aren't good for me but I'll hang in there.

Our country hates what it perceives as underproductive human capital, but would rather ineffectively harass people than invest in ensuring that people actually can and actually do work, or allowing people working fulltime to not live in poverty.

They are doing exactly what you think they are. It's not your fault at all, but contact your local Client Assistance Program/CAP or Independent Living Center/ILC to get some guidance from a counselor or social worker to help navigate getting into the best situation you can. Otherwise they will literally just keep trying to harass you into developing perfect vision and melanin even if you follow all the rules.

Anyway: School systems shouldn’t be allowed to do IQ testing, because they’re terrible at it. I had to do it when I was a kid, and I was terrified of the person giving me the test and they didn’t explain it well. 

I never asked my parents (and can’t now) but I think they came back listing me as mentally handicapped because my parents were *furious*. Within a week I was at a private testing center doing an IQ test.

The school accepted those results and put me in Gifted classes. I graduated high school and started college at age 16, and I graduated with two degrees. I’m also a member of Mensa.

I have a lot of respect for school psychologists, but I’ve yet to hear of one who can properly administer an IQ test in the environment they have to.",,False,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1544984314,t5_2qhe8,t3_a6ok9i,t1_ebx30y9,3,1547690035,0,0,ebx88ne,disability,,,,,

1197,"If a person has a moderate intellectual disability, and it wasn't misdiagnosed, they're not going to grow out of it, or have their potential ""unlocked"". There can be a tendency to assume there's a ""normal"" nondisabled child locked inside a disabled child and that belief can be a problem. It prevents people from loving and accepting the person as they are.

There's also a belief some people have that everyone a skill that they're naturally above-average in. That's not really true. Everyone has *personal* strengths - skills that are better than expected *for that person*, but not necessarily *general* strengths - skills that are better than most other people. (Unless you count very personalized skills, like ""John is best in the world at making his mother smile."")  So can people with ID play to their strengths? Absolutely, but realize that for most people with moderate ID, their personal strengths are not above average.

That doesn't mean people with moderate ID can't gain and apply useful skills. Most people with moderate ID learn self-care skills, some applied skills, and some leisure skills. Many work successfully, usually in jobs where they do the same thing over and over again. Most live with some helpers, but a few live semi-independently. Some have romantic or sexual relationships. Some parent children.

There are people who were misdiagnosed in the first place. For example, if the child has a severe speech language problem, and the clinician didn't account for that when diagnosing, they might not have ID at all. There are definitely records of children with autism who scored in the ID range on IQ tests before starting treatment. They weren't talking at the time. After some intensive treatment, they were able to use language and follow directions. When the IQ test was repeated, it was much higher. Did the child's IQ rise, or was the first test invalid? Most scientists believe the latter.

You might also be talking about savants. Savants are people who have a developmental disability but have some abilities that are average or above-average. About 10 - 20% of people who have ID are savants; most of whom have ID + autism. You see savants on TV who have extraordinary abilities - concert pianists or incredible artists - and that does happen, but most savants are just a bit better than you would expect, like someone who has an IQ of 50, but can draw Disney characters pretty darn well.

But if you're asking whether ID can be ""cured"" the answer is no. If you're asking whether education is beneficial to people with ID, the answer is a resounding yes.

Edit: I'd like to respond to your comment, ""it just goes to show most people are incapable with children."" I don't think that's true at all. All the available evidence says that there is a very big difference between *bad* parenting and adequate parenting, but only a small difference between adequate parenting and *great* parenting. The same goes for teaching and schools. You may be aware of a few anecdotes of people raising their children in extraordinary ways, but that doesn't mean that those people are necessarily extraordinary parents. For starters, their children share their genes, so an intelligent, ambitious parent will tend to have intelligent, ambitious kids. Those same kids raised by other parents might have come out the same way. Second, you don't know what the negatives or downsides are. That's a problem with anecdotes. You don't have all the data. Third, you don't know what the long term outcomes are from anecdotes. Did those college ready teens complete college? Or did they drop out early? Fourth, even if everything was perfect in that story, what works for one family and one child doesn't work for another. Finally, if you judge good outcomes of parenting by ""unlocking"" the child's ""potential"", then you're going to miss a lot of excellent parenting in which the parent loves the child for who they really are, disability and all, and focuses on modest goals instead of tilting at windmills.",,False,,nezumipi,,,1544969616,t5_2qhe8,t3_a6ok9i,t3_a6ok9i,11,1547682216,0,0,ebwrif7,disability,,,,,

1) work on your mental health and you will naturally start to take better care of yourself and your home as you get better.

Life pro tip on hygiene: baby wipes. Keep them behind the toilet. Use them on your underarms and crotch/butt (and any skin folds or high sweat areas, like underboob or stomach roll if either apply to you) every morning, or morning and evening, when you can't bring yourself to bathe. Takes like 60 seconds. Keep shampoo by the sink and wash your scalp at least in the sink. Very fast. Keep floss picks near your bed. Floss when you hate yourself and can't get up. Keep a lil trashcan right by the bed for the floss picks. Have at least 14 pairs of underwear. Same with socks. That way you can change every day for 2 weeks even if you don't do laundry. And those things get stinky easiest. Wear different PJs every night so you don't get funky from just wearing pjs that are funky. Have multiple sheet sets for the same reason. Change the sheets every 2-3 weeks if you can. I frequently can get myself to do like, 1 thing that's productive when I'm very bad (haven't been that bad in a long time, hurray therapy and medication) like just change the sheets, just do a load of laundry (not put it away but hey the stuff in the dryer is clean).

Those that don't, need to understand that consent and acceptance are a higher priority (socially and theologically) than their desire to pray for you.

1346,"I wish there was an easy way to let providers know how they can help. 

The important part (to SSA) is how it's noted in the record; that's all they see. I know often docs say patient is ""stable"" even though their stable baseline is *really effed up* but ""stable"" sounds like they're not having issues.

Most doctors in my area will say that they don't help with disability claims. If they write that in the note, it could seem like they're not supportive. Doctors hear ""disability"" and they think about Worker's Comp Functional Capacity Evaluations which are only done by some doctors and paid for by the insurance carrier, or they think of Independent Medical Evaluations done in the course of a personal injury claim, or they think of all the forms that LTD carriers have them complete. Sometimes doctors even say in their notes, ""wants me to help with disability but told them I am not the one who makes the decision."" None of this is what SSA needs from them, and it isn't what you mean by ""helping"" with your claim, but providers don't know that, and patients think ""my doctor needs to say I'm disabled.""

The only way they can help is to document your signs and symptoms and give opinions about your _functioning_ (not your ability to work). Filling out a form or writing a letter about your functioning is helpful.

When it comes to assisting patients with disability claims, doctors are often concerned about liability. However, the Social Security Act states that providers who submit information to SSA on behalf of an applicant cannot be held criminally or civilly liable as long as the information was provided in good faith. (See Sec. 1157 [42 U.S.C. 1320c-6] of the Social Security Act.)

As far as your doctor disagreeing, unless they're really angry about it, they aren't going to make a big deal in the notes, as their notes aren't their personal journal.   They may make an unsupportive comment, but they likely aren't going to take any actions to tank your claim. And, if you think they aren't providing the care you need, find someone else. But I know it isn't that simple, and if they think you're exaggerating or malingering, stomping out because they won't help with your disability claim is not helpful. 

Also, as other commenter said, get objective testing for the FM. See specialists (neurologist and/or rheumatologist). I assume you've had sleep study and have a CPAP, are you using it regularly? Still having issues? Tell the doctor. A PNCV/EMG nerve conduction study will show how bad the neuropathy is. A neuropsychological evaluation tests memory and concentration and other cognitive functioning. Did you have medical evaluations for state disability or Medicaid? If so, get those reports to SSA. 

I do think that applicants get into a mindset of ""how do I explain to SSA..."" Which, over time, naturally, becomes, ""how do I convince everyone that I'm disabled,"" which can be really overwhelming and self-defeating. It's important to remember that disability benefits don't have to be permanent. SSA has a ""trial work period"" where you can keep your benefits while trying to return to work. There are a lot of people recently-diagnosed (young) who are able to work, and SSA sees that every day. I know there's no cure for FM, but chronic doesn't mean terminal. Apply at the state agency that does Vocational Rehabilitation. If you do some kind of work, keep a log of your absences and how they may accommodate you (extra breaks, different schedule, etc). Get all those records to SSA. 

Your initial question was, ""how do I get SSA to listen to me,"" and the answer is: through your doctors. So, now you know what SSA needs to know about you, talk to the doctors about those things. The things you described in your post, about having trouble concentrating, how your sleep affects you, etc. You need your doctor's opinion for the claim, but also to treat you. Ask your doctor, ""Can we do anything about my problems concentrating?"" If treatments don't help, or your condition doesn't get better, talk to them about how to deal with or get help with  your current baseline of [being tired all the time/can't focus/neuropathy hurts]. They'll note all of this in the records, and SSA will listen.

Or, like most approved claimants, you'll just have to convince judge at your hearing. Get a rep for that, contact NADR or NOSSCR (you can Google them) or your local Legal Aid office.

1360,"SSA doesn't care if you can find a job, get hired, get to work, etc, only if you can do the functional demands of _any_  unskilled job that exists in ""significant numbers"" in the national economy. This includes ""less than light duty,"" or sedentary work. 

When you have subjective complaints (symptoms) like pain, fatigue, and other things that can't be measured, it becomes a consistency and credibility issue. 

SSA does not care if your doctor says you're ""disabled,"" as SSA has their own definition of disability, but they do consider all medical opinions. For decision makers to ""listen to your symptoms,"" they need to be documented and supported by the entire record. 

In the medical record, your doctor will note your complaints and will also note any objective signs they find. So if you're not complaining about fatigue (maybe you're always fatigued and doc knows it so you guys don't discuss it), it won't be in the note. You may report swelling, but when the doctor notes your objective signs, if you aren't swollen then, your notes will likely say 'no swelling' and 'normal gait,' and this is where most people with subjective complaints lose. The doctor makes records for himself and other medical professionals, and isn't thinking about (or knowledgeable about) SSA. 

You have to show you can't perform the physical or mental demands of unskilled sedentary work. Think about the functions of work activity- sitting, standing, walking, lifting/carrying weight, postures like stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, bending, reaching... mental demands like concentration, maintaining a schedule, following instructions, interacting with others, and other work-related functions like: do you need to take many breaks, lay down during the day, elevate your feet during the day, would you have excessive absences, etc. If your doc would write about the _functional_ limitations you have, saying they're consistent with your diagnosis and symptoms, that would be helpful. 

I'm on my phone so I can't see your original post and I really got detailed there... Hope I covered enough to help.

Combine that with all the “share this post and (celebrity) will donate $1 for each share!” fake posts on Facebook, and bloggers/vloggers that cross the line and extort their/their children’s experiences for monetary gain, and we have what you’ve seen today.

People also feel guilty for *not* upvoting/liking/sharing since “it just takes a second” and “there’s nothing to lose” and “what a nice story,” and the cycle continues from there. This also goes into the lack of ability for a large portion of our population to either do basic research into a story before believing it wholeheartedly, or to understand the importance of doing so.

I've tried diets. I've tried exercise. I've tried getting genetic diagnostics to explain why no medications work. NOTHING has helped.

If all this is actually true, and you have it documented then I don't believe you will be kicked off and should have nothing to worry about.  But your story seems very suspicious to me, as exercise helps for literally every single mental illness, and if someone had as severe mental issues as you, any competent therapist wouldn't tell them to stop coming in for treatment period (especially if you are on disability).  Not getting ECT by blaming your anxiety sounds like another excuse to me to not get better. 

Also seeing 6 different therapists sounds like a lot, but I saw over 25 doctors over a 10 year period before I finally got my autoimmune diagnosis and treatment.  If everything is as dire as you make it sound like it is, have you considered that you don't have anxiety and are being misdiagnosed?  In which case would strengthen your argument for continued disability benefits, and actually give you proper treatment to make your life better?

1546,"&gt;Idk, does anyone understand what I am saying and has dealt with similar feelings?

Absolutely. It is part of Human Nature that ""The Disabled One"" is seen as having less value to others and groups such as Society in general. Males are also valued less than Women and Children.

The Human Rights and Equality bill of goods that has been sold in The Developed World for the last 100 years has not only emphasized hierarchy with the Disabled and Elderly at the bottom, but it has also empowered so many to claim they don't discriminate whilst they do it to your face. 

We unfortunately presently live in a Biazzrely created pseudo equality bubble where inequality, bias and discrimination can't be seen because of the ""Lunacy of Intersectionality"". If you are a white disabled male you are labeled as privileged because you are male and white, so discrimination against you is not about Disability it's justified retribution because you are male and white. I'm sick of this psuedo Marxist political shenanigins. 

After over 25 years of fighting Disability Discrimination in Europe and Globally, the intersectional schtick is making and has made Disabled Males and underclass that is ignored. 

So many are shocked at how [The Men's Shed Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_shed) has exploded in Australia, Australia, Ireland and The UK. I just see it as a necessary backlash and readjustment to the Equality Lunacy of the 70s, 80s, 90s and N""OO""rties. Some seem shocked at the idea that 30% of shed members are disabled males. Due to the slashing of support in the UK since 2008, disabled men have had zero support or resources, but cuts to women's services have been nowhere near as Draconian. The Men's Shed Organisation is most often the only venue where males are welcome at all, hence disabled men will use it.  

Examples of the entrenched discrimination that shall not be named or allowed to speak can be seen in the recent issues from California and Wildfires. Disproportionately, the disabled were the ones to die as Local Government had illegally failed to bother with Evacuation plans that meet Disabled People's needs. US law requires such plans to be in place, updated and maintained.... but who cares if it's just a few less cripples where federal mandate has been ignored. 

When Disaster hits that last group to be relocated and resettled are the disabled as they are seen to be more costly and long-term more difficult to justify the costs of. So many will scream that with Global Warming women are the most affected. They love screaming this to promote a Hierarchy of victimhood. Those who are fact-based rather than emotional abuse based know that the groups that will be thrown under the bus first are the Elderly and the Disabled.

Its a one time thing. Not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. 

Something else you can do is claim it over a span of two months as part of the end of December and beginning of January.

I'm pretty well read on how the ABLE Accounts work. 

I can't deposit the check into my ABLE account directly. The ABLE Account isn't accessible to deposit cash or checks. It's only transferable through a bank. For me to put this money into my ABLE Account, it needs to be deposited into a bank account first. The ABLE Accounts don't have routing numbers. It's its own strange system. 

That's why I was hoping I could just sign the check over to a friend and have him stick it in my ABLE Account or pay a credit card or something.
