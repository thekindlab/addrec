50,"This is an interesting article, Carola, thanks for sharing it.

At this risk of being nitpicky, I feel the need to correct a point of error in your definitions. The United States Dog Registry site you used is one that is.... of... dubious merit... to be the most polite I can be. 

There is no registry in the United States required by, or recognized by, law. Any registry claiming any such certification is selling something at best, being outright deceitful at worst. As a person with a service dog, any internet search for service dog information is populated with paid advertisements from these garbage sites shouting about ""how to take your dog anywhere!""... it... causes one's blood to boil... 

Small tirade over; their information is not quite accurate, and so yours is not. I don't blame you, of course: they pay good money to be the top of every search engine!

I'm not sure whether you're going for the legal definitions, or whether you're simply trying to assist people in understanding the different capacities in which a dog may help a person with disabilities, but since you started your article in the legal realm, I'd like to correct your terminology on that front.

Admittedly, the terms *can* get fuzzy, because (in the US) there are 3 primary laws which determine assistance dogs - namely the ADA (Americans with disabilities act), the FHA (Fair Housing Act) and the travel one (I can never remember which one it is, as I live in a more suburban area and can drive everywhere, and I never fly... it just doesn't impact me... ever....) - each of these 3 laws defines them slightly differently.

But the most impactful definitions, and those which have the broadest impacts on those *without* assistance animals, are the ADA's definitions; so I'll use that law's definitions to clarify.

Under the ADA, there are 3 classifications for assistance animals:

1. Service Dogs 

2. Emotional Support Dogs

3. Therapy Dogs

1.**Service dogs** are not considered pets. They are considered medical devices. They are dogs which have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. They are trained either by a professional trainer, or by the owner (or somewhere in between) to meet the disabled person's individual needs.

In order to qualify as a service dog, they need to meet 2 minimum standards: A. they need to have good citizenship (that will vary depending on the circumstances. In a dog park, barking, and running and playing with other dogs is perfectly acceptable... in a concert? not so much...) - and they need to perform a task (or tasks) for a disabled person (generally understood to be a task or tasks that they cannot do easily or at all for themselves, but the law has nuance in this regard).

If a person claims to have a service dog, and the dog is well behaved - a person in authority may ask ""Is that a service dog?"" and ""what task does s/he preform?"" 

Service dogs can perform tasks for any degree of disability from the very obvious like pulling a wheelchair for a paraplegic or guiding the blind, to the very invisible like seizure alert and PTSD attack mitigation. Disabilities aren't all visible, and so neither are the needs filled by the dogs. 

There may be different classifications of service dogs, depending on the state (for example, my state adds additional protections for all service dogs, above the ADA's, *except* psychiatric service dogs, or PSD's, which only receive those protected by federal law.) But at the federal level, in the ADA, a service dog is a service dog, regardless of the type of disability it works to assist. A state or local law may *not* **remove** protections given by the federal laws, they may only ever add additional protections.


2.**Emotional Support animals** - ESA's gain most of their protections under the FHA rather than the ADA, as they have almost no public protections - they are pets, not service dogs. They have no special training. They help a disabled person deal with the emotional challenges surrounding their disabilities. That's no small thing. They can be literal life-savers for many people with severe emotional disabilities. But these animals perform no task aside from being a companion to their owners. These are not specifically dogs, and can be cats, rats, bats or birds (or any other number of animals - this has caused some grief as people have tried to fly with turkeys and pigs.... remember, these animals have no special training, even good citizenship training. They're just pets.)


3.**Therapy Dogs** From Wikipedia (who's definition is fabulous)

&gt;A therapy dog is a dog that might be trained to provide affection, comfort and love to people in hospitals, retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, hospices, disaster areas, and are defined but not covered or protected under the Federal Housing Act or Americans with Disabilities act. They also do NOT have public access rights with exception to the specific places they are visiting and working. Typically the dog would be granted rights by individual facilities only.

So, there's the ""*short*"" version.

I'm sorry it's not short.

Keep in mind, I'm not an attorney. I may have some things wrong, and anyone is welcome to correct me. (I'm not an attorney, but before my health began to fail, law was my collegiate study at university and my first career - just not on that end of the law... so I'm rather good with legal-eze..... at least, better than the average Joe... still, I have been known to make mistakes.)

But that ""So what do you do [for a living]?"" question is always a difficult one. It doesn't always work, but I usually try give a brief answer and then shift the conversation to a different topic.

So I might say: ""I'm actually not healthy enough to work right now, but I've always been interested in X."" Or: ""I have a medical condition that keeps me from working, but I used to do Y."" Maybe add something about X or Y, and then ask: ""So, what do you do for a living?"" Or: ""You said that you do Z? How did you get into that field?""

Then you're (a) not sharing personal information, (b) telling the other person one of your interests that you *are* willing to talk about, and (c) shifting the conversation back to the other person. It doesn't always work - but if you're talking to someone who is *willing* to respect your privacy, this makes it easy for them to do so.

The other thing that helps is to have someone with you who knows you and can help shift the conversation in another direction... although that's not always possible. ",,,,amslucy,,,1522097866,t5_2qhe8,t3_87b402,t3_87b402,7,1525618867,0,0,dwbu7m6,disability,,,,,

It only takes once glance at the statistics for the rates of Depression and Suicide in men and women with disabilities to know something is very wrong in the way both genders are able to access care and treatment.

Both genders face struggles, they are different types of struggles and therefore no gender has it worse than the other - it depends on the individual.

I honestly don't know what I can do for a living in the current economy, let alone what I'm good at and what will pay the bills.

142,"Ugh. Confluence is my nemesis. 

I need to use Dragon Naturallyspeaking due to a very bad RSI. 

Can’t use MacOS at all because Outlook and Dragon don’t work there. The marketing material says they do, but trust me, you’ll go batty with dropped characters and incorrect correction fields. 

You can’t dictate into any Confluence text box, no matter the browser. I’m forced to copy and paste from Word. 

SharePoint is a little better, but views don’t scroll correctly when dictating, so I must be succinct. 

Outlook and Dragon are fantastic together. 

Slack in a web browser is OK. But their native app doesn’t work well. 

Jira text entry works well, but a lot of the actions require drag and drop. Not to mention it always seems to require an oddly high number of clicks to get anything done.

The question is, is it wrong for her to consider herself disabled? Not necessarily.

190,"Hi. I'm not sure I can help much, but I was in a similar position a few years ago. When I started pushing a chair I had little stamina and most of my local hills were too much for me to handle, both going uphill and downhill. Over time I've found a few things that have helped.


**Handles** My first chair had fixed handles and I got tired of having strangers grab hold and start pushing. So, for my next chair, I specified folding handles. You can also get extending and folding handles. Not every make and model offers folding handles, but it's worth looking out for them. I don't get too many people grabbing hold of the chair now.


**Bags** I use a bag that clips onto the back of my chair. It shifts the balance point backwards, so the tipping point of the chair makes going uphill slightly more dangerous. However I can carry a laptop and several books in the bag, in addition to a cloth shopping bag, waterproof cap, two water bottles, glasses and other odd bits and pieces. The only bag I wear is a small purse that I strap across my body and that carries my phone, money, keys, wallet and lip balm.


**Practice** I had little stamina when I started pushing the chair, so I looked for somewhere flat that I could practice pushing. I used a local mall and pushed up and down their central corridor for an hour or so at a time, going as fast as I could, but including manoeuvring round pedestrians as part of my practising. After several weeks I found that I was getting better at hills as my strength increased. It takes time, but your strength and stamina will get better. Try and find a large, flat, horizontal space that's mostly empty of people as a practice space - possibly a local running track would do.


**Hills** Hills and slopes are always going to be a pain. Initially many of them were beyond me, but I'm getting better. I live in a hilly city and there're many spaces I can't get to. I **have** to wear gloves, both for going up and down hills - the push required to get up a hill would rip the skin off my hands, and the braking for going downhill would burn my hands to blisters in seconds. There's no easy way up a hill. Accept help if it's offered and take it slowly. Give yourself lots of time to get up a hill. But, if the slope is too steep, give up. Usually I try and start journeys at the top of the hills and plan my pit stops as I go down the hills. It means travelling further than I would have if I was on foot, but it takes less effort overall.


**Push Rims** I found that normal metal rims were too slippery for me and I couldn't apply enough force when wheeling up and down slopes. So, for my next chair, I bought Surge LT rims. There are other makes out there, but the difference in ability to push is night and day. I recommend Surge rims to everyone who has to deal with slopes regularly. Also, in wet weather, the Surge rims are still too slippery, as are my normal tires. So I have a spare set of wheels with mountain bike tires on them and the rims are totally covered with spongy rubber. If it's raining I just swap the wheels and I can still manage to get about, albeit a bit more slowly than usual.

&amp;nbsp;


There's probably other things I could talk about, but this is all I can think of for now. I hope it's some help. DM me if you want to chat about adjusting to your new life.

198,"Hey - I'm in the UK too and have ehlers danlos, POTS and ulcerative colitis. I cannot walk and so rely on a wheelchair and am bed bound most of the time due to regular dislocations and passing out.

Whilst my carers are paid for by the NHS (which I am SO grateful for!) and most specialist equipment has been paid for by the council (as recommended by my council OT), there are other additional costs. Probably for me I spend the most money on getting wheelchair accessible taxis to hospital appointments (and social events when I can), and washing clothes/bed linen as I regularly have accidents due to bowel incontinence. At the moment I am spending a fortune on incontinence bed pads, adult nappies and bed pan liners, however I am hoping that when I finally see the incontinence nurses that I have been referred to that they might be able to provide some of these things on the NHS. I have been told though that the options of things they provide are quite limited. I will most likely have to continue paying at the very least for bed pan liners - which make things a lot easier for my husband as he helps me at night. 

I also spend a lot of money on buying clothing essentials - often my underwear and leggings get ruined and need replacing unfortunately. Bed sheets obviously need replacing more often than most as they have to be washed so frequently. Unsurprisingly our water bills are very high! Heating probably costs us more than most as I am unable to work so am at home all day with my carers. 

I don't have one but a friend has an assistance dog and obviously that would incur additional costs. I have two gorgeous cats who are wonderful companions - my husband says they are my 'therapy cats' - but I doubt that counts :P

233,"Most universities will send someone with an electric cart to transport anyone with disabilities when requested.  There often are call boxes all around the parking lot with rotating blue lights to visually signal lot attendants and to connect the caller directly to campus police dispatchers.  Sometimes it's possible to schedule the trips in advance.  They have carts specifically for this purpose and their budget partly comes from disability funds and student parking fees, so this is a service that you should be able to depend upon when you need it.   Most campuses are very big with long distances even to handicap parking spots, so electric carts are provided to fill this need.  It also provides some students with jobs they need through Federal Work-Study programs.   No need to feel self-conscious about it at all-this is a normal service.

Campus police loved writing handicap access tickets because these violations rarely get overturned or reduced by judges when someone tries to fight them.  Student vehicles aren't usually given any special treatment, while official vehicles in the middle of campus business can be exempted for obvious reasons.  Campus parking lots aren't setup for regular parking by large busses, so accommodation is made for them when being used for their intended purposes.   But if any non-campus bus tries to do this, you can usually be assured that they will be ticketed and towed just like for anyone else.",,,,vapeducator,,,1520191030,t5_2qhe8,t3_81kdf1,t1_dv6cgrk,1,1524809888,0,0,dv6dpci,disability,,,,,

As for walking the dogs, usually, we just let them run around in the fenced in backyard. If we do leash walk them, we prefer the retractable leashes (especially the extra long 16' ones) that gives them enough room to walk around and sniff without pulling us around too much.

262,"I've been going through a rough time of my life, I've been homeless for the last year-and-a-half, Couchsurfing between four different states, sleeping in shelters, sleeping on the street,  renting rooms from people who turned out to be abusive and having to cut off relationships.

I can't drive, I can't see very well, I can't trust people, I have a million different problems because I was born extremely early in 1982, 26 weeks to a psychologically abusive psychopath of a mother. It took 30 years actually 31 years to escape.

I have crippling anxiety, terrible generalized anxiety and PTSD. 

Because of the stress of the last year-and-a-half I now have IBS, and every fucking thing turns to diarrhea no matter what it is.

I have no friends in any of the states I've lived in the last 18 months, so I'm going back to the one state I do have friends in.

Shit, I volunteered at a food bank for cats and dogs and one of my volunteers committed suicide.

I know things feel bad for you right now, but it could be so much worse.

All this stuff has been going on, and yet I'm getting on a plane in a few days to go to back to my state where I have success, and go back to school and get stability.

Just cuz things look bleak now doesn't mean it's going to be that way all the time.

You may never be able to work again, I won't without serious help, but my self-worth has nothing to do with the jobs that I can or can't do.

I can't speak to your situation, but something that really helped me was connecting with other disabled people, online and locally. Seeing other people with bodies like ours, living their lives, helped give me hope. 

A lot of able-bodied people have a lot of negative things to say about being disabled, and feel horror at the thought, but with time and familiarity you realize that it is just another way that people live, just another type of ""normal"". That people are worth more than their productivity.

I spent much of the first years of my illness learning the boundaries of my body and giving it lots of rest. I, like you, had been pushing myself before finally going to the doctor, and because I'd pushed so long my body was wrecked. 

I wouldn't be surprised if, for a while, your back is worse than it's ever been because it's been pushed so far. But you can take this time to figure out your body, try different things, and learn your limits. 

Likely, it will never go back completely to what it was, but humans have an amazing ability to adjust and with time you can reach a new plateau, a new normal, that you are able to better predict and rely on. This will allow you to ration your time and energy to do things you really value and enjoy, even if you can't do everything all the time. 

You are more than what you can do, and there are lots of people out there who can see that. Many disabled people, including the severely physically impaired, have fulfilling love and family lives. 

There isn't a lot of publicity for that in the media, so it can be hard to imagine, but meeting other disabled people and seeing their lives helped me a lot with that. There are also many more accessible solutions to doing things than I ever would have imagined before! Sometimes it just takes learning to do an old thing in a new way. 

Don't give up! Things are slow, sometimes painfully so, but you can wait out the worst parts and become acclimated to the rest. Becoming disabled doesn't mean not having a life worth living, it's not only about giving things up.

266,"That makes sense, it's hard to think of anything else when basic needs aren't met yet. I applied for SSDI a while back, if you live in the US here are some tips I found helpful:

-The Nolo website has lots of great information on applying 

-SSDI has a list of conditions that are default covered, check to see if your condition is on the list. If not, it is very common to get rejected on your first try. Don't take this to heart! 

Most people get rejected on the first try, sometimes even if their diagnosis is on the list. If you get rejected the next step is to appeal, and after that if your appeal doesn't go through you can still get a disability lawyer and appeal again. They can help even if you don't have money because they take a portion of your disability backpay instead. (So they only get paid if you win the case.)

-For me, when I got sick we didn't know what it was for a long time so I was seeing doctor after doctor until I got a diagnosis. I asked for copies every time I got scans, and recorded dates for the scans as well as keeping track of my past medications. Having a paper trail helps immensely in the application process and greatly improves your chances of being accepted on your first try. 

Part of your application will have to be filled out by a doctor, so I would recommend talking to your PCP before you apply and make sure they are on board. Having a doctor who understands your situation and the disability process is extremely helpful. I also highly recommend that you see a physical therapist and have them record what you are/aren't able to do, as this is likely the most valuable specialist recommendation to the disability process. 

-When your case is being reviewed, they must look not only at your single ""disabling"" condition, but at a combination of every condition you have. Because of this, it is very important you write down everything you have, even if it's something like generalized anxiety or IBS or anything else you've adapted to. If you have problems you haven't gone to a doctor or gotten diagnosed with, now is a good time to get those diagnosed so you can have a paper trail and put them on your application. 

-The disability application is, unfortunately, not always the best in terms of representing how disability works in the real world. It is not very accommodating of conditions that are worse some days than others. One of the most valuable pieces of advice that was given to me is to fill out the application, answering the questions as they apply to you *on your worst day*. This makes sure you can get covered for the help you need, because your worst day is the measuring stick of when/how you can or can't work. 

I also highly recommend going to see a physical therapist *on your worst day*. It's sad that we have to do this, but if you go in on a good day, they may write down that you're more capable than you actually are. When I went, I made sure to be at my worst-- I didn't sleep well the night before, hadn't eaten that day, and exhausted myself doing chores I would normally leave to a good day. The appointment will be miserable and painful, because the PT is required to go through a checklist of actions to test you, but it's invaluable evidence as far as the disability application is concerned.

267,"More than happy to help! I also felt I would get rejected first off, because I was in my early 20s and my disability was not on the accepted list. However, I ended up getting lucky-- someone with my same disability went through the appeal process in my town before me and got accepted. The reviewers were therefore familiar with my condition and I got in on the first try. 

When I was applying, I tried to get in contact with a lawyer ahead of time so I would be prepared to appeal, but they wouldn't even talk to me until after I got rejected. (I think they wouldn't deal with me until after I tried to appeal on my own as well.) I would recommend applying first, because you might get in anyway, and looking for lawyer recommendations in the meantime. (I think lawyers just don't want to waste their time talking until it's 100% sure that you need them.)

And yeah, it's really upsetting how little people know about disability. They tend to think ""you're old or you're paralyzed"" as if that's all there is. I had a hard time as well, due to my condition I couldn't sit up or stand for more than a few minutes without fainting, so I could only leave the house in a wheelchair. But I could walk short distances inside my house, where I had walls to lean on and people to help me. But the default view tends to just be ""omg, that person in a wheelchair stood for 5 seconds, they're a faker!""

You mention the distress of having a bladder that doesn’t fully work. With a neurogenic bladder, I suffered for years from incontinence and other issues before finding out that self-catheterization solves or reduces most of my issues related to a non-functioning bladder. I don’t know all your issues, but while you can’t have your device, a catheter may reduce the severity of the symptoms you experience. Although I feel I’m missing something important here, because if you truly have a sacral nerve stimulator, you should have tried at least one type of catheter before surgical implantation, and most likely had a discussion with your urologist about lifestyle modifications to aid with your bladder issues both pre- and post- implantation and removal.

Until recently, I was on Adderall for years. The drug tests I took for some psychiatric treatments were never an issue. I also routinely test false-positive for pcp on certain depression meds.

I've gotten ADHD meds from my psychiatrist, and not drug tested, BUT doctor's  do run a report called a CURES report, which will have all meds (narcotics/scheduled medication) on it anyways.

351,"Okay, disability examiner here. This has gotten very confusing.

What Ckbrouwer said about SSDI is correct- you need work credits to qualify. This is something the field office/social security determines based on how much you paid into the system and how many quarters you worked. What wasn't mentioned much was SSI.

SSI is based on income and resources. If you are earning less than a certain amount per month (somewhere around $1170), and depending on what you own, you may be able to apply for that. There is no cost to apply for social security, and you can apply for both types at once. I would recommend this. 

B-dub31 pointed you in a good direction with the Blue Book. ESRD is a significant illness. Being on dialysis meets a Blue Book listing, but there are other ways to be allowed. Chronic kidney disease is also a listing, which looks at creatinine levels and other symptoms. This would be in your medical records. You could also be allowed due to medical vocational factors, dependent on age/work history. You say you have many conditions, and when all of these are factored together, the determination could be that you are not capable of working, or you're not capable of working jobs that are similar to what you've done in the past/jobs with similar skills but lesser physical demands. I can explain this further if you'd like.

Medicaid is different in every state, and I am not well-versed enough in each state to advise you on that. Social services usually handles Medicaid, so that's where to start there. 

The biggest misconception on this subreddit is that an attorney representative is necessary at the initial level. It's not, and can often be detrimental due to not cooperating with the examiner. A person can complete the initial, and even reconsideration, claim forms on his/her own. As long as he/she responds to calls and returns forms he/she receives in the mail, or goes to scheduled exams, there is no problem. An attorney representative is necessary at the ALJ, administrative law judge, level.

SSI was what I was expecting anyways.  Someone had already told me the limit was about 700 a month, and I'm ok with that.  I have to take what I can get.  The main thing I need is the healthcare since my health insurance got cancelled and that's a bulk of my expenses.

357,"Thanks so much for this information.  I'm feeling a little overwhelmed here trying to figure this out so every bit of information is going to help me a lot.  I just received a benefits identification card from the State of California but it didn't have much information with it other than saying I can take it to a doctor and they can swipe it to see if I qualify.  I called them directly like suggested and they told me to call my local social services office which was unfortunately closed for the day or not picking up, so I'll have to call again tomorrow.

My exact situation is this.  I've had severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis to varying degrees since I was 18 (I'm currently 40.)  The longest job I've had was a work from home job for about 3 years back in the early 2000's, back when my condition wasn't as bad.  Aside from that I've had a one year stint of work at two different jobs one of which I had to quit directly because of work related stress causing my skin condition to break out to a level where I was bedridden and ended up in the ER.  Most recently I tried to get a union job for the healthcare but failed out of their training program after a few weeks because I couldn't move fast enough.  Within the last year or so I was diagnosed with ESRD due to a combination of diabetes, hypertension, and NSAID use due to arthritic pain.  (I really stopped taking care of myself.)  I was waiting to schedule surgery to have a fistula made for dialysis when I found out I no longer had health coverage.  

During this time I had health insurance on and off.  I went to school when I could but had difficulty passing classes due to medical absences.  I was able to extend the insurance from my last job that had healthcare using cal-cobra and paying out of pocket.  On March 1st I tried to pick up a prescription and was told I no longer had health insurance because my provider had decided to leave the state of California.  

Up to this point I've been supported by my parents, but the financial strain is mounting.  We're on multiple payment plans to pay off medical bills, the largest being a 7k bill for that ER visit.  The vein mapping for dialysis just added a fresh $600 bill after insurance, so I can't imagine what the actual surgery is going to cost.  I've gone to school and I've tried to find sedentary jobs but my conditions make it impossible.  Pretty much any repetitive motion, even typing or clicking on a mouse, can lead to a severe arthritic reaction.  (I can't even chew gum anymore because it could lead to an arthritic jaw.)

So basically what I need is assistance affording healthcare (or at the very least not being denied for pre-existing conditions) and help just paying for day to day expenses.  I've got about two weeks of medication left and just cancelled an appointment with my primary care because I'm not sure I can afford it without insurance.  

At the moment I've applied for SSI and waiting a response.  I was told I would be contacted by a social worker for my medicaid but I haven't yet.  I filled out a bunch of stuff and got a medi-cal card in the mail.  

I don't know if this complicates things but I was denied before for disability.  I had gone to the social security office to help my parents apply for their retirement benefits and asked the social security worker about disability and the guy gave me a form and gave me an appointment date to talk about it.  I never applied for anything but I got a letter in the mail over a year later saying that I was denied because I didn't show up.

I had gone to the social security office to help my parents apply for their retirement benefits and asked the social security worker about disability and the guy gave me a form and gave me an appointment date to talk about it.  I never applied for anything but I got a letter in the mail over a year later saying that I was denied because I didn't show up.  

I think my next move will be to go to the local social services office and see what it is I'm supposed to do.  ","[{'start': 1932, 'end': 1942, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I have a lot of difficulty sitting or standing for any length of time so they modified my desk so that it would mechanically rise to a standing position then lowered to a sitting and actually lowered to a kneeling so that I could transition through all three throughout the day.  

They had a custom chair made for me that had a cut outs in the bottom so they did not put unnecessary pressure on my tailbone which is a source of pain for me. They also had a custom kneeling chair made for me to use in the kneeling position. The kneeling chair was equipped with wheels and a strap so I could roll it with me to meetings and conference rooms and sit more comfortably.

They also worked with me on a modified work schedule so that I could drive-in and return home during the lighter traffic times and do some work from home each day to round out my hours. This minimize the amount of time required for me to sit in the car.

Lastly, we had an employee assistance program for emotional support to help me cope with the challenges of my physical ailments and the pain that I was in each day.

For some reason, in the U.S it is standard for sales clerks, cashiers, and a variety of jobs where someone is in one spot behind a desk for long periods, to stand instead of sit like they do in many other countries. When she asked for a stool or similar, they gave her hell about it, even as she offered to bring medical paperwork as proof.

It would be nice if workplaces had smoother processes in place for requesting accommodations, and if it just got approved, especially if it was something small and cheap like a stool.

496,"I have mixed feelings on that. The change in the DSM from ""gender identity disorder"", which classified being trans as itself a disorder, to ""gender dysphoria"", which is a distressing mental disorder than many trans people experience and which needs treatment. 

A lot of folks were still uncomfortable with ""gender dysphoria"" being in there, but I understand why they kept it. If there wasn't anything there, it would be impossible to get insurance to cover basic trans care. 

For trans people who experience body dysphoria, access to things like hormones and surgery is really important. It's also important that we recognize that as a separate thing from being trans-- not all trans people experience body dysphoria, so having gender dysphoria in the DSM *isn't* the same thing as saying trans people are intrinsically mentally ill. 

I suppose you could argue that trans people have protections in the ADA allowing them to use gender affirming bathrooms... But I feel that is flawed and incomplete. Not all trans people have body dysphoria, and they should still have access to public restrooms. 

A trans woman is a woman regardless of whether she experiences body dysphoria, and should have access to the woman's restroom *because* she is a woman. Not because she has or has not had certain medical procedures or because of her medical records. If we use only the ADA, trans people who did not get diagnoses or engage in specific medical processes are left out. 

I think, for both the long and short term, it is better to approach the situation as ""everyone needs to use restrooms in public, trans people should use the restroom they feel comfortable and safe in, and gender neutral and single occupancy bathrooms should be available whenever possible to allow flexibility.""

But I also get that diversity in tactics is important, so if a trans person is fighting under the ADA for accommodations related to their body dysphoria, and not saying being trans is itself a disorder, then I don't see it as harmful. Having multiple vectors of approach is beneficial, and people should have their rights protected from multiple angles.

539,"Unfortunately, transitioning adds in another level of hard to navigating medical things.  A lot of doctors are not very well educated in trans care and can lead to ""trans broken arm syndrome"" where any issue you have is blamed on being trans/transitioning even if...it's obviously not related at all (yeah, my chronic abdominal pain was definitely because I'm trans, doc, and not because of a physical problem in addition to probably endometriosis, thanks for that awesome differential diagnosis).  It's especially exciting/nerve-inducing to navigate if you try to use insurance to cover things and get an official gender dysphoria diagnosis on your medical records so literally every doctor sees that and that informs/affects their care of you and not always in a good way.

And that makes it hard to sort out actual problems from transitioning from the trans broken arm syndrome because going on HRT *can* cause negative side effects with some types of disabilities (I have friends with EDS who cannot go on HRT because of how it caused their EDS to worsen); it can also make doing surgeries more complicated too.

That said, coming out, being myself, and taking the steps of medical transition that I need has been worth dealing with the additional headaches.  Yes, it has been overwhelming at times.

540,"Nice to meet you, I'm also disabled and trans, having POTS/EDS. I spent 4 years bedridden and in a wheelchair to get around before starting HRT and some other medications which improved my blood pressure. 

I was going to doctors 2-4x per week for years trying to figure out what was going on and treating symptoms, so seeing so many different doctors so often gave me a decent idea about discrimination in the medical field at least. Before I started HRT, I honestly just didn't come out to doctors at all. I had to see so many of them, all different, so it didn't make sense when it was not likely affecting me medically. 

I had the most trouble in reproductive health, as I was having a lot of pain and wanted to have a hysterectomy since I didn't/don't plan on giving birth. The doctor kept gaslighting me about the pain, telling me to just take painkillers, wouldn't order any scans or refer me out, etc. 

Kept saying I was ""too young"" and would change my mind. At that point, I told her I was trans to emphasize that I really, really wasn't going to birth children and she decided I'd made the whole thing up to trick her into approving ""sex change surgery"" and then referred me to a ""sex change clinic."" Of course, since my problem was not about transition at all, they didn't help me. Turns out, bc of that doc I had an undiagnosed infection for several years which had spread to the point that it almost killed me. (And later was diagnosed with endometriosis as well.)

That's probably my worst experience just because I almost died. I had several other problems, but mostly just snide comments from Drs about my wheelchair or, after HRT, them trying to blame things like an eye infection on my hormones. I did find that *always* bringing someone with you to doctor appointments helped immensely, since people are much less likely to be abusive with other people around. Bonus points if that person is totally on your side and likes to be mean to bigots. 

I don't have much personal experience with caregivers-- I really needed in-home care and suffered a lot without it, but insurance wouldn't cover it, I couldn't afford out of pocket costs, and I couldn't find any local programs that helped. Ended up spending the last several years just not eating or drinking when my partner was at work because I couldn't get up to use the restroom when he was gone. Went months without bathing, got a lot of bed sores, other problems. 

I did briefly manage to get in contact with some other disabled trans people locally, though, and the issue of caregivers came up a lot. The medical field is really prejudiced, so in my area, which is one of the most liberal cities in the U.S., LGBT caregivers are mostly completely closeted, even though we have a thriving queer/trans community and lots of people live ""out"" in various public jobs/places. Very likely, there are queer/trans caregivers in your area who similarly have to hide to get by. 

The trick is finding them-- my best guess would be check to see if there are any non-profits in your area that deal in disability/aging or LGBT stuff, then asking around. In my area, there's the Center on Aging or similar, which actually provides for younger disabled people too in a limited capacity, and SAGE, an org by and for older queers. Maybe also asking around on Facebook groups like the Facebook Transgender Alliance, or groups for trans folks local to your country/state/city.

541,"So, as far as HRT, I would just have a talk with your doc about the effects it may have on the nature of your disability. Now, I am a disabled cis-female, and I take all kinds of shortcuts and things about my appearance. Wigs/Crochet Braids help keep me in nice, long hair without any maintenance/effort on my part. Dresses can help if I cant put on pants that day (I am also in a wheelchair). Ive found wearing a custom steel boned corset (not tightlaecd tho), help in bracing my back and ribs better than any other medical brace ever could, but it can cause worsening of muscle atrophy if worn too long/often.

I personally wear a VS bombshell bra. These are the best and most comfortable to me. and they are extremely flattering as well. Looks as if I had gotten a breast augmentation. Ive always wanted implants but my body cant handle it.
As far as catheters, I would say if you wear a midi length dress, you may be able to attatch the bag to your upper thigh maybe? This would be easier in a maxi dress tho. Or maybe slip the tube around the back of the knee to conceal it. I seen on pintrest there are several ways to disguise it with decorative bags. The best one I seen was a belly bag, where the bag can be attached at the navel on top of the underwear area. Not sure if that would work for your situation. The photo said its for use with  indwelling foley or suprapubic catheter, not external male catheter, but maybe can be modified to fit lower on the lap ?  Tubes can be decorated as well to match the outfit if coverage isnt possible. You can add a side/back slit or a small opening on the dress to feed the tube thru.

I hope this can be of some help! And good luck on your journey, if you need to talk or anything I m here :)",,,,_audiotherapy_,,,1521006897,t5_2qhe8,t3_844v0s,t3_844v0s,4,1525145580,0,0,dvo8aar,disability,,,,,
542,"I'm sorry you had a rough time of it.   Unfortunately, spinal fusion has a high complication rate.   That is why the orthopedic surgeons only recommend this surgery when there are almost no options left.    

My son had his fusion last summer.  He bled out on the table and they had to replace his entire blood volume.   His heart went into a deadly arrhythmia also and they had to use chest compressions to keep him alive.   Then he nearly died again in the PICU while they transferred him from one ventilator to another because the traditional ventilator was still leaving him severely hypoxic.   We then dealt with four months of post-op infections.    What has me still concerned is the risk of post op problems still remain even years later.  If I knew then what I know now I would have skipped the surgery and enrolled him in a palliative care program.  

It took six months before the pain started to diminish for my son so hopefully, since you are seeing improvements so quickly you will be one of the better outcomes.

543,"I would not be surprised if that has something to do with the infection. It sounds like the poor guy has been through way too much. I am so sorry your family has had to go through all this. Initially after the fusion I was spiking fevers but we couldn't figure out why. I think it was a reaction to the Alloderm they used. Last time they used Alloderm after one of my cancer surgeries, I spent 6 weeks on IV antibiotics twice a day and 8 on oral while I watched my chest rot off. The vomiting and diarrhea from the antibiotics was as bad as chemo by the end, nevermind the fact that I had to deal with the knowledge I was torturing myself giving myself the infusions knowing it would make me sick. I'm not sure why the fevers stopped this time after only 5 days of vancomycin and waiting it out after it infiltrated (and contributed to the clotting) but I'm grateful. I really hope he doesn't have to deal with much more related to the fusion. I feel lucky so far, but I know I'm only a month out and I've got a long way to go.

I've always had trouble with anesthesia. I've woken up during quite a few procedures (first time was when they sliced into my breast for my first cancer surgery) and it can cause quite the scene.

Last time they used <LOCATION> after one of my cancer surgeries, I spent 6 weeks on IV antibiotics twice a day and 8 on oral while I watched my chest rot off. The vomiting and diarrhea from the antibiotics was as bad as chemo by the end, nevermind the fact that I had to deal with the knowledge I was torturing myself giving myself the infusions knowing it would make me sick. I'm not sure why the fevers stopped this time after only 5 days of vancomycin and waiting it out after it infiltrated (and contributed to the clotting) but I'm grateful. I really hope he doesn't have to deal with much more related to the fusion. I feel lucky so far, but I know I'm only a month out and I've got a long way to go.

I've always had trouble with anesthesia. I've woken up during quite a few procedures (first time was when they sliced into my breast for my first cancer surgery) and it can cause quite the scene. General still works, but for smaller procedures I'm awake now. Not terribly surprising that a good chunk of my PTSD is medical trauma.

I've got a while left to see what my outcome is but initially it has relieved the pain and numbness in my leg, at least, but now I've had two blood clots in the same place so it definitely isn't a fluke. I'm on blood thinners. My hemoglobin was cut in half after the surgery. I was wondering what they did that I managed to lose half of that, but after hearing your soon bled out, I'm not surprised. My heart rate has been itty of control since the surgery, but we don't know why. I didn't realize the risk for infection stuck around for so long. That is scary.

547,"I'm not a 100% certain but I think what led to all the post-op infections was his incomplete surgical closure.  The surgical team did the internal stitches but the skin level stitches were not done at all since they had to flip him quickly to do the chest compressions.   

The surgeon thinks one of the internal stitches got infected.   The infection didn't clear fully until I bought a bottle of wound cleanser to clean the sinus tract on top of the oral antibiotics.   

As far as long-term complication I think the concerns are the screws pulling out or the rods breaking.  My son is non-ambulatory (wheelchair bound) so his bones are softer and it makes retaining the screws harder but even healthy people can have complications year later.    We, unfortunately, weren't aware of how bad his bone density issue was until the surgery (and the screws started backing out while the surgery was still taking place; Thus leading to a longer more involved surgery where they fused the entire spine so the rods would have more anchor points.   We also had to redo all his DME seating as well due to the full fusion and that always takes time for insurance to process the approval and funding. 

Hopefully, you won't have any more problems but usually, 6 months out is when most people start to feel significantly better.  Totally horrifying that you had to stay awake and aware during your surgical procedures.   One of the main reasons I have always refused to get eye surgery is that I don't want anyone cutting on me unless I am completely oblivious.

615,"Just a tip. If you buy one which requires a powerpoint and it has a reservoir it can be a real hassle, especially if you run out of water. I have a shower head style water flosser of [this design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000H68J2S/) (I'd expect that the shower head version would be inaccessible...) which runs on mains pressure, is easy to install, and does not need any inputs or fussing around that some of the more expensive models do.

This might be ideal for you if you have issues with muscle strength or dexterity in your arms because you don't need to hold down a button and, frankly, you can take as long as you damn well please without having to worry about topping up a bulky and cumbersome reservoir.

619,"Assisting with eating isn't as hard as most people think it is. Really, as long as you follow her lead, it shouldn't even be a worry at all.

But that part is the key. Don't get in a rush, and listen. Asking directly what she wants/needs is way better than anything else I could mention.  Some people need the utensils and food placed in their mouth, others prefer/need to have it held steady so they can take the bite. 

It never hurts to ask about sizes as well.  Usually, a fairly small bite is better, but what a person  considers small varies. It's easy enough with spoons, just keep whatever the food is either level or maybe slightly above/below. It's fork foods that tend to take more trial and error if the person can't communicate. Since your girlfriend can, it's easy peasy, just ask her to indicate something to compare the bites with. A lot of people do well with coin comparisons, with the range between a dime and a nickel being the best range for most. Anything bigger than the typical crouton is probably a bad choice though.

For real, I started out as a nurse's assistant at 17 (officially anyway, training and volunteer work started a year or so before that). It was a bit awkward the first few bites with my first patient, but after that it just became background, automatic. If my gangly, nervous teenage self could manage it with a stranger, you'll do just fine.

And for what it's worth, feeding a partner like that can be a very deep bonding experience. It is intimate, and very primitive in how we respond to it.

The first time my partner came over to my house it was unplanned. I didn't want him to come over when I was having a bad week, because our few dates so far had been on good pain days, and I'd dressed up and worn makeup, done my hair etc. But he asked if he could come over to cook for me as I was too ill to do anything, he even brought his own pyjamas so I wouldn't be the only one wearing them! 
The next day (he slept over), although we had only ever kissed before, he helped me have a bath and washed my hair for me. It was so lovely of him - he's quite a shy person and I think he could have been nervous about it, but it was something I needed help with and he wanted to help. 

My advice for you is to ask what help exactly she needs, what it entails. Let her be in control. And don't worry about messing up - it happens, we get over it quickly.

634,"The previous responses on this post are much more eloquent and thought-out than I can be at the moment, but I'll throw my two cents in nonetheless.  My primary issues are MS and spinal problems, so I still look fairly ""normal"". However, due to where one of my lesions is situated, I often have to use a cane, walker, mart cart, etc. I can get around some, but I have limits that tend to close in on me quickly and can cause pretty nasty falls.  So as a 34 year old man, I get a lot of quick looks when I'm out shopping in a mart cart. It's irritating if I'm already in a bad mood, sure, but I don't really mind the quick looks.  I don't mind well-intentioned questions or offers to help me,  and will often use humor to make the situation more comfortable. I don't see it as feeling obligated to educate them, or anything of that sort, but just a social interaction that doesn't ignore the obvious elephant in the room. Humans are wired to notice that which is different, and disabled people often stand out from the pack.  The only times I've been irritated enough to be brusque with people are when they ask pointed questions that seem to imply I'm just lazy, or not trying hard enough.  That's incredibly rare, now, in my experience.  I can't even remember the last time that happened to me, thankfully. Most idiots keep it to themselves when it comes to judging us, and if they want to be ignorant silently, it is what it is.

However, I must admit that I personally am fine with pretty rough language, so sometimes, when people go out of their way to cut me off or block my way to get somewhere or get to something ahead of me (this usually happens in grocery stores), I've often just bluntly said ""That's okay, never mind the cripple! You go on ahead with those fancy workin' legs!""  I know the word is not welcome by some, but it honestly cracks me up to see those people scramble to find something to say as an awkward apology after being called out on that.

The pity we face can come from either of these or both, perhaps from a fear of causing harm or a curiosity for over our unique experience. 
In response to the comments about  our responsibility (or lack thereof) to teach about disability, my name alone should make it clear where I stand on the issue. In my years I have come to understand that if people don't ask, they will assume--and usually wrongly. So I do answer questions, and I do take it upon myself to make use of those teachable moments. If I don't, then who will? Who else can? One of the things I emphasize is that one is not all, that you cannot model all of cerebral palsy, and certainly not all that is disability, by my or any one person's experience. Every person is a new slate, and you have to ask those questions anew each time if you truly want to understand anyone, disability or otherwise.
Keeping with my lesson I also understand that not everyone is going to do what I do, and that is perfectly okay.
I think having a disability has helped me to come to understand the myriad of ways that people can be and behave, and to embrace all of them with patience and understanding--the same thing I hope for from everyone else.

640,"You said we're just regular people, and you're correct.  I should be treated as such.  I get sick and tired of being bothered by random folks about my disability when I'm busy doing other things or otherwise just trying to live my life.  No one asks why I'm in the chair; my lack of legs is explantation enough.  What I get is a lot of thanking me for my service even though I was never in the military, or religious people trying to pray to me or lay on hands praying, which is super annoying as an atheist.

  I'm usually polite about it, but I've had to get pretty damned assertive to make a couple of the worse types of religious people to lay off.  They then act like I'm the asshole because I dont want them trying to practice their religion on me.  Politeness goes right out the window when people just wont listen.  

  Ive also had a couple people just up and grab my chair to ""help"" me.  I absolutely am not polite or nice about that one.  I immediately order them to stop and angrily explain how fucking rude that is.  As far as I'm concerned, unannounced chair pushing is in no way worthy of politeness or understanding.  You do that, you get dressed down, period.

  Assuming I'm just going to answer questions about my disability when I'm clearly busy will also earn my disdain.  I normally dont mind occasional questions from polite folks who follow normal societal guidelines of mutual respect.  Hell, I put on live streaming shows where I openly talk about disabled life and answer questions.  If someone is bothering me while I'm wearing headphones and clearly in the middle of something, why should I respect their questions when they havent respected my space and time?

  All that said, I dont mind polite folks who follow general rules of courtesy.  I've talked to bunches of curious kids and plenty of adults who treated me like anyone else.  Its when boundaries arent respected and incorrect assumptions are acted upon instead of questioned that I start being openly aggravated.  I dont feel bad about putting those types of people in their place one bit.  I already get stared at everywhere I go.

670,"I realize that comments like that might feel patronizing, but do you think that pressure you feel is warranted? If others are motivated by you simply living your life, why isn't that ok and why isn't that enough? I used to agree that comments like that and inspiration porn, etc, was bad but let's face it, it takes a certain internal fortitude to live our lives as disabled people. Just look at the people with disabilities (and without!) who give up on life or never leave their homes or get a job or go to school because of their disability. They could if they ""only"" did what you and I do every morning -- get up and go for it despite it all.

My thoughts about this changed the morning I realized that I can still get out of bed by myself. I have muscular dystrophy, but the fact that I can roll and shimmy and shake and twist and leverage and kick and oompf and scoot and eventually get my body sitting up in my wheelchair is actually pretty damn amazing. But if someone else said, ""Hey that's amazing that you can get out of bed!"" I'm supposed to get upset? I don't think so. Better yet, if someone said to me, ""I think about how you get out of bed in the morning when I can't make myself get out of bed in the morning..."" then WOW. They're actually referencing the thing I'm proud of doing to motivate themselves. That's a positive impact.

In times when I feel pressure to achieve more in my life, I ponder the idea that maybe my purpose in life is simply to do my best and live. Maybe by doing so, I will motivate others to get off their able-bodied asses and go do something with themselves. Maybe when all that happens, the world actually becomes a better place? Maybe even those disabled people who give up will be motivated by us!

I encourage you to think seriously about the things that are difficult for you and think about how you overcome then and think about how you are amazing because you do that. We can't continue to devalue and discard our own personal accomplishments even, and especially, if they are related to our disability. As you have experienced, it makes you feel pressure and maybe makes you feel not good enough. To deal with what we deal with on top of all the responsibilities of being human?

Most of your case is based solely on medical evidence and the information from your own physician(s) does carry more weight in the decision. I did have one doctor who felt that I was not disabled, however still responded to any SSA requests appropriately as it is not her place to state her opinion but rather provide objective information relating to my health so goes to show that just because a doctor tells you that they think you can still work, they probably can’t put that down without a lot of evidence supporting that; they know that’s what the disability determination process is for. I was given a fully favorable ruling about four years after my first filing in front of the ALJ. I did hire an attorney once it got close to the hearing and highly recommend getting one that specializes in disability cases as it caps their pay at 10% of your back pay.

764,"First off, it can be difficult for SSA to find doctors willing to do the exams, and there at a lot of doctors who just churn them out as a way to make extra money. There are crappy doctors who do exams just like there are crappy doctors in general. 

Every DDS office has a Professional Relations Officer (just called a 'Pro'). Their job is to deal with exam provider complaints. You can call and tell them what happened. Likely, nothing is going to come of it for your specific situation, but they might talk to the doctor about it. The complaint will also get logged and, if a doctor has enough issues, they will stop using them. 

As to your question on its effect on your claim - its going to have very little effect. To be honest, given that you have almost no medical history and [I'm assuming] you're young, your claim will not be allowed based on physical conditions. Legally they are just required to obtain exams. 

If you are denied, you can appeal, but if you continue to not get regular treatment, chances are you're going to be denied again and again. Very few people are allowed based solely on a SSA purchased psych exam, especially for mood/anxiety disorders. 

If you want to increase your chances - you need to get into treatment. If you have no income you might qualify for your state's Medicaid or look for free/sliding scale clinics in your area. In order for a person to be disabled, we have to look at their symptoms/limitations *in spite of treatment*. Your diagnosed conditions often respond well to treatment, so SSA will need a documented history showing that you've tried multiple treatments (meds, therapy, etc) but still your condition continues to prevent you from gainful employment.

Medicaid and Disability are two completely different things. Disability is a federal program, and Medicaid is done through the state. Each state has their own qualifications, but they are generally the same. Being on Disability is not a requirement (although sometimes it is an automatic qualifier)

So whether or not you have Medicaid has no bearing on your disability case. So that person gave you bad information or maybe you just misunderstood her.

774,"I have a similar experience. Thought my problems would ""mature."" They would go away with age, until I had a complete breakdown. Now, I'm on the same path as you, with a similar story.

It matters and it doesn't. It helps to have a Doctor ""approved"" disability, meaning your PCP backs your claim of disabled, but not like it used too. The State will have it's own process, and that's what matters.

It's sound like your doctor was a little insensitive, but nothing out of the norm. PCP see a lot of people,for the most part, you should trust them. If you don't trust them, find another doctor that will listen and respect you.

Though, don't jump around too much. It could look like you're trying to game the system and will black mark you. Like yourself, I have severe PTSD. That caused a lot of issues for me in getting a lawyer that will fight for me.

I'm not a Veteran, but I have a PTSD and it took a Veteran lawyer to  take my case. He has seen it all regarding PTSD and said my case was slam dunk with my job history and PCP history. Said he got Veteran's with only PTSD diagnoses, with less history than I have, disability.

You need a lawyer, now. If you are truly disabled, a lawyer will take the case. They will get you in line with expectations from doctors and the State. As well as fighting your appeals and such. Currently, I'm waiting for my hearing date and I've been at this stage for a year. It's a very long process.

I know it is heartbreaking to not be able to do what you love, and I agree, you can't do that work right now. Unfortunately, SSA doesn't take into account what you love or have been trained to do, if you're young, meaning under 50. You can't lift more than 5 pounds with one arm, but the other one is fine. You have pain, and limitations with how long you can walk, stand, and lift, no doubt. But can you do sedentary work, like an office job where you can sit 6 to 8 hours a day, and do most reaching with your better arm? If so, then it's likely you'll be denied. 



The leg numbness and loss of bladder control concern me, as a human and medical nerd, a disability examiner will question whether that affects your ability to do sedentary work. Unfortunately, pain is only considered as secondary to physical findings such as motor loss, decreased sensation/strength/reflexes, inability to stand or walk at least an hour per day, use of assistive devices to walk, and whether you can handle/finger small objects at least occasionally, with your good hand. 


If you apply, list the depression and be clear about how it affects you, even if you haven't been treated for it.


To answer your questions- no, you don't need doctors to recommend disability. With the new rules about medical sources and opinions, we are basically forced to address and consider them, but we don't even need to rationalize them anymore. You can thank the disability advocates and lawyers who send blanket statement forms to providers to sign, which are meaningless, for the change in that rule. As far as conveying the affect on your life and livelihood, they'll send you a questionnaire about just that, and it's your job to explain exactly why you can't work full time consistently.

Not everyone gets denied the first time, but your odds aren't good if you are under 50, have a high school education at least, and can probably do sedentary work. Don't get a lawyer; as long as you can remember your medical sources, open your mail on time, read it, and do what's asked of you on time, and fill out some basic forms, you don't need one. They don't do ANYTHING, trust me. 95% of lawyers/advocates/representatives never even contact me or submit anything. I honestly don't know how they sleep at night.

From my experience and from reading a lot about disability, you'll need a specific diagnosis and history of trying all available medical options to establish your claim.  Also, lawyers will likely not take your case or advise you until you are no longer working or have had your claim denied.  When I was still working and trying to figure out the whole process, they listened to my history on the phone and told me I had a very strong case, but they could not advise me until I was no longer working and to call them as soon as I quit.

There is NEVER a situation where you are repeatedly telling multiple people around town intimate details of your client and not aware that you are doing the wrong thing. If you are genuinely unaware that you're doing the wrong thing, You aren't qualified to be a carer.

CDR's are given at a specific interval based on the disability on record.

If someone on SSDI pursues work, that's completely fine and has NOTHING to do with a CDR.

885,"I know this was posted three days ago and I’m a little late to the party, but chronic migraines are no joke, as much as others like to brush them off. I’m not in the same situation as you and I’m not a doctor, so this is more validation than advice, but still. I’ve been told a lot of it is “just my chronic migraines” but that doesn’t mean it isn’t serious or concerning. I’ve had spells lasting up to three hours where I’ve lost my vision, my hearing, and had violent muscle spasms through my whole body. On a normal day I am chronically dizzy and need a cane to keep myself stable. I’ve seen family docs, ER teams, neurologists, and a rheumatologist who have all said these can be explained by migraines if they’re bad and frequent enough, particularly with this neurological thing I have going on that’s very rare, most people who have it have epilepsy or cerebral palsy (I don’t) but it’s called heterotopia,  and it’s not super serious for me other than the fact that it gives me these horrendous migraines. 

Migraines have a lot of causes and triggers, and blood pressure is one of them. I totally get that hearing “just migraines” is invalidating and I’ve heard it for a long time with the lingering fear of “what if it’s something worse” but my neurologist said that migraines can happen in different parts of your brain at different times, which is why I get vision, balance, co-ordination, mood, and cognition issues. She said it could even potentially rule out my diagnosis I got as a teenager for bipolar disorder. 

My point is it’s hard to explain to other people, especially the people who just get them after a hangover or who can just take an Advil and a nap and be fine. Telling people “I have chronic migraines” and having them reply “me too, headaches are the wooorrst” completely sucks. Like no, Becky, you don’t get how this affects me.

Currently my cardios and my neuro are aware of this stuff and they're not particularly concerned right now.

That said, if you can see a cardio about this it might not be a bad idea?  They might not have much for you other than trying to drink a shit-ton of water and adding salt, but if it is a major issue, there are meds that can raise BP (which I'm on; it's been very helpful for me and machines no longer think that I'm dead).

888,"I hear you, it’s super frustrating. Personally, the thing I kept stressing to my doctors too was that my attacks weren’t like my typical migraines either, but I guess there’s this type of migraine that can be painless, that mostly affects vision and balance. It’s always important to make sure it isn’t caused by something else.

I was super skeptical to hear this but what actually helped the most was being put on a daily migraine preventative medication, and I noticed an almost immediate difference. There’s still some issues that pop up here and there, but it’s nothing like how it was a year ago. No vision/hearing loss, no spasms to the level that they were, no dropping on the floor, less dizziness, it was amazing. The short term ones didn’t help for long, if at all.

If you haven’t already talked to a neurologist or your doctor about taking a migraine preventative, I would ask them about it just to see if it helps. If it doesn’t (or if you’re already taking one and it’s not helping) then it tells them there’s something else going on that needs to be looked into.

It’s honestly such a hard system to navigate and it’s frustrating when you are speaking to someone about your daily life in a period of five minutes.

889,"Thanks so much for this reply!

So first off, believe me I know chronic migraines are horrendous. I've lived with it a long time and know quite a bit about them. I'm well aware they can cause vastly different situations! It's definitely one reason I came here for the question before my doctor anyhow!

But the main reason I was skeptical on that doctor's comment was the way this happens. I've never been able to link it to my migraines in any way. I will not even have a headache later that day if the attack happens, only -after- (and a headache, not as severe as a migraine. Just uncomfortable, none of that extra fun stuff!) I've had the attack and it goes away quickly once I lie down.

I've always known how my migraines affect me, I know how to react fairly quickly once I've felt one coming on, I even recognize the starting signs and know what to do for what type of migraine I'm gonna get. I've never had these attacks in relation to a migraine, and I don't get half of what I get during these attacks when I do get migraines... So to be told 'it's just the migraines' has been a little disconcerting to me..!

Either way, thank you very much for the response.

Now I'm older and, oddly, even though I'm much closer to an age where dentures are acceptable, I am SOOOO selfconscious about them. My bottoms broke years ago and I haven't been able to get them replaced and my uppers broke as well but at least I was able to salvage those, sort of. They hurt to wear and cause painful sores. 

Your mouth takes a good year for the swelling to go down, the bone to shrink, etc. They will be adjusting and re-adjusting your dentures for at least that long. I don't know how it works through Medicaid but part of the treatment plan is you don't get your permanent set until one year post op to account for the changes in structure that will take place during that time. 

I know it's hard but once you're through it, it's really not that bad. Unfortunately you're just going to have to try and find patience (I don't practice what I preach at all, btw) to wait it out.

925,"I don't have angioedema, But I have MCAS and stress is a trigger, so it's a similar sort of annoyance to explain to people ""I have symptoms like bad allergies, stress causes it, sometimes, but not other times, it depends, it can kill me when it does happen, if it happens""

Like there is a very real and very genuine risk when doing certain things that could cause stress, so you want to avoid stressful activities, But as you say, you can't avoid stress.

I had a hysterectomy and the surgery was fine, no stress reaction. But a few months ago I went into hospital and got my jaw manually realigned, and I pretty instantly started having a reaction to that stress.

It also just depends on how much sleep I've had, if I'm run down, how many other triggers i've exposed myself to... Monday I could eat Potatoes and be fine, could go to enjoy them again on Friday but suddenly need my epipen because my body has decided to react this one time in particular. So I just avoid potatoes all the time, But occasionally I do get accused of faking by people who haven't known me well, because ""I saw you eat potatoes by accident 3 months ago and you were fine, don't act like they could kill you"" Urgh, But they *could* I just don't know when.

It's the most frustrating thing to have a condition that is *sometimes* triggered by a thing, and the end result could be fatal throat swelling or fatal anaphylaxis. It's not a gamble you ever want to take, But sometimes life forces you to take the gamble.

In my case, The friction from my retainer that I wore in high-school was a trigger. But my Plate I had a few years earlier was never a problem, nor were the braces itself. My orthodontist warned me that in the future, dentures might not be an option, and this threw a spanner in the works because they always expected me to lose all my teeth by 40.

I've also had reactions to surgical clips. When they took my gallbladder they clipped me and I had recurrent reactions for months after surgery with no explanation. When they did the hysterectomy, they cauterised instead of clipped, and then they went up and took out the bile duct clips while they were in there. Haven't had issues like that since.... But I had clips from a previous vascular surgery that were never a problem.

So I'm very worried for both dentures and implants, I wont know until I get them if they'll work for me. It's the same with everything that's a new experience, I wont know if it will kill me until it's actively killing me, sometimes you can't avoid it, you just have to find out the hard way.

Same with withdrawing.

978,"So, I know how condescending it might be to tell someone with an anxiety disorder to relax....but don't overthink the CDR too much. Everybody has to go through them, its the law. And contrary to some myths out there, SSA isn't looking for evidence to stop your benefits. 

To address some of your questions

* Even though you seem to be between therapists/psychiatrists, it obviously will show that you are *attempting* to get treatment. That is what is going to be important. Plus, you are getting care from your physician in the form of medication (SSA isn't going to care how much/what it is). 

* Re: #4. There are federal law enforcement units (CDI units) that are a joint OIG/SSA venture that look for fraud. Here is the thing though - they have to either receive a complaint from the general public OR there has to be a huge inconsistency in your CDR file that would highly suggest fraud. Like, you say you can't leave the house yet you have earnings on your SSN. 

* Re: #5. There is no such thing as an unnecessary detail. You want them to have as much information as possible. 

* While I think you need to work towards finding a new therapist you're comfortable with, you don't need to do that just for the CDR. Honestly, it will slow down the CDR process. Because they will have to then wait for you to have several appointments to get those notes. 

The best thing you can do right now is be patient with the process. They will probably send you more forms to fill out (similar to forms you completed when you first applied). They are also going to send requests for records to your doctors. Something you can do to help is 1) make sure you turn all your paperwork in on time and 2) make sure your doctor does the same. We can't force doctors to submit their records, and if we don't have them within 30 days we are forced to make a decision without them. 

Depending on how backed up your state DDS is right now, it could be a while before you hear from a worker. CDR cases get lower processing priorities than new applications. The theory being that you guys are already in pay status, and its more important to get decisions to people who are waiting. 

The percentage of people who are kicked off disability due to medical improvement (if they follow all levels of approval) is in the single digits. Here is the most important thing to know about a CDR: **If they do cease your benefits, you need to appeal immediately and opt for benefit continuation.** This will allow you to keep getting your check during the appeal process. They will tell you that you have to pay it back...but it is easy to get that discharged based on hardship, or they will let you pay it back at ridiculously low monthly amounts (like $10). 

If you have questions along the way in the process. Feel free to PM me.

First of all, the article itself is misleading. It is clearly biased and buries important details way down in the article to try to obfuscate the topic. The article wants the reader to view it as a lawsuit over petty, minor details. Like (it implies) 2.1% vs 2% grade. But there were actually many more concrete things wrong it turns out (buried  farther down in the article of course) *like* lack of van accessible spots (!) and fake curb cuts. And this was all across multiple campuses of a *major medical center*, not some small mom and pop outfit. It's also notable that this case wasn't a settlement. The medical center paid very poorly spent money to fight it in the courts and *lost*. They lost because...they were in violation of ADA.

Second of all, I think it's dangerous for the disabled community to jump straight to negative narratives about possible disability activists.

And I can't help but notice that that narrative is exactly what corporate interests would *love* us to buy about anybody who tries to make a difference using the law. It sure looks like from her background, this woman considers herself an activist. And why, exactly, is bringing ADA suits a *bad* form of activism? ADA has statutory damage caps for the litigants. As a result, while excessive lawsuits can be a profitable strategy for attorneys, it's much harder for it to be actually profitable for disabled litigants. Hence, spates of unscrupulous lawsuits are usually headed by law firms, who then gather up some disabled people to use as litigants.

986,"I appreciate the well thought out and considerate reply. Mine didn't start that way, but I certainly appreciate your tone of respect; it's something I try to keep, and I failed in this regard. Thanks for the reminder.

You're definitely correct on the article being biased. I think they were trying for some level of objectivity... or at least, if they were, they failed. It reads more like an editorial than an informational... but there's good information in it, however the fact that I didn't know much of the information you just gave me is further evidence that the article was (intentionally or because of bias) heavily skewed.

As for this particular case, I agree that the case was good. Hospitals, particularly across multiple campuses, need to be in compliance - but again, when the plaintiff has been plaintiff in 20 cases in 8 years, it's pretty clear that she's actively targeting places, whether they deserve it or not; in some cases, they're going to be justified, in some cases, they're not - even when the *letter of the law* may agree with her.

And that was my point of contention; not that the case wasn't legally justified, or that the hospital shouldn't have made changes.... just that even if they should have, or if it was - that doesn't mean they weren't targeted by her... *that both things can be true at the same time.*... that... just because one party is wrong, doesn't mean the other is right.

I think that's the most concise summary of my thought process. one party being wrong doesn't make the other right. Both sides can be wrong at the same time.

&gt;And I can't help but notice that that narrative is exactly what corporate interests would love us to buy about anybody who tries to make a difference using the law. It sure looks like from her background, this woman considers herself an activist. And why, exactly, is bringing ADA suits a bad form of activism?

I'll answer your question in a moment, but I'd like to challenge it with another: why are the corporate interests automatically assumed to be malicious, malevolent, or contrary to the public interest? I'd suggest history shows the opposite; and while that's an historical and philosophical academic conversation, it might be one which would be worth having... and it a stance upon which, I suspect, I'd be in the minority in this sub... 

But to answer your question: the law is only half of the battle... and I'd say it's the smaller half. The other half, the bigger, or at least more important (in my opinion) is that of public opinion (as it is public opinion which forms and shapes law). Public opinion can take longer, it's true, to change, but it is the more sure and better way.

No one likes to have their hand *forced* to anything. And frivolous lawsuits are not viewed positively by any faction of society, for any faction of society. It does not help, therefore, our cause to have someone campaigning on our supposed behalf to go about *forcing other people to do what we want them to do, by force of law,* by repeated (often frivolous) lawsuits. 

I'll present an example: Jesse Jackson's activism has become effective.... *if* the goal is to get his way. If he shows up with his team of lawyers, most of the time, his opposition will fold and give in to whatever his demands are (whether or not they're in the wrong), because it's not worth the battle.... *but* - has he endeared himself to anyone? Has public opinion been swayed by his activism? I'd suggest the answer is no... which is why, in part, he was not a part of President Obama's campaigns for presidency (they also had some differences early on.... namely, that Jackson said that Obama ""talked down"" to black people and ""talked white""...) - I'm not trying to make the topic about race, or even about politics - I'm just trying to point out that there is a fine line to be walked - and throwing our hats in behind people who, like Jackson, have made habits of frivolous lawsuits (even if sometimes they've gotten the lawsuits right), doesn't help our cause in the court of public opinion.

1006,"My parents do have money saved up somewhere that I do not have access to until they die so they are not a financial burden. As mean as that sounds it’s the truth—especially nowadays when most 17 year olds don’t have a job—and I have two. My parents are great parents and my sisters would most likely not be the way they are today if it weren’t for them. Unlike most parents who have disabled children, they were never coddled and they used precise judgement on every decision made. They were treated as if they were normal children (obviously with judgement involved).

However that money will run out. I think a lot of the people commenting; they can call me a bad person all they want, but I know in the back of my head that they probably don’t know first hand what it’s like. They can first hand know what it’s like with one, but two makes all the difference, and I honestly feel truly sorry and empathetic for those who have more than two. You can call me mean but it is true—as exhausting it can be for people who are autistic to have their independence taken away, I will have mine taken away too when in all reality, I have no obligation to them and I could tell them to fuck off and take care of themselves—but I won’t.

At the end of the day, even though they are autistic, to some degree, they are still responsible for their own actions. People need to stop coddling them. If they are so deserving of independence just like everyone else then they also have to take responsibility for them selves. They will never be independent. Group home or not, they will never ever be independent and people need to stop telling me that. 

They don’t get to be independent while I am slaving to them, because that is what it is. If I have to give up my time and independence to take care of them then they should do the same. People often forget what the term “independent” means and they are far from it. High functioning or not.

Of course they can call me a shitty person for having them institutionalized—they will probably never know what it’s like to have to make that decision OR care for them up until that point.

1007,"Above everything, you are currently a minor so none of this thinking about the future should be on you and you certainly shouldn't have such a large role in caring for your sisters. Eventually you won't be a minor but you still won't be a parent to them either. The responsibility here lies fully with your parents.

I sense a lot of frustration and, frankly, some resentment towards your life and most of that seems to manifest in the way you talk about your sisters and in the way that you talk about disability in general. It's evident from the way you write and some of the things you've said that there is a lot of anger as well as a skewed perception of where that anger belongs. It's totally understandable to be feeling those things in this situation and then to feel guilty, those are the classic signs of a parentified child. I'm sorry to be blunt but your parents have fucked up on this one. They've neglected to fulfill their full parental responsibilities towards you and have given you responsibilities beyond what should be expected of a child. Parentification can have serious consequences on the way a person interacts in their future relationships as an adult. You're worried about how having two disabled sisters is going to affect your life down the road - I would argue that the real issue here at the root of everything is how your parents actions are going to affect your life down the road. 

I'm not saying any of this to be hurtful or patronizing or because I'm trying to invalidate your feelings. I'm saying it because even though you might not be able to see it now I hope you'll be able to see it later on in life so that you can get past the issues it can cause. For the sake of your own future emotional health (which can affect many aspects of your adult life), I would strongly urge you to start trying to reframe the way you view your life and direct the blame exactly where it should go - which is to your parents. That doesn't mean getting into a fight with them and destroying your relationship or hating them or anything like that. It simply means acknowledging that you shouldn't be in this position, that what has been asked of you is not OK, that the fact that you are even worrying about whether you should put them in a care home is an indication that something has gone wrong and that your parents (like most parents) are good but flawed human beings who unfortunately didn't handle this situation in the way it should have been handled from the start. It also means learning that you have boundaries and that your parents need to take on the full responsibility of your sisters care and the plans for their future.
 
You should not be caring for your sisters beyond providing casual help. Let me explain what I mean. I'm a severely physically disabled person. My brother is not responsible for me and never was. When I was a kid, I might ask him to get something from a top shelf I couldn't reach or pick something up that I dropped. Little things, casual help now and then that didn't impinge on his life. Not care. There's a huge difference. It should be up to your parents to figure out how to make their care work in their current lives without that impacting you. Yes, it's good to help others, but there always has to be choice in helping others and help should only be given when we are emotionally capable of helping and when it doesn't cause us harm.

You do not need to be worrying about care homes and whatnot. What you do need to be doing is having a very frank discussion with your parents about the fact that they need to make these decisions and they need to make them soon. They may be good and well now, but you don't want to be dealing with sorting all this out if something happens to them tomorrow. No 17 year old is ready for that and I would argue that neither is anyone in their 20s. Based on what I've read throughout this thread, it doesn't seem to me like you're currently in a place where you can make good decisions on this - it's too personal and emotionally raw and it will probably be that way for a long time. Besides that, at the end of the day it's their responsibility as parents, not yours. They need to explore all the potential options, decide what they think is best, and start taking serious and concrete steps in preparing your sisters for the chosen pathway for their care so that everybody knows what is happening and when it's happening. You need to be clear with them that you need this taken care of. You do not need to have any more involvement with the process than that.",,,,TinyLittleStormCloud,,,1522312208,t5_2qhe8,t3_87x7p3,t3_87x7p3,3,1525708315,0,0,dwgqtoo,disability,,,,,

I can’t. I don’t trust anybody to do that because they don’t know them like we do and I’m willing to bet some sort of crisis such as abuse or neglect will happen. It would be very difficult for my parents to give them up to assisted care because we do not know who to trust.

As mean as it sounds, they are extremely vulnerable and can easily be taken advantage of if fallen into the right hands. For example, our “assisted care” nurse can have 500 dollars I gave her to buy food and supplies needed for them but she takes 200 for herself. Unless I am constantly monitoring it then I will never know. I could be wrong of how this assisted living works because I have not researched it—this is entirely based on assumption.

Both of these people are *older* than you. They are more of adults than you are. Just bcause your sisters may not have the life skills that you have, may not process information as fast, may need assistance in things like driving or work, etc... does not make them children.

You don't know what being ""high functioning"" and ""low functioning"" means. It is not something that offends us because it tells us some 'brutal truth'.

You didn't choose this situation, you were born into it, and while it would be a very good thing to take care of your older sisters, it should not be your obligation. You're also very young, and you have a long, long life ahead, and it sounds like both of your parents are still alive and well, so I think it would be a good idea for you to try to let some of the tension over this issue go. You don't know what will happen in the future! You have a pretty good idea of it, and I'm not saying it's wrong to have some kind of plan, but you shouldn't allow it to control your entire life when a lot can happen between now and some future ""then.""

That said, one thing you can consider is some kind of middle ground/intermediary. For example, rather than put my very disabled mother in a home environment, we've hired full-time care for her at home. That's difficult for us in many ways, but not unbearable, and it's better for her for now. There may be resources you or your parents can set up, or research you can do for the future, that would be better for your sisters than a group home.

However, a lot of group homes are not like that. It is probably the last choice on my list if all else fails and I would keep moving them around until I found a place that made them happy.

And they’re honest. If they were unhappy at a group home they would be extremely vocal about it because we taught them that way. If they want something, they must speak. 

They are blessed having the ability to speak and form understandable words, and if they couldn’t speak then this situation would be entirely different and I would never ever have closure of knowing if they are happy or not because they couldn’t speak.

 But they can which is amazing in more ways than one because by several doctors we were told they would probably never speak or have emotion.

You can be “sympathetic” of the situation all you want. Sympathy does not give them a home. I probably have all the people and their mother feeling sorry for me and them. Do I care? Not one bit because that doesn’t help anybody.

Also, me taking care of them does not justify me being miserable and a slave to them because that’s what it is.

If you don't like the place or if you see red flags, you can ask about alternative placement.

There's a good chance your sisters will be sent to the same place, which means they'll be together.  That always helps.  You can bring them home for holidays and birthdays, or just visit them.  Sounds like it's a good option for all of you.  You shouldn't have to give up your life.

I’d rather them have the ability to talk to people so they can get what they want than for them to be able to wipe their own ass because the only people seeing them wipe their ass is the person doing it and themselves. We would never take them out in public if they were screamers, violent, or mean to people. They are good natured.

And you’re right, as someone who is 17 I’m probably not even entirely developed yet. From experience, I am most definitely not the same person I was six months ago.

1063,"Warning: Novella ahead lol. 

I'm on disability/medicaid, so I mostly have to take the therapist I'm given, but after trying a couple over the past few years the third time proved to be the charm and I finally got a good one last fall. For me that means being able to talk about whatever is triggering/ has triggered me and figuring out why (sometimes it's obvious, sometimes not), then finding and implementing a way to manage that particular situation when it comes up. Sometimes just figuring out why something is happening in my brain makes all the difference. My abuse was physical, sexual, and emotional, and taught me to gravitate towards those relationships as an adult, so until I met my husband a couple years ago at 34, that was my life. Couple that with the medical trauma and I've got a lot of triggers. 

I'm still new to having a good therapist, but once we figure out one solution it tends to be applicable in many situations. Use anything that will pull you out of your limbic system's fight or flight impulse and back into your frontal lobe. Deep breathing, in through the nose slow, out through the mouth, even slower. Distraction is a good one. Books, art/doodling, random trash reading or short articles if I'm too upset to focus on actual reading, playing with my cats, exercise, whatever floats your boat. Grounding has proven to be an amazing tool for me. Honestly, I always thought it was crap, but it turns out I just needed a good coach. I dissociate a lot, and it helps not only with that but with panic/anxiety and fear. Example: It even helps when my husband accidentally sneaks up on me and scares me. I ground myself to his face and the surroundings and the reality that it isn't someone that will hurt me sneaking up on me. I level out much faster without getting angry or as scared. 

I haven't mastered any of it yet but the idea is once I get coping tools, I can practice them when I'm not triggered so that'll be easier to use when my ""lizard brain"" tries to take over. Practicing when your limbic system isn't going nuts is key to being able to implement coping strategies when it does. Eventually, I want to try EMDR, but with as much stuff that can be dug up with that, my therapist and I both agree I need a more well-equipped mental tool box before I do that. 

I have severe asleep disturbances too, of course. Screaming, swearing, thrashing, I'll hurt myself throwing myself around in my sleep  (bruises and scratches) and with my hypermobility I'll wake up with things dislocated at least every week, usually more. I've ground my teeth to nubs and wear a hard plastic night guard that I chew through regularly. Once I destroyed my laptop throwing at the wall in my sleep. I've punched a few people in the face over the years. C U Next Tuesday seems to be my favorite sleep swear, usually accompanied by, ""Shut the f***up you stupid..."" The nightmares sometimes destroy me for hours after waking, if not a whole day or a few *but now the meds typically make it much easier to shake off, and I can sleep through instead of waking up screaming. The day destroying ones are less common now. 

I also got a good psychiatrist a couple years ago that works closely with my therapist. I have depression, so I'm on Lexapro, 1mg Klonopin 2x day with an 3rd afternoon dose as needed for sleep I take Prazosin 5mg, melatonin 3mg, and I have a cup of chamomile tea and montmorency cherry juice every night. Exercise helps burn off some of the energy that would otherwise translate into anxiety. I hope any of this helps (our at least makes sense).

SSI, however, has no work requirement because it is a ""needs based"" program with asset limits. It is for people who haven't worked enough to qualify for SSDI.

I have thought about part time work, but I’m focusing on getting my shit together right now- I lived in the same area for 40+ years and hadn’t realized how much I depended on not having to process new routes, places etc- I’m hoping by next year I will have organized my life to the point where I could try something new. Also, keeping up with the 5 year old is still enough “job” to keep me busy, haha.

1107,"I completely understand.  I had low blood pressure/blood oxygen levels due to an intestinal  ulcer complicated by blood thinners, which damaged my optic nerves and did a number on my brain as well.  They actually thought I had MS due to white matter deterioration.  I’ve got a cognitive deficit, especially when multitasking.  It’s been better without the stress of my previous job, which was on-call 24/7/365.

1108,"Congratulations! I was approved last July after applying in April.  However, it wasn’t quite as smooth as your experience because my case was denied then reopened after they didn’t consider all my records.  I’m 39 (be 40 in July) and also have my MA.  It sounds like you have some major health issues, but have you considered going back to work part time?  I’m legally blind but also have some other health issues, but after working for 22 years, I’m getting kind of bored.

If you have any federal student loans, you can have them discharged due to disability.
