0,"I've found the issue tends to be more about specific airports than airlines. I've had great luck with Delta but most of all at my former home airport. Delta basically owns the fancy terminal (some international flights and chains use it also but mostly Delta) while everyone else flies into the second one. I get amazing service there. Like had a valet parking nightmare and was massively late for a red eye flight. Have loads of medical liquids and TSA was amazing. Used an airline wheelchair and assistant person and he RAN with me and my heavy luggage down the entire terminal to get to my flight. They accidentally closed the door while he was still on the plane loading my bags but damn was that amazing service. Never had a problem there in general. 

Had nasty service in Philly as far as baggage size and refusing to get me help right away (made me lift and finagle my own heavy bag into the size check thing and I was clearly struggling bad. I have extremely poor upper body strength. Had asked for a wheelchair assist and they forced me to do all this on my own first). Had some issues with meds leaking and being depressed from baggage while going through TSA there. 

Had some other wheelchair assist issues in Nebraska. 

And now I'm in Chicago and I've heard horror stories about O'Hare. 

So I have really noticed a lot of the issues are more with the specific airport. That said, Delta staff has always been wonderful across the board. The flight attendants have even gone and gotten a wheelchair to help me out when we were waiting took long for one of the airport people to arrive. They always help with my luggage and sad I mentioned, I have a lot of medical supplies and am connected to IVs so I bring a ton of stuff on the plane because medical supplies shouldn't count against your limit on any airline. I've never so much as been questioned or had a single problem. Once had a flight attendant see me waiting after deboarding and make mention she was surprised I got on with all that but the moment I said it was medical she apologized. Funny that no one has ever even asked when I'm boarding! 

Also ran into a flight delay where they weren't sure if our plane would go out or not. Moment I explained to Delta staff that I have serious medical needs and absolute needed to be on the next flight out (because I'd be out of my IV supplies if not) they actually got me tickets for two flights, said take whichever comes first and gave me priority over others. It was such a relief in a bad situation. 

So eh, as you can see airports and flying isn't fun by any means and I've learned to expect some minor issues. Overall Delta has been incredibly accommodating. Any major issues I've experienced have been specific to the airports themselves though, not any specific company. And some of my issues are out of the norm even from a disability perspective (having a mandatory patdown due to the IV stuff and how they check through my IV bag and supplies in my luggage varies SO MUCH from airport to airport and even at the same airport. Like TSA never knows wtf they're doing with me! That's advice I regularly share with people with IV or feeding tube and medical liquids or medical devices that mean X-ray can't happen. Never had a bad TSA experience. Just noticed they're super inconsistent and they often have to go grab a manager with me to ask how to do stuff).

Maybe I'm extra forgiving. I don't know. I've heard horror stories from a lot of disabled people. On Delta, on virtually every major carrier. Even then a lot of them seem more airport specific though. And I feel like the more I've flown the more I've kind of learned the ropes and little tips that help my experience.

1,"I agree that r/legal advice is your best option. Unfortunately if a training or certification is a standing job requirement and you are unable for whatever reason to obtain it, they do not have to change the requirements/position for you. If you say needed a piece of equipment to perform the task and they denied you it it may be a violation.

In this situation it may be especially true. I’m assuming from the fact you have to get this training that dealing with  an unexpectedly unruly person may be part of the job. From the business standpoint it’s an issue of both client and employee safety if a situation occurs you may not be trained to handle, 
If this is truly not a possibility for what you’ll be doing, or it’s a passive restraint where there no violent threat, then you could approach HR about a waiver or something? (Not sure if that’s actually a thing...)
This is only based on personal experience and my understanding of how the law works as I’ve dealt with accommodations going to school. I know another disabled person who was unable to attend my program because they didn’t have the ability to perform and become certified in CPR. 

So I’m super sorry they miscommunicated things but I’m not sure you have a case ��

You can apply for [PIP](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support/personal-independence-payment/), you may have a chance of being eligible. I do think that to give your application the best chance of being successful you will need to have a GP document that a) you have some sort of mental health disability and b) that it affects your ability to carry out daily living tasks.

I understand that not all doctors are helpful. What I would suggest is that you make an evening appointment with a doctor (when they are not running their morning clinics, because they tend to be more able to listen when they are less stressed). Go in and start explaining your story, factually from the beginning:

- I'm here because I'm very concerned about my mental and physical health.

- I left my job to be a caregiver for my parents until they recently died.

- My relationship with my parents was enormously difficult, I suffered physical and emotional abuse throughout my childhood and whilst caring for them.

- Having to care for them and their recent deaths has brought up some difficult emotional issues that I'm finding difficult to handle. I am having difficulty functioning in my daily life.

- I am unable to cope in stressful situations and don't feel I am able to maintain normal living activities. I have severe anxiety and depression.

- I also have been having physical symptoms such as ""pain/insomnia + other examples"" and I'm really worried about that. 

- I feel incapable of holding a job right now and I'm here in hopes that you can help me with an application for PIP, so I can at least have some more financial security given my current condition.

- I'm hoping we can talk about what I'm having difficulty with and you can write me a supporting letter. 

You might want to add some more detail but not too much because your main message will get lost. What you are trying to convey to the doctor is that a history of abuse has led to some sort of breakdown and that you need financial support. You may also want to mention that you're open to talking about counselling or medications (if those are things you're not doing already, it can help to show that you're trying your best but are still unable to function).

Another tactic for dealing with doctors is to write everything down and give it to them and say that you've written it down because it's easier to articulate in writing (that way they will take a few minutes to read it and they won't be able to interrupt you). You can also do both, write it all down *and* explain it to them in person.

There is also Employment Support Allowance but I think that's part of universal credit and I don't know much about that one I'm afraid.


Best of luck.

Edit: Had second thought about this - don't say that caring for your parents has brought up emotional issues because it makes it sound temporary.

1) You need to find a local attorney that does employment law, specifically disability.  They will help you stay in your job.  Many/ most lawyers in this area offer free consultations, don't pay out of pocket for anything other than ""costs"" which are things like filing fees and depositions, but don't pay for the lawyers time (this is to be paid by the company or as a portion of what they win for you).  


2) Contact a lawyer that works in benefits administration.  They will help get you social security disability, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, food stamps etc.  If you're low income, this can usually be done for free at a local non-profit law clinic.  


3) If you don't have a doctor that you feel is on your side, fucking fire them and find a new one while you still have insurance.  This is where your money should be spent.


4) Don't just call one lawyer for each of the above, call three (at least).  Each lawyer has different strengths, weaknesses, and style, find the one that's right for you.  You wouldn't buy a new car without at least taking a look at a few models, why wouldn't you apply the same diligence to finding a lawyer? 



5) If you have questions, keep posting!

Stop the ADA education and reform act. Congress is going to vote soon on the ADA education reform act (H.R.620)

The proposed legislation allows businesses to ignore ADA requirements until a notification is sent by disabled person, undermining the spirit of the ADA.

The proposed legislation denies a person with a disability the right of due process to the courts by allowing businesses to Indefinitely delay enforcement of the law.

The proposed legislation shift the burden of compliance from businesses to the disabled, many of whom did not have the resources to file to issue a proper notification.

The ADA network already provides 80 a training and education; setting up an additional education program at the department of justice is unnecessary and wasteful.

What they will look at is whether or not you can do a job - not necessarily a good job, or a job in your preferred field, or a well-paying job, but a job.

They *will* consider your emotional or psychological capacity for work. You might want to think about whether there realistically exists a job that has low enough stress for you to function. If you can't handle people yelling, for example, they will say that you could work in a quiet, isolated job. On the other hand, if you can't handle any level of direction or feedback, or you have agoraphobia and can't leave the home, then you may not be able to work any job and you would qualify.

116,"Your elected officials cannot do much regarding speeding things up; for one, SS is a federal agency pretty much independent of any other form of government. They have a process in place for a reason though it seems redundant to me. 

You have a lawyer, which is very good. He will have sent in everything pertinent to her case. They're gathering her medical records. If they haven't, they will have her visit a doctor of their choosing to examine her. 

It typically takes between 8-10 months altogether. Although she meets requirements it doesn't mean she is going to be approved; around half of all initial applications are denied straight across the board. If she is denied, your lawyer will file an appeal which typically requires another 3-6 months until a hearing is held in front of a judge/magistrate. I know these are the last things you want to hear but it's good to be prepared. 

And then you will hear nothing from them until they send the letter saying yes or no. Her first back-pay check will arrive soon after if she is approved. They broke mine into three payments but YMMV, my friend received two. She will be paid for every month dating to the day she applied. I had to depend on goodwill from friends and family while I awaited my approval but was able to repay them with the back-pay.

In the meantime, apply for state assistance. Get a food card if you don't have one. Apply in her name, she should be eligible for it as she has applied for SSDI. 

Hang tough. And get her online Social Security account set up. It may be able to provide you with some info, though likely not much.

**A Server's Perspective:**

A typical server, in a busy establishment, is expected to work long, hard hours on their feet. The position rarely comes with formal training (unless provided by a corporate chain); and such training does not typically cover how to address disabilities. Management is more often bad than good, and staff often feels as though they are left to fend for themselves. Those who get into food service are usually those who need to make cash and/or are not equipped to work a 9-5 job; due to lack of skill, experience, school, or other life circumstances. Often they are single parents or college students who are desperately trying to get by. It's a thankless, hard job that leaves you with a tempting wad of cash at the end of the shift; which is a detriment and creates a vicious cycle trap. The turnover is great, and restaurants are often forced to put up with less-than-friendly staff; just to have warm bodies on the floor.

At any given time, a server will be juggling a number of tasks. For example:

* A table of five was just ""sat"", and are waiting to be greeted. They expect this to take no longer than two minutes.

* This birthday party is in your section (out of rotation), because it's the only one that fit their specific requirements. Now, you're ""in the weeds"", because you weren't supposed to be next in line. The host could have mitigated this, but he's more interested in his phone.

* Another table has ordered their drinks, which have just come up at the bar. The ice is melting, and your guests are looking over at them.

* You have a check, in your apron, waiting to be closed out. Those guests are staring at you, wondering how long before you leave this table, and run their credit card. They expect this to take no longer than two minutes.

* The appetizers, for the guests whose order you are trying to take, are sitting under the heat lamp and the food runner is busy mopping up the class of Sprite that the little kid, at your other table, knocked over. That table is waiting for you to bring another Sprite. The food runner *miiiight* do it for you; but who knows...

* The manager is AWOL. Probably flirting with the hostess or bartender, somewhere in the back of house.

* As you took the order, of the first person at this table, you listed every salad dressing and side dish (which are right on the menu). Going around, you've had to repeat them, three more times, because no one was paying attention. 

* There's a dirty table, in your section, with a tip on it. The busser *miiight* get to it. They *miiight* also nick your tip; so you'd rather get to it, yourself. Not to mention, that the hostess is AWOL, and a group of people are thinking that they'll seat themselves at your dirty table.

* You have two orders to go into the Point of Sale, but there is a line, and you can't seem to get away from your current table, to take your place. That food is going to take a lot longer; and those guests are going to be complaining in about 20 minutes.

This is just a sampling of the extreme amount of stress that goes along with waiting tables. It has been said that it ranks up there with that of air traffic controllers. Except that your pay is directly related to how happy your guests are; and they are doing math to deduct for every mistake or sleight (real or imagined).

With this in mind, put yourself in your server's position. She may not have any experience dealing with the hearing impaired. How loudly should she speak? Will you be able to read her lips? What if she speaks too loudly, like when she did and got yelled at by that one lady? What if she can't understand your answers and feels terrible for having to keep asking you to repeat yourself? 

Her time is measured in seconds, and that clock is spinning in her mind. Every second that she loses in failed communication is costing her money from all of her other guests. At some point, she has to find a solution, on the fly. Does she sacrifice the tips, from her five other tables, or does she roll the dice on how much you will dock your one tip? I can tell you that it's a shitty position to be in.

Hearing impairment is only one of the many disabilities that your server may encounter in any given day. With this in mind; I'd like to make some suggestions to help you have a more enjoyable experience, in the future. Please understand that I'm not assuming that you didn't do some of these things:

* Scout the venue, in advance (preferably during the same day of week and time as your upcoming visit). Locate the ideal table/s, and ask the host/hostess for those table numbers. Also, find out if they take reservations, and get a copy of the menu. Inquire as to when they are typically most busy; as you are best served to avoid the rush.

* A day or two before your visit (sooner, if you have a very large party), call and speak to the floor manager. Request a reservation at your chosen table, and explain your specific circumstances. Make sure to get their name. Also, ask any questions about the menu, etc. This will give you an opportunity to learn about any events, which would impact your visit, as well as learn about things like they usually run out of prime rib before 7:00pm. Although it may not be as much fun for your friends.

* Call a couple of hours before your visit to confirm your reservation and table number.

* Come up with a contingency plan, if communications do go down. Make sure to be seated next to someone who can help you communicate with your server. Try not to avoid being offended if this becomes the case. It's a simple fact that goes along with hearing impairment in noisy places; and it's not always possible to perfectly accommodate everyone. I always have to assist my nearly-deaf parent in restaurants.

* Take a quick moment to describe your disability to your server and help them with tips on how to best communicate with you. ""Thumbs-up"" and ""Raised index finger"" can be very helpful. You can also carry a notepad and write your requests. Have your intermediary be prepared to jump in, if communication does prove to be too difficult.

I hope that I have not offended you; and that some of this may prove helpful. With understanding and prevention, I hope that this never happens to you, again!",,,,whatsreallygoingon,,,1518293397,t5_2qhe8,t3_7wn5gm,t3_7wn5gm,11,1519121209,0,0,du1rkai,disability,,,,"I'm so sorry that you experienced this.

Disability Secrets is a good site that lays out a lot of how things work in plain english. The government websites are a bit difficult to follow.

&gt;To encourage SSDI recipients with disabilities to try to return to work, the SSA provides for a trial work period. During the trial work period (TWP), a person receiving SSDI can have unlimited earnings and still receive full benefits without risking termination of benefits.

&gt;The trial work period provides nine months (that do not need to be consecutive) out of a rolling 60-month period where SSDI recipients can try out working before their disability is deemed to have ended. What counts as one of the nine trial work months? In 2018, any month in which an SSDI recipient earns more than $850 is considered a trial work month. (Notice that this amount is different (lower) than the SGA amount.)

143,"IMHO, the best way to curb these feelings is to find something, anything that you can do. I can't do much of anything, but I can play a game online or bake something for my family. I can't sit up for long, so I got a desk that goes over me on my bed, and tilts so I can see my laptop screen. It's my favorite thing I own, and amazon sells tons of them, along with tablet and phone holders that adjust many different ways. Even though I can't eat or drink, I started baking again because it's something. I love it. It gives me something to think about other than medical stuff. I also play Sims and Chef Wars because they're a good distraction, and I can live vicariously through them.

When I first got really sick, I didn't expect to lose the ability to walk or eat or drink, but I did. It's a lot more freeing when you learn to accept it instead of fight it. The abilities I lost, I lost them within the past 2 years, but was sick before then. I fought it at first, went to college but couldn't keep up at all, constantly having to go home or wouldn't even be able to go to class, because I wanted to be normal. I saw other ill and/or disabled students, and they were always frustrated w the lack of elevators and rudeness from peers. We all had the same look on our faces. 

I was always creative. In high school, I painted and did photography, but I lost those abilities due to pain. So I switched to makeup, which I can't do much anymore because of pain. And now baking, which is easier because I can split it up over several days. So find your thing. It'll probably take a long time and there will be setbacks, but find something that makes you feel productive.
From what I'm writing, you'd probably get the impression that I don't lay in bed all day. I do, though. When I bake, I have to make sure I've been lying down all day so that my neck can withstand an hour or two of sitting up. I'm including this because we're never really seeing the whole picture, so it's easy to assume others aren't struggling like you are. And although it may seem weird, I get to enjoy my baking because I can chew and spit it out, so you get creative with how to deal with your disabilities and then you keep going.

Here goes...

I was injured in 2014 on a construction job when I fell through a hidden (open) hatch on a large piece of equipment which I was reassured was safe to walk on. 

I suffered 2 disc herniations, musculoskeletal damage (like sprained back muscles i guess). As well as tore my meniscus and one of those pcl or acl I cant remember. 

Obviously L&amp;I took over medical costs. I have been through many rounds of spinal shots (as well as knee shots which helped my knee) physical therapy for both knee and back. 

The therapy and shots helped tremendously for my knee, however and unfortunately not for my back. 

I was working this whole time until my Dr. and Surgeon then recommended surgery and so on November 27th I had spinal surgery and went on L&amp;I disability.

For the first 4 weeks life was hell as the pain was tremendous post surgery, even with alot of oxycodone. 

5 weeks post surgery the stitches were removed. Still in alot of pain.

7 weeks post surgery I saw my Dr. and explained the problems I was having with pain and how my ability to move/work around the house/general daily life tasks and projects, was being limited due to pain in back. He said it wad nerve pain and ordered an MRI (yet to happen, L&amp;I takes forever to approve anything). He also put me into pain management therapy with another Dr.

Pain management Dr. prescribed me Gabapentin (pain nerve transmittor inhibitor), Cyclobenzaprin (muscle relaxant), and Hydrocodone (pain killer). 

The medication regimen this new Dr. has me on seems to help me alot more to be active which helps my mental and spiritual state. However, it is the minimum help and I have constant pain with any bending, reaching, kneeling; basically anything (I never realized how vital and joined with all your bodies motion the lower back was until this).


So that's where I'm at. L&amp;I is being good and paying me 60% of my wages while I continue medical treatment. I am VERY concerned however about my future. With the pain I'm in I cannot see myself working full time construction like I have been doing for 10 years. 

I asked L&amp;I about retraining or college or something to keep my mind active but they said they have to wait until the results come back from my next MRI.

166,"Yeah, I hear ya. It's super painful. Give it some time though, once you've healed more you may be happy with the result. That 3 months right after surgery was absolutely brutal, but the result was definitely worth it for me. Sometimes this type of surgery is more or less successful, but you won't really know until you get over that initial recovery hump. If I had to make the choice all over again, I'd still do it. Was definitely worth it. I'm very glad I got the pain reduction, but even if I hadn't, I'd still have been glad if it just stopped getting worse.

Good luck to you, I hope you get plenty of pain reduction too.",,,,FlailStorm,,,1518561933,t5_2qhe8,t3_7wy44f,t1_du76cap,2,1519217944,0,0,du7dud0,disability,,,,,
167,"Society has a stereotype of a 'super cr*pple'. This is the image you have often seen in the news - from Stephen Hawking to disabled athletes who have climbed Mount Everest, or the trope of the autistic 'savant', it is a very popular image.

It's also a thin and hurtful one. When you see or hear about other disabled people 'doing better' than you, understand that this feeling is one from a society that demands we outperform our able peers in order to be considered worthy of anything. When you see other disabled people doing 'more' than you, realize that there are many aspects of their lives that you do not see - they may have other things they can't do that are hidden to the public.

When we demand excellence from disabled people, society either only sees what we can not do, or only what extraordinary things we can do. If a disabled person is labelled as 'exceptional', their needs are often ignored or undermined. If a disabled person is not seen as exceptional, their talents, skills, and personhood are often ignored as well.

As it seems you are possibly in the second group, please understand that *your* talents, skills, and personhood have not lost importance since you have become disabled. Moreover, although you may not be able to do some things that able-bodied people can do, you are worth very much. mr_strawsma made a lot of points I agree with. Why are the ways you are specifically dependent on others more important than the ways that other people are dependent on others? We all would not survive without the skills and care of others - from getting food to shelter to relying on the services of people like firemen and electricians, very few people would ever survive without the skills of other people.

Disabled people's needs are only considered a 'burden' because our needs are not built into society's structures. If every building had a ramp, wide hallways, and automatic doors or doors with buttons that open them, wheelchair users would be much more independent. Your needs are not built into society, and that is not your fault. We very much have the resources to help disabled people and to make us more independent, but as a society, it is not prioritized, so it does not happen unless we fight for it.

If you feel like you contribute something, it is not because you are worthless or because you are a burden. It is because society has actively ignored disabled people and excluded us from integrated lives, which makes it very very hard to contribute things indeed, or to feel human at all. 

You are definitely deserving. You are not worth less or working harder than other disabled people. You are also welcome in the disabled community - even if the people around you don't understand, please know that you have people here who understand and care.",,,,doelana,Autistic,,1517683080,t5_2qhe8,t3_7uz3ge,t3_7uz3ge,16,1518895067,0,0,dtoobgi,disability,,,,"Society has a stereotype of a 'super cr*pple'.

171,"Hi, 2 things:

1) Go to Citizens Advice and ask for their help about applying for PIP. You may not qualify, but CAB usually have expertise in the process and can give you impartial advice about your chance of getting PIP. Also, Citizens Advice may also be able to point you in the direction of other benefits that you may be entitled to.

2) PIP should be in addition to any money you're currently getting from Universal Credit, and PIP should not be counted for tax purposes, or be used as a replacement for other benefits. It's worth applying for, even if you don't get it, in the sense that you'd be no worse off than you are right now.

176,"I agree with another commenter that, in my experience, the airport matter more than the airline. Sone airports are on their shit, some...aren’t. In many cases, all the assistance one does or doesn’t receive prior to and during boarding is coming coming from an outsourced company that each of the airlines hire at the airport to handle special needs passengers. In some airports this is the same group regardless of airline. Sometimes if an airline rules over an entire  terminal, then the group is specific to that terminal.

It makes it harder to ascertain which airlines are actually doing their part better. :( and of course the airlines have fought not to have to publicly release stats on things like wheelchair damages...grrrr.

I will say though, I have flown hundreds of times both domestically in the US and internationally, usually alone, and entirely dependent on my manual wheelchair.

Also, never let novice employees talk you into parting from your chair before the gate—totally not required and way more risky—ALWAYS GATE CHECK (more advice that sadly doesn’t apply to power chairs).

I do not know what it is like to lose ability, and can only intellectually imagine the sort of identity crisis that this can bring, most likely exacerbated by the reality of having to face people who had known you before onset. I also do not know about general pain--though it is something I am assumed to have, it is fortunately not a reality that I face. One reality I do face, however, is that of constant questioning.

The inevitable questions you will face may indeed be laced with unsolicited pity--though I can't speak for your friend, I would venture to guess that this is unfamiliar territory for her as well, and will be just as anxiety-inducing. I recommend that you not say anything in advance, as doing so would intensify the uncertainty of your eventual interaction in the meantime and may cause her to cancel outright out of fear. (I would not be surprised if we found her on this thread, either way, asking how best to approach you!)
 
Your condition does not define you, but it is a part of you. Asking about it is natural, but you have the right not to disclose just as you would any other personal detail. 
It will be a tough conversation for the both of you, but if you want that connection to be sincere, those questions need to be asked. Not all at once, certainly not the first time you see her. Not even all verbally. If the two of you remain close, she will learn these things as she goes. 

If its just not going well at all, deflecting with humor is a good tactic that keeps the mood up if you really don't feel like talking.

Also if you do have MS, physio can help you manage it better.

There are some ""specialists"" you don't need a referral to see (e.g. sports medicine specialists), if you take this route, explain to them why you're there, that you don't know where else to go and ask them to make a referral if they can't do anything to help you.

3. Parenting techniques/strategies are just as diverse as the children that have disabilities. You have to be willing to trust your gut and do what works for your family. 
4. There are so many! Our first challenge was finding a doctor that would diagnose our child. We went years with Drs. telling us she was just a slow talker or she was just shy ( why she wasn't speaking). Challenges finding Drs, paying co-pays, paying for therapies, one parent not able to work b/c of no childcare, school, learning the whole language of ID, IEP's, most families I know cannot get any help until child turns 18 then they can get SSI, transition after high school, finding a job, who will take care of my child when I am gone and the list goes on and on.

You've solved a lot of challenges in life. It's a very impressive career path. But reading it makes me mad at the expensive college education, health care and unfair social support system. 

At the end, if nothing else works, you may have to go back to work. Until then, let's brainstorm with our foggy brains :) Sorry if I keep asking questions on repeat. 

Have you talked to a social worker at your local disability assistance centre? I'm not sure if there's something like that in your area, but these people are experts in appealing and they can help filling out forms. Is there any such help from MS society? Do they have any suggestion on funding during the appeal? 

Can you ask previous employer for part time / slow return to work hours? That may keep your income lower than SSDI criteria. 

How long does it take for SSDI appeal court date in your state? In that case you can see if you can survive on 700 till then (sorry I know how ridiculous this sound :( I don't know if someone over r/assistance might help)

Is moving to a lower cost of living area to survive till the court date an option? I think the main challenge is uncertainty over SSDI appeal result. If you decide to appeal, please talk to a lawyer.

LTD is supposed to pay till retirement. If you can earn lower than SSDI criteria amount, you should still qualify for LTD since it's supposed to be a certain percentage of your previous income? In that case it's worth appealing that even if it takes a long time. This can be parallel to SSDI appeal/return to work.

If at the end, you have to go back to work, maybe ask your doctor about medications for increased attention. Think they're used for ADHD, and only prescribed in extreme cases. I don't recommend using them, and may not be applicable to you. My specialist gave me some for worst brain fog days. I was about to get into an accident because my brain wasn't very clear. It's better to be safe than sorry. 

I can relate to your fear of not being as sharp and creative as before. Its important to limit your hours and modify expectations. I just wanted to say that you and your wife sound very strong. It's admirable how far you have come, how you care for her and don't want to put her through financial troubles. It could be that on her end, she'd rather have you in as good health as you can be than taking a toll on your body for money. Internet hug to you both.

259,"OK, here's the thing about getting Disability. The diagnosis itself isn't what's important. You could have a brain tumor, they don't care. All that matters is your ability to keep a job. That's it. If you've got no legs but you used to be a professional typist, then they'll ask why you can't go back to that line of work. But if you have chronic and unpredictable symptoms that keep you from predictably functioning in any kind of job, regardless of having an underlying diagnosis or not, you have a shot at Disability. As long as your symptoms are documented by doctors, that's what's the important thing. 

I say this as someone who had a mountain of medical records and no diagnosis when I applied for Disability. Just chronic migraine, dizziness, body pain, IBS, nerve problems, etc. The longer your medical records span, the more credence your claim. 

Get a Disability lawyer to help you apply for Disability. It takes on overage 3 years to get approved, and almost everyone is denied their first time, so be prepared for that disappointment. Start the process ASAP online, though, because the sooner you start the process, the farther back your claim for Disability starts, which means the more money you'll get in back pay when you are finally approved.

Just always remember: when asked about your condition, don't answer given an average or good day, give an answer that exemplifies one of your worst day. And also, it's not about what you have, it's how it hinders your ability to keep employment. Depression, IBS, dizziness, these are all ailments that work well in that defense.

271,"Hi :) 
Thank you so much for your well constructed and compassionate reply. I truly appreciate every word. 

I realized that a huge part of my anxiety surrounding this was due to the fact that my friend was just recently deceived by a cancer faker whom she thought was her best friend. 

That shouldn't have anything to do with me, of course, but it has her questioning her reality, and everything she thought she knew about someone she was close to for 26 years (we're 33, so much of her life).  She's struggling to understsnd the motivations and serious malingering appears to be the main one. 

So I felt like me not telling her anything at all about my condition would potentially throw up a red flag or make her somehow uncomfortable. 
This might be really self-absorbed thinking, but it sort of dog piled the anxiety I already have. 

It's a weird thing, this apparent identity crisis of mine. When I meet NEW people, I don't even think about it. 

It's definitely weirder seeing people from ""before"". 

I was a national level figure skater as a kid &amp; teen, and a horse trainer by profession. I rode for years after I couldn't walk, until progression hit a point which made it too risky for my residual physical functioning.  So In the past, I definitely defined myself by physucal capabilities. 
 
I love my life and I make every single day worthwhile even if it's a really brutal one. I just haven't dealt with the dissonant breach between what my life looks like on the surface and what that really means. 

I shouldn't be so vain as to care what people are thinking yet I totally hate pity. It's hard to reconcile who I am today with the scars (literal and figurative)  from the past fourteen years. And harder still when I'm reminded of who and what I was before, (even though I'm ultimately happier and more well-rounded now). 

There's something that just feels like a lie about throwing up or blacking out from pain and then coming to, laughing it off, and continuing on, but that's my reality.

I ended up giving her a casual heads-up via text when we were confirming timing. I still can't put a finger on why it felt necessary, but it did. She thanked me and reiterated that she's looking forward to getting together. She's a gem of a person and we'll have plenty of normal stuff to talk about, so I'm confident it will go great.. I'll find out on Monday!

Thank you  for listening while I unravelled my thoughts, and thank you for giving me so much more to consider. It's not the kind of stuff I talk about usually (duh, that was part pf the issue), and I appreciate you helping me think it through.

276,"Hey there. You're in for a lot of pain for a bit, but once the surgical pain dies down you'll know if you've gotten some pain reduction overall. I think it was like 3 months at least when I did it before I started getting to where I was able to tell that I was lucky enough to get the pain reduction. They told me that the goal was to stop my spine from getting worse (it had ground away bone and was crushing the nerves) but that if I was lucky I'd get pain reduction too. Turned out that I was, it went from a daily baseline pain level of 7-8, down to about 3-4 baseline. It's been a few years since my fusion, but keeping up with PT and whatnot I'm still at that 3-4 level of pain. So about 50% pain reduction after the fusion/bone rebuilding surgery.

Just from personal experience so YMMV:


* $80 might be a little high if heat is included in rent but it's going to depend a lot on local utility costs.
* Internet (you should be getting a promotional price if you're setting up new service, yeah?) and cell bill (you're on Lifeline, so is the $25 for data?) seem slightly high but again, local costs. 
* You might need to apply for LIHEAP due to the change in living situation, which may keep your food stamps the same or possibly increase what you're given. With the help of LIHEAP, at SSI income you should get the maximum amount (a little under $200) which is generally enough food budget for a month for a single person without additional expenses. Obviously tell SSA your new rent if you haven't already.
* I think you're underestimating household expenses - from recurring costs like soap, detergent, coin-op laundry if you don't have in-suite, toilet paper, bleach, etc, to bigger one-off costs like furniture, kitchenware (cast iron is cheap), and small appliances (countertop dishwasher is a godsend), there's a lot of 'em. Many of these are up-front expenses that aren't too bad but definitely should be accounted for. I'd suggest writing all your recurring costs down in a spreadsheet so you can make an accurate budget. 
* You have transportation to medical appointments, but what about non-medical? Any public transit costs for e.g. going to the grocery store? 
* I would advise building up an emergency fund with at least 6mo of living expenses (for yourself, double it for any future pet). Your emergencies (no pet or car, have renters insurance, stable income, no possibility of rent hikes) are going to be fairly few and far between, but it's still a good idea. Maybe try to save $150/mo (around half your discretionary income), opening an ABLE account if necessary due to the $2k SSI asset limit. 
* Think about opening a secured credit card if you have no credit history. Treat it exactly like a debit card, don't carry a balance. Discover's is excellent (2% on everything, can change it to 10% on rotating categories) and every little bit of cash back is great on a low income. If you have a stable income and can be responsible with it, credit is sometimes a useful tool and it pays to start early.
* Pets (especially dogs) are expensive. After you have a large emergency fund and you're settled in, I don't think a pet is necessarily financially out of the question as long as your building is OK with it. If the dog is medically necessary you can use its care costs as expenses for the purpose of HUD rent determination, but this will obviously not be a 1:1 deduction.

295,"Technically I was approved for both but SSDI is too high to get both. And I'm on a more unique form of benefits because my parents are older, so we're already on retirement social security when I became disabled. That and the fact that social security agreed that I became disabled before the age of 22 meant I qualified to draw benefits based on my mother's social security and work credits. But it's functionally SSDI (but my mom makes markedly more each more each month than me). 

Either way, the process for approval is the same, means the same thing. Just works differently. (And I know the word disability is only in the name of one but the same disability determination people decide on both). 

Anyway, I get that even using the term disabled can be an odd thing. Or depending on what you're dealing with, it maybe doesn't feel like it's the right word for you. You also may not fit the narrow box of what a lot of people think of when they think disabled. But it's a pretty broad spectrum and I've been involved more recently with disability rights groups and such, and can tell you most people who consider themselves disabled would almost certainly consider you disabled as well. Heck, someone with say asthma that's well controlled technically has a disability even though it may not have a major impact on their life and they probably work and don't even think about it much. Mental health issues can be considered a type of disability as well though often even the disability community forgets that or doesn't do as good of a job at remembering that. 

Anyway, it's all semantics. Disabled is what I always right on any form though. As someone else replied you certainly can use unemployed or homemaker but I never feel like that fits as well and it's like I have a choice in being unemployed.

I'm a little concerned that your doctors ""don't believe in it"" - do you mean they don't believe in disability for anybody, or that they don't believe you in particular are disabled? 

If they are talking specifically about you, it might be worth having a conversation in which you make sure they understand the standard of disability. For Social Security Disability, you need to show that you cannot perform any full time work on a sustained basis. Full time to SSA means eight hours per day, five days per week, consistently. If you're absent as little as 2-3 days per month, that's not consistent enough to sustain fulltime work. 

Maybe your doctors think you can do part time work, or maybe they aren't considering that your conditions have good days and bad days (if that's the case).

- Accept the anger and saddness of this injustice, pain, death of a past and future self.

- Day by day, figure out what things I can do. I can clean off the stove. I can fold some laundry. Even if these  are the only thing you can do all day. I found a family member who needed some data entry done and was flexible about when I can finish it by. I dont contibute financially or physically as much, but purpose has given me a sense of peace. I am exploring arts and crafts as healing from bed and might sell some. I hope to someday start a shop for only disabled folks to sell their stuff. Anyway, figuring out little by little what you can do will help you birth a new self. Be gentle with yourself.

Once you have a diagnosis, check with your state's vocational rehab department to see if they can provide you with any services.  They might help pay for training and education so you might find a job that you could realistically do with your disabilities.

Keep in mind that with most diagnosis, you will have to submit medical evidence proving that your conditions severely and markedly affects your ability to work and function despite treatment.  Follow your doctor's orders carefully so you can prove you are following treatment protocols.  Be sure that your doctor knows about any medication side effects and notes them in your records.

It’s so difficult when the professionals minimize the severity of your decline when you are very self aware of “losing a step” mentally.  It’s not much consolation, but you are definitely not alone.

Despite the popular belief, you can work while your disability case is pending and still win.  You absolutely can not earn above the substantial gainful activity (SGA) amount (it was $1170 a month last year, not sure if it went up for 2018).  If you go above that level, the SSA automatically assumes you are not disabled.  Another criteria is can you still do any of your past jobs at the SGA level, so if you go back to work, you should consider not going back to your old job or career.  While working below the SGA technically shouldn’t affect your application, I can see why most attorneys advise you not to work.  Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.

My doctor put in my notes that I was alone, which could have looked as if like I drove there by myself.  I left him a voicemail and explained what I needed.  I was open with my doctor and he immediately said that he would change it.  I think most doctors care about their patients but sometimes things fall between the cracks.  I imagine charting is among most doctors least favorite duties.  If your doctors make a mistake, let them know.  If they are unwilling to fix the error, it's probably a sign that they don’t support your application .  It might be time to look for new providers.

393,"Really TL;DR.  Whichever choice you make concerning an attorney, get copies of your own records and provide your disability examiner with updated records as you get more treatment.  Stay up to date on your case even if an attorney is handling it.  

It’s a hard process to go through.  You’ll have to make the decision whether to hire an attorney or not, but I will make two observations based upon my application.  The first is get copies of your medical records for yourself, even if you hire an attorney.  That way you will be familiar with the evidence being used to decide your case.  As you receive additional treatment, forward those records to your disability examiner and call back about 10 days after submission to confirm receipt.  

The second is to remember that even if you hire an attorney, you need to stay up-to-date on your case.  They are working on your behalf,  but it’s ultimately your claim.  I had an acute illness and last May, my eyesight had declined so much I was declared legally blind.  I forwarded these results to my disability examiner and confirmed receipt 10 days later.  At this point, I should have met a disability listing and been approved automatically.  I was surprised in late June when I received a denial.  I looked the letter over and discovered that the records pertaining to my blindness weren’t used to decide my case.  My attorney told me to file an appeal immediately.  Instead, the next day, I called my examiners boss and told them about the missed evidence.  They reopened my case and two weeks later, I was approved.  Had I blindly listened to my attorney or not been up-to-date on my case, I would have probably waited months longer for my benefits.

Look up substantial gainful activity for

It is possible to hold down a job and still get disability, I worked while my disability case was pending, but I did not do substantial gainful activity, I held onto a part-time minimum-wage job in an office.

Due to the circumstances, such as travel time, difficulty performing the job, workplace politics, and wanting to move to another state, I happily quit that job as soon as I got my Disability check.

You can make more money while on disability or while working while you wait for a case,  if you are blind or have low vision 

I make less money now then if I would have kept that job, but I really don't care about that.

I'm aiming to go back to school, and possibly leave disability if a fantastic job came along.

The main thing about your case is documentation, and the kind of work you can do despite that, with medical treatment.

I know people who are young and have got in on Purely mental disorders, but it's very difficult and requires lots of documentation.

I for example had 4 years of mental health health documentation, several years of documentation of eye diseases, documentation of birth defects that went back to my birth, school records, documentation of my heart surgery, ect.

It's definitely possible to get in, if you have a very good documentation and not much work experience or transferable skills you will have an easier time, if you don't have a slam dunk case and sometimes not even then, you're going to expect to wait about a year-and-a-half on average to get to an administrative law judge and then another 3 or 4 months to get at your first disability check, with back pay.

I've known people at 23 who became disabled due to depression for example.

There's also the possibility of you going back to work, and earning credits for SSDI, then applying later.

He was legally blind, and that's one of a handful of things where it's very easy to get disability for no matter how young you are.

You need to have all your ducks in a row regarding medical evidence.

How long you been treated, what medications, you should get a form called the residual functional capacity form, which basically is going to tell you some questions you need to answer about what you can do despite your impairments.

If your  impairments are quite severe, have not responded to treatment that much, and are expected to last more than a year, AND Social Security feels there's nothing you could do full time, then you would have a shot.

If you don't have health insurance right now, see if you can get your problems documented at a clinic ?

I know that some people probably have to go into medical debt and credit card debt just to see a doctor about their conditions, then once they get approved for disability, declare bankruptcy and have that debt discharged.

However, I had been talking to my doctors about the state disability and getting my records in order for that (straightening out some notes where important information wasn’t recorded because I requested my records and noticed the errors). Those were key steps that I think really helped me. Additionally, I have been fighting multiple chronic illnesses for over 14 years. I was careful to note all of my doctors for all of that time (all of whom knew I was applying for disability). I think there are places in the application to note important things. If there is a spot like that, take time to explain and note those things. I did the online application. You will later receive a set of questions about daily life and how your disability impacts it. Take time to answer those carefully and send it back ASAP. I got my approval in about 6 months.

497,"Thanks for sharing. Here’s a quoted section from the article that caught my attention:

‘Nor would adopting the Netherlands’ model of private disability insurance, as Autor and Duggan have suggested, reduce program spending. As of 2013, the OECD reports that the US spent 1.4 percent of GDP on cash disability benefits. The Netherlands spent 3.1 percent, more than double that. Among rich countries, only Canada, Japan, and South Korea spend less than we do, and most spend far more. A 2010 OECD white paper concluded that the US, Canada, Japan, and South Korea have “the most stringent eligibility criteria for a full disability benefit” in the developed world.

The idea that we, of all countries, are panicking that our benefits are too generous is slightly absurd — especially when we also offer substantially worse access to health insurance for working-class people, to prevent these disabilities from developing in the first place.’

The author also linked pieces from NPR (This American Life) and the Washington Post that support cuts to some SSDI benefits/programs (according to the article).

I won’t tell you to leave your position but I will tell you that the excuse is BS. If you feel your training is inadequate, it is.","[{'start': 49, 'end': 57, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

507,"At this point I’m looking for any suggestions, MS was the only one I brought up due to the family history (though yes I know its not been proven but it has shown to be more likely). Anyway for some reason I didn’t really give a thought to neuro-muscular things, I am looking around at CMT which fits me like a glove, including the curled toes and some other really obscure ‘I thought it was just me’ things lol. I won’t jump to conclusions yet but that’s definitely a thing to bring up! If only my GP actually listened to me...

I’ve had an ECG (because of chest pains, unrelated to all this), EMG of my left leg which apparently was fine, and some basic blood tests for auto-immune which seem to be clean. Other than that it’s just things like iron and thyroid. I have the hypothyroid problem and I’m a girl, so I have the lovely fluctuating iron problem. My GP wants to send me to Physio and is convinced nothing is actually up with me and that I need to stop being lazy basically so asking for tests is kinda... tough.

Thank you for this info it’s helped me actually quite a bit already!

539,"OTC vitamins I was told to take, fluids to replace electrolytes (my go-to atm is propel water and coconut juice), I have to spend more on certain food items like getting meal replacement shake powder and other low sugar nutritious liquid foods, and also pre-cooked or pre-chopped stuff. I pay for transportation because I cannot drive a car. The state gives me free rides to the doctor but they can be as much as 2+ hours late so I still have to use a taxi sometimes since public transit doesn't reach most places and is also late. Other items include kitchen things that make it easier for me to make meals, I've paid for people to move my things, paid cash for glasses because insurance didn't cover all of the bill.

I think getting things like mandolin slicers, rice cookers, kitchen aids, etc would really help disabled people to eat more nutritious food and be able to cook more. Cutting vegetables is often difficult enough that it deters many people from even eating them. Supplements are also a big one. For example, ginger chews are often used by people who get nauseous, they work pretty well but insurance does not cover them. Same for iron pills, co-enzyme 10, meal replacement shakes, melatonin (lots of people have issues sleeping) and things like fiber powder. Transportation is another big one that I think a lot of people spend money on. Either their own special equipment to get around, or cars, or taxi's and public transit.

563,"I can't help with the first two because that does sound brand specific, but on the last point, do you know how the results will be transcribed and interpreted? when I had a holter monitor the data was constantly recorded onto the device hard drive and a poor Tech had to comb through the 120 hours of data to find the abnormal events. So when recording the timing of my symptoms, it didn't actually matter if I was noting it down several minutes after the fact, as long as the tech knew to look at the data a few minutes *before* I recorded a symptom, not just at the exact time I recorded a symptom.

The first time I got the results back it was clear of all abnormalities, I requested the raw data and my GP and I combed through it together and I found the exact time I experienced symptoms supported by a change in my heart rate, The tech hadn't taken into account that I wasn't physically able to record a symptom at the exact time, because, well, I was in the middle of a fainting spell. My Gp wrote back to the imaging company with a copy of the raw data, highlighting the moments we wanted them to re-report on, and they reported back with the abnormalities we knew I had been experiencing.

565,"I have a box next to my bed that helps me with my self care so my partner doesn't have to do to much for me on a bad day.

It's within reach of my bed, has water, shelf stable protein drinks, extras of my usual medication, a single use heat pack and ice pack that you punch to activate the chemicals, as well as my reusable microwave heatpack - though if I'm stuck in bed my partner will need to help me, but at least he's not having to look all over the house for my other heatpack. It has wet wipes so I can wash my face and freshen up, It is also a has my knitting project, and eye mask and some ear plugs so I can rest.

That's usually me taken care of. The other side of my bad days is making sure my partner isn't having to go out of his way to take care of himself.

I try to do a quick sweep of the house before bed every day, it just keeps the dirt at a controllable level so if I'm stuck in bed for a few days the house work doesn't build up. Trying to do a chore the second it rises. Use a bowl, wash a bowl, drop a crumb, mop a crumb. I don't let housework build up, because then it becomes a huge job and I need to be in the best health to tackle it, or my partner has to pick up the slack and he works full time so I want him to just be able to relax when he's home.

When I cook, I always cook 4 portions, a lot of cheap easy family recipes are designed to serve 4. My partner and I eat a portion, and he might take leftovers into work, the remaining portion I freeze, so if I'm having a bad day my partner doesn't have to cook, we have a stash of homecooked meals in the freezer, a few minutes in the microwave, and he's set. Slow cookers are amazing for meal prepping lots of portions when you don't have much energy or strength.

Laundry and showers are two tasks I'm still working on. My partner has to help me shower when I'm having a really bad day, so often I put it off and make do with wet wipes and dry shampoo, hoping I get better before I need to bother my partner to help. That's not ideal. We're trying to find a shower chair that will fit with our awkward bathroom shape. Laundry is also a problem. My partner often forgets to tell me until it's too late that he's out of underwear and we need to do laundry *right now *. He grew up with a washer dryer, so he's still getting used to the fact that handwashing and line drying takes 2 days, and he needs to plan ahead if he's running low on clean clothes, especially if he needs me to clean them while he's at work, because I'll need to plan my week around having enough energy for laundry. Otherwise he has to drive to the next town over to find a laundromat.

The judges decision clearly says both were reopened, and he found me disabled back to the 2012 date for both, but I'm guessing the processing decided since it had been over 2 years, the SSI can't go back that far.  

I did manage to log into the ssa website, and it shows an ssdi payment coming in march, and it also shows that medicare coverage started (retroactively) in 2014....which if I understand correctly medicare has a 2 yr waiting period, so that would make sense using the 2012 date.

618,"Unfortunately, these agencies do not provide any services beyond providing information.

I get what you're saying. As a business, it sucks to be slapped with a lawsuit out of the blue, but these are not frivolous lawsuits. Whenever someone is in business, no matter if it's the Fortune 20 company with 40,000+ employees that I work for, or my uncle's small business with 8 employees, it is their responsibility to ensure that they are in compliance with the law, or risk litigation. 

Think of it this way, if an employer was ignorant of safety regulations religions for their workplace, they will be sued by their employees for unsafe work conditions, and rightly so. If a hiring manager discriminates against a particular race or religion, the business will be sued under civil rights law, and rightly so. If you want to avoid lawsuits, as every business does, then it is your responsibility to be aware of, and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.

The ADA has been around for 27 years. Businesses have had more than enough time to become aware of the law, especially when free resources are available. Penalties for ADA violations are very, very light compared to other regulations: they only need to remedy the violation, and pay the plaintiff's legal expenses. The only ones getting a payday from ADA litigation are lawyers, to be compensated for their time and expertise.",,,,seanthegeek,,,1518440017,t5_2qhe8,t3_7wq9gu,t1_du4fead,2,1519168458,0,0,du4i5wk,disability,,,,,
619,"Great question. Generally, communication with the business is the way to go, although it's technically not required. It builds goodwill and understanding. Lawsuits are the enforcement mechanism.

&gt; This latest attempt to curtail the civil rights of people with disabilities was reignited by a popular “60 Minutes” segment alleging the widespread filing of frivolous Title III lawsuits by attorneys who spot ADA violations using, for example, Google Earth. The segment implies that people with disabilities have no complaints about the noncompliant establishments but that, because of these lawsuits, business owners end up with a bill that many of them cannot afford to foot. It’s important to note that under Title III, those in violation of the ADA do not have to pay any monetary damages, only attorney’s fees and injunctive relief, meaning business owners must remedy the violation.

&gt; So-called frivolous lawsuits, however, are nowhere near as pervasive as proponents of the ADA Education and Reform Act suggest. Proponents of the bill point to increases over the past several years in Title III filings, including a 37 percent uptick in 2016 compared with 2015. But a quick look at the numbers shows that this increase is easily explained by a small number of large-scale filers. In fact, just 12 individual attorneys and a single disability law firm were responsible for more than one-third of all Title III lawsuits filed in 2016, accounting for more than 100 cases each..

&gt; Even in the unlikely event that all of these large-scale filers’ lawsuits were indeed frivolous—which is disproven by the fact that many of them have brought to light very real violations of the ADA—they would hardly present an issue systemic enough to warrant federal intervention, particularly when such an intervention would gut a decades-old civil rights law. Additionally, protections against the filing of frivolous lawsuits are enshrined in existing ethics rules. As disability rights lawyer Robyn Powell notes, frivolous lawsuits can already be addressed through district courts, as well as by state bar associations.

Buildings built before the ADA in 1990 are exempt (I think there are some exceptions to this, check the resources below). So there is little excuse for a business that is still not in compliance after 27 years!

Before you contact a business, make sure you know that they are actually in violation.

The ADA National Network is a great information resource from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) The federal government’s primary disability research agency.

&gt; In a 225-192 vote, most House Republicans and a dozen Democrats passed a bill on Thursday that makes it harder for disabled persons to sue for discrimination in an effort to prevent opportunistic attorneys from taking advantage of business owners.

&gt; But many disability and civil rights groups fear the bill will weaken incentives for businesses to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which mandates equal access to public accommodations.

...

&gt; Proponents argue that the bill, The ADA Education and Reform Act, or H.R. 620, is necessary to stem the flow of ""drive-by lawsuits"" brought by lawyers who only wish to line their pockets. The bill would require those filing suit in federal court against businesses for not complying with the ADA to first give that business 60 days to devise a plan to fix the issue, and another 120 days to implement the changes.

&gt; The ACLU called the bill unacceptable, adding, ""This scheme removes the business’s incentive to proactively ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Instead, businesses will simply wait until someone’s right to access is violated and notification is received before making the change they were already obligated to make.""

&gt; More than 200 disability rights supporters signed a letter in opposition to the bill, including the National Bar Association, the Paralyzed Veterans Association and the NAACP.

&gt; The motivation for the bill stems from reports of trial lawyers and firms across the country submitting dozens of lawsuits against businesses for not complying with the ADA. A ""60 Minutes"" segment from earlier this year showed lawyers in California filing ADA complaints simply after noticing violations after driving by a business or online via Google Earth.

&gt; But critics say that these issues can be addressed at the state level and through district courts.

## My take

The ADA Network already provides federally-funded ADA training and education; setting up an additional education program at the Department of Justice would be unnecessary and wasteful. Under current law, ADA accommodations must not place an “undue burden” on the business and be “readily achievable “. Plaintiffs cannot seek financial damages beyond recovering legal fees. 

The proposed legislation allows businesses to ignore ADA requirements until formal notification is sent by a disabled person, undermining the spirit of the ADA that all public businesses must be accessible from the start. These additional steps would deny persons with disabilities their right to due process through the courts, by allowing businesses to indefinitely delay enforcement of the law through continuous claims of “substantial progress”, as noted by the ACLU. 

Whenever someone is in business, no matter if it's the Fortune 20 company with 40,000+ employees that I work for, or my uncle's small business with 8 employees, it is their responsibility to ensure that they comply with the law, or risk litigation.

He may not qualify for disability just for having stents put in, since most people make a total recovery after stenting, meaning they get 90-100% of their functioning back within a couple months after stenting.

Application will need to take place either online, or in person in the state which he physically resides. The claims process can take anywhere from 2-3 months (typical in my state from application to initial decision) to years, depending on the state's backlog and appeal process.

Exams are always the last step, so the case should be written up already, that will probably take a day or two after the reports are received. Then the analyst sends the case for doctor signature, both physical and mental if necessary, or any specialists like ophthalmology or cardiology. The doctors sign off on the case after providing input on how your conditions affect your ability to work and what limitations they may cause. That can take from a day to a week, usually. The analyst gets the case back, ties up any loose ends, and closes it, that takes a day or two.

Because of the CDL requirements, I don't believe this is a violation of the ADA or HIPPA.

653,"Most likely your case will get another review in 3-5 years. Most people under the age of 50 without a 'permanent' (amputation, genetic condition, etc) impairment get reviews every 3-5 years.

Technically, you do have a 'diary' on your case that denotes when it should be reviewed again (1, 3, 5, or 7 years usually). But, it doesn't *always* happen that way, especially if you've already been through one CDR review. 

So, time is really the main trigger of a CDR review. The other things that can trigger review is significant work activity (if you work they do occasional reviews of your income and if you're earning substantial income they can refer you for a medical review) or a fraud complaint. 

Up until a few years ago, CDR reviews used to be delayed all the time. A 3 year review wouldn't get looked at until 5 years, etc. There is a finite amount of work a DDS can do, and they have to process claims of those applying for benefits (whereas CDRs can be pushed back). But, as the baby boomers are reaching full retirement age and the economy has improved, receipts of initial claims is way down. That, combined with the politics surrounding the SSDI/SSI programs has resulted in a renewed push for CDR reviews. So, to those on benefits, it may seem like they are getting more/quicker reviews, but really its that scheduled reviews are going to actually start happening on time.

656,"Hmmm, so tampons really shouldn't hurt if they're in properly- same goes for the cup. 

Actually, let me elaborate. Going in, tampons should not really hurt. If you're using a cardboard applicator (instead of plastic) and you're very dry then it can be uncomfortable. If it's more than uncomfortable then you might not be inserting the applicator in far enough. Once you ""deploy"" the tampon from the applicator you shouldn't be able to feel it in your body.

Taking a tampon out should be painless too, but you can get sore if you tense up, are too dry or if you change your tampon very frequently (making it dry).

The cup is larger than a tampon and more awkward to use at first, but it never chafes or dries you out (it's made of a soft silicone). You have to be willing to be very ""hands on"" with your lady bits to use a cup because there are no strings to get it out. The cup stays well in place by creating a vacuum seal in your vagina.

664,"It was in a small room in a federal building. There was the Judge seated at a raised desk then of to the sides were a secretary and a lady that works for the state to advise the judge how many jobs you are qualified to work, I can't remember what they're called. My lawyer and I sat across from the judge. I was so scared and anxious I was shaking and crying even though my lawyer told me my judge would be nice (not all of them are but she knew mine would be).

My judge was nice thankfully. He started asking basic info questions then he asked specific questions about my symptoms and what I did with my time. All the advice I ever read on here was to talk about stuff like it's your worst day, but I'm a super literal person and my judge asked very specific questions like what I do when I'm not having a bedridden day. So I just answered as best as I could, but I was still so nervous. Looking back I might have undersold how much energy my depression leaches from me even on a ""normal"" day, but aside from that I think I did ok.

Then the judge asked the job lady how many jobs there were similar to my last employment. Now, I'd read about this part before. The judge will propose specific scenarios and the job person will answer if there are any jobs available that you can do. The answer that is supposedly good is to hear that there are no jobs in all scenarios.

For reference I've just testified that I spend no less than 9 days a month completely bedridden. I have a function report and on going medical treatment supporting my conditions. So I was expecting that all the questions would say I was unable to work. Not how it went for me.

So the judge threw out the first condition which was somthing like could asknanners12 do her previous work if she had brain fog (one of my medicinal side effects). The job lady said no, my previous job was too highly skilled but there would be other jobs I could do. The judge asked what it was and wrote it down. I was too shocked to really react. Then he said, would that job be available if asknanners12 needed to take more than 2 breaks every (I can't remember). And she said no. Then he asked would that job be available if asknanners12 missed more than 2 days a month and she said no. For good measure my lawyer then asked would that job be available if I could not stay on task and she said no.

There were a few more questions then my lawyer asked me a few. She told me ahead of time she wouldn't have to ask me much because my judge is very thorough. Then it was over. He said he'll be making his decision in 60 days. The whole thing lasted about an hour I think.

When my lawyer prepped me she told me that she'd never been able to read this judge and he doesn't ever give away his decision so we'd just have to wait for it.

After the hearing my lawyer sat with me in a private room so we could talk about what happened. She said I have a shot and that I did very well. She just let me absorb what happened. My ex-husband went with as support and had to be in the waiting room the whole time. He said nobody else's lawyer talked to them after the hearing- I'm really glad mine did.

So yeah, now I'm just waiting. I read a post by a lawer in this sub that said the judge has pretty much already made up his mind when he asks those scenarios. I also read that a judge needs to choose one of those scenarios as your like baseline and depending on which he/she chooses means if you're disabled or not.

SSI is for people who either 1) are disabled but never worked/didn’t work enough to receive SSDI, or 2) receive SSDI but the amount is not enough to live on, so their income is supplemented by SSI.

Spoiler alert: the answer is probably ‘no’. 

My in laws are GOP voters, but I never thought they were radical until this election cycle. I’m on SSDI. Their daughter cares for me, and they had to pay to keep us in housing when everything went south because we couldn’t get help from anywhere else. Their son is an Obamacare recipient, and it *literally* saved his life.

But they get so pissed off over spending things like this, and *livid* when my wife and I talk about leaving the country to have kids (I really don’t believe we can afford to live here and raise children). I try to point out that they’re voting for the policies that cause this, but it doesn’t go over well.

It’s a type of cognitive dissonance that the GOP specializes in — the people they know who need these programs are special, and are exceptions to the rule that only lazy worthless people rely on the government.

In that case, compile all the medical records yourself and send them along with the appreal. If you’re in California, or if you were mistaken in describing this and this is actually your appeal before and administrative law judge, run, don’t walk, to your attorney.

You absolutely, absolutely, without a doubt, should get an attorney. When you end up in front of the ALJ, they will have a government employee there whose job is to explain why your husband can still work. Your attorney’s job is to counter that, and you are not as good at it as he will be.

Disability attorneys are limited in the amount they can take from a settlement. There is no way that they can draw it out, because there is only ever one hearing that an attorney has to show up to. In most states it takes roughly 3 years from the date you apply to the date you see the ALJ. After that, it’s all over. You have to start over from the initial process with new information. You do not want to lose in front of the ALJ.

My point is that there is no reason that you should not have an attorney. Your husband is accruing backpay while waiting for this to be approved. It’s money that’s not already in your hands, and it will be a windfall when you get it. The attorney fee comes out of that amount, before you ever see it, so you’ll never feel like you’ve lost anything.

The idea is that they provide an emotional component which is not recognized as a specific task, and therefore they aren't given the same public access rights--so they don't have to have great extensive professional training to be equipped for public work. (And full service dogs don't have to be professionally trained either; owner training is actually recommended for psychiatric SDs to increase the bond between handler and dog.) 

Practically, I intend to at least try to do some task training, though I doubt she would be able to be a full-fledged service dog just due to the fact that I'm not sure she could physically handle going out and about with me all day and I don't know about her previous exposure to various environments.

743,"We can't help what others do. If somebody wants to pass off their pet peacock as an ESA, my having or not having an emotional support dog who I do not take in public and with whom I follow all the rules and guidelines does not impact the decisions of stupid people. According to the ADA and Fair Housing Act, ESAs are not required to have specific training to mitigate disabilities. Ideally, one should be trained at least as well as a pet dog, but as they don't have public access rights other than flying (and that's sketchy at best), there is no immediate need to pay thousands of dollars to train a dog in something they maybe aren't great at. If you were to try to find a dog with the perfect temperament and train them like a service dog, then you've essentially got a service dog, not an ESA. 

As a responsible representative of the disabled community in my area, I intend to do everything I can to ensure that my ESA is well-behaved and doesn't cause issues in my housing, but I can't control what happens with airlines, and calling the dog by the legal term which applies to her does not affect that in the least. Believe me, if I had the money to pursue a professionally trained service dog, I would already be doing so. But I don't have the money, so I have to settle for the next best thing, which is having a dog which will be allowed in my no-pet housing specifically because her presence helps me manage my anxiety.

Problem is that when we start making *morality based* decisions like that, it can easily slide into someone 5 lbs over ideal weight getting denied help for “giving herself diabetes.” 




Nevermind the issue of what to do as a society with a spike of dead-broke disabled people. How do you think they would live? Since I’ve seen it, I’ll tell you: steal, assault, prostitute, sell drugs, and so on.... 



The ~$800 a month these people get to *not* do this might not be worth it to you, until one assaults and robs *you.*Then you would be wondering: “Why don’t we do something about these damn criminals?!” 



I’m guessing your answer would be “prison.” But the cost per inmate averaged ~$33k per year in 2013 and surely is now even higher. The cost for them to get SSI/SSDI? Average of ~$13k per year.



A potential difference of 20k *per person* of our tax dollars.

I agree with you 100% that we need to stop the trillions of dollars wasted in the “drug war” and get people treatment which is generally less expensive than the costs of prison, dedicated LEO, etc. 



I don’t see the need for a “financial deterrent” (ie, punishment) when someone has a *disability*, no matter what the cause. You probably would not give a “financial deterrent” to fat people who have diabeties so they cannot buy more food. And probably not give a “financial deterrent” to the family who had a baby with a genetically linked disorder to discourage them from breeding.



After addicts are treated, they can still have disabling conditions such as epilepsy, dementia, COPD, etc. And then without any income, former addicts need a way to get food and shelter or they are still gonna break the law for these things and we are back to the original problem. 



Recovering addicts are also more likely to relapse back into using when homeless or under similar stress. And *then* they will not only be stealing to live, but stealing for drug money. 



I agree with what you are saying. You need to also factor in: 1. Not all addicts continue to use, some enter recovery. 2. Then there is still the problem of how they will live if/when they are disabled and unemployable. (back to square one.)

831,"That is what my recent situation is, yes. I was on LTD through a private company, and was waiting for a court date for my SSDI hearing. Now, it looks like my options are:

1) Go back to work as an analyst (or whatever position that company puts me in, which could involve physical labor that will also affect my spinal issues even further, IF they will take me back) and try to make it work, 
2) Find something else to do that would put me under the gainful employment amount ($1180/month) while I continue to fight for SSDI, 
3) Fight the LTD decision, which judging by the last time I had to do this and spent all of our savings in doing so (and had to use my back pay to keep us afloat due to late fees, penalties, and pawn loans), that means around 6 months without pay, getting by on my wife's  $700/mo SSDI income. We will end up homeless. We already lost our car last time we had to fight this.  I can't put her through that again.

The upside is that if my old employer will take me back as full-time, while I will forego my SSDI case for now, I can have STD and LTD benefits again in case another relapse causes me to be further disabled.  It honestly seems like that would be the best option at this point.  I just dread going back to coming home and inmediately going to bed and laying there until it's time to get up the next day.",,,,FormerlyAutoecious,,,1518126553,t5_2qhe8,t3_7w32tw,t1_dtya9uu,1,1519062007,0,0,dtyc4v0,disability,,,,,
832,"The problem is that I can't afford to appeal again. I'm still recovering financially from the last time I had to appeal last fall, which burnt up the last of our savings and everything we could sell/ pawn, as well as accepted help from our friends that cannot be duplicated at this time. We lost our car and are still behind on utility bills.  And I have one more paycheck coming from them for 3 weeks worth of pay. $1200.  I wish I could fight it, but I don't have the means to do so.

If I return to work, I will keep a roof over our heads, but they'll be able to say that I can work. And I will be able to - until my work fires me for being unsuitable for the job.  But it's all that I feel like I can do at this point.  I've appealed twice before when they tried to screw me and eventually won both, but I can't take that financial hit again.

Your comments have made me wonder if I might be able to return to work, save as much as I can (my old salary was about twice what I make through the LTD insurance), and if I cannot handle working, if I might be able to appeal the LTD denial then.

Either way, that could potentially be another fallback plan.",,,,FormerlyAutoecious,,,1518159726,t5_2qhe8,t3_7w32tw,t1_dtz3yac,1,1519075474,0,0,dtz449l,disability,,,,,
836,"No family able to help. My parents are dead, most of my grandparents are dead. I have a grandmother who is poor and an aunt on my father's side whom has the means, but wouldn't because of her view of my lack of religion, as well as old family drama (my father threatened to kill her husband long ago when the husband abused her).  My wife is estranged from her family.  Our friends have helped us a great deal through our two previous fights over denials, and most are not in a position to help at this time or fall into the category of the ""I helped you guys before, now you're on your own"" mindset. It doesn't help that, being disabled, we've lost touch with a lot of our friends over the years.

I'm definitely going to watch my employers like a hawk if they will allow me to return. Thankfully, I live in a one-party recording consent state, so that may come in handy.

My biggest fear is that I will have a very hard time finding a desk job if I don't get back in at my previous employer.  I was one of those kids that fell into the trap of getting burnt out in school from a lack of challenges, and as a result, couldn't get any scholarships. I couldn't afford college as a result, so while my last job technically required a master's degree, I was able to earn my way into it by proving myself from an entry level (bachelor's degree, typically) position, which I got by having proven myself as a good analytical hand at my employer before that, despite hiring on at an entry-level dispatch position there.  Because I could constantly re-invent myself and create opportunities back then, over a few years, I went from (at various companies) a stockboy, to a planogrammer, to a debt collector, to a debt collector trainer, to a dispatcher (that was after my first experience with disability many years back, with just spinal issues but no MS),  to a business manager assistant, to a category and retail analyst.  All with no degree.  I just don't know if I have it in me to still be anything like that creative go-getter that I used to be.",,,,FormerlyAutoecious,,,1518163359,t5_2qhe8,t3_7w32tw,t1_dtz4m8u,3,1519076309,0,0,dtz5uyy,disability,,,,,
837,"I understand what you're saying. However, while I appeal, I would have no income. The disability insurance company requests that you send all of the documentation in within 6 months. For me to get the documentation from my doctors, it will probably only take about one to two months, since some will require appointments to address the concerns I would need documented to effectively fight this (e.g. my neuro).  Then, I fax the forms to them, and it takes a day to have them show it in their system as received. Then they get to stall for 45 days (and the quickest they got a decision back to me before was 32 days) to make a decision. Then they get to stall to send the payments, which takes about another week.  So that's, at minimum, IF my doctors all play nice about the paperwork, about 3 months without a dime coming in.  We are paycheck to paycheck now because of the previous fights with this company.  Plus, there are the costs of copies of my records, faxing them, transportation to the doctors, etc. that would have to come from nowhere.  That is why I cannot afford this.

If I choose to appeal their decision and return to ANY work in the interim, I would lose my appeal, because their disability guidelines state that they have to believe that you are incapable of ANY employment. No matter what I do or how few hours, if I go back to work, I'm screwed as far as appealing it.  However, if I work somewhere earning under the gainful employment cutoff for SSDI, I can still keep my case for SSDI going, which I am currently waiting for a court date for.  The problem with that is finding somewhere to work to earn that little income, because my old employer whom I have been on disability leave from does not pay that little even for part time employees.

I'm between a rock and a hard place.  I can choose to risk homelessness and hunger to fight, or I can struggle to try to work.  The only positive, IMO, is that if my old employer takes me back, I will quickly requalify for STD and LTD leave again if it is needed.",,,,FormerlyAutoecious,,,1518159115,t5_2qhe8,t3_7w32tw,t1_dtz3ge0,1,1519075314,0,0,dtz3smy,disability,,,,,

You know whatever higher being ther is or isn't is a complete ass. Like why not make me obsessed with something I actually *could* do.

*Generally, SSA learns of conserved funds when a payee submits an annual or final accounting report.

It sounds like you filed for SSDI, and then later filed for both SSDI and SSI - so the SSDI can be paid way back to the reopened claim, but the SSI can only be paid from the date you filed that new application.

You can't receive both a full SSI payment and a full SSDI payment for the same months retroactively. For example - and this is *very* simplified: 

If you are retroactively, for the same month, due $750 SSI (I'm using made up round numbers here) and $1500 SSDI, you're only going to get the $1500 SSDI. If you're retroactively due $750 SSI and $400 SSDI, you're going to get $400 from SSDI and $350 from SSI. 

So what happens next is... 

1. You begin receiving monthly SSDI payments
2. The SSI unit determines exactly how much you were due for which months retroactively
3. Sends that information to the payment center (PC) in Baltimore, where they are working hundreds of thousands of cases. From there,
4. The PC calculates how much SSDI is due for the retroactive period, and then
5. Subtracts the SSI amount from the SSDI amount, and then 
6. Pays your attorney's fees, before *finally*

Based on the advice above, it sounds like Joe should be fine, but when they do Joe's review, they're going to look at the activity and how much it *should* be worth - if an unimpaired person was doing this *same* work, how much would they be making?

Take your time to recover, don't rush things as it will take a while to adjust. The biggest difficulty I found was balance, as the spine is suddenly so stable! Physical therapy is vital to help this if you find the same! As I said, all the best and look forward to hearing how you're doing afterwards!",,,,InterestingCriticism,,,1518438917,t5_2qhe8,t3_7wokkp,t3_7wokkp,2,1519168165,0,0,du4hjs9,disability,,,,,

897,"We did. granted, we only applied around a year ago, and its in the reconsideration phase. but its just difficult surviving on what little we have now.

899,"Duly noted and definitely appreciated on that end of it. 

My neurologist seems nice enough but she’s hyper focused on the migraines and little else; not at all concerned by any other symptoms— she’d much rather treat those secondary and hope that the Topamax/amatruptalyne fix it. So fingers crossed in that direction.

I do appreciate the guidance. This always seems like a sinking ship.",,,,no-netflix-in-prison,,,1517637327,t5_2qhe8,t3_7uxb8q,t1_dtnxxsv,2,1518882702,0,0,dtnyg5j,disability,,,,,

903,"I should have specified and I’m sorry, the gait bit is in my neurologist’s reports. Not one of my specialists (five) has any sort of consistency. They all seem to contradict one another’s diagnoses which is incredibly frustrating.

So I don’t blame SS; not entirely. I take issue with the “doctor” they sent me to but that’s a sort of here-nor-there situation. For the most part I understand they’re overworked and trying.

904,"It’s actually a bit funny you mention your client; in my chart I have deep tension areflexia and in the very next sentence my gait is normal. It amused me because those two things don’t go together.
