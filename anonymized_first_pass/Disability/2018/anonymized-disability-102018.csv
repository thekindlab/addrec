0,"I applied for ssdi August 2017. I had two denials and got to the Hearing stage. I had hired a representative (not an attorney). She stated that I had very good, thorough records. I think my saving grace was my Pain Management office. I've read social security likes when the applicant attends regular appointments. That creates more of a paper trail. I think there were a few specialists that didn't send records in time for the hearing but I still got approved. They were slightly minor considering my contact with them. My representative's office did have my fiancee write a letter regarding my conditions affecting my life. I never read the letter because I never wanted to influence anything he had to say. Social security also sent me a form to give to a close friend that has witnessed things over time. Again, i never reviewed it. She didn't know much but filled out what she could to the best of her knowledge. As long as you give social security every doc you've seen within, goodness, i think the last 5 to 10 years, they'll hopefully send things in and they'll be thorough. I never did request a copy for myself as I've seen recommended. I've heard it can be good to know that's in there. However, i doubt it would be free.

but progress takes understanding from both sides. the author's suggested approach to the problem is to become so outraged that you act with complete self-righteousness. the issue with this approach to life is that it severely limits a person's ability to understand the people they are in conflict with. once that happens there is almost no potential for compromise or progress.

12,"&gt; Now I'm just even wondering if I will be approved. If they will consider 2012 the begining of my struggles or not


No worries. There are a few very important questions that don’t *predict* approval, but go a long way toward making it more likely. 

First: When were your diagnoses made? Apologies if I missed that somewhere. This is sort of double edged: too recent and they won’t be sure it isn’t controlled, too old and they want to know what suddenly happened and made it worse to the point you can no longer work. Be prepared for that.

Second: what kind of medical records do you have? If it is just monthly doctor’s visits I’d say that you’re on the low end of probability given you’re applying with a mental disorder which is, by all reports, harder to be approved for. If you have a *history* of hospitalizations you are much more likely. Other things like intensive therapies (2+/week? many people go to three sessions a week) including group therapies increase chances. Records showing you’ve been fired from jobs for mental health call-outs (with the corresponding doctors visit to corroborate this) can be used to bolster this.

Third: What sort of therapies and accommodations have you tried? With mental disorders they want to see a history of therapies, various medications, etc. in order to demonstrate that it is something that truly can’t be controlled. If, for example, someone was diagnosed with depression only this year and had just been seeing a therapist, they would have an extremely difficult time showing that they have tried all the possibly effective forms of therapy to control their issues. Just not enough time has passed for them.

Finally: does your doctor support you applying for disability 100% and truly believe that you cannot work and need SSDI to survive?  If you don’t have this, I would honestly reconsider applying at this moment. Typically you want your primary to write a letter to the SSA supporting your application and explaining why you *must* be on disability. That’s a huge portion of the fight, but a doctor who is ambivalent can be overcome with intensive medical records. What will kill you, though, is a doctor who does *not* believe you need SSDI. Since the SSA needs all of your records, they will reach out to your doctors. If your application comes as a surprise to them, or if they don’t support it, they can immediately torpedo it by telling the SSA that they do not believe your case is severe enough to warrant SSDI. Having a doctor who disapproves basically marks your application DOA unless you have *serious* documentation demonstrating otherwise. If your doctor won’t write the letter, I’d wait a year. Find a new doctor, begin seeing them and building a relationship, and in a year ask *them* to write a letter for your application.

You don’t have to respond with your answers, if you don’t want to. These are just things to think about. 


&gt; and what this all means for me if I try to still find work

You might need to stop working if you’re applying — get legal guidance on that. Remember, you’re attesting that you cannot work at all, not that you can’t find the right job. Your SSDI payment will likely be a pittance, it may very well force you into bankruptcy and you’ll *still* have to pay your student loans — it’s generally not the best option if you can really work. 

(By the way, you can call SSA and find out what your payment would be if you were approved. If you haven’t done that yet, you absolutely should. It could be as little as $800/month.)

You can work a little bit once you’ve been granted SSDI, but doing so during the application process is a dangerous game. If it goes to the court they will immediately point to the job you’ve been holding as proof that you can, in fact, work. 

Having to be out of work like that can be the hardest part of the application process.",,False,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1540917081,t5_2qhe8,t3_9son4y,t1_e8qc96h,2,1541635487,0,0,e8qf7i2,disability,,,,,

14,"Airline travel works fairly well, despite all the horrid stories that abound. I can’t walk at all and fly all the time with very few problems. 

Power chairs and manual chairs work a little differently I believe (all my experience is with manual). The gist is, when you make your reservations, there are various accessibility options to notify them of (like, have wheelchair, or can’t walk on to plane). With a manual chair, you gate check it (that means you go all the way to the door of the plane in it, and then right before you board, they take the chair). Power chairs might have to check them earlier. You get from your chair, to a tiny airplane chair. If you need assistance transferring, they can lift you. The employees push the dinky, tiny airport chair down the aisle of the plane to your seat. Then you get in seat. When you get to your destination, you get your chair back. With manuals, you get the back immediately at plane door and on all layovers. Not sure about power chairs.

\- the cable / cable routing / cable is too short - I suppose is possible to get another / longer cable ... ?

\- not enough room on the right - there's room on the handlebars, what ""room"" is needed on the handlebars?

\- there's no way to mount the clutch lever, because there's no mounting system for the clutch lever on the right (what they mean was, you would have to rotate everything upside down, in order to mount it on the right) - I don't get this one, why not use an identical lever with the brake lever ?

The case manager maintains that a decision had been made and the letter is in process. But when I called the 800 number a few days ago they told me a decision had not been made but based on my hearing date I should have an answer by middle of next month and if I didn’t to call them back. When I asked my case manager about this she said they really don’t have access to the same info as the lawyers office has. It’s stressful and frustrating.

I've lived without power for much longer than that myself, but with an infant and a toddler at home, heat and hot water (and, if I'm being honest, Thomas the Tank Engine) is pretty important so we decided to check into a hotel until power was restored.

I'd never checked into a hotel without a reservation before. I thought it was odd when checking in that they didn't ask how long we wanted to stay, but I assumed the person at the front desk knew what they were doing and would just rent us the room until we told them we were checking out.

Big mistake on my part, because the next morning right around checkout time the front desk called our room and asked why we hadn't checked out yet. I explained the situation but they said they had already rented the room to someone else and we had to get out.

We told her we were following the disabled directions to get to the visitor center.

It is awkward for all parties and if she hadn't happened upon us we would have been lost and confused and probably just left.

125,"Hi, glad you beat cancer! This got long sorry, hope it is of some use to you

I have primary lymphedema from an underlying condition, it is not an apples to apples comparison, but if you have any questions about living with lymphedema go for it. I also have personal experience with wheelchairs as I have been stuck in one for the past 21 years because of my leg.

I'm currently a full time student set to graduate with my bachelors in Electrical Engineering next summer. Once I graduate it is estimated I will manage to keep a 70% position (sorry, the wording does not translate well), as I need a minimum of 2 rounds of lymph-massage(? direct translation; lymphdrainage) a week. For me that is usually 90 minutes of therapy, ending in compression-bandaging.

The bandages stay on for at at an average of 6-12 hours depending on my leg.



Some tips;

If you get lymph-massage, make sure they treat your whole body and not just the affected area.

If you dont have it already get measured for compression leggings, and wear them every day. In Europe the main providers are Jobst or Medi 

https://www.jobst.com/

https://www.medi.de/en/

They come in compression classes called elverex from 1 to 4 with sub-classes along the way, eg 3-forte. Talk with your fysiotherapist, they should have experience with measuring and fitting them.

Wash them after use. You can machine wash them, use a wool program (or something similar, low temp, low centrifugation), 40°C, 500 spin, anything you can use on wool you can use on these, no soaps!

Get more then 1 pair, I have 6 pairs in rotation, rotating in 3 new every 6 months and the oldest 3 out.

You have to get on top of both your personal hygiene and cleanliness, with lymphedema you are at an increased risk for infection (especially erysipelas). Myself I have been on antibiotics for the past 15 years because of severe infections.


The edema gets better the healthier you are, if you can try and eat healthy and work out as best you can. I know some people with not too severe secondary-edema who manage to keep it all in check by just general fitness.

It is not unusual for people with edema to have a vitamin-d deficiency, have your doctor check your levels and supplement if needed. This can help more than you think.
 
My last tip is, if you can learn to bandage your affected areas with compression bandages.
I know around here the lymphedema-organisation organizes classes in this.
Make sure you get compression bandages, and not bandages used for burns etc, as they can cause more harm than good. The level of compression you need is entirely up to you, more is better but if it feels bad or wrong, listen to your body and adjust or take it off.

A verry common way to bandage is as follow; A thin stocking or gauze to protect your skin from any irritation, then a layer or two of cotton bandages (these can be re-used) and then a layer of compression bandages. Make sure you throw away these: https://imgur.com/a/UjHw9xd

132,"(For reference, my partner is autistic and another EDSer, and they work. I'm allistic and on SSI. We've been together for 6 years.)

Certainly, if both people have disabilities that make it hard to work there can be financial strain, and there's always stress and anger that comes from dealing with ableism and stuff, which you can bring to the relationship if you're not careful. It can be hard to have someone do carer-type stuff for you if they are also disabled--maybe they can't help you up off the floor, or make high-stress phone calls--but honestly, lots of people caution against having a partner do a bunch of caretaking for one anyway (*if* you have the option, which of course not everyone does). And there's concerns about legal entanglement--marriage, shared finances, etc--affecting SSI/SSDI or other benefits.

I actually love dating another disabled person and would miss it greatly if I didn't, though. Maybe it would be different if I were dating someone who was disabled but not chronically (physically) ill. There are aspects of my mental illness stuff that I think they don't always understand, and I've been a real jerk about autism stuff before I did research or learned the hard way. I just recommend the Golden Rule, I guess. Think about stuff people might have done to you that you like and don't like around disability, because you might make the same mistakes as an abled person if you don't understand their experience.

For me, this means being consent-oriented (don't start ""helping"" before you ask what someone needs and when), being interested in why your partner acts and thinks the way they do, and being respectful.

My heart goes out to you and everyone else in <LOCATION> who could really benefit from this program. I hope that in the future they're able to fund the program again and that you're able to take advantage of this.","[{'start': 567, 'end': 577, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
141,"You don't need a lawyer. But a lawyer can be very helpful to prepare you for the hearing. I had my hearing and was awarded SSDI so I can share some tips that my lawyer helped with and that I learned from the process. 

I was asked about my work history and what jobs I have done, what education I have and what skills I used for my job. Then I was asked about my condition and the physical limitations I was experiencing and how those would impact working. The judge would then ask the vocational expert that was on the phone how many jobs were available that could accommodate all of those things. The vocational expert came back with a couple of jobs that my attorney later told me were the same jobs they always have. 

The judge asked me very specific questions about  my limitations: can I walk to get the mail, do I take a shower every day, can I fix food, take out the trash, take care of the pets, etc. How you answer these questions is very important to think about them very carefully and then answer HONESTLY. I really think people tend to gloss over their suffering and we aren't honest about what we do day to day. 

So when asked if I take care of the pets I said that I scoop out the cat litter but someone else has to take it to the trash for me, I can feed the pets and make sure their water is full. I empty the dishwasher but I have to do it in stages so I do the top, then go sit down and then come back and do the bottom. I can fix dinner but I have to do it in stages so I sit down or lay down in between things. I can't just stand in the kitchen and cook for 30 minutes. 

I don't take a shower every day. I don't have the energy. I explained that I have to take cold showers because of my condition but I also can't stand for long so many times I can't dry off and end up putting on a robe and laying down while still wet. 

I described my day: Wake up, spend about 20 minutes trying to get energy to stand up. Go to the bathroom, comb my hair. Sometimes I don't have the energy so I put on a buff to hold it back. Get dressed then lay down because I don't have the energy. Get up and go in the kitchen to get something for breakfast, usually a protein bar and coffee. Feed the dog. Sit down and rest. Depending on energy maybe go outside and water the plants. I have chairs set out all over the yard so I can sit down with the hose and water plants. Lay down until lunch time where I have cheese and crackers or something else that is easy because I don't have the energy to make food. Take laundry to the laundry room maybe start the machine then lay down. Get clothes from the dryer but lay down and rest before folding them. Etc. Etc. 

Just give a detailed description of your day and how your disability affects your life. I have to drink a lot of water so I would need a job that let me go to the bathroom at least once an hour if not more frequently and let me drink water all day long. I also pass out so I would need a job that let me lay down whenever I felt like I was going to pass out. 

Also, if you can't sit comfortably for the hearing for an hour don't do it. Ask to be accommodated, ask to stand, explain that you have to lay down, etc. The hearing will be recorded so if you are denied because you were able to sit for the entire time an appeal will review the recording and show that you said you had to stand or shift positions because of discomfort. 

Try to write down exactly how your disability affects you and how it is limiting your ability to work. Explain how it affected your ability to work at past jobs and why it is preventing you from living a full life. Can you shop for groceries? Go to  movies? What happens if you try to do those things? Have you driven to a store and had to pull over halfway? Have you had to leave a cart full of groceries? Did you have an anxiety attack on public transportation? 

Make your list then check it off as each thing is addressed at your hearing. 

Now after all of that I would suggest that you focus on getting well and trying to work. At your age and with your work history SSDI will be a small amount and hard to live on. If you are approved, keep trying to get better so you aren't trapped in poverty forever. ",,False,,VROF,,,1540501931,t5_2qhe8,t3_9qms0k,t3_9qms0k,1,1541463309,0,0,e8g7nw4,disability,,,,,

145,"I am an open book!  

I was in my first month of undergrad, and was in school in FL.  I woke up from a party, and my legs felt asleep, tingly and unable to move them.   I also had weakness in my right arm tricep.

I was put in the back of a truck, wheeled up in a computer chair, and dropped off at my dorm.  After 4 more hours of tingling and inability to walk, I called my dad, a physician (OBGYN...lol) and he advised me to go to the hospital.  I was very calm and collected throughout this time.

I rode to an initial hospital where an open MRI revealed edema in my spinal canal c3-c7.  The attending, with tears in her eyes revealed I may never walk again.  That's when I realized how serious things were and shared a few tears.  I was transported to a level 2 trauma center and re-examined.

No sign of blunt force or impact trauma, no infection, and thus diagnosed with bilateral idiopathic paralysis, a rare SCI. I was given high dose glucocorticoid steroids that only spiked my blood sugar levels.  I also got a Foley catheter and released 1.2 liters of urine...I dont think I have ever had to pee that bad... I was then prepped emergency surgery.  My head was shaved and went under for 8 hours while the surgeons perform a laminoplasty.  This cut my c3-c7 vertebrae laminate, and hinged themat a 20 degree angle with plastic plates to create a larger pocket for my spinal cord.

After recovery I woke up I could start to feel the poke of a needle on my big toe, and eventually move it and my feet, and then my legs.  I was in a step down rehab for 3 weeks where I learned how to walk again, and strengthen my nerve damaged right arm. I was up and at them and progressing with therapy, but then things got worse- fast.

I developed a UTI from my catheter, which wasn't changed for 3 weeks.  I was not responding to treatment, and while the culturing was done I became septic, and moved to ICU.

My parents, both medical professionals, I can remember the look on their faces, and their temperament.  They were scared shitless.  They discovered I had a multi-drug resistant pseudomonas infection, and began a rigorous course of treatment.  I was in the hospital a total of 5 weeks.

I went back home in NC, and recovered for 6 months.  Eventually went back to school, and would require another surgery (anterior spinal fusion) requiring another 6 months of healing.  

It hasn't been easy, and I am reminded everyday by the residual pain and nerve damage and muscle weakness, but it has empowered me to become who I am today.  I  turned my adversity into an opportunity to help others, I studied biomedical engineering and now run my own medical device company.

We met in 1991 and she was diagnosed back in 1984. We dated for 8 years before we married in 1999.

She had no signs of it but as the years went on, it progressed to where she can barely walk and needs a transport wheelchair to get across any long distance.

Back in December I had a foot amputation and now we are both disabled.

My wife used to work up until 1997 and she had to stop driving because of her M.S. - her legs would randomly go stiff and you can imagine that would be bad in the middle of driving.

Before my foot amp, I just wheeled her to the car and helped her in, load her chair and reverse the process wherever we went - shopping, eating, baseball games, etc.

We tried to live as normal a life as we could within her limitations.

After I became disabled, I could not drive (still can't yet) so we depend on others 100% to get anywhere right now.

I think it brings you closer as long as you understand each others limitations and work to compromise what you can and can't do and take a lot of time to laugh about it. I am not kidding. We laugh and joke and make fun of ourselves all we can. Its funny  to see us at a baseball game, I am in my chair behind her pushing her in her chair to our seats - lol.

Life it too short to get hung up on what you can't do. Communicate a lot. I always ask her if I can do anything for her and I do what I can within my limits and she knows that and she does the same.

And a transfer they have to organize for you would save you from having to apply for jobs yourself.

I'm sorry, but the SCI/neuro ward with all the lifting/turning/transferring (picking up from the floor-ing)  of patients seems pretty incompatible with your own current physical issues. 

Maybe lungs or dermatology or pediatric or something would work better, with some breaks in the 12 hour shifts! Or  retrain to do lab work/ take blood? or do that for 6 of the 12 hours, and see if a 6 hour neuro shift works better?

Generally, the best way to do it is have both parents agree which one will be the rep payee. In those situations, there is communication, and both parents set it up so there isn’t hostility about the SSA benefits. 

Once in a while, though, the two parents with joint custody can’t come to an agreement. The most common ways of dealing with these rare occasions is to appoint a payee agency or have the parents decide on a type of schedule for when one is the payee and then the other is the payee. Neither of these options is really good for anyone, and both parents spend a lot of time and money on this instead of just working together on it.

Since you are doing your bowel program daily, I don't think shifting it to the evening will cause any adverse accidents. If you are really that concerned then do as IQBoosterShot suggested. Eat lighter or fast for the day. That's what I've had to do if my routine doesn't go good or I'm feeling constipated.

However you really should get a better handle of your bowel program. During those 4 hours do you go a lot or very little? My thinking is it's taking long because you are trying to force movement when there is nothing there. Try doing your routine every other day. Within time your body should adjust and you'll see better results.

Yeah I know I did not get a lawyer until they denied me the first time. Also The monthly amount will be factored by how much you paid into the system. I have heard of some people getting as little as $700.00 a month. I get just over 1600.00 a month. and I have heard of some people getting more. Also my youngest daughter was about 16 yrs old when I was approved and she also got a check from SSDI for around $700.00 for being my underage child. She stopped getting the check when she graduated high school at age of 19. She would have still got it if she would have gone to college.

So things that were in your electric file now have to be printed out and put in a paper folder, along with everything else. The only person you can talk to who can see what's going on is the person who has the folder and is working on it. Provisional payments should be easy, but those have to be processed manually through the payment centers, which are so far behind they can't even keep up with normal stuff much less EXR's, plus the field office can't communicate with them to try to get things done faster. So then you're stuck waiting to see if the CDR comes back with a medical approval and getting the record back in pay, trying to set up provisional payments, or setting up a critical payment because those actually work to get a check out to a claimant. But you're not supposed to do a CPS during the provisional payment period so you're back to square one. They suck, everyone hates doing them, everybody knows the EXR processing system is fucked and needs fixing, but the agency is too busy putting out the bigger fires caused by decades of neglect and politics to pay attention to the relatively small one that is EXRs.

323,"So, one bit of advice: do not write in the booklet they give you, but instead write a document separately. 

I used a word document, and broke it down into the individual questions. From there, I broke it down by diagnosis. From there, I broke it down by symptom. I even used a bullet point system to start with, because it was easier. 

So, here’s the annoying part: it’s really repetitive. I had a system that essentially required a copy and paste regarding my diagnosis, symptom, effects, and consequences. So, for example...“I cannot lift because I have chronic pain. Chronic pain is caused by this. It means this. It effects these joints/limbs/etc. If I am having a good day, I can achieve this much. If I am having a bad day I can achieve this much. No matter what kind of day I am having, if I did partake in this activity then the consequences would be this.”

In the above example, I’ve used one symptom. I’ve not even touched on dislocations, or the plethora of other diagnoses or symptoms associated with them. 

Take it one step at a time. There isn’t a rush. They will back date all of the funding from the moment you say you’re applying, so there’s no worry on that front.  Similarly, if you don’t like the idea of going to an assessor or you can’t get to one, make them come to you. Let them see you for you, and not as a number on their list to just go through the motions with. You’re more than a number. ❤️

I’d be more than happy to share my rather extensive document that I sent through to PIP for my reassessment if you’d like? It’s lengthy, I had to appeal after it and won, but it’s something to go by.

Four hours is too long for a bowel movement, particularly when done daily. I'm sure that others will share their experiences and perhaps better tips. Good luck and best wishes.","[{'start': 984, 'end': 994, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

387,"It’s a hard thing to wrestle with, and we’ve all been there. You’re in good company here. 

My personal theory on it (largely related to new physical disabilities, but it may help) is that you must treat this as both a death and a birth. You are beginning a new life — one that allows you to take better care of yourself, to not stress yourself to the point of breaking down — and there is a lot that comes with that. Look forward to those things.

But you’re also ending your previous life. You have to mourn that in order to come to grips with the fact that it’s gone. You can be sad that it’s over, and the pangs of loss will come and go over the years. 

I’ve talked to loads of people over the years, and it almost always follows this. The people who are able to embrace their new life — to enjoy the new freedoms and luxuries it affords, and to find new things they enjoy — are the happy ones. Those who cant mourn and move past their former lives have problems living their new lives.

———

This is the more practical information I have for you: you need a new bank account.

If you have a substantial amount of debt (as you said) it may come to a point where you are forced to file for bankruptcy (very likely if SSDI will be your only income). When you do, they will take what money you have, beyond some set exemptions, to cover your debts. In *practice*, this often includes people’s SSDI that they have saved. 

Technically your SSDI income is supposed to be exempt, and it can’t be garnished by anyone but the federal government (student loans — I learned that the hard way). However, *in reality*, if you mix your disability funding with non-disability dollars, all the mixed money becomes fair game. Because of this your previous SSDI can be taken away. You protect yourself from this by opening a new bank account that *never* receives any deposits other than SSDI, and then set up an automatic transfer to move that money into your spending account.

I can’t explain the legal intricacies of this, but I’ve been through it. Two bankruptcy attorneys agreed, my disability lawyer agreed, and an attorney who specializes in creating trusts for disabled artists all agreed that this is how it works. So protect yourself, and make sure that your application contains an account number for a *brand new* account.

Good luck with everything. It’s a hard and exhausting process, but it’s a relief when it’s over. ",,False,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1540913792,t5_2qhe8,t3_9son4y,t3_9son4y,2,1541633559,0,0,e8qb2li,disability,,,,,

A few of the first questions that popped into my head:

-Is it intended to be used while the user is in their chair? Or is it to make transferring to the ground/sleeping bag easier?

-Is it intended primarily for manual wheelchair users, or also power chair users?

It’s better to make something that works great for a smaller group than struggling to make a one-size-fits-all kind of solution. Happy to give more feedback or ideas if you’re looking for that kinda thing. Good luck with the project!

390,"I don’t know that you want my opinion, but if it were me or my kid, I would wait to apply. I know it’s hard, but with several years lacking a medical record to them it will *look like* you’ve been doing fine health wise, and just quitting jobs because you don’t like them/don’t want to work. Especially since it sounds like you’re saying that all the major health events you’ve had were before graduating high school and/or at least 6 years ago.

I know that’s a hard thing to hear, and worse to do, but I think you’re risking your future if you apply now. I don’t know what it works like when there are *no* medical records, but generally speaking when you have been denied once your next application has to demonstrate you have gotten *substantively* worse. Which, of course, would be impossible without medical records. 

Without a doctor to fall back on, I assume you still don’t have regular medications? If so, that is going to be another severe strike against you. Remember, the federal government does not view MMJ as medication. It will appear as though you’ve been handling day-to-day life just fine without even needing any medications to do so.

You won’t have a doctor to support your application, which can be enough to sink an application on its own. 

*Edit: That all goes back to being able to prove that your disorders cannot be controlled by therapy and medication, which is hard to prove without records and when it hasn’t been tried recently.*

If you do go ahead and apply, you are almost certainly going to be denied twice and head to the ALJ. It will take you 2-3 years to get to the ALJ (18 months in some pilot program states). There you’ll need a lawyer or you will frankly be wasting your time. Most importantly, I don’t know that you will be able to find a lawyer who will take your case without medical records, as they often send people to a *second* doctor just to get corroborating medical records. 

I know that all sucks.  The name of the game here is proof, though, and proof means medical records. If you don’t have them, you are likely just spinning your wheels could severely impact your later payments by not working now.

Of course, I’m not on the inside of this. There could be things you don’t feel like sharing. If you’ve been on 72+ hour holds several times a year since 2012, increasing in frequency over the last 18 months, that would definitely change the math — but it would do so because the hospitals keep those medical records, and you can get copies from them.

You should try to verify and corroborate everything I’m telling you, of course, and if you strongly believe they only way you can survive is by filing then by all means do so.

My other advice would be to go talk to a lawyer right now. Only go to a local lawyer (some will consult by phone), do *not* use the national numbers. Ask for their opinion, and ask if they would be willing to represent you. They will absolutely be honest with you, and if they decline to represent you then your chances are very low. For an attorney, even iffy cases are a good bet because it’s a large payout for minimal work. If they are open to new clients in the first place, then they will generally only decline the lowest-probability cases.

If it were me, given what you have said here, I wouldn’t apply now. *Maybe* if I already had an attorney committed to ensuring I win.

I know that’s hard to hear, and I’m sorry for that. I would suggest making an immediate appointment with an attorney and bringing all the records you *do* have.

Yes, afaik it's standard procedure to do albuterol (or saline, and surely others types) as much as possible for almost any/all respiratory patient... Supposedly it ""helps clear mucus,"" but I've personally found it *creates* mucus, and overly thin mucus that can be hard to suction. Of course, since you end up coughing/suctioning afterwards, it helps reinforce the (mis)belief of ""well if it's there *now* then you must've had something in there *before*.""

...I have unusual, strong feelings about how stupid that specific guideline is, although I would *never* deny/argue that if you feel you need it, you should use it! And I have other strong feelings about the paranoia surrounding vent care, most of which make sense in a hospital setting but little sense in a home setting. To be fair, many of my feelings stem from being trached as a toddler and being semi-ambulatory (like, barely so), and growing up with parents who, while they kept me very healthy, did not at all put me in a bubble of sterility and let me play in dirt and whatnot, so I'm pretty laissez-faire about my trach. Due to growing up with *truly incompetent* in-home nursing, I decided upon turning 18 that I won't rely on nursing anymore at all, since I can do most of my own care and dictate the stuff I can't do like changing circuits or lifting it, etc. Reading the manual is great! I've read my vent's manual more often than some of the RTs I've met, too; I am not shy about changing settings, and they are not going to stop me xD

I know it's different for people trached as adults... But, either way, it quickly becomes obvious that the medical professionals are somehow *still* completely unprepared for long-term, home vent patients (like, fuck, I've heard of doctors *outright refusing* to try a cuffless / deflated cuff, some not even mentioning to the patient that cuffless and/or trached/vent speech is possible, not administering a swallow test, just the attitude of ""nope never done it, it's 100% unsafe 'cause I say so""!).

Anyway, yeah, the misconception with trachs is that they always need to be cuffed (or, rather, the cuff inflated), or else you have subpar ventilation.

I don't think specific settings matter too much because everyone is different... But I'm afraid I can't say anything in regards to pressure support vs. volume control; I know  pressure support isn't common, and it's *certainly* not required for speech.

I'm unsure how they do the process nowadays, to be honest. I think it's weird that they switched pressure control, especially if it wasn't his normal nor played with beforehand, as that kind of change to his breathing sounds like setting him up for failure. If you start the process... You may find he'll be quiet and/or raspy, especially at first. You *may* find that you need to set the volume setting up a little higher for easier/louder speech; my daytime volume is about 30 higher than my nighttime volume, actually. The speaking valve (brand name is Passy-Muir, if you don't know) is great if he can tolerate it, but it's okay if he doesn't or if he has to work up to it. I can't tolerate it so, while my speech is usually consistent in volume, it's ""broken up"" in that I need to talk as the vent gives me a breath (so, rough example, my inspiration time is 1.0 seconds, thus I have roughly, oh, 1.5 seconds to say stuff).

I *think* I saw one guy speaking *between* breaths in a video, once, so my way may actually be inefficient; it's just hard to change after 25+ years xD I've heard of some people leaving a very small amount of air in the cuff, too, but leaving it down enough to provide air to talk.

580,"In order to honor my family member's wish to remain at home during recovery after a stroke, trach and ventilator dependence, I was trained and checked out by 6 different respiratory therapists at 2 different facilities before the hospital would release the patient to home care.  I also had to have 2-3 caregivers checked out with the same training.  I directly worked with the patient's pulmonologist and R/Ts for about 2 years.

I was the only person who knew how to set the alarms properly so that only important events caused alarms, instead of minor coughs causing alarms all night and day.

&amp;#x200B;

**As for SSI, Medicaid and Medicare:**

I'm on SSI, SSDI, Medicaid and Medicare. I became disabled as a child -- LGMD2A started manifesting in my teens. I was able to go on my mother's work record for SSDI and in turn get Medicare. SSI and Medicaid is supplemental, meaning that it's for low-income individuals only. I make about $760, give-or-take a few dollars, every month. The two insurances cover everything for my care -- and since my disability is progressive I'll need to keep the health insurance. When married, the maximum amount of money two individuals can make TOGETHER is $1125 -- anything above that you can kiss all Social Security benefits goodbye. He'll lose his health insurance and supplemental income. If he's on SSDI as a child beneficiary he'll also lose Medicare and the income from that. Once you become married you become responsible financially for your disabled spouse. Most of us on SSI and Medicaid don't get married -- there is no federal protection to make sure that we're cared for. Individuals who do become married and their spouse becomes disabled who require long-term care with not-enough work credits get divorced so the disabled spouse can be cared for. There is no marriage equality or ability for us who are permanently disabled unless we marry a financially secure spouse with extensive health insurance coverage. I highly recommend individuals who are covered by the SSA (unless on their own work-credits) not get married. 

That being said, being in a committed relationship is about as much as we can do unless our spouse is financially secure. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. I'll answer what I can.",,False,,clutchqween,LGMD2A,,1538750227,t5_2qhe8,t3_9l8dnf,t1_e7646tt,2,1540714298,0,0,e77t5e6,disability,,,,,

713,"I am disabled and my main barrier has been my health. I've been bedridden for 4 years, using a wheelchair to get around, and it's been pretty impossible to work like that. Most days I was too sick to leave the house even with the chair. 

Another barrier was that when I got sick, I lived in a trailer park outside if the bus service area. I had stairs at both entrances to our trailer, no bus nearby, outside of the area for dial-a-lift, and there were no non-profit orgsbor otherwise that provided rides places. 

Some churches had limited service for seniors, but not young disabled people like me. Also I'm trans and that can cause problems with religiously affiliated services. 

Even if I was in the area for Dial-a-lift, they aren't very reliable. You have to give them a range of 1-2 hours and you'll get transported somewhere in there. They're also often late. Not really appropriate for job transportation.

Barriers I've had yo getting healthier are that my spouse works full time in 10hr shifts and I am too sick to cook for myself most days. If I don't get nutrition, how can I get better? When you're chronically ill, you can't roll with hunger or sleeplessness the way a healthy person can. 

Even while completely bedridden, I didn't qualify for any in home care or even a chore service. So everything just goes to hell. Now that I'm well enough to walk short distances, there's so much to catch up on that I'm drowning in it.

But it's hard to get work after a long gap and so it's a temp job. But temp jobs don't come with the benefits of even part time work. I have no sick leave. Default breaks and lunches aren't long enough for me to recover. The job is also more physical than was stated in the interview.

I'm lucky in that my boss is willing to give me leeway, like longer breaks and setting my own hours. (It's project based so it doesn't matter what days I come in just that I do the work.) But the structure of the workforce in general is difficult and he can only do so much or else he'll get in trouble with his bosses. 

I originally went to Disability Vocational Rehabilitation Services to get a job, but they took months to get back to me because they're flooded with work. I ended up getting this job on my own, and asked to be assigned a job coach to teach me how to ask for accommodations and such. But again, it's been months and I haven't heard back. 

My license was taken from me when I went to renew it in my wheelchair, so I bus to work. Luckily, my job has a bus stop right outside. But many bus stops I need to use don't have seats, they're just a poll. And I can't stand for long periods of time without losing consciousness. Also, there aren't crosswalks for every bus stop, requiring one to walk half a mile or more to the nearest crossing and back or risk getting hit jaywalking.

  Phantom pain is at it's absolute worst right after the surgery.  When my right leg was amputated, I described the pain I felt for roughly three weeks to be like a couple rabid dogs tearing at my calf all day.  That's not to mention the spikes of pain that'll feel like a bone breaking or being stabbed with white hot pokers, etc.

  I'm not telling you this to scare you or her, if it's gotta go, it's gotta go.  I'm just trying to drive home that attempting to tough out that level of pain is a fools errand.

To get an accommodation (a change in how, when, or where a job is performed) to allow a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of a job, an interactive process (a give and take of communication and information) between the employee and management must occur.

Fwiw regardless of disability or not, people have the exact same problem you are describing. Which isn't helpful I realize.

As far as addressing not being able to drive, I will admit if someone says ""I don't drive"" I do think they are funny-odd, not funny-haha. When I don't think it's odd, it's when they something like, ""I can't drive for medical reasons."" I back the fuck off with my judgy mcjudgerson and am a bit more empathetic about it.

Dating profile online: if you haven't done so already, I'd ask a friend that you trust and is good at reading comprehension to take a look at your profile and rewrite it. Sometimes it takes a little outside perspective to get the matches you're looking for.

For instance: I'm a lady type and I read comic books. I put that on my dating profile and I kept getting matched with people who look like they never see the sun willingly nor could talk to me like I was a human. I changed things around and mentioned comic books without emphasizing them and ended up getting matched with people who I would get along with and similar sense of humor, etc.

If the pictures you're putting on the website look like what you gave us, you need pictures of you out and wearing something other than an undershirt. �� You like video games? Maybe you've been to a comicon, post a picture from that. Dinner with friends? What a good time to take a not-blurry photo. Some group photos, some of just you.

I'm sorry I can't be of more help when it comes to addressing the disability other than wording things on your profile. Suggestion: ""I have a brain thing that makes me wobbly at times so I don't have a car, but let me tell you, I have some great Uber stories."" No specifics while conveying up front. That shows you're social, you go out regardless of limitation, and you're self-sufficient. Oh and you have a disability as a side note. Woohoo.

924,"They have a numbing gel you can ask for if you need it; they put it on a cotton roll and right on the area of the gum where they put the anaesthetic in so you don't feel the needle as much. It still stings a tiny bit as it's going in, but it's like having blood taken. A moment of pain and pressure and it's over.

If you've never had blood taken they say 'sharp scratch' and it's like someone pinching you, hard. If you've had anything pierced it's like that. You feel a sting that can make your eyes water then a bit of pressure, but as long as you remember to breathe in and out you're just fine and it's gone in a minute, tops. I need two injections which is unusual so for most people it's probably 30 secs, tops. A lot of the time it's 10 secs. I tend to forget and hold my breath (sensory shit) so my dentist reminds me to breathe in and out which is helpful. You could always ask for that. 

Additionally I have issues with certain dental techniques due to PTSD which can trigger hallucinations and send my BP skyrocketing. We work through this by me bringing my big noise cancelling headphones and plugging in some good tunes. I keep them off for the initial anaesthesia bit so I can hear the dentist but once it's kicked in and they're working away all I get is a vague sensation of pressure and mumbling noises as the dentist and hygenist chat. Works a treat. If I have any issues I just hold up my hand but in the last ~15 appointments or so I've never needed to use it and I've had root canals and extractions. 

Take a list of your current medication and health problems and anything you think will be an issue. When you get/make your first appointment, ask if you can meet for ten minutes beforehand or that they leave time in your appointment to chat about your issues and meet your dentist and nurse. They're aware people are anxious and mine is happy to explain what's happening in whatever detail you need. From 'right, today we're doing x and I'm going to use y and z instruments, would you like me to explain as I do each bit?' to 'Hi there Raargh, you're here for some dental work so why don't you lie back and I'll tell you nothing until it's all done'.   

I have extensive dental issues due to long term poor physical health. I ignored it because dentists had been such a nightmare and I avoided them for years which, shocker, made things worse. The special needs guys (we call them the PDS here) are really good and I've got a ton of work done I've been avoiding for a very long time. My dental health is so much better and my overall anxiety around dentists has improved tons. I'd also recommend speaking to your dentist about a special needs hygienist as they can help you need the dentist less often! Mine puts a coating on some teeth and I have prescription flouride from my dentist to help keep further problems to a minimum.

944,"(Sorry, TLDR at bottom) 
There is far to large of a range of chronic illnesses to just lump them all into disabling or not disabling. By definition a chronic illness is a disease that persists for a long time. A chronic disease is one lasting 3 months or more, by the definition of the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Chronic diseases generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication, nor do they just disappear. I can’t find the study but I remember reading that something like 80% of people have at least one chronic disease by the time they reach 65 (or something like that). 

A few examples of what are considered chronic illnesses: Alzheimer’s, Diabetes, Heart Disease, HIV, Parkinson’s, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Schizophrenia.  Just from this tiny fraction of this list you can see that you can’t base a persons level of disability on the diagnosis alone. One person with diabetes can live a totally normal life. Yes, they need to monitor sugar levels, insulin, etc., but in general day to day life they are not disabled in the sense that they can’t care for themselves, work, etc. Other folks with diabetes may have a much more difficult time of it and be 100% disabled.

963,"I was denied and it took two years to get a hearing then another month to get a decision that was fully favorable. 

I had a lot of doctor's notes that supported my disability and a month before my hearing I was hospitalized overnight. I'm convinced that was important. For some reason they ask about hospitalizations. 

A key in the hearing is to be honest about your condition. For this I mean describe a typical day, and don't pick a good one, pick one that clearly shows your limitations. For me that was something like: wake up, wait around 20 minutes until feel well enough to stand up, go to the bathroom, skip shower because no energy for that, have breakfast, something like a muffin or cereal bar with coffee because no energy to make food. Lay down and rest until feel well enough to get up and try a shower. Finish shower but no energy to dry off, so use a robe and lay down until feel well enough to get dressed. Make lunch, something quick. Etc. etc. 

I was asked in my hearing if I can take out the trash, make meals, get the mail, do laundry, care for pets, how often I shower, etc. Whenever I answered I always included the accommodations I use to do those tasks. I scoop the litter box, but someone else takes it to the trash, I can make dinner in steps, I have to rest and sometimes food gets burned. I empty the dishwasher and lay down throughout the process, I can't walk to get the mail, etc. Always remember to mention and describe your limitations and how they are caused by your disability. Remember to include EVERYTHING that is contributing to your disability, not just the main medical diagnoses. 

My lawyer told me a story about someone who wasn't able to sit through the whole hearing so he asked the judge if he could stand up and change positions. He was denied and the judge said it was because he could sit comfortably for an hour. They filed an appeal and a review of the audio recording of the hearing showed he had asked to change positions because he was uncomfortable. So if you can't sit for an hour, DON'T force yourself to do it just to avoid problems. You need to show and tell the judge exactly why you are unable to work. 

If you have to drink a lot of water mention that you will need access to a bathroom at least once an hour and you need to be able to drink water. If you need to lie down mention that you will be required to do that throughout the day. Describe the work environment you would need in order to work at a job.

1030,"Agree with /u/_agent_perk to ask about a kitty who likes being indoors and who is unlikely to get under your wheels. This is likely to be an elderly and more experienced cat. I'm personally not a fan of outdoor cats in general, there are too many weirdos out there and with a decent sized home and toys you can keep an indoor cat happy and safe. If you're able to do minimal daily walks, an older or lazier dog may be an option, particularly if they have a good training history. If you'd be open to a dog, look at an ex-service companion as they are used to people with disabilities. Be very honest with the rescue/shelter about your needs, there's nothing worse than taking an animal home, them being a bad fit for your life and having to go back. 

Going outside past you should not be the major issue, rather their training and getting under your wheels in the house. You can train most animals to stay in an indoor room while you leave the house, though of course this depends on your home setup. Training them to stay away from under your wheels when you are indoors doing everyday tasks is much harder and more down to individual personality. 

I have free range rabbits and use a manual chair, but would not suggest them to someone without experience and definitely not without good chair control. While most rabbits will get the fuck out of your way without prompting, I currently have a bun who loves to sit/run under my chair and it is a safety risk. She runs towards the front door whenever someone knocks/I leave but I deal with this by shutting her into a further back room with food while I fully open the front door. What I can't stop is her running after me and under my chair whenever I go across a room. I've had to adapt my push and general movement style to cope with that as I can't step over her and she won't get out of my way. Particularly a problem when you are tired/drunk/on new meds and not 100% aware of where their paws are.

There are difficulties with some basic care tasks like nail clipping and grooming; I am lucky enough to have good upper body strength and reasonable fine motor control but mostly a lot of practice before I gained my disability. You can train them to come to you for food with some tasks but if you do this too often they'll catch on and no longer respond. If you can rely on and afford your vet for basic grooming tasks this makes it easier but consider how you will get to your vet, both standard and emergency. Think about your home in general - if an animal runs behind a sofa, on top of a table, into a cupboard...will you be able to catch them? If they were bleeding or presenting with neuro symptoms, would you be able to grab them to get into a carrier and to a vet? I currently have a Continental rabbit who can jump far higher than I can reach, what would your plan be in that scenario?

Depending on your disability also be aware of the risks when an animal jumps up on you. For some people an animal with claws, no matter how well meaning, can result in injury which is an issue with poor wound healing. I have thigh scratches that are still healing from several months ago. Cats particularly carry toxoplasmosis which is risky for immunocompromised individuals.

Have you thought about smaller animals? Guinea pigs can be very pettable dependent on individual personality.

Sorry to hear about your blindness. I simply can't imagine that huge challenge. I'm stuck on disability home alone because I've got fibromyalgia.

I'm sure I've had fibro since a child but it is only as I've got older, m52 btw, has it totally wrecked my life.

I gave up all coding about 5 years ago as fibromyalgia was just destroying my brain's ability to think, to focus. I think only people who have done some programming understand that buzz we get when it works. I miss that.

Anyways, I'm sitting here taking a break from re-watching Sons of Anarchy, and sometimes I just get so depressed about my life I just wish a bloody airplane would crash out the sky. I've been fighting depression for 30 years and sadly it does not get any easier.

About hobbies, well all my hobbies used to be based around adrenaline but now I try to avoid any excitement as it makes my fibro worse. Just in the last few years I've come to really enjoy gardening as it is amazing the way plants grow and thrive with just a little bit of care and attention. I don't know if you have a garden. I'm lucky to have a tiny garden and that is slowly becoming my hobby.

When I was a kid, one of my friend's much older brother was blind. He was 25 ish. He had a little workshop and he used to build model boats. It was just incredible to watch him take sheets of balsa wood and turn them into a proper working scale boat.

He'd stick model real engines and remote control gear into the boats and sell them.

When trying to find a doctor you might want to start with a psychiatrist, they are mental health professionals that specialize in diagnosis and can prescribe medicine if it's indicated. If you have choices (lots of practitioners) look at reviews on Google. 

When you call you should ask if they are accepting new patients. The first thing a doctor's office wants to know is if you have insurance, and what company, group number and/or member number. Many doctors work in an insurance network and charge more if you are not part of that network.

If you don't have insurance, most towns have a clinic with a sliding scale fee system, which comes out to almost nothing or free when you don't have an income. They will ask you what you want to be seen for, and you should tell them your issues and mention that you haven't seen a doctor and haven't left the house. Chances are that you will have to see a general practitioner first and be referred to a psychiatrist, but not necessarily.

You could have a learning disability at the heart of your problems. There are also medications that can really help.

1304,"Doing in-home interviews is a terrible idea for a variety of obvious reasons. A lot of things can be done over the phone, and online services are also available for a lot of things. The problem is, the nature of Social Security requires in-person interactions but thanks to Congress the agency has been destroying field offices for the last 20 years. Closing, consolidating, understaffing, etc. The reason there's a line of 44 people standing in the cold is because there aren't enough workers inside to get them taken care of ""promptly"" if they show up later in the day. 

Right now, SSA is trying to replace field offices with large teleservice centers and central processing offices that handle online claims. They're trying to force claimants to rely on lawyers and financial advisors and community organizations to do what should be getting done in the field office. They're cost shifting SSA work and costs to the beneficiaries, channeling massive amounts of taxpayer money to third parties, and screwing over their own workers, all in the name of appearing more ""cost efficient"" due to not having a budget from Congress for the last 22 years. 

If you want to see the future of SSA, look at the IRS. For that matter, try contacting the IRS. They have maybe a handful of offices left you can visit, phone wait times are hours long, and when you do talk to them you get pushed to do things online or through an accountant. If things continue like they are now, eventually people will be getting degrees in social security and charging you 25 percent of your retirement benefits to help you fill out forms for benefits that nobody can understand without a degree.

He has a decent job with health insurance and a huge house. He is married to his beautiful wife who also works a decent job and makes great money. They have two young kids. ""<PERSON>"" hates his job and wishes his life was different daily. Him and his wife are in a shit ton of debt because his kids go to a $10,000 private school per kid, they go on vacation 2x a year, they buy whatever the kids want, they always eat out due to the kids being picky eaters, and they have two cars they make payments on that cost more than my rent. 

So while you feel like less of an adult. Remember that those 'adults' aren't always better off. 

Being an adult is what you make it out to be. I am 25 and I am an adult. My biological father is 52 and he is not an adult. He is a child. And not someone I want in my life.

1360,"&gt; I also found recently that some of the school run mums have been saying things amongst themselves about my daughter having one.

Nothing, and I mean nothing, pisses me off more quickly than parents of able-bodied children whining and bitching about disabled children and their families. I can distinctly remember this happening to me in school as well. We were given permission to park right at the entrance at the school so that my mum would have enough space to unload me and my wheelchair - other people had to park a 2 minute walk away. The amount of bitching and comments I'd hear from them as they walked right by us was unbelievable. I remember my mum always stressed out, trying to get it all done as quickly as possible so as to avoid as many people walking by as possible. I could not understand why these people weren't just grateful their children could walk. That instilled in me a seething dislike of the entitlement that many, many parents display. 

And it doesn't stop there. No no no. They bitch every time an accommodation is made for the disabled child, every time the school decides to organize a trip or school event differently so that the disabled child can attend, every time the disabled child does better than their own children on a school test. Some of the worst bullying I experienced in school was actually from parents acting through their children than the actual children themselves being bullies. My mum said X about you, my mum said Y about you etc. 

My advice? Confront it head on when you are able to because their behaviour needs correcting. You don't necessarily have to be aggressive about it (although you have every right to tell them to shut their faces if you want to go down that route), you could for example just speak openly about your daughter's disability and what it means for her so that maybe they can wrap their tiny skulls around why she needs it. You don't owe them an explanation but it may curb their enthusiasm for reckless bitching to each other about a child.

1375,"Thank you so much for writing this. I don't know why, but I just wasn't prepared for this side of having a child with disabilities.

The points you raised, are something that really bother me; when my daughter overhears the comments. She was issued the badge on grounds of her mobility only, but she does have other issues too, including global developmental delay, severe dyspraxia and learning difficulties etc 
Despite that fact that I used to push her to school in a disability buggy before I got a car, and her gait is laboured her other difficulties means that she can come across as 'naughty', and the school run mums seems to be under the impression she has it because she's naughty, so they don't understand that it's physical also.

Her little sister was at the preschool in the school grounds and one little girl said to my younger daughter that her mummy didn't like her sister (7yo) because she was weird and different. Unfortunately 7 yo overheard this exchange and my younger daughter was very upset by this too.
7 yo can't grasp why people say these things, and it knocks her already rock bottom self esteem and causes her more anxiety.

A lot of the mums don't say these things within my earshot, or I might be inclined to educate them, but I've seen them looking and then hear from someone else what's being said.

I just assumed people would understand that she needs extra help and not really bother themselves over it, but some seem to think it's preferential treatment over their own kids that she has a 1 to 1 teacher to help her physically and with her work, and other adaptations they school have made for her.

I probably don't help myself because I'm intensely private and I don't talk freely in public about my daughters needs, physical or otherwise because it's not their business and if my daughter is present, she gets upset.

How sad for them and for society that those are the values they are passing down to their children.

I hope with time that things get easier. And, as your kids get older and more able to express themselves, that you find ways to be able to make these people reflect on their hideous self-importance.

Idk, maybe there's about the puppet string leg analogy that doesn't ""work the same way"" with a wheelchair.

1487,"I would if I had no other choice, but not if I had any other means of doing it by myself. It would have to have a way to *immediately* shut down, and a way to control it somehow. I'm in my own powerchair for most things, so not having that, for me, is creating somewhat of a barrier in my thinking; the answer might very well be different for those who don't rely on it so much, or can't reliably operate their chair independently. I can imagine, say, someone who has severe muscle spasms/tremors choosing this option, but not someone with muscle control.

Another problem that came into my mind, it's that the program and such would likely not factor in anything personal. Many of us rely on, say, proper positioning of the chair to transfer, or make a judgement on when/where to be less (or more, if you're that type) ""intrusive."" There's a lot of unconscious thinking that goes into me driving my chair, like where I take up space and predicting how others are moving around me and how I can most effectively communicate and guessing how far something is away from me, that anything autonomous would likely make into a hindrance. I don't like my chair away from me because that means I can't transfer or ""walk"" away, so anything like that is out completely (""wheelchair, go charge"" would be a strict no, unless it engages something rather than moves something). 

But FWIW, I am open to automating things I can't do, or can't afford to do, which makes me (personally) interested in self-driving cars. To my thinking, it's unlikely I'll ever afford a modified car, so relying on a machine over a human doesn't matter much to me. But you don't often stop to have a chat or try to position yourself *just right* in a car (I mean, obvious exceptions like parking) so it feels less like an intrusion.

- quit your job and you can. But it's not at all as fun as you seem to think it is. (I'm sure she'll complain about the need for money. Remind her that you can't work either if you have to rest and sleep this much and that, yes, not being able to work and not earning money sucks too)

- explain the difference between wanting to rest and having to rest. One is to physically recover. The other is because you physically can not continue. One means you have a choice. The others means you don't. And no matter what your plans were, you'll have to cancel them. 

- ask her if she would say the same to someone who's tired from chemo. Just because in your case the cause hasn't been found yet doesn't mean it's not just as real (and again, it's not by choice, it's because you have no other option)

- If you're both free a full the weekend have her actually do it. But realistically and 2 full days. Which means only getting up for bathroom breaks (healthy person will get restless and annoyed well before those 2 days are up. And make sure to remind her during that time that there is no exercise, no going out with friends, cooking your own meals is limited to anything that won't take longer than 10 minutes etc. Just laying down and resting is super boring!

Public Law 93-112, Section 504, requires “that no individual, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participating in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance” and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires a LEA to provide non-academic and extracurricular services and activities in a manner necessary to afford children with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in those services and activities. The LEA shall provide transportation services to implement any Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) for a student with a disability whose residence falls within the jurisdiction of the LEA, as defined in Bulletin 1706, Regulations for Implementation of the Children with Exceptionalities Act. The LEA must incur the cost of providing services and specialized equipment.


B.​All students with disabilities (regardless of age) are eligible for free appropriate public education (FAPE). Facilities, services and activities provided to students with disabilities must be comparable with those provided to non-disabled student, and students with these disabilities must have an equal opportunity for participation in any non-academic and extracurricular services and activities provided by an LEA.

C.​LEAs must provide transportation services in such a manner to afford students with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in those services.

D.​LEA personnel involved in transporting students must be knowledgeable with the laws and regulations required for transporting students with disabilities.

E.​LEA transportation staff must work closely with LEA personnel to ensure that services meet or exceed those required by law and current BESE policies.


A.​LEAs must comply with IDEA, Section 504

B.​LEA transportation staff must develop procedures to minimize conflicts and resolve issues that may arise in transporting students requiring additional services.

C.​LEAs must provide school bus service for students with disabilities as indicated in the student’s IEP. The IEP may specify “curb-to-curb” or “door-to-door” services. When alternative modes of transportation are required, approval must be granted by the special education supervisor and LEA transportation authority. Alternative arrangements must be stated in the IEP.

1.​The term “curb-to-curb” implies that bus drivers and bus attendants are responsible for loading and unloading students at their home bus stops and at school loading/unloading areas. The term “door-to-door” implies that the bus driver and or bus attendant are responsible for loading and unloading students at that door and at school loading/unloading areas. This related service does not extend to the interior of the student’s home.

2.​In determining whether to include transportation in a student’s IEP, the IEP team must consider how the student’s disability affects the student need for transportation. Factors include: the student’s ability to move independently, ability to reason and understand potential safety hazards en route to the bus stop as a result of the student’s age or disability, nature and condition of the route, availability of public assistance, and access to private assistance.

3.​If a student with a disability can use the same transportation as non-disabled students, then transportation is not likely to be a related service and the LEA may make the same transportation provisions for the student with a disability that it does for the general population.

4.​Students with disabilities may not have transportation schedules which differ from non-disabled students. Students with disabilities must be transported on a schedule which allows them to receive a full instructional das as documented on the IEP.


5.​Certain students may be picked up at a safe bus stop near (e.g., at the corner of) their residences. Alternate arrangements can be made that are mutually agreeable to all parties, but must be handled on an individual basis and indicated in the IEP.

6.​Parents must request approval from the school and the school bus driver when the child is going to be picked up or dropped off at a location different from the student’s residence. Prior approval from the LEA transportation office is required if the different location results in time conflicts, overloads, or an increase in the driver’s mileage. Final approval rests with the LEA.

7.​Local procedures must be developed to specify whether bus drivers, bus attendants, classroom teachers, teacher assistants, or other staff is responsible for taking students to and from the school buses at the school site.

D.​When attendance at a school outside the student’s geographic zone is mutually agreeable and determined to be part of the student’s FAPE, the home LEA has the responsibility to provide transportation, if transportation is also related to FAPE. In situations where the student attends an out-of district school based solely on personal preference and the home LEA has offered an opportunity for FAPE, transportation may not be required, even in instances where the student may otherwise qualify for this service.

E.​The LEA cannot discharge its obligation to transport a student with a disability who needs transportation as a related service by requiring parents, without their agreement, to provide the transportation themselves and receive mileage reimbursement. However, while the LEA cannot demand this arrangement, it is not unreasonable for the LEA to request such an arrangement.

G.​It is the responsibility of the LEA to employ and train qualified school bus drivers and substitute drivers as needed to transport eligible special education students. Bus attendants must be trained to assist in transporting students with disabilities when necessary and appropriate as a related service.
1.​The need for a bus attendant is a decision of the LEA, unless the requirement is documented on the student’s IEP.
