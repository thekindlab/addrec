I could go up the steps onto the train, walked to the dining car to eat, and to the cafe car to sit at a table and drink some coffee or have a snack. There was almost always plenty of room to sit and spend time there. I had some problem getting off the train; I needed to use the stairs.

I am in a wheelchair now, so I don't know how it would be. Can wheelchairs handle the aisles? I know that some stations have raised platforms so you can walk on and off, but others do not, forcing you to use the stairs.

Not sure if /r/editing exists... If it does they'll probably be off more help than I am. 
Edit: it does but it's for video editing. Not the right sub!


There are a lot of writing fora online too, start browsing.


Once you are confident you can deliver excellent quality work. (And you know all the formatting standards etc):

Get a website, with some feedback from the people you edited for, add a PayPal button and start promoting your services.



Look for technical writing gigs online (I would skip sites like Fiverr, that's more for beer money, not for income that can replace/add to whatever the Canadian version of SSDI is - check how much you are allowed to make! Don't want them to cut you off ..)

Write your own book(s) on the side of you have time and energy left - I wouldn't make this my main focus though, it's a gamble with no guarantee of any income, and even if it takes off it will take at least a few years to make enough to live off (as far as I know). It also takes a long ass time to write a book and it sounds like you're better off not waiting that long.

Editing and technical writing, once you've got the skills, can start you earning right away.

Check Coursera (or other online teaching platforms) for courses on technical writing/editing, it's free unless you want the credits/certificate.

There are probably some courses on Udemy too - wait for them to go on sale/go for free. (Never pay regular price unless you are in a real hurry and are absolutely sure of the quality of the course. )

Coursera is by real colleges, but I'm pretty sure anyone can make a  Udemy course, same for Skillshare.

105,"My husband 'needs' an 'overnight carer'. And yes there's a reason those are in quotations.

In my area, apparently spouses can't get this job, thus the client is stuck with an extra person living in the house as the 'carer', which is now rendered useless and overpaid as there is someone *in the actual bed* who can do the job more immediately *for free*. This also every time the carer needs to go away for something (because carers are human) they need to spend hours ringing around for someone to stay the night, like my husband and I are toddlers who need a baby sitter.

We've been married for a month and I still haven't gotten a straight answer from anyone as to why he needs one. So far all I've gotten is 'for safety' because he won't be at his best to know what to do in an emergency in the middle of the night.

He is now insisting he doesn't need a carer at all.

But I still couldn't get this job even though a first aid certificate makes me more qualified than some of the 'carers' hes had over the years (eyeroll).

Just recently someone has been ringing around again to see if they can get me the carer role anyway so it might be possible.

Sorry, that's all I can help you with so far. It might be possible in some areas but in our experience we've found the system to be massively broken. None of his carers so far had to be qualified in anything. They get minimal training. Being spouse and caregiver is a very good idea in my opinion. If you can get paid for it, go for it.

113,"Is she turning 62 or 66?

If she is turning 66, then the title 2 disability benefit (SSDI) converts to a retirement benefit, and for the most part nothing changes (there are far fewer reporting requirements for retirement after age 66 compared to disability). There should not be a break in payments. With the title 2 program (old age, survivor, and disability insurance), payments always come one month behind, and the automated letters aren’t super clear about what is happening.

Example: if she turns 66 on November 6th, then she will get a disability payment in November (for October) and a retirement payment in December (for November). The actual quantity of money doesn’t change, but the source of the money does change. 


If she is turning 62 and was receiving SSI (Supplemental Security Income or title 16) then she will be required to submit an application for a reduced retirement benefit. This would need to be taken by a person because she has to elect reduced retirement benefits. In this situation, there should not be a gap in payments either (except for switching from the 1st of the month to the third of the month). If she did submit a retirement application, there should be an application with the phone number and extension of the person who took the claim. I would give this person a call to verify what is happening. 

TLDR: it is probably just the way that the automated letters explain payments, and they seem to freak people out because SSA is paying one month behind.

134,"Anyone thinking about these, they have pros and cons. I have a set of similar solid tyres for times I'll be around lots of hazards but I wouldn't swap my everyday pneumatics for them.

Pros;

* **Non-puncturable.** Low maintenance and you don't have to watch out for anything but dog shit and vomit.

* **Low long term cost.** They don't need replaced as often as pneumatics as the tread tends to be deeper and has very even wear.

* **Constant even pressure.** If I don't inflate my tyres often enough I get tired (heh. heh.) a lot faster and certain tasks are harder. Inflating tyres is my least favourite chair maintenance job, I'd genuinely rather clean gunk out of the castor well. With solids it's not a problem. 

Cons;

* **Heavier and less cushioning.** You feel bumps a lot more with solid tyres and the weight makes them more tiring to use.

* **No ability to vary pressure.** If I'm really stuck getting up a high kerb and there's no-one around, I can let a little air out of my pneumatics which makes it easier to grip the kerb and bump up. Not an option with solids. I like a high psi and find that solids don't have the same 'spring' that my pneumatics have. They're not adjustable if you prefer a different feel for different tasks or weathers. 

* **Expensive to replace.** You can't change a solid rubber tyre manually like a pneumatic, you're going to be taking it to a garage to get stretched on. For me it's cheaper to buy a whole new set of wheels than pay the garage cost. If you do a lot of exercise in your chair and wear through treads that's going to get expensive quickly. 

* **Different maintenance.** They don't puncture but you still have to remove the things stuck in them. That can be surprisingly difficult if you've been rolling on a piece of glass all day and it's properly embedded by the time you get home to your pliers. 

If you mostly use your chair to go to and from your car or take short journeys, rubber tyres are great.

138,"My brother in law has a learning disability and low IQ. He comes across as very quiet and usually in group will not speak very much. When he's 1:1 hes a bit more talkative. Ive known him for 20 years, since he was at high school.

&amp;#x200B;

His parents had to put in a lot more work with him than with the other kids. Things like spelling, writing, maths, took a lot more time. Then it was pretty much, from my observation, like the sort of parenting you might do with someone, say (this is an arbitrary figure), 10 years younger. For example, at 28 he might make the same sort of basic errors of judgement a 17 year old might make. He had the life experience, but putting it together to make age-appropriate decisions always eluded him. I want to be clear this was never a character issue. He never struck me as reckless or impulsive. More that he was just not able to factor in all the variables sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

His romantic life was a total clusterfuck. He was like a magnet for the most unstable, narcissistic, manipulative, selfish, venal women. Probably because when you meet him - its obvious hes someone that would not be hard to take advantage of. 

&amp;#x200B;

From his side, the inability for him to see them for what they were was a manifestation of just a lack of critical judgement. It was like he could not assess character - that other people could make out pretty quickly - and ended up with these terrible people who used him up, exploited him, then fucked off leaving him a total mess. He just didnt have the nouse to handle them or the necessary assertiveness to stick up for himself when they were taking the piss.

&amp;#x200B;

So now he is - finally - with a girl who's not evil.  She's also very quiet, but from what I can make of her, she does not seem to have a learning disability. They have ticked on fine for a few years and have partial custody of BIL's son, who is quite a handful (long story; mother is a piece of work). Im saying this because the fact she is still with him - with the situation with his kid - means its probably in the category of his first, proper, grown-up relationship. He's 35.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to get back to the age thing - hes probably at best functioning like someone in their early 20's in a lot of ways. Younger-seeming capabilities with any sort of complex decision making. We all still look out for him a lot. For example, his parents are on an overseas holiday at the moment, so we are all looking out for him and checking in regularly. This is just because he has some stuff on with the custody and a wrong decision could land him in trouble. Im emphasising here - and I hope you can see what I am trying to say - he will probably need this sort of supervision ongoingly. Like even when he is older, he will still benefit from having family looking out for him with complex issues so he doesnt get taken for a ride.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more to it than this. Im trying to keep this brief. I think what I am saying is that if you take this on - there is a caring aspect that comes with it. You will have to be responsible for ensuring the person's wellbeing in a lot of ways that may not be required to with someone who does not have this type of disability. The matter of the power difference is really important to consider, because you will almost certainly always be one step ahead of her. That means you are in a position of making decisions for both of you, and finding ways to factor things in for her to be able to catch up so she can have a say in whats going on. If you see what I mean - there's an ethics here thats very important to consider, and patience I think will be required to make that aspect work.",,False,,AltitudinousOne,,,1542355623,t5_2qhe8,t3_9xga0t,t3_9xga0t,4,1545443503,0,0,e9sygl0,disability,,,,,

157,"Okay, I'm no expert I can just give you my own experience. (I'm still filing SSDI, but have SSI) 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Start by filing the proper paperwork, whether you are going for SSDI or SSI there are proper channels to go through. If you don't want the hassle of online paperwork (Where you might miss something) Then I suggest you make an appointment with your local Social security office. They'll walk you through the initial application and do it all with you right there. 

2)Gather any and all documents that you can. Part of the process will give the social security offices to pull all your records, but you want to make sure they don't miss anything. If there's something that you feel is relevant to your case then it's best to gather a copy for yourself. There will be multiple times where they will send you the same paperwork over and over again. It's very repetitious, but it's important that you fill it out to the best of your ability. Make sure that if they request something, you get it or give permission for them to get it.  The biggest thing to get is your work history and medical history. Those are the BIG things. Doctors, medications, hospital stays. How long you worked, where you worked etc.

3)For the majority of the paperwork, it's not overly difficult. Like I stated above it's quite repetitive. Half the paperwork is signing your name at the bottom and mailing it back. The other portion is filling out sections of information about your records. Work history, Doctors, medical history, Medicines and a personal account for your disability. Basically a statement on why you feel you're impaired from working. 

4) When you file a claim it will go through a series of channels, the first time you apply prepare yourself for rejection. It's their way of weeding out those who are serious or not, just keep appealing the process! You have rights to appeal, don't feel discouraged if you have to keep appealing. As far as being seen by another doctor by them, no. Not to my knowledge will this ever happen. They will have their own doctors/medical experts go over your case based on the documents you provide/they gather. That is why you have to appeal, these people don't know you and you have to make sure that they understand how debilitating your condition is. 

5) Filing is free. The only fee's that I know of would be for the cost of mailing documents back and forth. OR if you get an attorney. An attorney will take a % of your benefits as compensation for representing you, keep in mind that you don't always need a representative. I didn't have one for my SSI case, but I'm now in Hearing stages of my SSDI case and am looking for an attorney (It's far more complicated). 

6) I don't know what effect this might have on your application, my assumption is that if you go and file at a social security office and bring that documentation then they can help you navigate that. 

7) Yes. You will need your work history, it's a big part of your case. That along with medical documents will be what you are using to plead your case. Expenses will also come into play, they'll want to know such things to see what kind of expenses you have on a monthly basis and how you are living right now. 

8) Okay, I'll break this up into two sections.

SSI- SSI is based on your need for assistance, think of it as a bit like food stamps. It's given to those who can prove that they have a need for it. Your disability and financial standing are what has standing in this case. Mostly medical history is what comes into play here, though they will want to know about rent you pay and medical costs. 

SSDI- This is based on work history, you need a certain number of credits in order to be applicable to receive this benefit. You have a date last insured (Work history) That is what has the biggest standing in your case. It's determined by when you last worked and how long you've worked. Your disability has some standing, but isn't the determining factor. 

9) Denials are different for everyone because every case is different! More often than not, SSI cases go through faster than SSDI cases. My case took just over a year for SSI and I'm nearly at two years for SSDI and still haven't gotten to the point of seeing the end of my hearings. So the biggest thing is to be patient! Keep on the paperwork and make sure you do all you can to help provide the documentation they may want/request. 

10) As far as reporting a change in your medical conditions. I believe they have a monitoring period for such things. I think it's like every 2-5 years where they will reevaluate you. You could, of course, call in and report any changes, for instance, if you rent situation changes you could call in and update them on the situation and they could possibly increase your benefits. (At least as far as SSI works).

I am an adult diagnosed with narcolepsy so I fully relate to how your son is feeling. Something to consider is that these types of situations will never really go away as he gets older, so these can all be teachable moments to help prepare him for the real world. Not everyone is going to “get it” for various reasons, and that’s on them.

I myself find that excessive lists are key. I don’t trust myself to remember anything. I have notes for everything I do at work (my co workers are always so impressed with my notes) so I won’t forget. I also keep a personal to do list.

When I was in school I never scheduled a class before 9am and always sat in the front row to help. Maybe your school can arrange some sort of adjusted schedule?

Maybe he can be one of the lucky kids to get a cell phone before the other kids, but you can load it up full of reminders and lists for him. Dad can’t get mad if it’s used as a crutch when we all use our phones like this.

Get creative and involve your son in the brainstorming session to come up with little life hacks to make things a bit easier. Let him be 100% honest with you and himself about when and where he really struggles, and when and what causes him to feel most alert. 

Listening to my body and knowing when to say no is a huge piece of my disability and something I continue to struggle with.

They only (from my experience) reserve a small subsection of their complex for it.  Some (Catholic Charities in Maryland) will only accept those who are 'mobility impaired' in their small subsection of units reserved for nonsenior residents.

Section 8 waiting list in my state is 7 years.  The benefit to a section 8 voucher though is that once you get one you can use it nationwide.  There are strategies that involve moving to an area with a shorter waiting list then moving to the area you actually want to live in.  Sec 8 vouchers are like liquor licenses, they are allocated by the government (Congress) and are only so many in circulation until someone either dies or stops using it.  

It is *very* difficult to find out where these are located.  You can get a 100plus page pdf from HUD and just go through it.  But I found the easiest way is to go on craigslist (search for 'senior' 'disabled').  Since if the complex wait list is open, they will be advertising it somewhere.  There is also something called 'a place for mom' but you have to pay for that.  

I wouldn't get your hopes up though, just being honest.  I found an opening and I couldn't get there for 2-3 days and it was already gone.  Expect to be able to call and view the place instantly.  Where I was applying you had to go through a series of interviews, just to be considered to be accepted.

There are two types of disability. SSDI and SSI, SSI is based on your disability status meaning it goes off of your medical records/work history and personal testimony to determine your ability to work. It is a financial benefit for those who can't work. It took me just over a year to get SSI and I was able to do all the paperwork myself without the need of an attorney. 

SSDI is for those who are disabled and have worked a certain amount in their lives. It's called work credits, there's a limit on them based on your age. You can google it. If you don't meet the number of credits required for your age group then getting SSDI would be a long stretch. You can still apply and you should, just be prepared for a long wait, another thing is that the ability to get an attorney can help as these cases are far more complicated than SSI cases.

No matter what symptom is affecting me, whether you have multiple diagnoses or just one. Just apply! No matter your disability apply!

There are two types of disability. SSDI and SSI, SSI is based on your disability status meaning it goes off of your medical records/work history and personal testimony to determine your ability to work. It is a financial benefit for those who can't work. It took me just over a year to get SSI and I was able to do all the paperwork myself without the need of an attorney. 

SSDI is for those who are disabled and have worked a certain amount in their lives. It's called work credits, there's a limit on them based on your age. You can google it. If you don't meet the number of credits required for your age group then getting SSDI would be a long stretch. You can still apply and you should, just be prepared for a long wait, another thing is that the ability to get an attorney can help as these cases are far more complicated than SSI cases. I'm still working on my SSDI and it's been two years.

I hope this helps. Good luck.

281,"First, I am sorry about the diagnosis. 

For the SSDI, yes you will be approved for benefits. ALS is one of the few conditions where just being diagnosed with it is grounds for approval. 

Your case will be given priority (CAL-compassionate allowance) status, but these can still be slowed down by things beyond SSA control, especially getting medical records. If possible, get the last few appointment notes from your neurologist documenting the diagnosis. When you apply you can give them those records and that is all the examiner will need. I've seen CAL cases get approved within 1 day (although payment processing does take longer). 

You may want to read the fine print on your LTD insurance as well. Sometimes the payout you receive from them is offset by SSDI, and they then only pay what remains to get to your benefit amount. So, if you receive $2000 from LTD, but your SSDI is $1500, they may only end up giving you $500/mo. Just a good thing to check on for longer-term financial planning.

Some people are just ignorant of what chronic illness really means - if I did everything people expect I'd be twice as disabled, I once had an employer suggest I ""just bring your chair from home each day"" when I asked for permission to *buy my own chair* for my desk, I don't drive, and it's use forearm crutches, but my boss just didn't think about the logistics and because *he* could easily throw a chair in his car every morning if he had to, that seemed like the easiest solution for me having the perfect chair at home and a shitty chair at work.

But once it's explained to them, if they're still coming up with dumb solutions or pushing for you to manage the stool solely on your own, they're definitely trying to play some weird game.

The most logical solution is for someone on the other shift to be assigned to putting the stool in the storage area during their shift and removing it to put back at the desk at the end of their shift as part of their clock in and clock out ritual.

More simply, as you suggest, they simply educate the other employees to not use the stool.

321,"I trained my first dog myself. I didn't really know what I was doing but she had the perfect temperament for it and really took to the work. Although having trained 2 other dogs since I see that she's not as smart or food motivated as they were. But she was sweet and calm and gentle. However, I adopted her at 5 years old and less than two years later learned she had arthritis. The boundary about whether or not I could continue to work her was unclear.

Since I first adopted her I'd been looking out for other service dog options. I thought I just had PTSD, and so couldn't look to any programs. However, I've since been diagnosed with a seizure disorder and am getting diagnosed for a cardiac disorder as well. I did find an in tandem service dog program, where you take the dog to classes once a week for an hour and continue their training at home.

I got my second dog there and made so much progress. However, as he aged his temperament dramatically changed and he was too stressed out by working in public to be a service dog. I had to rehome him because I couldn't take care of his exercise needs without working him.

The third dog I trained I trained for a friend who was sent to a private boarding school that would not allow the service dog in training. He was sent there due to truancy. I trained the dog for a little less than a year and just recently the friend has begun to switch back to his public school with the support of the service dog. The friend is continuing the training and looking for a professional trainer with more experience in his area.

I've now applied to eight service dog programs since August and been denied by three. There is one organization that I did apply to in August, followed up on the phone several times, and still have not resieved a deicition about whether or not they will move me through to the next steps of the application process.

363,"Hey! I'm a 23F in Ontario, Canada. I have avascular necrosis in both shoulders, both knees, and both hips. I had my right hip replaced at 16, my left knee replaced at 21 and my right shoulder replaced about eight months ago (at 23). AVN is when the joint doesnt fet a steady blood supply, resulting in the bone dying. Once it dies, it starts to crumble. So my shoulder ended up not sitting in the socket properly, similar to yours!

You dont specify whether you are in a lot of pain, so I'm not sure how much this will apply to you but: my shoulder replacement (along with my other joint replacements) were the best decisions I ever made. My shoulder has by far been the most successful surgery of the three. I have zero pain, recovery was relatively easy (more annoying than anything), and my range of motion has increased so much. 

Prior to my surgery I was participating in physiotherapy which I feel really helped my recovery. The extra bit of strength you can get from physio can help with the recovery, so if you do end up needing the surgery I reccomend talking about it with your doctor. 

I have anxiety, and it was pretty bad prior to the surgery so while they were prepping me for surgery I asked for some anxiety medication. They gave me some and I was able to relax while they hooked me up to everything. They gave me a nerve blocker, which was a life saver - I could not feel a thing when I woke up. 

Once I had been awake for a few hours I started to feel a bit uncomfortable, so I asked for pain meds. They had me on several kinds for the day of the surgery. One kind was delivered at specified times, while another was as needed. So between the two, they really take care of you! 

I believe some shoulder replacements are considered day surgery, but due to another health condition I have they kept me in hospital for one night for monitoring. That night was fine - not a lot of pain at all. I was released the next day. 

I was in a sling for six weeks I believe. I was allowed to move my arm, so long as I kept it within a certain range. It hurt to move but it was bearable and actually felt good to stretch. At the four week mark I started proper physio. At three or 4 months (i believe) i finished official physio, but was encouraged to continue the exercises at home. The pain throughout all of this was minimal so long as I kept up with my pain meds. I think I stopped taking the pain meds at the 7 day mark, and just stuck with tylenol. 

I only have one restriction, which is I cannot externally rotate my shoulder past a certain point otherwise I'll pop my shoulder out of the socket. As the joint replacements get older, they can sometimes ache in cold or wet weather for some reason, but the ache is really minimal. 

I know it's a scary sounding surgery, and there are some risks, but I swear it's really not as bad as they make it seem.

364,"well, since you also asked for related info, not just personal.

I've had patients have shoulder replacement surgery. Only three, but that's still enough to have a rough idea of the general recovery issues. And I had a cousin (and I have a ton of those) that had one.

So, not a huge sample group. The patients I only had a year or so with each one, which means no long term observations. I did help them with their therapy exercises after discharge (that's why they were my patients in part). It's incredibly grueling work, but all three reached amazing improvements.

 The worst outcome had nearly eighty percent use compared to the uninjured arm. Since that was a traumatic injury with some really nasty damage, eighty percent was incredible.

The best outcome after ~a year wasn't quite one hundred percent parity, but it was close enough he had no functional deficit. The other guy only had minor limitations in how much stamina he had.

My cousin maintains full use of his arm, has no pain, and he had a similar birth injury to yours (can't remember what his was called though, not a close cousin).

The surgery itself is pretty significant. It's not a minor procedure. But it also isn't one that has a high complication rate either. 

Recovery involves a shit ton of work. Every day hard work. And the four people I know of that had theirs replaced complained way more about that than post surgical issues. I was never super up on orthopedic surgeries enough to know exactly what they're going to be doing, but I do know that it's a well established method. That means most surgeons that aren't fresh out of school have done a few, and have plenty of resources to have gained high proficiency with it.


I get the impression that pain is high on the list of things you're scared of since you mentioned the EMG being scary and causing tears. Post surgical pain isn't exactly a cake walk, but it isn't as sudden and jarring as an EMG.  Plus, since it's known the pain is going to be there and needs to be controlled, you'll have access to pain management of some kind. Immediately after, while in the hospital, you'll probably have iv pain relief which is fast and effective. After discharge, it'll be oral meds combined with therapeutic techniques. Your pain levels will be monitored as part of your recovery. So any pain you do have is going to have options to handle it.

And again,  none of the four shoulder replacement patients I had complained about the post surgical pain at all. It was the pain from working like hell in therapy that they despised. But that's short term, acute pain that decreases the longer you work the prescribed course of therapy.

Other joint replacement patients I've known or worked with (knee and hip pretty much, plus one ankle that I wasn't around for until well after for other reasons)  go pretty much the same way.  The post operative pain is there for sure, but it gets controlled. The pain of therapy is there, but gets controlled and decreases.  But I've never known a joint replacement patient that didn't end up far more comfortable and mobile than before. I've never even known any that didn't state that despite the pain involved that they were glad to have had it done because of the improvements it made for them.

As always though, be your own best advocate. Read up on the procedure. Look your surgeon up and make certain they're good at what they do. Check into the recovery time and likely therapy needed. That way you can ask the right questions, be prepared and not have to try and figure all of it out when medications have you loopy afterward.

Always, always speak up for yourself. You have the right to be heard and have the opportunity for informed consent. If you have fears, it is the job of your medical team to help you overcome them with solid information. If you have questions, that's part of their job too. Even having family in the field doesn't equal the benefits of self advocacy in positive outcomes.

 It doesn't matter if  it is a major procedure like this or just a minor dermatological excision, the more of a role you take in your treatment, the easier you'll be able to face the fear, the pain, and come out with satisfaction. It's so easy to get caught up in the medicalese and just miss what's going on, or to give over advocacy to a trusted relative (and there's nothing wrong with that if you choose it). But patients that self advocate tend to have much less trouble over time.  It's a habit we get into when we're disabled to just let go of that sense of self  determination.

450,"I know a few disabled people in Ontario Canada.

Canada (for the most part) lets the provinces handle disability support.  There is a federal level disability but it is extremely difficult to qualify.

Ontario's premiere is expected to drastically reduce disability services which are already poverty levels for many.  I don't know about other provinces.

Ontario Disability Support Program ""ODSP"",  pays approximately $1,100 a month or about $13K a year for a single person.  Minimum wage here is $14/hour, so about $29K a year.   Rent in Toronto for a one bedroom is roughly $1500 a month at minimum.

On the bright side socialized medicine.  If you are on disability, young or old it includes prescriptions and dental.  The rest of us pay market rates.

Housing (unless you are the lucky few who gets subsidized housing) is damn expensive, as is the cost of living in general.

Peoples attitudes are about the same here as in the US, divided about 70% people who are helpful and kind and 30% people who believe that your disability is your fault, that stronger work ethic and love of Jesus will cure you.  We also seem to have our share of predators selling snake oil and taking advantage of people.

Accommodations for disability is pretty good unless you are in a wheel chair then you will find lots of inaccessible places.   Government and larger buildings are supposed to be wheelchair accessible and many are.

Transit in Toronto is not bad.  Many busses kneel and can lower a ramp.  If you qualify their is special transit called Wheel Trans which costs the same as regular transit.  Smaller towns vary greatly.

463,"I am in Québec and don't know the particulars, because my wife's disability doesn't really qualify her for most programs (i.e. she doesn't cost much or has special medical needs).

I would add that there is a major difference in the approach used by U.S. and Canada.  

U.S. has passed its *Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)* around 1980, and basically the act puts lots of very strict requirements to make things physically accessible: building ramps, having wheelchair-accessible parking spots, fully accessible public transit, accessible restrooms, alternative print instructions, accessible exams at school, etc. It is far from perfect, as there are loopholes and walking 2 km ""like everyone else"" is not realistic for many disabled folks and using your specially modified van to go everywhere isn't possible on minimum wage. But overall, the U.S. principle is that we'll make everything physically accessible so anyone with a disability can use them.

The Canadian approach is more paternalistic. ""Let's help you by providing special services""; or call it ""separate but equal"". Except these services are never equal.
For instance, less stores are accessible in Montréal than in many U.S. cities. There is typically 1 step, sometimes 2, and in many cases, it requires structural work that can't be done by the merchant but must be done by the building owner.

There is paratransit available to all who need it, but one needs to reserve 2 days ahead (I think) and your request may be denied if they are too busy. Or they run unpredictably. If you decide that you want to go shopping *right now,* forget it! Or if you want to visit Québec City as a Montréaler (or as a visitor), you can't use paratransit because you haven't applied. Or if you live in Longueuil and work in Montréal, you have access to Longueuil's paratransit so you can commute from Longueuil to Montréal, but you can't use it to leave your job in Montréal to visit a friend in Montréal (you would need to be living in Montréal for that).

In Montréal (STM), wheelchair-accessible buses were gradually introduced in 1998 (but really more like in 2003-2004), but they were low-floor buses with a rear ramp that was never maintained, so service was spotty at best. Since 2009, we have buses with a front ramp that *usually* works; right now, probably half the buses have a front ramp, which is enough to have decent service on most runs. But all bus runs end at a metro station, and 13 stations out of 68 are wheelchair-accessible (conversion is technically challenging, but they could provide an alternative bus service, for example). The STM has also bizarre practices like not allowing wheelchair curb access when there is no sidewalk, so entire zones of the island are inaccessible because of that. Likewise, when there is a snow storm, they may decide that it is inappropriate to offer service to wheelchair users until the snow is completely cleared. Can you stay off work for 1 week? Why not let people decide by themselves if they want to go out?

Apart from paratransit, other cities in Québec have dismal services for wheelchair users. Longueuil, Laval and Québec City offer 7-10 lines each (i.e. 5-10 % of their network) with limited stops (again, they want a sidewalk and most streets in Laval don't have sidewalks).

573,"It's important to stress that you don't provide accommodations just so you are in compliance with the law. Of course, large corporations hardly care about that, so you have typically have to frame it in terms of productivity of the employees.

The obvious, if they see the employer is willing to help them, they are more eager to work.

As for actual, quantifiable productivity though it's so important to get them to understand the low cost of the accommodations versus the improved output of the employee.

My employer was being kind of iffy about accommodations for me, not because they were unwilling, but they weren't experienced in dealing with my condition.

I need to take a short nap - 15-25 minutes is typically all I need. I already get a 30 minute break, which I had been using to try and nap already, but it wasn't working well due to not having any sort of comfortable place. 

I had been going to my car prior, but it was hard to get comfortable enough to rest in time. Plus, I could really only do it in mild weather. Summer or winter, that isn't really an option.

They were having difficulty finding a private space I could go to(not for their lack of trying), and were suggesting I take FMLA, clock out, and ""go somewhere"". I have a long commute so going home mid day wasn't an option.

That's a good example of the weird, kind of cold, impersonal response people with invisible illnesses often receive. Ah, right, I'll just ""go somewhere."" I will not only forfeit at least 1-2 hours of pay, but will also..get a hotel room every single day I work?

An easy way to drive that is to ask them how they would felt if they were told something like that - or if a more visibly disabled person was told(""instead of us building a ramp, couldnt that person in a wheelchair just use the one three buildings over and then take the pedestrian walkways to his building?"")

I didn't have to address the tone of what they said, but I did address the productivity problem in it. No matter what, I already get a paid 30 minute break. 30 minutes that I will not be doing any work. I am already willing to use that time for my naps, which  means there is no productive loss compared to anyone that doesn't have a condition. If they can not find me a suitable place to rest, then I either have to spend longer than thirty minutes trying to get adequate rest on site, or will have to leave and ""go somewhere"". Either one will require me to use FMLA at that point - which has to be used in hourly increments minimum.

So instead of being the same as every other employee, I am now guaranteed to stop working for at least an entire hour every day, PLUS my 30 minute break on top of that.

Putting it that way really seemed to make them understand what a difference this relatively minor thing could make. Not just on a cold hard numbers way, but it seemed to help them kind of ""get it"" overall.

That's my personal anecdote, I'm fortunate that my accommodations are so minimal(just needed a room with a locked door basically)

Most conditions will be more impactful to production, and that's when they have to brainstorm *with* the employee. I read and hear of many cases where it seems all the discussion happens behind closed doors, and then the employee is presented with what they came up with. This will hardly ever be acceptable as they have no idea what the condition entails. Employees should be involved in virtually every step, and management should be asking *them* what needs to happen. This not only helps the employee convey what they specifically need, but also opens them up to presenting their own ideas on how to make-up for any lost time it incurs(staying 15 minutes late and such)

Physical barriers— I can’t keep up with people my age, or in general. I tire really quickly, and prolonged activity, even just walking, causes me pain for the next few days. I can’t run for long, and doing so or even just moving too quickly sometimes will cause my joints to profoundly ache, along with some sort of bone aching. In the case of emergencies, I’ve had to discuss with the adults at school (as I’m only a minor; I’m in high school) what has to be done, since I can’t move nearly as quickly as everyone else: at this point, it’s actually part of the plan in case of evacuation for someone to carry me, since I can’t move nearly as effectively. Moreover, everyday life at school is painful. If a class is across the school’s campus or more than a few rooms away, I’m always guaranteed to be late, which means that I’m often missing some portion of class time if I want to minimize the pain I feel throughout the day— if I made it to class on-time, especially for classes that are further away, I’m basically accepting the leg pain, which makes it even harder to make it later on in the day and week.

I know that you said that you are getting therapy.  Depending on whether you are interested into looking into another therapist, it may be worth it to call a pediatric allergy practice to ask for recommendations.  Food allergies are more common in kids than adults, so often they will have a few people that they can recommend with more experience with food allergy anxiety.

I had to dump a therapist when she told me in our first meeting that she would help me to reconnect my left brain and my right brain to cure me of my allergies.  Not how this works at all.

Anxiety that is based in rational thought is really, really hard to get rid of.  It's rational for me to be anxious about food - food can kill me.

832,"There are a lot of different options that could fit there. Most Compact or SubCompacts would work, though a subcompact might be hard to hold if you have any dexterity issues.

Here’s a really long but super basic primer on the most important aspects: 

**Revolver vs. SemiAuto:** A revolver is an “old west wheelgun.” It has a cylinder that rotates in the middle of the gun to line up bullets with the barrel. A hammer falls on the round and it fires. A downside is that material can get caught in the cylinder or under the hammer and cause a misfire, in addition to the fact that a revolver will only hold 5-6 rounds. A semiautomatic is like the guns you see cops using on TV, where the top of the gun slides backwards to chamber the next round. 

Some people really like revolvers, but I prefer semiautomatics so that’s what I’ll be focusing on.


**Firing Mechanism:** There are two main types of semiautomatic pistols out there: striker fired and hammer fired. A striker uses an in-line “striker” that, when you pull the trigger releases and moves forward in a straight line to set off the bullet. The entirety of this mechanism is contained inside the slide of the gun, so there’s nothing visible on the outside. A Glock is the typical example of a striker fired pistol. It’s a bit more finicky, but people claim that it prevents misfires if you drop your gun, but no modern gun should fire when you drop it, regardless of firing mechanism. 

A hammer fired weapon is one that has an external hammer you can clock. The gun will automatically cock the hammer between each round (that’s where the automatic in “semi-automatic” comes from), but if for some reason it fails to, you can manually cock the hammer by hand, unlike the striker fired. The hammer fired feels like there is less that can go wrong, but the downside is if the hammer falls on something else — for example if it catches your shirt — the gun won’t fire. It’s something to consider. CZ’s ar hammer-fired.


**Material:** Next, there are two main types of material “plastic” and metal. Glocks are plastic, CZ’s are metal. The choice isn’t super important as they are both incredibly durable, but it changes the way the gun feels substantially. Plastics are much lighter and, depending on the brand, can have more recoil (I can’t speak to if the Glock compacts do this well). Metal feels like an “real gun” to me, and has weight to it. The weight absorbs some of the recoil, and, to me, that can be very important in a self-defense situation. It could be the difference between one round on target and two.


**Caliber:** This is a bit of personal choice, since I think you’ll be choosing between 9mm and .45. Either caliber is fine. My personal philosophy is that if I pull my gun, I’m shooting more than one round. 9mm has a lighter recoil, which means more rounds on target. However, once you start looking at hollow point rounds you probably only need 1 round to stop them anyway. A .45 will hold fewer rounds than a 9mm (10 vs. 15), and the rounds are more expensive. 


**Safeties:** Not all guns have a safety, but most do. Some people do not want a safety, because without one your gun is always ready to fire. In a self-defense weapon, there is something to be said for that.

There are two main types of safety: manual, and decocker. A manual safety is one like you’re probably familiar with: a tiny lever on the side of the gun. When you draw your gun, you have to *first* use your thumb to disengage the safety before you can pull the trigger. When the safety is off, the trigger pull will be light (~5lbs) and short.

A decocker on the other hand allows you to “decock” the hammer, so that it lays flat against the gun instead of being “open.” The advantage of this is that it *substantially* increases the weight of the trigger pull (to ~12lbs) and travel distance for the first round you fire. The second (and subsequent) round will set the trigger to the “light” setting, so that it takes a light weight and short distance to get every other round off.  It’s important to note that in a terrifying situation, the extra weight/travel isn’t enough to slow you down.

This is my preferred method. With a manual safety disengaged, that gun is ready to go off. Could be on a bad draw, could be because you’re pulling the trigger, but to me it feels *more* dangerous. Additionally, in your draw training you will drill disengaging the safety together, so that once the gun is pointing at someone it is ready to fire. A decocker has such a heavy/long trigger pull that it ensures you damn well mean to let that first shot loose, and weren’t just being an idiot and trying to threaten someone with your gun. I feel much safer with a decocked weapon.

There are two other types in brief: glocks can have a trigger safety, but that’s sort of just a failure point for me. It doesn’t add much protection, and it’s something that can go wrong. Next are grip safeties, which are depressed by your palm when you grab the gun. These seemed like a good idea to me, until I read stories about them not depressing or being shot in the hand/arm and not being able to squeeze to depress them. I stay away.

The reason all that was important, is because yes, I feel like the CZ Rami is one of the best concealed weapons, and it happens to be small enough that it works well in both my manual and power wheel chairs. I prefer semi-auto to revolver. The weight is enough to dampen recoil and feel solid in your hand, but not too heavy. I think a decocker is the best solution for concealed carry, because it’s an excellent balance of safety and not impeding your ability to fire, and I think 9mm is best for my use-case. The CZ 2075 Rami BD meets all of that criteria. Glock is used by police in the US, but CZ is time worn and battle tested by police and militaries the world over. It takes a lickin’ and keeps on tickin’ so to speak, in any environment this world can offer.

However, there are advantages to a manual safety weapon, especially if there are ever kids around (if there are, you *cannot* be without a safe In either case). Some people only buy glocks, and love the way the plastic feels. They feel finicky to me, but they are much less expensive than a full metal weapon. Some people feel unsafe if they aren’t carrying a .45.

Not everyone will agree with me, and that’s fine. The truth is that you can’t really go wrong if you stick with a major brand. None of that hi-point shit, but Glock, CZ, S&amp;W, H&amp;K, Sig Sauer, etc. will always serve you well

My advice: Start by looking up the next gun-show in your area and going. You’ll get to feel loads of different handguns, and you can decide what *feels* best to you.  Then go to a local gun range. Most places will let you rent a gun — call ahead to ask if they have what you want — so you can try a few different ones to get a feel for what you like. Then go back to the gun show and buy that gun, since you’ll likely get the best deal there. Guys at gun shops will be thrilled to talk to you about everything, and willing to explain anything you need to know. If you have the extra money, it’s nice to buy local and a shop can order you exactly what you want. 

Good luck. I’m happy to clarify or explain anything else if you need. Also, just as a bonus, most pistol shooting sports are happy to have competitors in wheelchairs!

Most Compact or SubCompacts would work, though a subcompact might be hard to hold if you have any dexterity issues.

Here’s a really long but super basic primer on the most important aspects: 

**Revolver vs. SemiAuto:** A revolver is an “old west wheelgun.” It has a cylinder that rotates in the middle of the gun to line up bullets with the barrel. A hammer falls on the round and it fires. A downside is that material can get caught in the cylinder or under the hammer and cause a misfire, in addition to the fact that a revolver will only hold 5-6 rounds. A semiautomatic is like the guns you see cops using on TV, where the top of the gun slides backwards to chamber the next round. 

Some people really like revolvers, but I prefer semiautomatics so that’s what I’ll be focusing on.


**Firing Mechanism:** There are two main types of semiautomatic pistols out there: striker fired and hammer fired. A striker uses an in-line “striker” that, when you pull the trigger releases and moves forward in a straight line to set off the bullet. The entirety of this mechanism is contained inside the slide of the gun, so there’s nothing visible on the outside. A <PERSON> is the typical example of a striker fired pistol. It’s a bit more finicky, but people claim that it prevents misfires if you drop your gun, but no modern gun should fire when you drop it, regardless of firing mechanism.

833,"I would probably suggest a revolver, then. Every semi-automatic is going to require you to grip the top like that and pull it back (“rack the slide”) to chamber a round, but a double-action revolver only requires you to pull the trigger. Of course, you can rack the slide with either hand if one is easier for you than the other. It’s not like you’ll be doing it often outside of the range. Actually, with a semi automatic you can rack the slide back with the gun completely empty, and the slide-lock will engage (which holds the slide back). You can then put a clip in the base, and slide a single bullet into the chamber. Then you just have to push the button to release the slide, and it will pull the bullet in for you. A safe way to load with dexterity issues, since you barely have to handle the weapon once a round is ready to be chambered.

The catch with the revolver is that modern revolvers are made without safeties, instead relying on the DA/SA method similar to a decocker weapon. 

The CZ 2075 Rami is actually drop-safe, meaning that it is virtually guaranteed not to discharge if it is dropped, as there are three separate safety features that would have to all fail simultaneously during the drop in order for it to discharge. You can ready some more about that [here](https://thefiringline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=576500). It would still have the issue with racking the slide, though.

The fact is that modern self-defense firearms have so many safety measures in place, a manual/lever safety is becoming a relic. Of course, I would suggest doing your own research rather than taking my word for it. You would want to be completely comfortable with the gun you’re buying and carrying, so if a manual safety is a permanent sticking point for you, that’s fine.

Yes, I think this would be a good campaign.

**What is it like to live with a hidden disability and use public transport?**

I am in the process of trying to get a diagnosis for the various symptoms I have started to experience, dizziness, heart palpitations and presyncope are the most problematic. But balance issues stemming from my Autism and my mucked up back are my longest standing symptoms making standing on the bus very painful or downright dangerous on my worst days. Before I started using my walking stick to help with my dizziness, I frequently would get accused of being lazy or entitled if I did not move for another person or even asked a person to move their bag from the seat beside them so I could sit. Getting yelled at was a common occurrence, so was being kicked off the bus despite me being the one remaining calm and the other person getting belligerent. I have incurred various injuries including a concussion because I was forced to stand on the bus but lost my balance, and landed on steps to the back of the bus. Or the time that somebody bumped into me while the bus was in motion and I fell onto a baby in one of two strollers, combined they took up the space of 8 bus seats...  

**How does this topic make you feel?**

I can get pretty heated about this topic as I personally have been injured several times because I could not get a seat, and have seen others injured because of it. Especially the stroller issue, the rules on my bus system are clearly marked right beside the fare machine thing, strollers must be folded up while on the bus and children held or sat on the seats. Nobody does this, and often times we end up with an aisle full of unfolded strollers making it impossible to get on or off the bus. I blame the bus drivers for not enforcing this rule as it is a safety hazard, I have seen small children almost become run over because brakes failed or a sudden stop cause the stroller to slide forward. Attitudes are honestly towards individuals with invisible disabilities, but it is not as big of a safety hazard as the strollers. I can handle the rude and entitled individuals, parents with strollers are going to kill somebody some day.

**How do others make you feel about your hidden disability? Either on public transport or in general.**

Honestly how people have made me feel about my disability is no different on the buses then it is during everyday life. Before I have started requiring more medical equipment, I was seen as invalid, lazy, entitled and trash.

872,"I have arthritis that makes it painful to stand. Riding the metro in Madrid requires lots of standing. Luckily, I guess, I haven't seen any shaming of apparently able-bodied people sitting in the disabled seats. However, that's because there's very little respect for disabled priority in anything. 

For example, when I've got my crutch and get on the metro, no longer invisible, the people sitting in the disabled seats don't offer me a seat, and no one says a thing to them. If someone offers me a seat, it's usually someone in one of the regular seats.

875,"Typically your insurance will handle this for you. Call them and tell them you need your chair serviced. My wonderful insurance company makes me get a prescription from a doctor every time I need my chair serviced.

If you bought your chair yourself, you are probably on your own for repairs. You can call a local mobility store to see if they can do repairs for you, but it will probably cost a small fortune, and many places will *only* service chairs they have sold. They’re used to billing insurance companies, and my experience has been that they aren’t very helpful to people without insurance. YMMV though, as I’m sure there are some good ones out there.

Basic repairs, like replacing the armrests or front casters, are probably pretty easy to do on your own if you can push a manual chair. I do all the work on my manual chair myself. If you have to adjust the axels, though, be careful: they’re often overtightened at the factory and can be very hard to get loose. I had to break my chair down completely so that I could soak them in WD40, and it still took a bench vice and an hammer to break one of them loose. If you aren’t having to replace quicklocks, though, that shouldn’t be an issue. 

Regarding wheels, I *think* the bearings require a special press to fit them in most modern wheels. I’m sure there are exceptions, but I don’t know that it’s a DIY project for most wheels. If you have inflatable tires, you can replace those yourself. Go to AutoZone and buy a car interior/trim removal kit, which is several heavy plastic prybars of various shapes. Deflate the wheels and use the prybar to pull the rubber off. Then replace the tube and the rubber, and reinflate. It’s very straightforward, and if you have the strength and dexterity for a manual chair you should be able to do it. Solid core wheels/non-pneumatic wheels are not user serviceable. You pretty much cannot replace the tires yourself as it requires a very strong piece of equipment to overstretch the rubber. Honestly, it was cheaper for me to buy an entirely new set of wheels with tires on them last time, rather than paying someone to replace only the tires.

If you look up the manufacturer online, they’ll have a 1-800 number you can call for help. They should be able to email you the service manual free of charge.

Home health care, on the other hand, when considered medically necessary is covered, at least in part, by Medicare and other health insurance programs. However, Medicare severely restricts coverage to only those individuals who are “homebound”. This is defined as persons who require assistance (by human or medical equipment such as wheelchairs) to leave their homes. Alternatively, persons who health may be worsened by leaving their homes are also eligible. During home health care visits, Medicare will not pay for any personal care that is provided during that visit. Visits tend to be brief and procedural in nature.


From the National MS Society

Home health care is covered by a number of payers, including traditional
Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, the Veterans’ Administration, TRICARE,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Older Americans Act programs,
private insurance, and private pay. Medicare is currently the largest payer of
home health services, with Medicaid increasingly oriented towards rebalancing
resources between institutional and home and community based services,
including personal care services designed to prevent nursing home placement

- The amount of paperwork required for a simple extension.

- The strong focus on exams as a way of measuring understanding instead of coursework which would allow more people with chronic conditions to organize their own time.

- Libraries that don't allow for reservation of study space and so the accessible areas are usually taken up by other people so disabled people end up not being able to use those resources ever.

- Practical things like not having assistants in labs or not even having height-adjustable benches. It's not a policy thing but there is a huge, huge lack of foresight in this area and a general perception that only able-bodied people would be doing science.

1040,"As far as I know, the SSA doesn't allow them to accept out of pocket or upfront payment for representation. I do know they have very strict guidelines on compensation amounts, and that the amount is restricted to a certain percentage of the back pay you receive upon approval, with a  ""which ever is less"" total cap. They can lose their ability to represent people for disability applications if they don't charge within those guidelines,  so they're highly unlikely to let you pay upfront, especially since they'd have to return it if they lost your case, or return any excess in the event the SSA issues an approval for a modified onset date, reducing back pay by a certain number of months. 

It's likely not the size of the payout that is the problem. They take SSI cases, which would by definition be people with so few or no work credits that their work history is irrelevant to the amount they receive and they get a set need based amount, limiting back pay to that amount going back to the filing date or modified onset date. 

It's likely they won't take your case because, as you said, your conditions are difficult to prove and without more and better documentation, they believe you will lose. A lawyer isn't a magic approval button, and if they lose, they can't accept any payment, even if you want to pay them.

It took 11 years of looking (as opposed to it taking her doing online dating for 3 days before I messaged her), and I came close to giving up several times. I kept trying though, and we've both never been happier. 

Here's a few tips that I found helped a lot, and that Chloe said attracted her to me:

* Don't hide your disability. I can't stress this enough. I had my wheelchair clearly visible in my profile pictures, and stated that I was physically disabled at the beginning of my profile. If someone is turned off immediately by your disability, do you really want them in your love life? I even encouraged Chloe to ask me questions about my disability very early on, so that she would know what she was getting into. She appreciated how upfront I was.

* Speak in full sentences with proper grammar. The first thing I ever said to Chloe was ""Hello Chloe. How are you today?"". Most guys were messaging her things like ""how r u"" or ""Sup"". She said it was nice seeing somebody with a proper grasp of the English language.
* Be respectful. There are some truly rude people out there, and being respectful from message one got me huge brownie points.  
* Humor can be very useful. If someone isn't very used to being around somebody in a wheelchair, humor can be a great way to make them feel comfortable. In one of my first conversations with Chloe I was telling her why I just got a Master's instead of a PhD. I said ""You have to jump through too many hoops to get your dissertation funded. I'm in a wheelchair. Jumping is not my forte."" She said later that she fell for me because I could make jokes about my disability. She didn't feel like she had to walk on eggshells.

Person A gets cancer and needs extensive treatment. They will be given chemo for 6 months, followed by two months of radiation. Person A's doctors believe that A will be able to return to work two months after finishing radiation for a total of 10 months of disability.

Person B gets in a serious car wreck and permanently loses their ability to walk and type. 

Both A and B apply for SSDI. Person A is denied because their disability will last less than a year. Person B is approved because they are no longer able to make more than $1200 a month. B begins recording disability checks 5 months after their car accident until they are no longer disabled or they make more than $1200 a month.

If person B is a voice actor who makes more than $1200 a month, their SSDI would be denied.

Person B's SSDI check is going to depend on their work history. If B is young enough, they may be able to use their parent's work history. If B is 30 and becomes disabled after never working, they won't receive any money. 

If your brother had been disabled for less than 5 months, will be disabled for less than a year, or doesn't have a strong enough work history, he won't receive SSDI. 

Honestly, my husband is paralyzed (a pretty clear cut case of disability) and we used a disability lawyer who was worth every penny. Even with the lawyer, the process to get approved for SSDI took 5 months of phone calls, doctor's appointments, filling out forms, and more.

1089,"5 year old kids say shit because its how they feel at the time and they dont know any better. It doesnt make them bad kids, or inconsiderate, or anything particularly. It just makes them very young and inexperienced. Which is what they are at that age. Dont think this is about 'her'. Its not. Its about 5 year olds. Its one of the things they do (unfortunately!) :)

&amp;#x200B;

A really good way to teach kids about disability is with stories. Maybe  go see your school and community librarians and get the titles of some good kids fiction that handles issues of difference / and / issues of disability. Slot these in with her normal books and pick them up occasionally over the next few weeks or months - over a period of time so the ideas start to sink in.

&amp;#x200B;

When you read one of them, get her talking about how the people in the book might be feeling in the different situations that are depicted. No need for you to mention cousin's name, but she may well bring it up as she joins the dots to experiences of the characters in the books. Over time she will start to 'get' whats going on for him.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider there are a lot of adults who have plenty of years behind them who literally have no idea about 'difference'. They go through life with all sorts of wrong ideas about us, and remain ignorant because they have never been required to spend any time thinking about what it might be like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kids are no different. It just takes a bit of time and of course the opportunities to think about other peoples situations. The great thing about kids though -  different from adults - is that they are open to new ideas and absorb them so effortlessly.

However, take my words with a grain of salt. I am only a student. My opinion is based on what I learned so far and my own experience as a person born with a muscle illness. 

Your daughter crossed a line when she said those mean things to her cousin. It is definitely behavior that needs to be addressed. That said, it is also normal for a child her age to start seeing ""differences"" and point them out. She is about to learn social norms, like traditions, laws and rules too. It is up to you to teach her that she did something wrong and that the right thing to do is to apologize. This is a good opportunity to teach her a lesson in norms and values. Like protecting the vulnerable in society. Or, if you suspect that she was reacting to her cousin's behavior, a lesson in self-discipline (channeling anger in a positive way). 

As for the cousin, it is up to his mother to deal with that, so there is not much you can personally do. Boundary issues will probably disappear within a couple of years.

This tacked on another two years, but they did pay me (not my dependents though) for several months while they did their investigation. At this step, they ruled that the ALJ, who approved my claim at the first appeal hearing, had made an ""error of law"" with his decision. Mind you, I was still insured with all the credits necessary to be awarded *SSDI*. So, my case was remanded back to the ALJ LEVEL (BUT NOT THE SAME JUDGE), for a new hearing/decision. In the mean time, I had been so frustrated with my attorney &amp; after this incident of what I didn't understand &amp; my atty didn't seem to be familiar with the process either, I fired him. There was a bigger reason that I won't disclose here, but I reasoned to myself that since he didn't specialize in SS cases (he was normally a criminal law atty, but he did other areas as he decided &amp; he was someone I knew, so I just used him bc I was honestly just exhausted of doctors &amp; paperwork), I should see about getting a specialty SSDI/SSA attorney. It was actually hard &amp; confusing to switch attorneys, so I do not advise attempting it (I learned the hard way, story of my life), as a new attorney will be very leery of taking a case where another attorney had previously been signed onto, and the fired attorney has to agree to release you from fees, etc. I had good reason for him to not give me any trouble, but that's for another sub.

ANYWAY, keep in mind, my initial application started in 2009. I haven't worked since April 2010 -- going on NINE YEARS with this crap. 

So, on to the follow-up ALJ hearing/review that had been passed back to a new judge, as if I had just been denied. As you know, you do have a LDI (last date insured), which was quickly approaching, but I had applied in plenty of time so as long as this turned out in my favor, the LDI wouldn't be an issue. Well, my LDI came &amp; went. I still had nothing. Then came the ALJ hearing, which was via video conference (which my new attorney had never done before &amp; he did not like it at all, said he'd never do another). Guess what? My very experienced &amp; confident attorney said all went pretty well, and it should be fine. Well, Mr. ALJ wasn't having it. Denied completely. He even had the nerve to say I wasn't credible (bc some doctor visits had that I was ok, others had that I wasn't ok, but I'm fairly certain it's bc *I LOOK LIKE I'M OK*). I had status epileticus in front of the whole ER in a big city, level 5 trauma center, so plenty of medical professionals witnessed it. While I waited for that denial, my attorney (of course they are going to appeal the denial of that ALJ to the District Court [last chance stop] if the attorney takes your case, they believe they have good reason/evidence, so most will automatically go thru all the appeals available). That District Court judge upheld the denial of the ALJ, and now that my LDI had expired, I lost all of the SSDI &amp; backpay, which comes with benefits for my children, which we ended up with NOTHING.

During the wait time, my attorney had submitted an application for regular SSI (like I never worked), and it was denied on the initial application, but we just had an in-person (no video conference) hearing with a new ALJ.

It is now the end of 2018. I've lost everything. I am waiting on the outcome of this for SSI, which (if found 'favorable') is going to be half of the money I should have gotten/month. My children will not get any benefits from me being ill for so long (they've had to do without for a long time, and there's more to that situation). The backpay I should have gotten (which I could have bought a modest place to live &amp; not have to worry about being homeless ever again), is gone -- even though I paid into the system for well over 15 years of working. I was told the most likely reason I was denied (ie, my approval being sent to the Appeals Council in Falls Church, VA is virtually a denial at this point) was due to my age &amp; the amount of backpay that was headed my way (after being approved in 2012). They will say it's not true &amp; it's completely random, but how in the world does an experienced judge take my in-person testimony &amp; evidence, approve me, then I get so lucky to get chosen for an extra step of checking, just to be remanded back &amp; eventually DENIED. And why do I hear nothing of anyone over 50 being sent to the *APPEALS COUNCIL*? NOT to mention my LAST MY DATE OF LAST INSURED, so I get stuck into the entitlement arena of SOCIAL SECURITY (still not approved/favorable opinion) instead of the DISABILITY INSURANCE, for which I paid into &amp; should be entitled to, regardless of date of insured (in my opinion, that LDI should be discarded if you're found with a favorable SSI decision at a later date if for the same disabilities &amp; you haven't went back to work).

Ok, so my point after that whole story is: 1) I need more info in order to give you my experienced opinion &amp; 2) I HAVE YET TO BE APPROVED AFTER AN APPROVAL IN 2012, not worked since April 2010, and am now looking at $750/mo for the rest of my life, unless I can figure out a brilliant way to make enough money to dig out of this hole, all while miraculously making huge improvement &amp; having a better cure come to the field of epilepsy... I'm basically stuck. If I'm not approved for the entitlement SSI, I'm not sure what I'll do. I will be where it seems like you are, and I guess I'll try Vocational Rehab, if they have funding &amp; if they can find something I'm able to do. Otherwise, I'm just not sure what I'll do. I don't know what to tell you to do either, other than talk to me/this post &amp; an attorney (if you haven't already). 

Sorry this is so long. I'm in such a similar position to you. I'm EXCEPTIONALLY frustrated. And I cannot go without health insurance, and my State Medicaid has me approved based on SSA guidelines for disability/adult Medicaid -- you'd think the SSI would be approved considering Medicaid has been approved at this point. If I lose Medicaid, I will definitely get worse &amp; could die or end up costing the ""people"" a lot of money by not having medications necessary to keep my epilepsy under at least partial control. If I go work somewhere, I'd have to wait 3-6 months to get insurance, which leaves me without my expensive medication, which throws me right back into the ER, back at square one.

I don't know where to go from there/here, anymore.

I'm still relatively young, and have lost the last 21 years to my disease/injuries/mental illnesses creeping their way in... but I tried to keep on keeping on -- it's just not an easy place to be, nor are there any easy ways to make life better.

I feel for you. If you'd prefer to privately message me, I'm fine with it. I'm not the best 'pen-pal', but at least you can know you're not alone in the mix. Maybe you know more than I do, maybe we can bounce ideas off of each other. It can't hurt anything.

I was told the most likely reason I was denied (ie, my approval being sent to the Appeals Council in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> is virtually a denial at this point) was due to my age &amp; the amount of backpay that was headed my way (after being approved in 2012). They will say it's not true &amp; it's completely random, but how in the world does an experienced judge take my in-person testimony &amp; evidence, approve me, then I get so lucky to get chosen for an extra step of checking, just to be remanded back &amp; eventually DENIED. And why do I hear nothing of anyone over 50 being sent to the *APPEALS COUNCIL*? NOT to mention my LAST MY DATE OF LAST INSURED, so I get stuck into the entitlement arena of SOCIAL SECURITY (still not approved/favorable opinion) instead of the DISABILITY INSURANCE, for which I paid into &amp; should be entitled to, regardless of date of insured (in my opinion, that LDI should be discarded if you're found with a favorable SSI decision at a later date if for the same disabilities &amp; you haven't went back to work).

Ok, so my point after that whole story is: 1) I need more info in order to give you my experienced opinion &amp; 2) I HAVE YET TO BE APPROVED AFTER AN APPROVAL IN 2012, not worked since April 2010, and am now looking at $750/mo for the rest of my life, unless I can figure out a brilliant way to make enough money to dig out of this hole, all while miraculously making huge improvement &amp; having a better cure come to the field of epilepsy... I'm basically stuck. If I'm not approved for the entitlement SSI, I'm not sure what I'll do. I will be where it seems like you are, and I guess I'll try <PERSON>, if they have funding &amp; if they can find something I'm able to do. Otherwise, I'm just not sure what I'll do. I don't know what to tell you to do either, other than talk to me/this post &amp; an attorney (if you haven't already). 

Sorry this is so long. I'm in such a similar position to you. I'm EXCEPTIONALLY frustrated. And I cannot go without health insurance, and my State Medicaid has me approved based on SSA guidelines for disability/adult Medicaid -- you'd think the SSI would be approved considering Medicaid has been approved at this point. If I lose Medicaid, I will definitely get worse &amp; could die or end up costing the ""people"" a lot of money by not having medications necessary to keep my epilepsy under at least partial control. If I go work somewhere, I'd have to wait 3-6 months to get insurance, which leaves me without my expensive medication, which throws me right back into the ER, back at square one.

I don't know where to go from there/here, anymore.

I'm still relatively young, and have lost the last 21 years to my disease/injuries/mental illnesses creeping their way in... but I tried to keep on keeping on -- it's just not an easy place to be, nor are there any easy ways to make life better.

I feel for you. If you'd prefer to privately message me, I'm fine with it. I'm not the best 'pen-pal', but at least you can know you're not alone in the mix. Maybe you know more than I do, maybe we can bounce ideas off of each other. It can't hurt anything.

Regardless, I wish you luck &amp; send you well wishes for things to get better for you, if possible ��","[{'start': 5854, 'end': 5862, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 4308, 'end': 4318, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 4296, 'end': 4306, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2574, 'end': 2582, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 375, 'end': 385, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 363, 'end': 373, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

- **NVDA** is your best start. it is free open source software created by blind software developers. it allows blind users to use a computer without using a mouse or a monitor. everything is read out loud using text-to-speech. it can take a while to get used to it because it is kind of like relearning everything you know about computers from scratch.

- **JAWS** is just like NVDA but its kind of expensive. most blind people like having both because they have slightly different strengths and weaknesses. this software is probably a good investment.

- **zoomTEXT** will allow a blind user to zoom in on text and pictures. good if they still have some vision. i believe it also has some text-to-speech but wouldn't be good for someone with complete vision loss.

- **windows 10** has a lot of hidden accessibility features that can be very useful like **narrator**. it also comes with windows edge that has text-to-speech but i suspect it is only really useful if a user has some vision.

If you are unable to work because of an Illness, injury, or disability, disability insurance may pay part of your income. Most states do NOT have state sponsored disability insurance. Most people with disability insurance have a plan through their employer or privately. 

If you have worked at your current job long enough and your employer is large enough, you may qualify for FMLA. This will hold your job for up to 12 weeks. You do not get paid while on FMLA unless you have access to disability insurance.

You will need a doctor's note saying that you are unable to work before qualifying for disability.

SSDI approval takes 3-years in most of the country. That’s three years you’re essentially out of work with no income. It’s tough. Some states (California) are around 18-months due to a pilot program they are trying. There are some auto-qualifying conditions (6 months), but don’t expect it. 


Generally speaking you need three things: 

First is a diagnosis. You need to have something solid to ground your application on.

Second is medical records. Generally several years worth, because you have to show that you aren’t likely to improve and that all reasonable treatments have been tried. This can be hard if you haven’t had the money to go to the doctor consistently, but it’s probably the most important part.

Third is a doctor that supports you filing for disability. You can ask them to write a letter for you, and that carries a lot of weight with SSA. If you doctor does *not* support you filing, you’re going to have an extreme uphill fight because the SSA of very likely going to contact them. Even if they only ask for records, you don’t know what that doctor has written that might torpedo your case.

There are of course other things that are required for the application, filing deadlines, etc., but the three points above are, in my opinion, the most critical.
