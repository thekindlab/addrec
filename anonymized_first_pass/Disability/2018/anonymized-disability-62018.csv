Under Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), those applying for Canadian permanent resident status may have their application refused if they, or one of their family members, has a medical condition which will cause excessive demand on Canada’s health and social services. Before these new changes were announced, excessive demand was based on a cost threshold of $6,655 CAD per year. If an immigration applicant could reasonably be expected to have higher costs than this amount, their application would be refused on the grounds of medical inadmissibility.  
  
By increasing the cost threshold for medical inadmissibility, there will be more leniency for immigration applicants who require regular prescription drug treatment.

15,"I think this depends heavily on where you seek out meeting new people. Most of my friends have been met through my major hobbies and there tends to be quite the variety of people I've met at soon as you cover up the shared hobby. Outside of regular events in a public space (Monday night board games in my case), I end up with very little time to set aside for socializing while still getting my errands and home life taken care of as well as my self time, which I feel is normal within adult lives.   

Those I consider my common social buddies tend to change out every 2\-5 years (commonly due to moving or just not clicking long term) and I don't get too hung up on it. It's not uncommon for me to happen to make other friends with disabilities who do in part understand the need to vent or complications in getting people together. Overall, I've personally met a lot of other people where it just happens they also have a disability, but we met over a game of Cursed Court. Can't speak for other localities but my local boardgame groups tend to be a bit more accommodating anyways, as the want for games to be accessible as far as basic play has been sought after.   

As far as the pity goes, I run into it a good bit at first but my own demeanor might be part to what pushes people past that. I've always felt it's not that they don't want to go the extra mile, they just don't know which extra mile to take and tend to feel really awkward about asking.

Second - especially if you have any form of sensation loss, even mild - get yourself a cushion that gives you pressure relief. Foam isn’t good enough and once it gets hot and damp from your body it breaks down. Get a light cushion like a Supracor or Varilite that will give you reasonable pressure relief and comfort. Protecting your skin on your ischial bones (in your bum) is really important for anyone using a chair for 50% or more of their waking hours. 

If you can, find a chair that fits you properly - if your need for a wheelchair gets more permanent, consider seeing an Occupational Therapist with seating experience.

46,"I have had this chair for a few years now, coming from a TDX5, and it is my favorite of all the wheelchairs I've ever used.

I have only ever had one problem with ""wet weather"" and that was a brief motor fault (locked up and wouldn't allow drive) after directly spraying it with a hose while cleaning mud off the tires. It faulted, I restarted the chair after letting it sit for 30 seconds or so and it was fine again. Rain and reasonable puddles haven't slowed me a bit.

As for grocery shopping, without more info, I can't really help. It is a pack mule and can be loaded with considerable weight without sacrificing stability... but there isn't a ton of storage space like on a typical scooter. Hanging bags from the chair should be fine, however. I have never had an issue. My driveway is inclined somewhere between 25 and 30 degrees (live up on a large hill) and this is the most stable chair I've taken on it, even loaded with heavy bags. Still have to be careful - no chair is perfectly stable.

This chair is a beast. It can handle even large curbs with only minor assistance and smaller curbs/obstacles are never an issue. Basically, it can handle rough terrain, but it is not an off-road specialty chair, so try and go over a fallen tree or something, you might get totally stuck. Drive through beach sand or deep mud, you might get stuck. Any normal, day to day off-road stuff - this chair is one of the best.

I hope you enjoy it, it's been my favorite chair ever. As an added tip, the chair has a programmer built in to the control module (depending on which controller you end up getting) that will let you set program speeds and such, but most places that service this chair have access to the PC software chair programmer which allows for much more in-depth customization of the chair.

A few other things which you'd need to consider. How long can you not go to the bathroom for? Bathrooms are very very small, and the aisle chair which you enter on is kept in the airport (not the plane) so have a plan regarding that.

How big is your chair, what sort of battery does it have (if applicable) and how fragile is it? Chairs just get put with regular luggage so if they are fragile it is possible that things can be broken mid-flight/handeling in and out of plane. I have had a few bent footplates etc but thankfully nothing major yet. Be sure to get your control panel off of the chair and take it on carry on to minimise the chance that it gets broken (if you break that and your overseas your in trouble. Bigger chairs may not be allowed on the flight either due to just being really heavy or too big to fit in the door. Most airlines are good at getting the info they need to either tell you which flights would work or scheduling the right planes to accommodate, but some may be better than others. 

On that last topic, some cultures are better than others with these aspects. For example, When we arrived in Abu Dhabi I had a guard prod the chair with a machine gun (being 8 at the time I had no idea of it) as he thought I was a bomb. Then when we left there and went to Paris, the chair was just sent down the luggage carousel in shrink-wrap, which was not fun to get out of. Most good airlines will either allow you to transfer at the last minute before boarding at the gate and then transfer to your chair as you get off of the plane. If that can't be done they usually put the chair through oversize luggage where it can be returned to you not shrink-wrapped.

Make sure you have clearly labelled spares with you and maybe even label them in the language of the place you go to, to ensure that no confusion arises over what the objects are.

Finally, most wheelchair hotel rooms are just normal hotel rooms without a step and with wider doors, and usually a roll-in shower. They don't provide equipment like hoists (sometimes there is a very basic commode), so if you need any of those either buy one or try to find a loanable one in the area. From my experience (granted on this front it is limited) they can be very pricey at times. Most beds are solid beneath so ask for a bed with nothing below; however, don't trust that this will occur as hotels usually aren't great at accommodating specialist disability requests. Have a backup procedure for these events.

I hope that list helps and sorry for the wall of text. Good luck!

A few other things which you'd need to consider. How long can you not go to the bathroom for? Bathrooms are very very small, and the aisle chair which you enter on is kept in the airport (not the plane) so have a plan regarding that.

How big is your chair, what sort of battery does it have (if applicable) and how fragile is it? Chairs just get put with regular luggage so if they are fragile it is possible that things can be broken mid-flight/handeling in and out of plane. I have had a few bent footplates etc but thankfully nothing major yet. Be sure to get your control panel off of the chair and take it on carry on to minimise the chance that it gets broken (if you break that and your overseas your in trouble.

242,"Alright, so, first of all: You have a right to 'An Adequate Standard of Living', Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. So, fuck this nonsense about being a 'leech' for receiving rights every one of us is entitled to.  


Second of all: You're not a leech. A leech is someone who engages in rent-seeking. Some of the most highly rewarded people in our society generate vast quantities of wealth for themselves without actually generating any value for the society they live in. Nobody perceives them as leeches, though, because nobody takes two fucking seconds to think about the reality of our economic system.  


Anyone who's concerned about the most disenfranchised members of our society 'taking advantage of welfare' needs a serious reality check. These are the types of inhumane assholes who will debate fiercely over why a minimum wage hurts workers but will laugh at the suggestion there should be a maximum wage. All you're doing is trying to live adequately, there's nothing wrong with that, in fact, more people should be focused on just having an adequate life, but, nope. Most people are focused on 'having it all', and their ego is attached to the idea that they're somehow responsible for the fact that they can be successful, and if you can't be successful their ego won't let them believe it's entirely due to luck, because then they have to admit that any success they have is due to luck as well.  


I know it's hard to ignore, but shit man, you have enough to worry about without letting people who are simply ignorant get you down.

247,"Full time wheelchair user here. You're going to hurt your shoulders and arms at first, especially with a heavy cheap chair. Lots of practice in short bursts, and practicing with someone to help on uneven ground will help you.
Think about how you want to carry things - handbags are a little more difficult if you're pushing yourself around. I have a pannier and a bag attached underneath my chair for storage, and I'm very good at holding things between my knees.
Get gloves, or get callouses. Even pushing for a short period can cause blisters if you don't have any callouses. You can push through it and build them up or you can get gloves with extra padding and grip. Also, be aware that you'll probably break your nails fairly regularly, especially if you have push on brakes.
Speaking of breaking nails, you should keep plasters with you, especially if you're not using gloves. They're great for covering blisters, and you're going to knock your hands against a lot of things while you're learning to move around in the chair (doorways are especially good at skinning knuckles).
You should be aware that your clothes will likely get some dirt on them from the wheels, and your hands definitely will. Baby wipes are a lifesaver, and I always keep some in the bag on my chair.
Be careful when going over rough ground, shifting your weight back slightly if you can't do a wheelie will help. At least until you get the hang of it, you'll probably want someone there for curbs, just in case.
Lastly, if you fall it's not the end of the world. People walking trip and fall all the time - we do too. Make sure to have anti tips on if you don't think you can catch yourself, but otherwise just pull yourself back in and move on. You didn't learn to walk without ever falling, you likely will have at least one misjudgement in your chair. If you can get back in the chair and carry on, you'll be a lot more confident the next time.

Look into a private criminal complaint. This is a document that you can file in municipal court that will lead to criminal charges being placed against the offender without the police. Unsure if Florida allows this so go talk to your municipal or district court house.

 Florida has empowered the states attorney generals office with the sole right and responsibility to file criminal charges from the state. I would contact their office and state that this action is persuasive and persistent by multiple offenders. The individuals are in violation of The 2018 Florida Statues, Statue 316.1955 Enforcement of parking requirements for persons who have disabilities.

Also let them know if the officers continue to act in such disregard for the law they are opening themselves up for legal action under the ADA for discrimination.

315,"I got my girlfriend an Apple Watch for Mother's Day and when setting it up one of the first questions it asked is ""Are you a wheelchair user?"".  After seeing that and doing a little reading, I decided to get one for myself.  I too am a paraplegic who uses a manual chair.  I've been working on trying to lose some weight and get into better shape and so far the watch has been a pretty good tool for measuring your activity.  One thing it measures is ""Total Pushes"".  It's not perfect, but it's close enough to give you a good idea of what you've done for the day.  For example, I put it on and pushed 9 times, and the watch read 9 times.  But at the same time I sat on the couch with my daughter and when I got up it had said I had done a few pushes.  That's likely just from any activity on the couch and transferring back into my chair.  

There's other apps out there for the Apple Watch as well that might be more useful, and I've seen a few, but I just haven't had the time to look into them in depth.  My 5-month-old daughter keeps us busy, so for right now the activity tracker on the watch is good enough for me.  It measures pushes, calories burned, and has exercise and roll goals for the day.  That and the heart rate monitor is pretty cool.

I've already had to fight two wrongful terminations of benefits with my ERISA disability, and it makes me worry about having what I say be misinterpreted in the hearing. I had a meltdown with the first attorney when he came off as adversarial (he said things to me insinuating that HE thought I was malingering).

I had another panic attack with a guy doing a psych eval that the first attorney sent me to, for suggesting that it's all in my head. Both times, I couldn't calm down until getting meds in me. This new law firm is going to start prep work in the next couple of weeks with me, but after the bad experience with the first guy, I just don't have much trust for my new representation.

My mom let the crisis line worker in the house without telling me anything. I get out of the shower and I see the shadow of a dude on the wall.

I say ""Is there someone in here?""

""Yes entent, I'm here to help"" in a Buffalo Bill sounding voice.

""Uh, I'm naked, I don't want your help, and I'm kind of having a panic attack about this whole situation now."" I said nervously.

""Okay, I will let you dry off; but i still need to talk to you.""

I locked the door right away. Said I didn't feel comfortable talking to that worker because of the awkward introduction. I didn't think their assessment of me could be valid.

Someone asked me through the door if I would talk to someone else. I said yes.

The next thing I know there's about 5-6 cops in the house. (My mom told them I would commit suicide by cop if the cops were called on me apparently. Although I have no weapons or violent history.)

I locked the door right away. Said I didn't feel comfortable talking to that worker because of the awkward introduction. I didn't think their assessment of me could be valid.

Someone asked me through the door if I would talk to someone else. I said yes.

The next thing I know there's about 5-6 cops in the house. (My mom told them I would commit suicide by cop if the cops were called on me apparently. Although I have no weapons or violent history.)

You're getting more of this than you were before, but you've been sidetracked by the word games and lies and orwellian names of pieces of legislation the Republicans are so well practiced in using.

They will argue semantics but the big picture conclusion is that their agenda includes stripping the disabled of all public services so we can ""pull ourselves up by our bootstraps"" (for us; die).

You must put aside their deceptions and doublespeak and look at what ultimate ends they continue to contribute to.

Even Obamacare's flaws and expenses that are higher than they should be are there because of changes the Republican party forced through so that the final legislation could pass. If they had not interfered as such, we would have made a meaningful step towards universal single payer healthcare. If not for the Republicans we may have had it already.

There is a great deal of deception in the way the Republican party interfaces with its members. As such, we have people voting for things that in reality will harm us, but they are told these things will help us.

Many of them simply know not what they do. Others are more direct about wanting to bring about these ends against us. But every voter who casts theirs in support of this party makes them complicit in the party's activities, and responsible for what their vote ends up enabling.

And their vote enabled my food stamps to be cut down to a third of what they were. They complicated my local adult care management patient requirements by legislating to deliberately make it more difficult to keep services, and then took services away for over half a year, causing numerous health and housecleaning crises as I was abandoned without help I was mandated to get. They are once again trying to make it impossible for people with pre existing conditions to have health insurance. They are working to undo the provision that made it possible for me to live in disability housing, while the only other option is the street.

Look at the consequences of the party's actions, not the flowery promises they make.

If you are disabled, the services that allow you to survive, like mine, are on the chopping block. And it is Republicans who are eagerly readying their cleavers.

They are trying to take away the meager little that keeps me alive. That keeps you alive. And you are defending them. It's like Stockholm syndrome. Remember what's important. Your life, your health, your future. Don't let a party who doesn't care about those things use you to destroy them in yourself and others like you.

Look at the forest beyond the trees; each tree has a charming and convincing misdirection for you, but the ultimate goal of Republican policies regarding the disabled and elderly is to thin our numbers so they don't have to pay for decades more of expensive chronic doctor visits. 

They want to starve us. (Did i mention my food stamps were halted arbitrarily after a Republican announcement that they were making cuts. My health is only getting worse and they took my food stamps away to help Trump show off how far he had already pushed down the number of people on food stamps. [Pure evil entirely at the expense of the disabled.] I am still fighting to get them back when they should have never been stopped. I can barely eat because of their wilful devaluation of and  disregard for my life.

They want to deny us medical care. New hurdles and complexities of the requirements to obtain - and then the requirements to keep - medicare and medicaid keep popping up due to Republican efforts.  They started with a system that even fully abled individuals must seek expert help to navigate or understand what is happening with their benefits and find out what they need to do. Then they make it even more complicated and difficult to complete - and officially imposed these requirements on people with all forms of disabilities.

Will the barely functional and unable to work be able to navigate and complete all of the new requirements in order to keep their health care coverage?

Spoiler: a lot of people who need this heath coverage are losing it because they are unABLE to complete these expert tasks. Especially those who do not have a caregiver managing their benefits and case, just didn't stand a chance to keep their care.

This is immediately devestating and usually forces the disabled person off their prescription medications because of their cost. This alone can be fatal.
Our deaths build in their wake and they either don't even seem to realize that is happening, or celebrate the thinning of the herd; depending on what kind of Republican they are. I do feel sorry for the ones who do not yet understand the consequences of supporting campaigns like these.

They want us to be forced to live in the street. (This one is like torment twofer for them, as the success they get in stopping the funding that allowed me a roof and bed is added to by the knowledge that a disabled chronically ill person's life expectancy will drop sharply if they see forced to live homeless.)

If you are disabled,

You are voluntarily helping people who wish to destroy you, me and countless others like us. If you can see their true agenda regarding us, as I have explained above, I just feel like the normal response would be to double down on defending ourselves and our community, not the ones who don't want us to exist.

404,"&gt; Any SSI she receives before SSDI will be offset from the SSDI retroactive pay, so it won't create an overpayment.

Ah, good to know, thank you! That was my concern, that since she won't be eligible for SSI once SSDI's end is finalized, they'd realize that and want the funds back -- but if it just comes out of the back-pay, there's no need to fret about it.

&gt; SSI back payments only are made in installments - SSDI is all at once. She would need to put in a written request for an early SSI installment payment, spelling out what it is needed for.

My concern is that since she's eligible for SSI during the first five months (as is my understanding, anyway), she's subject to the disbursement rules for SSI, not SSDI (that is, installments, not lump sum). Is that correct? Would that written request be submitted to the local SSA office? If so, would just a free-form ""I'm requesting blah-blah-blah"" work or is there a form? Finally, could it be submitted *now* or would it have to wait until the SSDI has finalized its calculations, etc and we get the award letter?

&gt; Likely a couple of months - once SSI is done with their part, the payment center has to do the offset calculations before releasing the retroactive SSDI, and unfortunately there's a lot of backlog.

409,"I can't believe I'm responding to this but here I am. I have cerebral palsy. I am however, very intelligent and manage to take care of my own finances, and have a normal marriage to the fullest extent. This is great and all, but what no one told me was how gut wrenchingly hard it would be to live normally in a world that sees you as anything but that.

Sex and relationships are challenging in many ways. I don't have intellectual issues, but I do live with other issues such as: ""What can I do for my able-bodied spouse?"" ""What do I have to offer them?"" 

Marriage is great for those like myself who have a basic idea of how the world works and can readily tell you what their needs are. Basically, there is a need to be persistent and prepared for the world to chew you up and spit you out, and being a person who can roll with the punches. If someone cannot do that, disabled or not, things will crumble. Sex does not alleviate the struggle of a disability. Life hurts, especially to those who may not have had any life experience. Feelings get hurt. 

there also has to be something of an understanding that finances must remain steady for one partner, such as staying on SSI or disability until the challenged person can find a way to live without the money each month. This also in a way means that progression isnt as feasible for the other partner, unless they put the challenged spouse in jeopardy. In laws also have to be extremely flexible, and this is something I still struggle with. My spouse is ""normal"" but as I have more life experience and grit, it balances out. I take care of them sometimes more than they take care of me, but its the kind of thing you can't see. My spouse can do the footwork, but I am the brains. I say this not in a mean way, my spouse is totally normal. I just mean this in regards to how the dynamic works.

I am not handicapped just because I'm sitting in a wheelchair. There is no lack of intellect. I have the ability to consent. I have the ability to think myself out of a sticky situation. I am resourceful in many ways. That is how I survive. For anyone else, however, igniting the emotions of sex and love may be too much especially out of exploitation or pawning them off on another person.

This whole post spells disaster, and is disgusting. Do not listen to this person. That is laziness. That is a poor excuse for not wanting to help someone.

If life is hard for me and I have all my senses, what would become of the person who does not? It is nonsense.

Sex will worsen things if she cannot give consent or if she does not have the life skills to deal with the consequences of sex.

(For the record, I do not think disabled people should have any less of an opportunity for typical life experiences like marriage and children, nor do I think someone who chooses to have a relationship with someone who is disabled should be driven away by the disabled partners limits.

489,"You make a lot of presumptions about what I do or do not understand.

in this instance, all of them were incorrect, concerning what I do or do not understand. I'm not going to attempt to defend the GOP's legislative ""successes,"" as I am not a supporter of the Republican party, nor do they represent me.

I *do* look at the consequences of the actions of a party. I look at the higher medical expenses because, for example, my specialist's bi-weekly support group, which was free, is no longer free, but $140 per session, which I can't afford (so I don't go), because the ADA made providing a free service illegal. That wasn't the republican's who did that. That is only a single example of many, many examples of care which I need, but can no longer access *because* of the very programs presented as the cures for these problems.

Anecdote is an interesting beast like that.

Yes, the republicans 'fought' to prevent single payer in the US; and as I've pointed out before, that's based in strong economic fact, not ideological theory. Canada's single payer system was ruled an human rights violation, the UK's is nearly bankrupt. Iceland, norway, and others are literally pushing eugenics to get disabled people out of the system.

I *do* look at the results, not the promises. The GOP's plan isn't fantastic. I don't support it. But I *completely* oppose single payer plans, like those pushed for by Sanders; because the result, in *every case,* has been decreased quality of care, and decreased access to care, for those who most need it, like us.

You keep insisting that the GOP wants to deny us care; that they want us to die in the streets; that they want those incapable of providing for themselves to ""pull themselves up by the bootstraps..."" and you've got zero evidence to support those claims, other than that they oppose your desired political goals.

However, as I've said multiple times, there are those on the left literally calling for our deaths (not you and I specifically, but some groups of the disabled community, generally). That's happened before, and it's happening again.

And yet, I don't think that you're either ignorant nor malicious. Why? Because, in spite of our disagreements, I get your point of view. I know where you're coming from. I flatter myself that if were you really able to look at the data, you'd probably be much closer to my views than you are... but I'm also not so naive as to assume that I'm always correct; so I'm always looking at new data, particularly those data which challenge my views. I've had to change some of them. I've become further convinced of others. But I don't demonize you, even though I think you're wrong, because I recognize that the economy in general, medical care more specifically, and government intervention in the health care system specifically, is such a complicated and multifaceted issue that there are going to be well informed, good-hearted, and well intentioned people along the whole spectrum of the discussion. 

To demonize you because I disagree with you (yes, to the point that I am convinced, based off of history, that if we followed your prescribed policy decisions, most of us in this sub would be dead in a matter of years...), would assume that I am incapable of being wrong; it would presume that there is no room for discussion, after all if I'm right, and you're evil, what is the point of discussion? Why should we debate the points? Why shouldn't I just lock you up, or even harm you? That's not helpful, is it? So I assume that you're *not* evil. Of course I believe that I'm right, but I'm willing to accept that I'm not; and as a consequence, I'm happy to engage on any issue, assuming that the other parties are willing to engage as well... but it's really hard to maintain that attitude when I'm simply a nazi for not supporting the democrats (never mind that the nazi's are socialists, which I am not... or that my wife and kids are Jewish, making me a really bad nazi....), or that I'm a dirty communist for not supporting the republicans (never mind that the republicans haven't had any idea what their views are, other than ""anti-whatever-the-hell-the-democrats-stand-for, for the last 20 years; nor that I've been a vocal opponent of that party); or that I'm some disgusting deplorable for failing to vote for Clinton, and a stupid libtard for not having voted for trump.... see, it's really hard to have any sort of discussion when I'm nothing but some caricature for not being exactly what the person I'm trying to talk with wants me to be. If we aren't willing to look at each other like people, how will we be anything but divided?

Well, I'm rambling now, too.

I'll sum up with this: I think you're entirely wrong on this issue, but I still don't think you're evil or out to kill the disabled, even if I'm convinced that your proposed policies will lead to that end, since they always have before. Moreover, the caustic demonization of entire classes of people (whether it be ""republicans,"" or ""undesirables"" or ""socialists"" or pick your label) is both unhelpful and divisive.

Further, even if you believe that I'm completely wrong (fair enough, it's happened before), and that the Republicans *are* evil, and *do* want the disabled to die in the streets... you're not going to convince anyone to your side with the approach of ""anyone who disagrees with me is stupid, ignorant, or malicious;"" that's just a little friendly, unsolicited, and probably unwelcome advice from a stranger on the internet.

I got sick right before my senior year, and seniors were allowed to take less classes if they did not need them to graduate. I believe they could have 2 classes off? Well because of my situation they allowed me to just take the classes I needed to graduate. I think I only had like 3 classes total.

Of course I needed many doctors notes backing up my illness, and I was extremely sick back then (at one point I was hospitalized). So don't go into the meeting thinking you will get all your classes off :)

* elevator key (needed to use the elevator)

* extra time during passing periods so I was able to rest if I felt light headed

* I was given a teacher parking sticker, so I could park up front at the school

* Instead of taking notes myself, I would ask to have them printed out if available

* I'm not sure how your classes are picked or laid out, but I would ask to get first priority on the classes that work best for you. Maybe if you are not allowed to special pick your classes, maybe you can ask to get that. Example, we had A/B classes that switched off back and forth.

526,"Is this a recent injury? The workers comp and disability systems, while they have some overlap, are still very different. 

First, the Workers Comp (WC) - has he already started this process? If not, he needs to do that like, yesterday. If this is a significant injury I honestly recommend getting a WC attorney. The way the WC works is that first they will pay all the medical bills related to the injury, and he can also be given a certain percentage of permanent 'disability' from it. This can result in a lump sum payment, or it can be more of an annuity situation. 

For SSDI disability - unless he is 66 or older, he can apply for SSDI. If he has reached his full retirement age he doesn't have this option. In order to be disabling, his injury is going to have to prevent ALL forms of employment for at least 12 months, or be expected to last 12 months. WC looks at their ability to do the job they have, but SSDI looks at all types of employment. Consideration is given for his age, education, and his past work. So, if he has never had a sedentary job, they aren't just going to expect him to go get one in his 60s. 

Him getting workers comp **does not** qualify him for disability automatically, he has to qualify based on the medical records. He can have concurrent SSDI and WC processes going on, he doesn't have to just file for one or the other. At this juncture (assuming injury is recent) WC is more important to deal with than SSDI. 

He does not need an attorney for the SSDI process - people always say that you do, but when you first apply you really don't. however, if he does get a WC attorney, a lot of times they will do dual WC/SSDI claims.

Yeah, the maeng da affected me in a way I would describe as halfway between gabapentin and adderall, kind of feeling definitely medicated but clearminded as well. Gabapentin is my current anxiety rx, but I got accused of being addicted to that last time. While you can be *dependent* on gabapentin and even experience withdrawal, addiction specialists agree that it doesnt produce addictive behavior. If I run out, I kinda just go ""oh well"" and wait until I can fill it again, I don't go out trying to buy it. Its main illicit use is potentiating opiates, or getting through withdrawal from them.  
The reason I keep getting accused of drug seeking is I'm an unapologetic cannabis user, which is so stupid because I would have a medical card if it didn't cost well over a grand to get one in my state, with an ounce of medical costing $500.

In the meantime, do you feel able to ask one of your classmates to help you go over the basics? Or is there a local dance school offering adult beginner's classes? I used to teach a bunch of absolute beginners before I got ill, and they all knew nothing when they came to me. A short while after getting the  class, I was able to ask them all what positions of feet and arms were which, and they all knew what they were doing. They all blossomed really well, even though a lot of them found it a challenge.  Two years after I took them on, they all had a more than average grounding in ballet and loved their lessons. Several are now working on their first exam with a different teacher. 

There should be some help for you where you're studying, too. I wonder if student services have any help for you? 

As far as your letter goes, write that you feel you need one on one tuition with someone who can teach you the basics, more time to pick up choreography, the ability to record the dances you're doing (that can and will help you learn more of the basics) and the ability to miss classes if your anxiety is absolutely overwhelming that day.

It would be virtually impossible for any of us to tell you if your attorney acted correctly as we do not have the facts of the case. We have your version of events from a layperson's perspective and to be honest, you don't know enough about law to know what is important and what isn't once you get down into the weeds of a case (this is made obvious by your indignation that the Judge did not follow advisement, He/She is a Judge and has broad discretion on many issues, especially in family law). It is overwhelmingly likely that your lawyer did just fine, but you are unsatisfied with the outcome. If I were you, I would continue with the same attorney as you are not especially likely to get a better outcome with another attorney, but you will spend a lot of time and money to get the new counsel up to speed.

TL;DR: Your lawyer is probably fine but should communicate as promptly as reasonably possible. There is probably nothing you can do in your situation that isn't quite expensive and is still unlikely to change the outcome.

692,"So, a couple of things. One, I can completely understand your feelings of frustration. The lack of reliable, accessible, transportation is one of the major factors that leads to social segregation of people with disabilities in this country. Having said that, you may have options. For instance, I do not know the specifics of how such things work in CA, but if you are on Medicaid \- you may qualify for free public transit. It goes by different names in different cities. Yes, it's not a perfect situation, but it is the beginning of one.

Alternatively, another commenter mentioned the possibility of moving to a city with a more robust public transit. If you are in a position to do so \- do it. This is what I am doing, in part. The urban landscape is typically better for PWDs anyway. Given the increased access to employment opportunities and medical treatment. Granted, I bring these two aspects up because they figure largely into my life as important factors \- as someone with CP in a wheelchair.

Lastly, and this is just a bit of advice. Don't judge your success by someone else's metrics. What matters is to have a goal \- and to work towards that. So what if it takes you a long time? You should do what makes you happy, and if someone makes you feel bad for taking a different path, fuck em. Or, you know \- you could point to the systemic economic oppression of PWDs, the aforementioned social segregation and bias, and *then* say fuck 'em. ��   ",False,False,,WheeledGnosis,Cerebral Palsy,,1528206946,t5_2qhe8,t3_8omg1q,t3_8omg1q,2,1532215608,0,0,e05dwcc,disability,,,,,

So, the evaluation they consider is about how it impairs your ability to function.

They ask questions like, how far can you walk, how much weight can you lift, can you sit, stand, pull, push, etc—when it comes to he physical stuff.

Then with the cognitive stuff, they look at your ability to concentrate, remember things, your sensitivity to environments, your ability to cope under stress, and stuff like that.

As long as it all combines to limit your function “substantially” so that you can’t work “gainfully,” you would have a chance of getting approved.

However, and this is a big however, there are two disability insurance programs in the U.S.—SSDI and SSI. SSDI does not have a means threshold (so if you are married and your spouse works and makes a decent living, you can still qualify for benefits for yourself.) To qualify for SSDI, you have to have [earned credits](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/page10-13.html) by working and paying into the system. SSI is a need-based program, so you would only qualify for that if your household brings in very, very little income, but there are no past work requirements. 

It can also take a long time to apply for benefits. I’m not sure, but there may be citizenship or other restrictions you would need to look into. My advice would be to talk to a lawyer who specializes in disability benefits in the state you are considering moving to. While the disability benefits programs are federal programs, they are administered by the states and each state has its quirks when it comes to getting approved for benefits.

Hope that helps! Best wishes!

Perhaps this is a function of the fact that such disabilities don't often lend themselves to poetic language, or, if we were being fancy – we might say, chronic pain doesn't always lend itself to the Western cultural Poesis. Because, I enjoy fancy language. ��   


\(I do believe that there are a couple books here where characters deal with chronic pain, however.\)

In any case, this is a list that is more or less from the top of my head. I hope you \(or anyone else who wishes to do so\)  find something here  to enjoy. And of course, it may be the case that you have already read some of these. I cannot speak to your prior experience. So, without further ado, and in no particular order:

1\) *The Ables*  – by Jeremy Scott \[this is a YA Adventure about disabled superheroes. The writing style is a bit poppy –  but for concept alone, it deserves a read, I think.  the main character is blind and telekinetic. I believe one of the characters here deals with chronic pain, and is autistic.\]

2\) *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night\-Time* – by Mark Haddon \[this is a British mystery novel, although it could just as easily be characterized as literary fiction. The main character has autism, and he is obsessed with solving the ""curious incident"" of the title\]

3\) *The Homecoming Saga* \&lt;the first book is* The Memory of Eart*h\&gt; – by Orson Scott Card \[I am conflicted on this series, as well as by Card himself, these days. On the one hand, growing up, I loved Card's books – particularly this series – precisely because 1 of the main characters has some sort of mobility disability. Personally, I would like to think that it is some derivation of cerebral palsy. Because Card has said a number of times that this character was modeled after he son, who had cerebral palsy. That is, he is no longer alive. So, this was 1 of the 1st works of fiction where I saw someone like myself reflected.

It has gotten harder for me to read Card these days. Mostly due to the fact that as an author outside of his novels, he has gotten a lot more vocal about his own conservative viewpoint. This is a viewpoint that I vehemently disagree with. And one that has always struck me as additionally curious \(to borrow a phrase from an earlier entry on this list\) precisely because his sci\-fi works have always been strongly egalitarian, at least, it in so far as I read them to be. In any case, for me, this was a seminal work of sci\-fi because it centers the narrative, in part, around a disabled character. And while chronic pain as such is not continually referenced – the character does have monologues about what it is like to be in pain because of his disability.\]

4\) *Akata Witch* – by Nnedi Okorafor \[this is also an ongoing series. I have listed the first book here. By including it, I have implicitly labeled albinism as disability. The main character has it. In fact, it is in large part, the source of her power. But let me back up a bit. This is a series that has often been called ""the Nigerian Harry Potter."" It is a fantasy, and also another YA novel. One could conceivably make the argument that here, albinism is not a disability. That is, Sunny, our main character, starts the novel impaired – but when she discovers she's a witch, she is no longer affected by the sun in the same way.

Despite this however – her albinism does not go away. It marks her as different. Ultimately of course, to succeed, she must embrace that difference. I will grant you that I am slightly biased with regard to this series – as it is one of my new favorites.\]

5\) *The Stand* – by Stephen King \[okay. This one is a cheat. I know that you said you did not want overly dark material. And, this book is unequivocally dark at times. But it is also my favorite Steven King. And, I would argue, it is his best work. A major character in the novel is mute. And, I should say, he is one of the good guys. I stipulate this because this book is truly an epic – and there are disabled characters on both sides of the battle for the soul of America. If you are not familiar, you are probably – but I will give you context regardless – this book is a post\-apocalyptic epic that details a battle over America between God and the devil and a huge cast of characters.

As I said, there are dark moments. Ultimately however, I believe that the book ends on a positive note. And as a final word – it is my fervent belief that the only addition that is truly worth anyone's time is the expanded edition.�� \]

So, there you have it. Looking back on it now – I can see that this list is heavily weighted toward science fiction and fantasy. Which perhaps betrays my taste in genre.

835,"There are very helpful SSA/DDS employees that visit this sub so they may be able to speak more authoritatively.  When you apply, one of the first things they do is to check whether you qualify for SSDI on your own work record.  If not, then they will deny that claim and continue on evaluating your eligibility for SSD benefits on your parents records if you meet the guidelines or for SSI.  All of the programs have the same medical criteria.  

As far as your records, I advise everyone to get their own records if possible so you know what they say and that you have submitted them to the person working on your case.  Also tell your doctor if your meds are not working or if you are having side effects so this can be written in your records.  Having a diagnosis is just one of the things they evaluate.  You need to prove that despite proper treatment, that your are markedly and severely functionally limited and unable to work.  Best wishes and I hope you get good news soon.  My wife has bipolar I and has struggled most of her life (she’s allergic to an entire family of antipsychotics and most other options pushed her into major depressive episodes) until she started taking a new medication which has greatly helped her, so I seen how hard it is when the medication either doesn’t work or causes severe side effects.

836,"The human survival instinct is very strong, and suicidal thoughts is actually a natural response to being completely overwhelmed. 

Imagine a person as a cup. Every stress and tragedy fills the cup. If you have more stress/tragedy than you have coping strategies to deal with it, the cup overflows, causing things like self-harm and suicidal ideation. 

Because the survival instinct is so strong, and most people try to distract themselves rather than dwell on it, the overflow usually passes before they find the means to kill themselves. Planning a suicide takes a lot of time and rational thought, and most people are not in that state of mind when they experience suicidal ideation. (The overflow state is generally not very rational.)

People who do make plans are usually those who snap themselves into a logical thought process, or experience disassociation during overflow, or folks in what is called a mixed state. Often when depression causes suicidal thoughts, it is accompanied by other aspects of depression including lack of motivation and difficulty thinking. During mixed states, people experience some aspects of depression, such as suicidal thoughts, combined with certain aspects to mania or hypomania, such as increased energy or restlessness. They are more likely to act in the moment using whatever is on hand as well. 

Honestly it's complex and there's a lot of factors. Usually people hold on for years with suicidal feelings without successfully killing themselves. I first attempted suicide at age 5 and have managed to make it through multiple suicide attempts until now, age 27. 

Also worth noting that most people do not succeed in killing themselves the first time. People who do succeed are usually folks who have more experience with death like doctors and soldiers. They succeed because they know how much force is needed to accomplish the task. Generally other folks try multiple times, slowly becoming desensitized to it, until they either succeed or get treatment. 

Marginalized communities, such as disabled people, very likely experience higher rates of suicidal ideation compared to the general public. However, no large studies have been done on this specifically, probably because of ableism. I am trans and disabled myself, and the National Transgender Discrimination Survey showed the percentage of trans folks who attempted sucide at some point in their lives was around 40%, but for trans people who are disabled this rose to 60%. However, it's worth noting that the rates were highest in people with mental disabilities, and a lot lower in folks with physical disabilities and no mental disabilities. (Particularly depression.)

In that study, individuals who had family and community support experienced 20% or less suicidal risk. This suggests that a very large part of why trans people experience suicidal thoughts is due to stress from discrimination, and that probably applies to other marginalized communities, such as disabled folks, as well. 

I think that's one reason why online communities like this one are so important. If abled folks don't give a shit about us, to the point where they haven't even studied suicide in our communities, then we gotta provide those resources for each other.

If your husband needs you to navigate this claim process for, or with, him create a quick Auth form where he gives you permission to communicate with Aetna   ""I <PERSON>, Date of Birth 09/23/68, hereby authorize my wife <PERSON> to speak to Aetna on my behalf for the purpose of anything related to my disability claim"". Then have him sign and date it 

The key to STD is ""what happened"" and ""now what"". Meaning, what happened that the claimant can not work. Exactly when and how did his/her health reach this level. And then, what exactly are the objective restrictions and limitations. 

Be sure hubby is not hiding anything from docs. Often people assume the diagnosis alone is enough. Even worse is when claimant doesn't directly tell doctors his/her EXACT symptoms and <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> how they affect work ability   

For example, you can have 2 claimants with a diagnosis like MS. Claimant #1 may have minimal symptoms and a sedentary job , thus have a disability BUT is not disabled from working. Meanwhile Claimant #2 has severe balance issues, leg numbness, narrowed visual field, and a medium job THUS is disabled from working.

This is the first time I have heard the phrase ""courtesy discount"", would you be able to elaborate exactly what this means?

I've encountered accessibility discounts - where someone requires additional services in order to receive access and those services are discounted or free. Reduced experience discounts - where the company acknowledges that certain disabilities reduce the experiance, making it not worth the full cost, for example, Visual impairment at the zoo, if you can't see the exhibits very well, you shouldn't have to pay full price to see the exhibits, because you'd be paying the same price as an able-bodied person but you get half the experiance. The most common I've seen is ""broad"" pension discounts, basically anyone with a pension card, seniors card, or disability health care card gets a discount because they are on a low, fixed income and otherwise wouldn't have financial access to this service/experience/program.

Is a courtesy discount similar to a broad pension discount?

They also made sure I had a perscription discount card since I didn't have insurance. 

I had never met my lawyer, always worked with the assistants. I had a new one every couple of months because they would quit, which was worrisome, but finally one stuck around. They always returned my calls and emails within 24 hours. When I had uncontrollable anxiety they would let me schedule an appointment to come in and talk about my case. They were hopeful and supportive but were very reserved about my chances of winning. They told me ways of improving my case like remaining in treatment and they gave me function reports for my doctors to fill out that they submitted to SS after approving what was written supported my case.

When it came time to meet my lawyer they actually wanted me to switch to a new hire at their firm rather than sticking with a partner. I was reluctant because I didn't know her and I felt like they were just trying to pass me off. They reassured me that they hired her because they liked her success rates. The assistant said she would likely represent me better as a female because frankly females are thought to be better at explaining mental illness as we're more empathetic or something (a bit sexist I know). I did end up going with her though I was really nervous. 

My lawyer was even more reserved about my chances of winning. Hopeful still, but oh so careful about what she said. She gave me more advice like I should comb out my dreadlocks to make the best possible impression on the judge, which I did. She said she'd always be available to answer my questions if I had any. She told me exactly what the hearing would be like and even showed me pictures of the building so I would recognize it. 

The morning of the hearing she spent a half hour with me beforehand to discuss her strategy. After the hearing she spent another half hour with me to give me her thoughts and to pretty much make sure I was ok. She didn't want to get my hopes up but told me that it went as well as it could have gone. She called me with the news of my approval as I was holding the envelope.

So being that I will have a family and wife and kids one day; and my career as an attorney is just on the horizon, I think this would enable me to do more with my job and traveling, and not needing to worry as much about poop, and allow me to focus on my career and cutting down more need from others as to not burn them out. I want to have a wife. Not an aid that has my last name too. And though the line blurs just as it does now with my relationship, I make sure to show her how much I want her to be my wife first. So the time it takes for me to poop is almost an hour, on most cases, and by eliminating that, creates more time for other things. I could then shower faster, and even with cleaning the port, it would be less time than that spent on the toilet a week. As well as allowing my hemorrhoids to heal naturally is a big part of this as well. So I have several “pros” for this and want to know from those who have them or help someone with them, what it’s like to have one and give some thoughts and advice that isn’t given by a doctor.

1205,"I have looked into those as well, but being that I can’t fit normally on the toilet due to my back issues that prevents my pelvis from sitting on any arched surface like a traditional toilet, I use my hoyer lift to suspend me in the air, above the toilet, and that is how I go. And quite frankly, it works like a charm. Sort of like the “Squatty-Potty,” it enables me to be in a perfect position while still not having to need special equipment. That’s one thing I try to do most, to have a house that is not filled with special equipment just for me. Certain things I can’t go without, but a toilet seat without the railings and padding, I can. The people who design durable medical equipment need to understand that these are items that some people will have in their house that they also entertain business colleagues, friends, family, children, etc. I don’t want to have the outward appearance of living in a make shift hospital, which is the unfortunate nature of many homes for which the disabled live in. They need to create items that are not as obvious or a sight for sore eyes, like some hospital beds.

This is not what disability is for, in the eyes of the SSA.  If you can presently or have recently, worked full time, they are not going to give you anything. Therefore you have zero choice but to pursue other options.... painful unpleasant options.

Not many people are going to be that honest with you.  Most are gonna tell you its Ok and send you down pointless roads to chase feel good red herrings. 

I've dealt with the SSA over a dozen family members and friends trials and pains.  You want help. I'm giving it to you.

You will run into a brick wall, and waste years if you have no paperwork, doctoring, and full time employment. 

I understand you need and want help.  The SSA will not give it to you, in the amounts you require.  You cannot defraud the govt or you will be in deeper shit than you are now.

Plus you are educated, with a degree I assume thats the student loan your paying. And you are young.... on your own.

The others will blow smoke up your ass.... I'm telling you the SSA is going to reject you at face value. So anytime you burn chasing that, is futile.

Look for better employment with better benefits.  That is your most realistic option. Preferably one that requires you relocate.

The husband they would count their income and contributions to the household but a room mate I think they would count differently.  It depends on who pays the bills.  It's all in the POMS if you want to dig around in there.

Roommates vs spouses is a sticky situation rule wise.  It depends on who pays for what, if they actually accept its friends only or holding out, and that fair share thing.

1292,"I did it. If you fail at work you have a 3 year period of extended eligibility that comes with a ton of strings. Once youre off disability you can pay for medicare out of pocket  for 7 years (currently 135/month). If you want to get back on SSDI you have 2 options: File and expedited reinstatement which takes weeks to a few months or file for a new claim. A new claim can take weeks to years. The expedited reinstatement will get you benefits while they decide your case and it's fast compared to filing a new claim. The downside is if they deny you then you lose the ability to pay for medicare so you're now possibly uninsured. 

I recently got off SSDI due to work and got let go at the end of the year. I filed a new claim in late March with an attorney it took me a month to get paperwork together and SSA started sending me tons of paperwork in May. Per the website they're going over medical records now... no idea how long things will take.

1336,"I’ll share my personal experiences. I don’t have kids and I still haven’t won even after my second application, so I only have info on the post ALJ waiting time and some comments about OVR and not being able to work any job.

- It all depends on the state you’re from I believe, but my first time around I waited 8 months to get a determination from the ALJ even after I had filed for hardship being as I was homeless at the time and going from friend to friends houses and sometimes sleeping at local college campus and was forced to eat one meal a day most days. As for this time around this lawyer says the process has been sped up slightly so without my hardship probably...8 months.

- As for OVR I’ve had OVR, another employment service associated with OVR, physical therapist, neurologist, PCP, multiple therapists and psychiatrists say that I couldn’t work and I still got denied. I got one of the harshest ALJs though. In my report from the Vocational Expert and whoever reviews mental health within the ALJs juridiction the mental health expert claimed I fell below some score that made me ineligible to work any job and the vocational expert claimed that there were a very very small number of jobs that I could work(if I remember correctly), but the ALJ still denied me and my new lawyer told me that is what she(the ALJ) does. She will ignore recommendations from both professionals advising her if she feels like it. I’m still fighting the Appeals Counsel as they denied it as well and now after multiple certified letters about requesting civil action I call the support lines and get hung up on and yelled at that I’m “suing the government” and “I should focus on getting better not extorting the government”. One of the worst things about is that since my denial the first time around it’s as if OVR, agencies, and doctors have been burned out with me not being able to work and kind of treat me like a petulant child by ignoring my pleas and sometimes scolding me for still trying....I wish you luck my friend

The vocational expert even said I was qualified for work I had been told by many medical experts to avoid due to my mental and physical disabilities. So here I am reapplying after wasting 7 years. So be careful, it’s all a roll of the dice if you get to the ALJ depending on what ALJ you get.

This is encouraging!

&gt;Rain and reasonable puddles haven't slowed me a bit.

Awesome!

&gt;As for grocery shopping, without more info, I can't really help.

Well, I was just wondering about the weight limits I can hang on the back of the chair, as well as how you might manage carrying your groceries/shopping prior to checkout? I know how I'd do it in the scooter (as mentioned), not sure about the chair. 

This said,  I can only carry about 4-5kg in the back of my scooter before the bag frame (which also carries my crutches) starts to bend under the weight, which is damned annoying as the excess has to remain in my footwell which is.... smaller than a basket anyway.

In terms of  a bag though, it will come with bag hooks and I intend to get a deep backpack for the back  of the chair. I have partial use of my right arm (full use of my left), so I may be able to hold a basket on my lap with my right arm and steer with my left. (Getting used to the different mode of steering will be fun)

&gt; and this is the most stable chair I've taken on it, even loaded with heavy bags. Still have to be careful - no chair is perfectly stable.

Of course! This is still great to hear from first-hand users of it though.

&gt;It can handle even large curbs with only minor assistance and smaller curbs/obstacles are never an issue. 

Really? Even going up curbs, or down only?

&gt; Basically, it can handle rough terrain, but it is not an off-road specialty chair, so try and go over a fallen tree or something, you might get totally stuck. Drive through beach sand or deep mud, you might get stuck. Any normal, day to day off-road stuff - this chair is one of the best.

Nothing so major. :) Just some grass and dirt and some bumpy unsealed roads in places I go (which could get a little muddy at times), but it sounds like it'll be fine. I don't tend to go mudding or anything in even my current scooter - only when necessary, you know.

&gt;but most places that service this chair have access to the PC software chair programmer which allows for much more in-depth customization of the chair.

It'll be serviced for free by whichever company the funding body has a contract with, but this is great to hear. I believe I'm getting the basic one [linked here](https://i.imgur.com/GcgKyCa.jpg) with a different joystick that I can grip, but I will keep that in mind.

1486,"&gt; may I call you Needle?

Of course. We're all friends here!

&gt; Any sort of rain or puddles has been fine. I have been drenched coming to and from work without any mechanical problems whatsoever. 

Fantastic! That's what I was hoping to hear.

&gt; You might have a bit of trouble with this one but I can confirm that the back of the chair takes an awful lot of weight. 

Excellent! I can only carry about 4-5kg in the back of my scooter before the bag frame (which also carries my crutches) starts to bend under the weight, which is damned annoying as the excess has to remain in my footwell which is.... smaller than a basket anyway, so this is great news! How do you manage carrying your shopping and things before checking out, if I may ask? I'm intending to get a deep backpack for the back of the chair to carry things as well as the bag hooks it will come with.

&gt; I would personally say this is a pretty damn good all-terrain vehicle. Has a lot of power and grunt!

Beautiful. I wondered if maybe the OT hadn't really considered that I don't really need to use the chair indoors, but based on that I'd say they know what they're on about. Sweet!

&gt;  Once you sit in this thing you will realise that it is never going to tip over but that doesn't stop you thinking about it.

Aaaaaabsolutely. I know in the back of my mind it isn't going to tip over or out, whatever - but I always felt during the trial like I was going to - especially on footpaths that were on a slope or whathaveyou. Funny thing is, my four-wheel scooter feels less secure on these types of things, because not all wheels touch the ground. It's just a psychological thing.

&gt;The good thing about this chair is that it spins on dime so doing that takes no time or space.

Which I am SO pumped about, you've no idea. As I only use my scooter in public or outdoors, more often I find that it's like turning a truck around and on crowded public transport is a nightmare. I couldn't believe it during my trial when I could actually turn around in the lift at the hospital. Dude.

Thanks for your advice and time!

That actually makes sense - I'm just not used to the different more... ""direct"" feel vs the passiveness of the scooter I have. That said, my chair will have solid tyres, which apparently make for a smoother ride when combined with the suspension that it'll have - so I'm pleased about that.
