0,"I recently got my 1st wheelchair so I’m looking at this more from an educator’s side as I taught 1st grade for 7 yrs. one yr I had a student with an aide. She has C.P. no wheelchair, but needed some help. The aide was just a part of our classroom and the kids all knew her and were allowed to ask her for help if she wasn’t needed by the student. She was there to make sure the student didn’t fall and also for bathroom time. 

During lunch our tables get full as well. The aide would sometimes sit at the table, but as the student had friends who could help her open things the aide started standing by the lunchroom monitor and just kept an eye on the student. As long as she kept an eye on the student she was ok to help other kids open things and excuse them from the table. This was something she asked the mom, the principal and our district 504 person about because those are the people directly involved with that. 

So, if the person who pointed it out is over you, I’d ask the parent what their thoughts were (in writing). This doesn’t sound like the case, and as with almost every school there are most people trying to tell others how to do their job better or looking for a reason to complain. So...I’d ask your supervisor their thoughts. Tell them the situation and ask them what they would like you to do. One thing that was so helpful for the aide &amp; my student was they had a notebook that went back and forth between home and school every day. It stayed in the backpack and it was a way for mom to communicate with the aide. Most of the time there were just a sentence or 2 w/any questions, something the aide saw (good/bad), and also how the child was socially fitting in. Not naming names if other kids, but saying if she had others playing w/her, etc.

The reason we keep seeing this is because we don't get our shit together and vote for disability-friendly candidates. If we made disability issues our #1 priority on election day, you bet your ass things would change.

But every election it's the same thing. Half of us vote for the disability-friendly guy, the other half go the other way, often for stupid reasons. And some of us don't vote at all. Not because they are legally banned but because they don't wanna.

I know at least two people who won't vote for pro-disability candidates because they don't want to be accused of letting disability influence their vote by their abled ""friends.""

And I'm beyond done with the special needs parents or whatever they call themselves who claim they're sooooo concerned about their kids' Medicaid yet keep voting for the people cutting it thinking that if they just ask reeeeeeeeaaaaal politely, they'll decide not to cut Medicaid.

Sorry if I sound abrasive but it's been 27 years since the ADA. And since then, we've stagnated in terms of progress because we've bent over backwards to be bi-partisan even as one party has made it clear that they don't like us. Justin Dart would be run out of today's GOP.

Yes, even though the special ed. teacher hurt your feelings (been there done that).
Yes even if the college kids complaining about ""cultural appropriation"" are insufferable.
Yes even if your friends/family accuse you of ""identity politics"" or whatever.

Find out everything you can about all of them and use this knowledge to hook up your clients with services that can help them.

Subsidized disability housing

Or other form of rent assistance service (pretty damn rare AFAIK) 

Home caregiver services from cleaning and shopping to in home health care

Local food banks and how to sign up

Local homeless shelters

Local free meal options for the homeless/poor

Home delivery services like meals on wheels, food rescue (leftover redistribution groups, some places have them)

And of course how they can sign up for Medicaid, Medicare if they're not on it already, food stamps/wic/chip/etc

Other local disability assistance services that can provide things like power of attorney to handle their paperwork and healthcare choices when they are unable.

60,"Oh my gosh. Same. Don't be too hard on yourself, it is really hard to change our diets to be safe because our tastebuds say one thing and our logic says another. Your eventual goal is to make it automatic so you just eat like you should out of habit and easy-access foods, or to reward yourself when you eat safe by noticing how good it is or punishing yourself by eating badly by noticing how bad it is. 

There are lots of options. What's worked for me is just making eating the safe foods a habit, and making sure everyone around me knows I'm not supposed to eat any foods besides my few safe foods. I make sure I always have a safe snack in my purse and bring my own food to people's places when there's a dinner thing. I make sure restaurants have a safe food by checking menus beforehand. It's like you said, when I get down to it eating this way isn't so bad and it's doable. 

Basically, I made a list of things I could eat at restaurants, quick prep things I had in my freezer (frozen food or prepared by me and frozen) to make it easy to eat safe, and then just ate the same things on rotation until it was eventually habit. The important thing is to make it really, really easy to eat safe or semi-safe. Try to avoid ""oh and I'll also cook elaborate meals constantly"" style planning. I still slip up a lot but I am usually eating within the framework of safe food with only occasional slip ups so I'm okay with it. 

Have a semi-safe treat food, too. Chocolate isn't great for me, but it's not as bad as if I caved and had cornbread, for instance. So having some chocolate on hand to satisfy cravings helps me. It's all about harm reduction and training the people around you so they don't make it harder on you too with their comments. And it's easier to replace a bad habit of caving with a different habit instead of trying to just do nothing and not eat it while you think about it still. 

Edit:
Oh and oddly enough adding in vitamin gummies helped me because it reduced my cravings. Often when we crave something it's because we need some nutrient, so I'll take a gummy when I have a craving too. Or if I'm craving something salty, I will (this is gross but it works) literally pour some salt into my mouth and wash it down. I need a lot of salt because I have POTS.

82,"So, unfortunately, the ADA reasonable accommodations protections only extend to the point of undue burden to the company. If the on call requirement is an integral part of your job duties, then that is going to be an uphill battle for you. If your doctor won't allow it, and the company still demands it, I suspect the next move would be to transfer you to a different position, or possibly even consider terminating you, if it's a big enough issue. If allowing the accommodation causes the undue burden due to the on call requirement being an integral responsibility, the company is within their rights to offer you a different solution, a change in title/role, or no solution/termination. It's very much a negotiation for you, so you want to be careful how you approach it with them. Can you do some sort of compromise? Every other night? Every second night? Half of each night? That's what I would go in with. or maybe even a plan to start out very minimally but increase in frequency over a proposed time period.

I  wouldn’t start with the keyboard however! Look first at mouse input. Here’s some ideas:
- eyegaze. Take a look at the Tobii range of cameras for developers. Now work in Windows 10 as mouse input devices.

I'm going to go through each of the points of this article. I'm going to use some cutting hyperbole and even some aggressive language. If that's going to bother you... you've been warned. 

For the OP: I will have taken this article apart, it's not a commentary of you. While I obviously (and ardently) disagree with most (okay, all) of this article, I actually think that there are likely many things on which we could agree. And while my comments are full of sarcasm, hyperbole, and frustration (*read disgusted vitriol), I actually do enjoy a kind, informative, factual debate of ideas. I usually reserve the derision (which is following) for hyper-partisan hacks who use lies, libelous character assaults, and deliberately deceptive exaggerations with no regard for the truth in order to create fear and division in those who look to them for help in deciphering the day's news.

They would always stammer out some excuse about how I had to apply elsewhere because they only did referrals, or there's a long wait list, or some other bureaucratic bullshit.  With regards to finding jobs, one would think that would be the whole point of the aforementioned departments of vocational rehabilitation...except in the cases of the other disabled homeless that I'd helped and myself, having a caseworker who would put in as much effort for me as I did for that homeless blind guy is as much of a Hollywood fantasy as ""the guy getting the girl after much creepy persistent stalking"".

95,"The listings are just one part of the evaluation. Disability is evaluated through a five step sequential process, and the listings are at step 3. If a person does not meet/equal a listing, then the evaluation continues to steps 4 and 5. A judge can find someone disabled at either step 3 (meets/equals a listing) or step 5 (has sufficient limitations to preclude past work and all other applicable work). In my experience, step 5 grants are MUCH more common than step 3.

The speed to first payment depends on your local SSA office. Keep an eye on your mailbox for a ""Notice of Award"" which will break down backpay and monthly payments. From my experience, many of my clients received their backpay even prior to receiving the Notice of Award. If you still don't have a Notice of Award within 60 days, contact your representative. 

For the continuing disability review, it may happen in two years or may take even longer given SSA's budget issues. The review entails contacting you and possibly reviewing updated medical evidence to determine whether your conditions have changed at all - for example, if a person with spinal problems had a surgery which fixed their symptoms. They'll also review your earnings record to see if you've worked at all since the determination. I wouldn't worry about it as long as you keep seeing your doctors and following their treatment recommendations.

111,"Your rep should give you a pre-hearing phone call within a couple weeks of your hearing date to go over the procedures specific to your jurisdiction since there is some variability between different offices and different judges.

The hearing will most likely be in a glorified conference room. You won't be on a ""stand"" and it's going to be nothing like whatever courtroom drama you're imaging. You'll probably sit at the opposite end of a large-ish table facing the judge with your rep sitting next to you. There will usually be a vocational expert (job expert) in attendance but this person could appear via telephone. There may also be a medical expert (much less common). Most judges try to maintain a relaxed atmosphere because it helps the claimant (that's you) give better testimony. 

You'll usually start off answering some questions from the judge about your vitals (name, SSN, age, residence) and then go through your employment history (including possible ""off the books"" jobs like babysitting). After that, you'll start talking about what is preventing you from maintaining full-time work. Everyone involved has probably been doing this for a long time and has probably seen people much worse off than you so you shouldn't feel embarrassed giving honest testimony (I realize that may be difficult depending on the severity of your condition, nevertheless... ). 

The point of the hearing is for the judge to ascertain what you deal with on an everyday basis. Therefore, it's my opinion that you should follow your doctor's orders concerning medication. Most judges are very sensitive to claimants who seem to be exaggerating their symptoms. Again, the judge presiding over your case has probably seen hundreds of anxiety cases. You'll talk about everyday situations: going to the store, driving, interacting with people, how you spend your time, hobbies, etc.

Honesty is absolutely the most important policy. Again, this is probably no one's first rodeo (except you). The judge will most likely have read your medical files and will have an idea about what to expect concerning your behavior and symptoms. 

After you've talked about how your condition is affecting your daily life, your portion of the hearing is over. Your rep, the judge, and the vocational expert will talk about how certain limitations would affect a hypothetical person in various vocational capacities.

134,"I agree totally that insurance companies that provide LTD ( usually as part of an employee's benefits) are heartless and run by the devil's minions. Mine was Liberty Mutual. They called my rheumatologist out of the blue and she responded to them - that I could return to work - without even looking at my chart.  I had only seen her once or twice at that point, just enough for her to diagnose my Chronic Fatigue syndrome - there was no physician-patient relationship at that point, so she had no idea who they were even asking about. They have her on tape saying this. When I asked her about it, she  denied even saying it.  By then, it is too late. There is no appeal, because they have her on tape. Of course, ""returning to work"" was a joke at that point, because the employee is terminated from the company at the end of Short Term Disability ( paid by the company) when Long Term Disability ( paid by Liberty Mutual) starts.  There is no job to go back to.  I was too sick to work, anyway, as demonstrated by the fact that I was awarded SSDI. The start date of my benefits was after Liberty Mutual stopped payments so, in my case, there was no overlap.  

Oh and one more thing - when they stop paying, there is no warning. You just get a letter in the mail and boom, no income.  With two preteen children and so very sick, I had to find a way to survive with no income. The rest of that year - from February to October - was a wasteland.

135,"&gt; They can't ask about your disability unless you request an accomodation and they definitely won't ask in the interview (opens them to lawsuit if you don't get the job).

Thank you.  I feel like I would definitely feel very uncomfortable about having that sort of conversation, especially as a way of people first being introduced to me.  Do you have any idea who ends up seeing this information?  Will the person I interview with know that I have / have had a disability, for instance?

I typically answer that I do not want to disclose this information. I understand that it says they are looking to hire persons with disabilities but I guess I am afraid of having a conversation about depression/migraines/breathing -- of either not being taken seriously about it or of being taken too seriously and then being considered a liability. Do you know what happens if I press, ""Yes, I have or have had a disability?""

Should I just say yes and then, if anyone asks about it, just mention I was previously diagnosed with major depression but do not consider myself to be depressed any longer? And then just not mention that I have other chronic health problems unless it becomes a problem at work?

I first started using a wheelchair when I was in college, and there was one set of double doors on campus that was a pain in the butt to manage. They were heavy and narrow - I had to open *both* doors to fit my wheelchair through, and I could only open them by holding onto the handles of *both* doors at the same time (basically bracing myself against one while I opened the other, and vice versa).

So one day, I'm wheeling up to this building, and a nice young man decides to help me with the doors. He opens one door and motions for me to go through. But of course my wheelchair doesn't fit. And I can't open the second door myself, because he's holding the first one open, and there's nothing for me to brace myself against.

146,Because a 1 or 2% cost of living increase every few years does not account for actual inflation. I doubt it will be increased because it has also become one of the only cash benefit programs with most other welfare programs cut (including section 811 housing). The people getting it has grown far too large since the 90s and it's on the chopping block of Republicans this year. Plenty of people that receive SSI probably could get jobs if the economy was better and accommodations were more available. People with all sorts of disabilities work with accommodations. A good size portion of SSI recipients are also children who presumably shouldn't be living by themselves and have an easier time qualifying for benefits. The program as it exists is cobbled together and really isn't sufficient or effective.

My own was to say that I would walk on my own, the 500 meters with the torch, without my cane. 

They called and asked me if I'd be okay to do it in Virden MB, not Winnipeg. I said sure, of course! and spent the next couple months practicing walking around my house holding one of my old crutches up - i mean, do you have a good torch substitute lying around your house?

170,"Thank you for sharing! Wow, what a difficult decision. I’m so glad it worked out for you. 

Your story is really interesting to me because the diagnosis that makes the most sense, in my case, is “chronic pain syndrome,” which is exactly as specific as it sounds. �� Essentially I had an acute condition that went severely undertreated for nearly a year, and the pain damaged my central nervous system. It’s very similar to phantom pain, only I’ve never lost a limb. 

The waking up feeling is eerie. I recently did a trial for a spinal cord stimulator, and it took away maybe 80% of my pain. I’ll never forget waking up in the morning having actually slept well, and my first thought was not “Owww where are my pills?” I realized I haven’t slept well in literally 12 years, and I’ve been awoken by pain every morning during that time. To finally sleep well and not be in agony on waking.... I can’t really describe how amazing that felt. 

The validation thing is so important. I’m anxiously awaiting my permanent stimulator—16 days!!—and I’m hoping for some of that validation afterward too. 

I can also kind of relate to having faced down a challenge. I got myself out of a terribly abusive marriage 5 years ago. I’ve had to do a lot of healing, but that awesome feeling has definitely been around. Sometimes it’s overwhelmed by grief or regret but I try to stay focused on the positive, as much as I can.

216,"A warning when you do this.  You will have to pay taxes on the amount discharged for that calendar year.

This can mean a pretty large amount must be paid when you file your 2018 taxes.  If you do not file they will begin garnishing your disability check.

One way to get around this is to claim insolvency if you qualify.  Calculate your debt including student loans then minus your assets to determine if you are insolvent for some or all the amount.

An example:
Person A discharged 50k in student loans in 2018.  He then received a tax form for the 50k discharged loans in January 2019.  He must then file his taxes with the 50k counting as income for 2018.  If that was his only income then he would have to pay $9,057 to the IRS.  If he fails to pay or file his taxes the IRS will begin to garnish his disability payments until it is paid plus interest and fees.

Person A decides to claim insolvency.  They add all there debt including the $50k student loans as well as $5k in credit cards for a total of $55k in total debt.  They then add there assets.  Lets assume this is $10k in the bank and car worth $5k.

55k - 15k means Person A is insolvent by 40k.  This means instead of paying taxes on 50k they only pay taxes on 15k.

225,"*Disclaimer: results not typical; your experience with amputation may vary*

Because of what I was going through beforehand, losing the leg was easy. There was a reflex-nerve component to the pain (according to one doc anyway), which meant that there was a chance amputating the leg wouldn't have stopped the pain, and that woulda been pretty catastrophically horrible, so it was a very difficult call. When I woke up *without* pain, it's hard to describe how great that feeling was. Then, I mean, then the morphine wore off and there was some generic ""they just chopped your leg off"" ouchiness, but whatever, I was over the moon. 

Support was great. I live by myself on the opposite end of the country, and my folks took turns flying out to help. There was some uneasiness about the decision (because let's face it, there ought to be), but when for instance my mother saw the ""before"" and ""after,"" that pretty much settled any doubts. Also helped everyone appreciate what the ""before"" really was, which was I guess some level of validation for me, and that was probably nice.

If I had to summarize the emotional impact.... I mean I really haven't stopped feeling great ever since. Shit happens and all, I've had rough days/weeks/months, but it's hard to think of anything as a particularly big deal. Probably part of that is being surrounded by great people, but also, I think there's some perspective that comes from going through big challenges.... At the same time I definitely *didn't* have that perspective when I was actually hurting, so I dunno. Sample size of one, going through a big challenge and coming out the other side makes you feel awesome.

That said (&amp; this is all from anecdotal experience for single/cohabitating adults without dependents, so YMMV), SSI and its associated programs form what's sort of like a creaky old four-legged stool - SSI, subsidized housing, SNAP, LIHEAP. If you're missing one, you're financially treading water. Two and things are basically untenable. Sometimes it'll just fall apart of its own accord because a caseworker screwed something up. But it's possible - at least in some scenarios and assuming you're well enough to navigate all this garbage - to get by with the help of all of them:

* At $750/mo, subsidized housing will cost you max 30% of your income in rent, usually lower. That leaves you with $525/mo. 
* You'll probably get nearly nothing on SNAP and this will kill you, but receiving LIHEAP (which you're eligible for at SSI income) should bump you up to the higher end, $150-$195. If your grocery bill for food would be $200/mo, that means worst-case we're at $475. 
* I can't speak for the LIHEAP intersection when tenants must pay for heat (don't even know if this is allowable through HUD) but utilities (lights/internet) cost us around $110 (but we’re two people, so electricity is higher), so that leaves $365. 
* Student loans can be discharged with a doctor's certification or a 3-5 year review SSA award letter. Otherwise, you're going IBR ($0). 
* Because you receive SSI, you're eligible for Lifeline, so no phone bill, but it is otherwise possible to get basic prepaid cell service for $3-$15/mo. 
* You'll want renters insurance, so that's $10-$15/mo.
* Transportation is tricky. Medicaid will pay for most medical transport, but needed non-medical transport in an area with little public transportation is a nightmare. Social services organizations (in rural areas) and mass transit (in urban areas) may help here. 
* Factor in basic household expenditures (toiletries, etc) and - at least without a car or significant expenditures for medical devices Medicaid won't cover - you can still come out with around $175 - $275 in discretionary income, save half for an emergency fund and spend the rest. 

Overall, actually receiving SSI/SSDI allows you to avoid jumping through a lot of hoops people perceived as able-bodied need to go through.

For those reading this, CMT is a genetic disorder affecting the ability for the nerves to communicate with toes and fingers (motor neuropathy) and sometimes to feel sensations in the feet and toes. (sensory neuropathy) Due to atrophy of certain muscles in the feet, toes, and fingers, it sometimes causes deformities in those areas. 

Charcot-Marie-Tooth was once thought to be a form of muscular dystrophy but is now known to be different. Unlike MD, CMT is inherited. That is, you have to be born with it in order to have it -  like an exclusive private club.

The Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association (www.cmtausa.org) has a number of local branches where CMTers gather to exchange tips, socialize, and hear speakers.

288,"Hello,

I suffer from chronic tendonitis in my right wrist, stemming from an injury in 2012. I am also unemployed, in my mid-30's, and trying to do a career change to accounting. I am inevitably going to need accommodations as far as typing goes. Probably more than just ergonomic keyboard and mouse - I will also need voice recognition software, so I am not overdoing it with my wrist.

My question is about disability law and ""reasonable accommodations."" If it turns out, as a result of me using voice software, I take X% longer to complete certain tasks, can they hold me accountable for that? I figure there must be a line somewhere, where an employer must recognize this and say ""Sorry, you're taking too long to complete tasks.""

I'm ultimately trying to assess whether I should keep going with my goal to be an accountant, or if I should just give up now, and avoid future disappointment later.

295,"Hi, I have a 13 year old son with bilateral optic nerve colobomas and bilateral microphthalmia comorbidity with chromosome translocation and microcephaly.  

EI (early intervention) should set you up with the local blind resources.    EI at least in Florida would refer out since it was covered under a different program.  The federal and Florida government jointly had a birth to 5 program for the blind and vision impaired, included in home vision therapy, sensory room access and other special equipment access as the child developed like light boxes and such.   I'm not sure if it is set up the same way in every state but EI should definitely be your starting point.     

CHIP at least in the 2 states I have been in do not cover children if they have access to private insurance unless you meet very specific circumstances (check your state's CHIP website for details).   Also, thanks to GOP and Democrats fighting and not putting citizens first, many states have their CHIP enrollment locked down.   Congress still hasn't come up with a long term funding solution and is only funding CHIP a few weeks at a time in a rob Peter to pay Paul scheme.   You can check into it but even if your daughter qualifies you may not get anything until congress stops infighting and properly funds the program.  

There are state specific charities and some national charities.   Post your state and some one might be able to give you more concise advice.    

Do you know how close to the SSI income cutoff you are?   Some families cut work hours because it is cheaper to get on SSI then pay for everything out of pocket.  We are generally talking about families that are toeing the income line.    Also check Medicaid waivers in your state. Again resources vary from state to state so when asking for referrals giving a general geographic area is best if you want relevant advice.

My son has been receiving his vision adaptions/intervention through his local school for the last decade but I know a few resources off hand, however, since we haven't personally used them recently I can't tell you how helpful they will be.   

[Sight Savers America](https://sightsaversamerica.org/)  - I know they have given away low vision aides to children and hold art contests.   My son won one of their art contests a few years back.

329,"Thank you very much for your well thought-out and thorough explanation. My on-call situation in the beginning of my employment was only supposed to be one day in a calendar month. Due to staff shortages it quickly became two days then more as the rotation got shorter and shorter and then there was this list called a forced on call so they would have a separate rotation of people they would fill in on days they suddenly needed to put it on call person. So it was causing too much stress and anxiety and other issues with my disabilities and I talked to my doctor and we went through the ADA process to remove all of my own calls for one year so that I could get acclimated to the new job and shifts that I was working overnight and 12 hours and battling through my health issues. The company came back and granted me three months. It has now been 4 months and into the 5th because they have not been able to put a new rotation schedule out. However my management has been talking to me saying confusing things to me about how they have a business to run, which I totally understand, and how they would like it if I could compromise with them, which I am also willing to do if my doctor will sign off on it under modified conditions. I believe that you are correct that I should find some sort of compromise. Changing my position is not an option because there are no other positions in the department that I am in. This company actually sucks quite a lot, but I am sticking it out because work is so scarce around here and I don't have that decent of a work history to feel confident enough to start looking again. I reached my 1 year anniversary with the company this month and that will also open up that I can qualify for FMLA. My only concern right now is that when I see my doctor on January 16th that she will still refuse to modify her original ADA signed form that I was not to do any on call. She said that it makes her look bad as a doctor 1 month signing that her patient should not have any on call and then 5 months later modifying it to add a little bit of on call. But I am going to explain to her that this could result in the loss of my job which would be even worse than what they would think of her. I am just really concerned that I don't know all of my rights and boundaries as this is completely new territory for me. I am not trying to get out of the on-call responsibilities. I am just not capable of handling working all of my normal hours and then giving them extra. Mostly because of sleeping and other disability reason, but also because there are supervisors that I work under that make my work life very difficult and add fuel to my anxiety and panic attacks, I know it's not a real medical reason person to have it, but it's a combination of everything.",,,,kfaery215,,,1515386471,t5_2qhe8,t3_7oof5u,t1_dsb26oi,2,1517674846,0,0,dscq25f,disability,,,,,

I would make a neurologist app, regardless of cost. It could be much worse, like MS or another sort of neurological disorder, or a lot easier to explain - like a compressed disk in the neck or back. Maybe, even something like depression and anxiety can cause nervous system issues.

If you haven't work in 2 years, you qualify for Medicaid, and it's little to no cost. And ezpz to file for just look online or call.

Start with Medicaid then get to a doctor. But, if your symptoms worsen then just go. Fuck the costs, it's medical debt.

Secondly, disability seems a weird go to, when you haven't tried to do anything about your condition. You must show medically, by professionals, that working isn't something that you can do. And you haven't done any of that.

You are missing a ton of steps before a disability claim can even be made, then you will more than likely need a lawyer due to your age.

The process is long, I'm 2 years now on the waiting list to be seen.  Also with only 2 years, you will probably not qualify for SSDI due to the amount of money you have put in. (Varies from state to state but I think I heard 10 years or something like that)

I would request the face-to-face meeting, possibly with a mediator or liaison. Ask her to do research before the meeting, maybe give her some resources or ask the liaison to do so. 
    
At the meeting, make sure that she understands the difference b/w service animals and companion/therapy animals. Yes, having any dog present has been shown to improve people's moods and be beneficial. But that's not what we are talking about here. Her over-generalizations need to be addressed. Yes, some people take advantage of the confusion over therapy/service animals. But that does not take away from the fact of what service animals are.
    
If you feel that she is sincere and apologetic, I would stay in her class b/c her ignorance shouldn't cost you a proper education.
    
**Additionally,** I would request that she apologize in front of the class and correct the misconceptions that she spread. Have her explain the importance of service animals in helping people partake in a world not designed for them. Have her explain the different types of services that dogs provide, especially to the invisibly-disabled. Make sure that she understands that this address is not about you or your situation.

383,"Well said.  I if I'm honest I get less upset with portrayals of people with invisible or nonphysical disabilities(that does put it in more of the traditional realm of casting imo), but it's still all a matter of representation and having a disabled voice representing their disability and bringing insights to the role that a nondisabled person simply can't.

I don't hate Freddie Highmore for example for playing an autistic person.  He does a pretty good job portraying *someone* who would be on the spectrum, even if it rings a bit hollow at points for me.  But there's just something gross about the fact that he's getting so much praise for pretending to be autistic, when an actual autistic like myself gets looked at like I'm crazy for rocking.

  I also can't get it out of my mind that some of the things that feel off about Shaun and are just excused by ""everyone on the spectrum is different, "" could be made more authentic to an extent by having an autistic actor who doesn't have to pretend to be autistic.  As an example, Highmore plays the character as *very* visibly autistic, disproportionate to his success in life(which usually goes along with solid masking skills).  Everyone on the spectrum is different, so his portrayal isn't *wrong,* but it feels almost like a caricature at points because it goes so strongly against what you'd expect.    A big part of this is also on writing/directing, but it would be easier for me to swallow if this was an actual autistic person drawing from their own background.


&gt; A) if you are writing a disabled character that an actual disabled person can't play, you didn't write them very well!! 

YES!  It *seems* to me that most of the time, if you can't have the disabled person play that role, then your script is probably either trafficking in stale tropes, using unnecessary flashbacks, or your director is too lazy to find a creative solution where some extra care(like composing shots to avoid a person's missing limb) could easily do the trick.

  This is an issue I see often with the related problem with casting cis people as transgender(especially when it's someone of the same assigned sex).  The go-to response other than ""it's just acting!"" is ""but what if there are pre-transition scenes?""  It's as if they either think that a trans actor couldn't emotionally handle that, or they've forgotten about how many movies recast the same role for different ages.  Worse than that, though, is if so much of your script takes place pre- or early transition that a trans actor can't play it, then you're probably not telling the sort of story most people in the trans community are interested in hearing.

It can vary by the state you're in, and other factors related to your living situation and disabilities.

Generally, a person receiving SSI can work. The first $85 you earn in a month is ignored by SSI. If your income exceeds $85 in a month, then your cash benefit is decreased by 1/2 of the amount you earned. Here's a simple example:

SSI Cash Benefit: $735
Income From Work $1000
Subtract first $ 85 from Income = $915
Divide by 2 = $457.50
Subtract $457.50 from $735 = $277.50

So your total income for the month would be your income from work ($1000) plus your reduced SSI cash Benefit, for a total of $1277.50.

The other thing to clarify is how your increased benefits might effect any medical coverage you have through the federal govt. (Medicare / Medicaid) or a state public heath care system.

443,"Exactly. Don't write yourself off just because you haven't made as much progress as others - the progress you *have* made is down to grit and determination and hard work and you should absolutely congratulate yourself for that. Look back and remind yourself, regularly, and that helps with moving forward.

I hate when random strangers tell me I'm inspirational because they know nothing about me and it feels like pity. I have had a couple friends tell me that they admire and are inspired by the effort I put into things and I'll take that, because they know me and they know how much it takes. If a mate says to me 'I love how you got out to Tesco even when it was black ice out there' that's not a shite pity comment to me, because they know that takes a whole lot of effort and actually, that is something worth admiring and being inspired by. It's not inspirational for me to get to the shops under normal conditions just because I use a wheelchair, I do it every day. But for someone with less function that might be a monumental moment for them because of the increased effort it takes, and that is inspirational. 

It's not an empty compliment if someone sees the work you put in. People are inspired by Olympians who dedicate time and energy to being the best they can be. I can be inspired by someone with a disability who puts their time and energy into being the best they can be, *whatever that is*. The problem for me is when people claim to be 'inspired' by everyday acts, with no idea how difficult that act is for the individual. To me, it's all about context.

444,"In your case specifically I'm with /u/wsw4742, because this is a friend problem rather than an inspiration porn problem. There are of course plenty of people out there who *could* put more effort into their health/recovery, but your friend has no idea if you're one of them. 

Speaking of inspiration porn generally I think it is down to the individual case, a lot of recovery *is* down to hard work and when everything is hard I can find it motivational to do my PT knowing it can make a difference. I don't expect it to make the same difference as anyone else and I would be pissed as fuck if anyone other than my doctor suggested 'if you just do x you'll get y result'. It also depends on the tone of the writer in general, someone like your friend I'm not going to listen to, someone who acknowledges that luck is as important as hard work I'll find a kindred spirit in.

Everyone is different and as you've said a large portion of it is luck. Some people who do all the right things, have a positive attitude and put in a lot of work get minimal improvement while others who are grumpy twats and sit around all day eating chips get great improvement. Life is unfair that way. 

If you want to be more diplomatic than fuck off I would sit him down and say that while you're happy for his progress, it is difficult for you when your own illness is so very different. Remind him that although his hard work was essential to his recovery, a lot of it is luck and rubbing that in the face of someone not so lucky is not going to inspire anyone.

I don't expect it to make the same difference as anyone else and I would be pissed as fuck if anyone other than my doctor suggested 'if you just do x you'll get y result'. It also depends on the tone of the writer in general, someone like your friend I'm not going to listen to, someone who acknowledges that luck is as important as hard work I'll find a kindred spirit in.

Everyone is different and as you've said a large portion of it is luck. Some people who do all the right things, have a positive attitude and put in a lot of work get minimal improvement while others who are grumpy twats and sit around all day eating chips get great improvement. Life is unfair that way. 

If you want to be more diplomatic than fuck off I would sit him down and say that while you're happy for his progress, it is difficult for you when your own illness is so very different. Remind him that although his hard work was essential to his recovery, a lot of it is luck and rubbing that in the face of someone not so lucky is not going to inspire anyone. If he responds with anything other than 'sorry mate, I didn't realise how it came across' I'd rethink how much contact you have with him.

I'm surprised your teacher's retirement denied you disability benefits.  I had 12 years of service as a county employee and was approved first time after about three months.  Here in <LOCATION> you can appeal the decision and then go to court for an additional appeal.  One thing to watch out for is that disability retirement guidelines about re-employment are very strict, even more so than the SSA. If I want to  work while receiving benefits, I have to submit a detailed job description to the retirement system.  If they seem any duties of the new job are similar to my previous position (for example doing consulting work from home writing and reviewing emergency plans for clients--I was previously a public safety director), the retirement system can use that as basis to discontinue my benefits.  If you are approved, I would review the guidelines VERY carefully before continuing to develop and sell lesson plans.","[{'start': 412, 'end': 422, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 178, 'end': 188, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

525,"Okay do you have anything else other than bipolar and OCD, since you're 32 you're going to need to prove a lot to get disability or SSI, you need to basically meet a listing, a Blue Book listing.

Do you meet a listing? It's possible you do I don't know the listing for bipolar disorder. Is there any other thing that you have? What is your work history like? You're going to be looking at several years if you did not meet a listing.

The other thing you can do is equal a listing, which means you don't have the exact impairment but you functionally are impaired enough to meet it.

People without very very severe problems would essentially need to be without any work skills AND have less than a  high school education to have a shot at disability, by that I mean a case that doesn't take several years. 

I know a person in their thirties that's on disability for bipolar, and what they did is repeatedly check into mental institutions.

I know someone else that had bipolar that was under age 50, but they had many other problems in a mountain of documentation, and 13 hospitalizations.

Job history and what you have and how well it's document and are basically it

I wish you luck.

If you're serious about getting disability you're going to need a lawyer involved unless you have a mountain of long documentation, and very severe symptoms that happen even with treatment.

I got in at 29 for example, but I had 4 years of mental health documentation, permanent learning permits, extremely low birth weight, multiple eye diseases, and lots of documentation for everything, I also had never done a substantial job, I worked but it was never anything substantial, something called substantial gainful activity

Yeah there are cheaters out there, but to get Social Security with no medical problems or problems that are not severe, would require a vast conspiracy.

Very interesting, and I am glad that within the agency there is such a strong push to make the correct decision.  I have heard a number of first hand accounts of people seeing a SS doctor and the doctor behaving in a brusque, short, and challenging way.  I am glad this is not the norm.

FYI, the background I brought to my response to OP’s post was based on my own experience having a “mystery illness” and getting no diagnosis, and feeling I was disbelieved by doctors, until I saw I neurologist who performed the nerve tests and found many badly injured nerves. Once I saw the neurologist, I had proof that my pain and symptoms had a real reason. I guess I projected my situation onto OP and jumped to the conclusion he would have the same result.

635,"I'm not often in my own dreams. I'm usually watching a scene involving different people from a third perspective. Like watching TV. 

When I do feature in my own dream, I am disabled. I've had dreams that actually revolve around my disability (I once dreamed that I was sitting in a doctors waiting room for several hours. It was just me staring at a moving clock while experiencing bad pain and fidgeting in an uncomfortable chair and occasionally asking a receptionist how much longer... Most boring dream ever)

I think I'm disabled in my dreams for two reasons.

1) my disability and illness is congenital. I don't know what it feels like to not be disabled, my subconscious probably doesn't either.

2) my symptoms often contradict restful sleep. My dysautonomia means I can wake up in a feverous sweat, or wake up from dead sleep with a HR of 180bpm. My pain can wake me up, my joint Instability can wake me up, sometimes I wake up vomiting or having bile acid incontinence due to a delayed mast cell reaction. When I do finally get to sleep, I feel like my subconscious incorporates the symptoms into my dream to help keep me immersed in my dream. If I dream that my knee hurts, I'll be less likely to wake up to knee pain, because it's just part of the dream.

Eg: I once dreamed that  I was walking around town and pushing through the heart rate, asthma, and the pain of walking because it was such beautiful weather, when I woke up, I'd dislocated my ankle in my sleep and I was having a tachycardic and dyspnoeic mast cell reaction to the physical sress of the dislocation. I'd clearly been experiencing symptoms IRL for a long time, my foot was purple and my mast cell reaction was out of control and I had to wake my partner to help me get my meds. But I'd gotten an extra hour of sleep that night thanks to my immersive dream.

637,"To add to this, If you do bring your SD, be prepared to put your foot down on any behaviour your instructor exhibits that is inappropriate around a service dog. Prepare some statements such as ""Please do not pet the dog s/he is working"" or ""Please do not distract her/him, they need to stay focused on their task"". If you have a working dog vest for your dog, I would suggest fully kitting your dog out to take to the meeting with your instructor, not that you need to prove your dogs legitimacy, But mostly to reinforce to your instructor that this is a service dog, not a companion pet.

Does your institution have a student disability liaison office? If so, request that someone from the office attend the meeting to so there is someone there who can understand both your side and the instructors side of this issue.

A lot of people mistakenly think that therapy dogs or PTSD and GAD service dogs provide their support purely through companionship and their adorable cuteness, but as you attempted to point out in your email (something your instructor did not address in their reply) your service dog is trained to cope with crisis situations such as panic attacks and night terrors, and your dog is trained to provide medical support through tasking such as deep pressure. 

It's clear your instructor wants to stay in your good graces, but they are very ignorant on what a service dog does in the case of mental health, their language ""bring the *puppy*"" shows they have zero comprehension of the level of training and obedience your dog has.

Your professor needs to address two issues with their level of understanding 

* They were completely dismissive of the severity of GAD and PTSD  and how it can be a legitimate disability

* They were dismissive of the level of training of SDs in general, and specifically *your* SD.

They need to be willing to say ""I didn't know that about Service Dog laws, It's the first I'm hearing about it, I will have to do some research to be able to discuss it properly"" and they need to be willing to say ""I didn't understand how debilitating GAD can be and how different it is from the everyday, rational, anxiety experienced by people without a traumatic history or anxiety disorder""

If they can't accept that they have gaps in their understanding, I think you are within your right to request a way of avoiding them as an instructor. You need a teacher who can accept and accommodate your disability within reason, respecting your service dog is a perfectly reasonable accommodation and you deserve that.",,,,DearyDairy,"Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, POTS, MCAS",,1515483773,t5_2qhe8,t3_7p55u9,t1_dsenczo,10,1517711874,0,0,dsepj92,disability,,,,,

However, if you struggle with public transport and need a way to get from your house to the doctor, an electric bike can be easier to operate and qualify for compared to a car, and you can possibly use a collapsible cane once you park close to the entrance and leave your bike.

It sucks to hear from other people that it is 'really that bad', because while ultimately, you know that, and that's why you applied for disability, I think that most disabled people do a whole lot of ""I'm doing ok"" and ""It isn't really too hard"" when talking to friends and family.",,,,owlandfinch,,,1515241041,t5_2qhe8,t3_7oi4nu,t3_7oi4nu,6,1517621447,0,0,ds9t1es,disability,,,,,

716,"So aside from currently working for SSA, I also used to be an organizational rep payee (my company offered payee services).

The big issue with being a rep payee is being able to provide documentation to SSA where your money is going. Now, will SSA do a complete audit? Not unless there is a question/complaint about your mom. She is going to have to fill out an annual Rep Payee Form that just asks how much money was spent in specific categories (food, housing, medical, etc). 

Your mom is responsible for making sure that you are fed, clothed, housed, and medicated (well access to medical care). As long as she is taking care of those things, the money she gives you for spending doesn't need to be accounted for. If you wanted to spend all your spending money on lotto tickets and candy - that is your decision to make.  

When I was a payee I had my clients keep all their receipts for their spending money - but that was for cash and so wasn't auditable. If you are using your debit card for your spending money, the statements would be sufficient. 

Your mom being an accountant explains a lot. Frankly, the way you guys have it set up (payee accounts and your account) is a really smart system. And you already keep track of your expenses; probably more than you need to. 

Is her being your payee a new thing? It can be stressful for payees at first, because it is a legal responsibility for which they don't give you much direction. Conflicts between beneficiary and family rep-payees are very common. At its core it is a bit of a power struggle.

That your mom is willing to go to family therapy is a good thing, its showing she is willing to work through the issues. From your post, it sounds like she doesn't have an issue with *how* you're spending your money, just on *documenting* the spending. That is an easier conflict to resolve. Some family payees will take a person's entire check and not give them any money.

Since SSI has the asset restrictions, it does lend itself to needing more documentation and tracking. Because the combination of your 3 accounts would need to be under the asset limit at the end of the month. SSI also has the higher propensity for fraud - hiding assets, misrepresenting living situations, not reporting income, etc. 

SSDI is so much more lax. Since your assets don't matter, they will really only investigate if there is a complaint or work involved (a work investigation would actually involve both of you). 

If your goal is to eventually be your own payee, one thing you need to do is prove your fiscal responsibility with the money that you are given. If, down the road, you apply to be your own payee they will ask your mom for her opinion. Now, I'm not saying do whatever your mom says, but some compromise now might help in the long term.

Now, here's the tricky part. When you file for unemployment you are stating that you are able and willing to work. When you file disability you are doing the opposite. I personally did take unemployment myself at the advice of someone at my attorney's office. I don't know if it will bite me in the butt because I just had my hearing this month and don't have my decision, but my lawyer tells me that it's not a big deal, I just won't be paid disability for that timeframe.

So in the end you have to do what you need to do to get by. Unless you're approved right away because you meet a listing this is going to be a long process for you.

782,"You know, I think you would be much better off doing one of two things: either having the stairs demolished and turned into a ramp (with a switchback), or to put in a [chair-rail lift](https://www.accessiblemed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Elan.jpg). If you don’t have a powerchair, I would say do the rail lift. If you can walk you’re golden, if not you can have a cheap manual wheelchair on each level. It will cost far less.

Another option would be to find a local contractor who can tear out your stairs, and turn it into a ramp with a movable platform lift.

Is his wheelchair a manual chair or a power chair? Either way I don’t think what you did was offensive, but “disrespectful” I can sort of see *if it was a power chair*. 

The reason I say that is that manual chairs are pretty goddamn sturdy and you can do whatever you want to them assuming it’s not an ultralight.

I agree that most people that get disability deserve it.   The instances I gave of the questionable recipients I happen to have known on a personal level since childhood and I am fairly certain that they could've found employment of some sort.  I am not here to complain about them, however.  I was just using them as an example, wondering how they can qualify vs  what my odds of getting it would be at this point.  I feel I  am probably considered ""questionable"" even though I am documented as having a legitimate disability.  
Working all these years is taking its toll on me.  The wear and tear on my body is making daily life more difficult and applying for this benefit has been on my mind more frequently.

I've had all of these conversations. I ended up only getting an MRI and surgery because I wound up in the ER after being denied treatment repeatedly for an SCI after it was to the point that I was unable to walk for three weeks, and fought with the insurance company for weeks in the second one. About whether the recurrence of an aggressive cancer actually needed treatment. I still don't have an inhaler that works. Tbh, I'd rather live in this guy's world.

853,"Basically they were claiming that people who are overweight or don't look disabled enough shouldn't be allowed to use mobility aids and scooters because being fat and immobile is a problem made by choice that anyone can solve.  They say right there that there are no disabilities that make you gain weight. I was retaining 2 gallons of fluid when my heart failure was diagnosed. 16 pounds. How is it counterintuitive that a physical problem could make it hard to lose weight? I'm on steroids for the flu right now, which isn't helping my rage issue, but it's still garbage. 

Edit: They're also saying ""if someone doesn't eat."" So easy solution, just starve yourself. Pretty much the only way I get to 126 now is literally by starving myself, because you can't get everything you need from 600 calories a day. Which stresses the body and further breaks down the functioning of my already terrible immune system and makes my heart failure go nuts and blood pressure tank.

854,"Thank you for taking the time to read. After he asked ""why you can't just stop eating and lose weight"" I explained with a comment similar to the one I used above, ( basically people need nutrients from food, no matter their size, and it isn't always all fat) and this: ""Yes. Along with water retention. Hormones are greatly affected by many conditions as well, (my cancer treatment also affects hormones) which inevitably affects weight/fat storage/nutrient usage and can be so incredibly hard to fight. I can eat healthily, but there is literally no healthy way to cram a full dose of nutrients into 600 calories/day and be able to exercise. I tend to consume about 1000-1200 calories/day, mostly protein dense stuff- veggies, chicken, and fish- don't drink soda, alcohol, or sweetened drinks, but I don't lose weight anymore, even when I'm well enough to exercise every day. I've been mostly bedridden for about a month now though, and I haven't gained or lost weight. Of course, if you eat compete garbage it'll catch up with you no matter what with nutrient deficiencies. 600 cal in candy/soda is not going to do anyone any good.""

If the non-custodial parent is receiving the payments, the custodial parent can apply to be representative payee (the one who receives payment for the child.) Visit the office with proof of custody. 

My least favorite is the court custody documents which award equal physical/legal custody 50/50 down the middle.

We can require a third party, but then a lot of times other family members don't want to be in the middle like that.
