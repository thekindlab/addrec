2,"And the weird thing is, every time I've flown, my chair has been fine. And it doesn't even fold! It makes me wonder what people (airline employees) are doing (or in my case, not doing) to these chairs.

I honestly think that part of my luck has been because I have a solid titanium frame. In my experience, titanium chairs can take a lot heavier beating than aluminum ones. Also, I think the reduced weight of the frame makes airline employees less likely to try to ""throw"" the chair.

I'm not saying that it's anyone's fault for having an aluminum frame. I'm just saying that the chair material is the *only* difference I can think of that has allowed me to avoid chair damage while flying (when comparing manual chairs)",,,,urbancripple,,,1574473410,t5_2qhe8,t3_e07a22,t1_f8cypmx,6,1583598338,0,0,f8cz0mt,disability,,,,,

8,"It's just a term used to denote the primary distinction between disabled people and those that are not. The opposite of disabled is abled, or able-bodied (incidentally, are you also offended by the latter term?) 

It doesn't just imply the opposite. It states it outright. Disabled people distinguish themselves from ableds in communities where we discuss issues specifically related to our experiences that ableds can't or may not understand and that they certainly do not go through. 

Disabled is abnormal in the clinical, non-connotative sense of the term, so far as the average human experience goes. Most people are not disabled. It only has a negative connotation--if you are a disabled person, at least--if you allow it such a connotation. There is nothing inherently negative about being disabled or, indeed, abnormal in some way. Many people actively seek out ways to be different from normal all the time. 

That said, nothing wrong with thinking of yourself as normal, as I do myself. But I'm a normal human being who happens to be disabled. I don't shy away from it, or the terminology associated with it. 

It's also fine to not like some of the terminology we use and not want to use it yourself, but I would hazard a guess that many people don't use terms like ""ableds"" to bring any attention to the fact that they, the speakers, are disabled. Rather, it is a convenient and useful term for, again, denoting the primary difference between people in a disabled community discussing disabled issues, and those who are not part of that community. They are abled, or ableds. I am not. It is what it is. There is no shame in it.",,,,DjinnOftheBeresaad,,,1573268405,t5_2qhe8,t3_dtpzlk,t3_dtpzlk,5,1581488133,0,0,f6y5mx9,disability,,,,,

I appreciate this and your willingness to one day be accountable for turning your words into actions.

&gt;Our assistive device is considered a class one medical device so it needs to jump through some extra hoops.

I have been disabled my entire life and you are not the first person I have questioned about the price of devices and I swear to you in decades you are the first to ever explain that what I simply think of as assistive devices are regulated medical equipment. (Obviously, I see wheelchairs and crutches and what not for that but I absolutely would have never considered a product like EazyHold to be a regulated medical device.) TIL. Thank-you.

&gt;None of us are getting rich and we spend a lot of time making donations and giving away as much free product as we can to nonprofits that ask for help.

Oh! I am sorry if I lead you to believe that I think you are getting rich in this scenario. Like I said, I have literally never had anyone explain exactly why products marketed towards the disabled cost so much and now after a lifetime of wondering it makes sense.

&gt;...we are really trying hard to bring this to the main stream.

I think this is great for a lot of reasons but I see how the more people that buy it will make it more affordable.

&gt;We made them colorful So that they do not look like an assistive device for children. And that makes him so much more inclusive and they can look like part of the toy or the object And use them in a traditional classroom setting.

Something to keep in mind for the future, as a person that was once a disabled child I see the positives here. I understand your thought process. This is a good thing.

As a now disabled adult I don’t love that I am needing to buy something labeled for sippy cups or that it’s bright green. I’ve spent my life fighting to be seen as like everyone else and disabled kids often turn into disabled adults and we again fight to be seen as like everyone else. Without being infantilized or reduced in anyway. As you were disabled later in life it’s not something you could experience and because you seem only disabled in a socially acceptable way you likely won’t ever experience that and couldn’t be expected to know that.

You speak often of kids with disabilities and differences and of allies of the disabled and of yourself and your sisters and your disabling experience with arthritis and I don’t want to discredit your experience with disability or invalidate you in any way but have you spoken to adults with disabilities? People with decades of experience living a life where most everything we do we do differently? People like me have vastly different life experiences and disability experiences. We are important, our opinions matter and our money (no mater how little of it we may have) matters. Also, because you failed to acknowledge  where I pointed it out earlier we also aren’t here simply to help you get votes in a contest. I cannot stress this enough.

&gt;In the almost 4 years we have been selling, I know this sounds crazy but you are only one of 6 people who ever ever commented on our price. I know our product is expensive and People with different abilities are forced to bear the brunt of the expense.

I am trying really hard not to see this as a slap in the face or feel any way offended by this last statement but it’s really hard.

Every dollar I spend is important to me because I don’t have the means to go out and simply make more by traditional means. I have a life long disability, and likely many more health problems and no affordable access to healthcare. My worries are simply greater than being able to hold things at this point. However--and while I didn’t love your method of sharing your product--I have been following it for quite awhile and I very much like it and want to support it and I was trying to help you out by upvoting your cause (while others silently downvoted it) and making a positive statement about your product and trying to bring up questions that I know are important to a lot of people in this community.

To have you virtually wag your finger in my face and admonish me for trying to learn why something I need is so damn expensive is so out of line. I don’t know if an age difference is the factor here or something entirely different but you said, “ASK ME ANYTHING”. TBH, this is reddit and this kind of thing can go so differently.

Disabled adults are disproportionately poor, many of us live in poverty with little ability to do better for ourselves despite the fact that we desperately want to do better for ourselves.

I bet if only six people have commented on your pricing in four years it’s not because we six are the only ones that think it’s high (yes, I made an assumption here) it’s because we are the only ones that cared enough to tell you it’s high.

You really are stating the obvious here and it wasn’t in such a good way. Disabled people have to pay so many premiums in life sometimes for things as ordinary and necessary as food and toilet paper we don’t need the reminder of it and we don’t deserve to be called out for it either.",,,,anniemdi,disabled NOT special needs,,1573245445,t5_2qhe8,t3_dt931s,t1_f6wp0ki,1,1581472986,0,0,f6xa1n5,disability,,,,,

37,"He's leaving because he's in sensory hell. He's not ""escaping"", he's leaving a place that is causing him pain. The room is daily torture for him and you aren't paying attention to his signals. He's not doing what you want him to do because he hates you for forcing him to stay in a completely hellish environment and not giving a shit about how much pain he's in. Maybe you do think you care, but he's a child and that's not the behavior he's witnessing.

Eliminate the distractions. Let him sit somewhere quieter, like in the hall, or in a quieter part of the room. If someone is bothering him, make them stop. If he doesn't want to play with the other kids, don't make him. They may be bullying him or being unfriendly in ways you aren't aware of, but you can't force kids to be friends just because they're the same age and forced to be in the same classroom together. 

Your goal should not be to force him to interact, it should be to repair the trust you have broken so far. Give him a few options on what he should be doing each day, and give him a working schedule. So, tell him, you can read for half an hour or work on math for half an hour, what do you want to do? And LET HIM DO IT. Do not disrupt that 30 minutes or you will cause a meltdown. Ask him where he wants to sit while he works. If he wants to stand, that's fine too. If he wants to work in the hall where it's quieter, that's fine. Check on him regularly.

I’m sure a lot of the ´horror stories’ you hear are genuine, but I tend to think you get what you give! If you are agressive with someone for simply asking about your badge, you will probably get agression back! If you’re polite and civil, there shouldn’t be an issue ☺️ 

I’m actually pleased when people ask me, it means I’m not the only one keeping an eye on who uses the bays, and maybe next time I really need one it might not be taken up by someone who doesn’t need it that day! 

For reference, I’m a 23 year old woman and have been driving alone since I was 16. Sometimes when I walk you can’t see I have any kind of disability (though I can only walk a few metres before getting tired). I sometimes walk and sometimes use a wheelchair. I think the *’worst’* comment I ever had was “you’re too pretty to have a disability” which honestly made me laugh more than anything ��

Don’t let the horror stories put you off! Remember, if someone has an issue with something you are entitled to do... it’s THEIR issue, and not YOURS! Don’t let a stranger bring you down ☺️❤️",,,,TheyCallMeHotWheels,����21F,,1573340278,t5_2qhe8,t3_du2810,t3_du2810,2,1581544579,0,0,f71efs1,disability,,,,,

This is just my own experience, but my cousin is an adult woman with Down Syndrome. She is hard of hearing and has a hard time speaking, but she is able to easily communicate through writing, so she takes one of those reusable drawing boards with her everywhere. When she's here, I make sure to watch for her writing something down because then I know she needs something, and I make sure that I have her attention before I speak. She also sometimes struggles to make decisions if there's a lot of options, so it can be helpful to rephrase things in a manner of ""do you want to do *thing* or something else?"" so instead of having to decide between like 20 movies, she instead just has to think whether she wants to watch a particular movie or not. (She likes Toy Story.) Hell, I'll use that phrasing on myself when I can't decide what to eat or what I want to do.

On the other hand, her mother has a tendency to just plop her down on a random couch, put on a random children's tv channel (without asking my cousin if she even wants to watch TV or asking us if we're ok with having the channel changed) and then wanders off to do something else.

140,"Man, I feel like I could have written this 7 years ago, before I had my son. Are you me? ;) I have CMT too (I read your post/comment history, hope that’s okay) and my husband works in law enforcement with a crazy schedule. We have a 6-year-old son who inherited CMT 1A from me (I have so many often conflicting emotions about passing on CMT to my son). 

For me, pregnancy itself was pretty normal. I did pull a back muscle in my second trimester and I couldn’t do much about it. I have a terrible gait due to hip dysplasia surgery and weak muscles, so the added weight from the pregnancy just took its toll.

I will tell you my CMT symptoms worsened during and after pregnancy. I knew it was a possibility, but I was very naive about how bad they would get. 

Due to my husband’s schedule, he only got a week off. I had to have a c-section. For me, recovering from a c-section wasn’t terrible because I had experienced recovering from major hip surgery and relearning how to walk twice before (right hip then left hip the following year). Recovering from the c-section and managing a new born wasn’t too bad. They pretty much just sleep and eat at the beginning. I did meal prep ahead of time so I wouldn’t have to worry about meals. If I can recommend only one thing, it would be to do this. It was a lifesaver!!

Installing the carseat base can be frustrating, but removing/inserting the carrier is easy. Buckles can be a pain in the ass. 

As for crazy schedules, I tried working full-time after he turned one, but it was awful on so many levels. Now, I’m a stay-at-home mom even though my son is now in school. It just works better for our family if I stay at home, especially with my husband’s rotating work schedule. I would like to get a part-time job sometime in the future, but it needs to be a job that suits our schedule and my abilities without overdoing it. If I’m in too much pain from overworking, then I can’t be a good parent for my son.

148,"Some quick background/context: I’m typing this out a sitting in Tokyo hotel after celebrating 10 years of marriage to my amazing wife.

You learn a lot about yourself after 10 years with someone else. And, to answer your question, “no”, I don’t feel like I need to be “better” or perfect, lest my wife leave me for some rando biped. Though, I do often joke that about her running off with a capoeira instructor if I were to die first.

I know that feeling, though. Those creeping thoughts that just happen to show up every time you both wanted to do something but there’s stairs and no ramp. That sinking feeling that you might be holding the body you inhabit is holding the person you love the most back somehow.    

And then, in that moment, you see your spouses eyes narrow at the staircase and they say “Well, that’s fucking stupid” and you remember that, they didn’t want to do X, they wanted to do X _with you_. And if they can’t do X with you, they honestly don’t want to do it. 

Granted, not every situation is like this. My wife and I are completely comfortable doing things separately, either out of desire or the need for accessibility. She wants to go see some very fancy, very old temples while we’re here in Japan. Temples I probably won’t be able to get to. And that’s 100% fine. I don’t feel left out when she goes off and does something I can’t do. Instead, I just go find a food vendor and eat something that I can’t even identify. 

And that’s what I think makes our marriage so successful: We are very much individuals in our relationship. So many marriages fall into misery when people get older because one person’s health or ability is less than the other, but they refused to do separate things they both enjoy. So instead, couple does something neither of them really wants in order to create some kind of compromise where no one is actually happy with the results.

Don’t believe me? Go on a cruise or a bus tour. Especially the bus tour. I went on a bus tour to the Vatican while my wife walked around Pompeii. I absolutely stunned the tour guide when she found out I was married. 

“Where is your wife?!” She asked. 
“Crawling around Pompeii” I said. 
“You can do things separately?!”
“Of course we can. She loves ancient stairs. Rome? Crumbling stairs. Pompeii? Volcano stairs. Britain? Boiled stairs”

The secret to a  “mixed ability” (or whatever the kids call it these days) marriage is knowing, believing, and accepting that you are not a charity case and your spouse is not a saint. You are together because you want to be. Because you choose to be, every time you wake up next to them.

171,"I spent about three years in major chronic pain from a prescription drug adverse effect.  Bedridden for about a year of that, two more slow years of recovery.

What you don’t hear (that you can actually work on) is that chronic illness and pain changes relationships, particularly power dynamics in a couple.  In my case, my spouse took on everything—all the finance, all the child care, all the care for me—and when I eventually improved, we had to completely renegotiate the power and control issues between us, as well as his disclosure of his feelings during the whole time.  Caregivers often hide their feelings from the people they care for, to avoid making them feel like a burden or worthless.  It causes resentment on both sides, and puts up enormous barriers to emotional intimacy.  They also take on guilt with the responsibility—lack of self-care while needing self-care, guilt for resenting it, shame for not being the (perfect) person they’d like to be, and worry about both health and expenses, along with trying to be parent to everyone.  And if they can’t be honest about their feelings, it completely erodes the relationship.

Plus constant pain is taxing on the soul.  Your world can become very focused on your own body, which doesn’t leave a lot of room for other people’s concerns.  I have virtually no memory of when my child was five—I was incapable of doing much of anything for or with him, and that lost time hurts to this day, 20 years later.  I feel like I failed him, and moms aren’t supposed to do that.

187,"Like said below, try to get an alternative for the gastric emptying test, as well as other tests you may not have gotten. I'll be much easier if you have a diagnosis as direction.

The fact that you're overweight is good because hopefully you can tackle this issue before you get underweight which can indeed cause a lot of problems. (Altho i wonder how overweight you are given society's hysteria/hypervigilance on weight, and your undereating.) Fat stigma is very real even among medical professionals, so do some research and get support on that so your health care team will take you seriously.

You kinda gotta relearn how to eat and become a researcher of your own body. Eating small meals/snacks of mild things helps. Identify some foods that are typically tolerable to eat and typically risky to avoid. Your hunger and cravings feelings are probably messed up and unclear, so learn about what those feel like again. (Like hunger and nausea are weirdly connected, so notice the subtle distinctions.) Maybe keep a log or list to help remember. Keep safe foods stocked and keep something on your person/at work for quick access.

Finally consider your whole body health. For example, my anxiety exacerbates my stomach problems, and a psychoactive drug directly helped my appetite. Exercise can help with mood and appetite. Meditation and therapy are  great for mental and personal issues, and mindfulness is necessary for that aforememtioned research on your body.

202,"On the whole, your emotions are your emotions and you do what you need to do. You've been dealing with your pain for a while now, I gather, but if the determination makes it more real and adds some air of finality to it, you do what you must. Human emotions are complex. I don't know much about migraines--my sister gets them though not daily--but I do know they are disabling, and having to go through them every day would be awful. Even standard headaches, which migraines are not, are some of the only kinds of pain I just don't seem to be able to grin and bear. It must be terrible, and I can imagine it puts you out of commission. The only thing I can say is that there are ways to gain a new normal and a new sense of control, just like any disability, and part of the process is finding that new normal and making the most of your life. In that way, you are not doomed forever. 

And hey, at least everyone you know if supportive and validating with regards to your disability and the financial determination. Although my family doesn't give me grief about being disabled either, I know that it is not so fortunate for some other disabled people. 

I do take care of myself, but it is human nature to feel a loss of control to be something that is scary, perhaps even dehumanizing. My disability doesn't have sentience, but if it did, I'd say it likes to remind me of how limited I am in terms of mobility.

Seriously lol for real. Every time I had an appointment my parents would take me to Checker’s, which was near the medical district, and they had my favorite fries. “<URL>ips - my favorite food” I remember taking my pain medicine with sprite and when I threw up, it tasted like sprite. I kept trying to watch movies in the hospital because they had like every kids movie ever and I was super psyched but I kept falling asleep. Other kids came to visit me but they looked at me like they were scared of me. It made me really sad so I just wanted them to go away. The same thing happened when I went home. I couldn’t play sports or games or be around anything that might knock me in the head for a YEAR. Getting the staples out was super scary but didn’t hurt as much as I thought it would, but when I washed my hair for the first time, I cried because it hurt so bad.

261,"Thank you so much for your questions . It is a valid one. And I hope you let me explain.

Yes...We really look forward to the time we can bring the prices down…It is my goal to provide a bucket of them to every child who needs for a very low cost.

My sisters and I started this company five years ago we all have arthritis.  I couldn’t even hold onto my own broom and rake and equipment like that. We all had other jobs, not high-paying jobs, but we each took what we had in our savings and put it into developing this idea. 

I know they just seem like simple straps but they still took so much time and effort and cost to prototype and cad file and medical trial and patent and trademark and and license and  manufacture and insure and distribution and on and on. 

Our assistive device is considered a class one medical device so it needs to jump through some extra hoops. $$$

They need to be #1 quality silicone with FDA approved ingredients because they’re going to be on little kiddos hands and near their mouth.
We looked for a very very long time to find a manufacturer we could trust to have all good ingredients that were safe and a plant that was clean.


When we finally went to market we had invested a lot. On the market now for over three years we are still recouping losses and one of us still needs to work full-time at her other job and  I myself I’m still working at another job and will be retiring in December and one sister is getting  paid full-time wages. 
When we reversed engineered the costs we knew we had to sell each strap somewhere around eight dollars. 
The reason was because we are a brand new company and we are trying to let people know , and most people don’t know about it,  And orders are growing but are not massive yet…so at this time we cannot order from our manufacture in large supply to bring down the cost of each drop to a very minimal cost

So the Cost to us is still quite high. 
We are hopeful of a time when everyone will know about us and we can order much more from our  manufacture and he will bring our prices down. 

Some of the prices that you see our from our distributors and  they mark them up. We don’t have any control about what they sell them for.

We sell our product  on our e-commerce site for the minimum we can and still pay expenses and salary.  $16 for two. None of us are getting rich and we spend a lot of time making donations and giving away as much free product as we can to nonprofits that ask for help. 

We sell our product on Amazon and they of course take approximately 35%. My sister does all the bookkeeping and fulfilling of orders. We work a long day every day. This has been particularly difficult a year and Trump is taking another 30% for tariffs. 
Though we have sold more this year than last we had hoped we would have been able to bring the price down this year, but we are breaking even because of the tariffs And every day my sister and I talk and say oh my gosh we may have to raise the prices if these tariffs don’t come off. 

I myself am doing the marketing, I do not have marketing experience and him trying my best to learn as I go. It is not easy to sell an Ability product as you may know and we are really trying hard to bring this to the main stream. So so many parents don’t know about it and their kids are going without holding anything. Not a spoon. Not a teether. Not a toy. I’m desperately trying to be hearing awareness to them and the necessity of keeping more ability products in the main stream marketplace. Amazon.

We made them colorful So that they do not look like an assistive device for children. And that makes him so much more inclusive and they can look like part of the toy or the object And use them in a traditional classroom setting.

  I am trying to advertise to companies that do not sell Ability products because I want them to know that they can go onto toys for kids. Or onto bicycles. That people with individual needs could be doing so much more!  

In the almost 4 years we have been selling, I know this sounds crazy but you are only one of 6 people who ever ever commented on our price. I know our product is expensive and People with different abilities are forced to bear the brunt of the expense. 

It’s not what we want to do. And we hope hope hope we can bring the price down.

I hope you can find a way to reach out to us and keep in touch… And hold me accountable And I will be able to prove to you that I brought the prices down.

354,"If I say ""Ugh fucking ableds at it again..."" to any of my disabled friends they know exactly what I mean.

It's a shorter version of ""able-bodied people"" for me. And yes, sometimes that person may have an invisible disability so I try to be as polite as posible if I have to engage someone. At least the first few times. But statistically unless my campus suddenly has an explosion of students with invisible disabilities most of those I encounter who shove past my wheelchair to get into the elevator that I'm supposed to have priority access to or refuse to have any spacial awareness are indeed ableds being assholes.

And no--- I'm not offended by being called disabled. Hell I call myself a cripple (now granted nobody else and certainly not an abled can call me this).
I've aged out of the desperate need to deny what I am and be like ""No I'm not different I'm just like an abled-bodied person!"". When I was a kid and desperately trying to prove I was just like an abled/aspiring to be them I said it a lot though.

Now, am I different in terms of what I want out of life or in that I should be treated with the same respect and dignity? No of course not.

But realistically my body moves, eats, sleeps, shits and fucks differently because it is disabled. I navigate the world a different way. Being with me in any capacity necessitates acknowledging that my body is different and needs different things.

Disabled folks are a minority and like any minority group they had and continue to have difficult dealings with the majority group and a world that is somewhere between hostile and completely ignorant to their existence.
So we have language like ableds and ""Ableds are Weird"" and ""shit ableds say"" to discuss that/our experience with ableism and institutional/structural ableism.

I was out with someone and we were both using our motorized wheelchairs that day. We were headed down to the subway platform and got into the elevator. It was a tight fit. The door is about to close.
This able-bodied man with lots of luggage suddenly opens the door back up.

He doesn't ask/say anything. He attempts to push my motorized chair out of the way like I'm a piece of furniture to make room for his luggage. When my chair doesn't move he begins looking angry, exasperated and insulted and begins arguing with us that there was space. 

In his abled mind we should have been able to squeeze in like sardines. Bcause bipeds can do that and move that way and it didn't occur to him that chairs need more room to maneuver. We tried to explain that sorry, no, there wasn't any room. But he was so insulted. 

We get it all the time though. People are stunned to see we exist out in public. That the elevator, automatic doors and etc are actually meant for us and not their convienence.

But when I looked at my friend after that guy stormed off the elevator and was like ""Dude, fucking ableds...."" he knew exactly what I meant.",,,,alone_in_the_after,,,1573478939,t5_2qhe8,t3_dtpzlk,t3_dtpzlk,2,1581659247,0,0,f77x6ju,disability,,,,,

It took a long time for my mom to come to terms with my conditions, but she's there now.

Ask them for opinions as to what might be helpful, feel free to suggest mobility aids such as, cane, rollator/walker or crutch(es).

What kind of school? What country do you live it? Is there a Disabilities Coordinator? Or a Disabilities Services/Office? Is there something like an IEP or Section 504 plan available to you?

Find out if there are any accommodations for you. You can ask while you are waiting to see your doctor.

You'd have to have something like a water or oxygen allergy for it to be the only thing that could prevent you from doing *any* job whatsoever, which is part of the criteria. In other words, your allergy has to be well and truly disabling, not just inconvenient.

You would also have to show documentation that despite all of your best efforts to manage your allergies and find work, you have failed to do that. 

Dyslexia would be much easier to pin down than allergies actually. Although, again, many people with these issues are able to find different kinds of jobs they can do.

Personally, giving people the option to walk through security (with a Special Assistance person, if required) and then get wheelchair assistance/an electric to the gate is my FAVOURITE and very rare. I walk with crutches and for me standing in a queue is very painful, but if I can use the Fast Track through security then I can manage that walk. It cuts down on the number of wheelchairs needed (and at busy airports, there are never enough!), and then the assistance is there for the longer distance element (which again is where most people with mobility difficulties struggle). Like most people, I don’t enjoy being pushed in a wheelchair so anything that makes it easier for me to keep a bit of independence (while also reducing the burden on the airport) is a real bonus!

I guarantee that there is *some* opportunity out there for you that fits within your interests and abilities. And if you go back to school/work, volunteering always looks great on an application.

Though I have multiple sclerosis, which seems to have a few similarities to the POTS, and also my sister has EDS. I can care less what some people think, stupid people's criticism, and them passing judgment, they have  opinions and think they know it all.
I myself been through several doctors, (perhaps it's the region where I live, they don't seem to know much of anything) So like my mom once said, you pretty much have to be your own doctor.
But, just like going shopping, each one at least had a few good opinions, but mostly opinions that I don't agree with.  At least the best opinion I got was ""help what you can help"" and ""everyone is different what works for one may not work for another and vice versa."" My new recent doctor (here I go again) is based on the challenges of my insurance. Over the years I've seem to have quite a bit of second opinions.
As far as getting help to be on disability, and it sounds like you're the type of person that deserves it that and other benefit programs. When I got mine it was help with someone through the United way,  or some may have to go through an attorney/lawyer. If you haven't already apply for disability benefits through SS ASAP! Because if you win you may be able to get the retro back pay, which is really nice and helpful. Hopefully you will win, and if you do if you do have an attorney / lawyer involved in this, which is a good idea, then they will get paid a percentage when you get paid. I'm not sure how your state works, but see about getting on full medicaid, not partial. It's a shame that they have to judge you on your income, rather than the medical challenges we face! Mine was just over the minimum requirements. Also see about getting on other programs, both Federal and non-federal if any. See about getting health insurance which may be a little challenging.

My son graduates high school this year and is already looking into work instead of college. He wants to go back later and get a degree but he knows he won't be able to afford it. As for the scholarships. I'll share a story from my kids teacher. They have a class called senior experience. It is amazing. They teach them how to apply for all the scholarships and Grant's. They also have them job shadow someone who works in the career they want to go into. Well this teacher was explaining that they should apply for every scholarship and grant even if they aren't technically qualified for it. You see he got a scholarship set aside for African American students. He is a white guy. He should not of gotten this scholarship but no one else applied for it that year. No one in his area applied for it. So apply for everything you can find. In the long run it will help. My kids get to apply for special scholarships because I am disabled and we are low income.

There are a whole range of tyres/tires available for wheelchairs - mostly because the tyres also fit on bicycle wheels. If you're looking for more traction, you should be able to find mountain bike tyres that will fit onto your wheels. The downside is that you'll probably have to adjust the position of your brakes as the mountain bike tyres will be bigger than 1"" deep.

There should be no need to change the wheels, just the tyres. Chunky tyres usually have an inner tube, so you need to be careful about broken glass on the sidewalk. Fitting new tyres is just like changing bicycle tyres, so get some tyre irons to help with the change.

If mountain bike tyres aren't quite doing the job, you might want to have the tyres with a lower than recommended pressure as this makes the tyres flatter and gives a larger contact with the ground which gives more traction.",,,,BlueBear63,,,1573308394,t5_2qhe8,t3_dtvz9m,t3_dtvz9m,2,1581504486,0,0,f6z443b,disability,,,,,

778,"Hi, I’m the person who designed these t-shirt ideas. u/IdaCrackersGhost put out a design request in r/tshirtdesigns and I responded. [Here is our exchange](https://np.reddit.com/r/tshirtdesigns/comments/dogipc/need_a_design_for_disability_rights/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). I asked for some direction, and I got zero. He/She didn’t even have a slogan or a basic concept of what the desired message was, so I googled and got Disability Rights Are Human Rights.

I’m a former web designer who still dabbles in graphic design, and that’s why I submitted ideas for this disability march, which IdaCrackersGhost is now apparently thinking of canceling because he/she got banned from this sub.

What I wanted from this little venture was to sell the shirts on Amazon for zero profit, so about $14 each. Why no profit? Because Amazon has a tier system for sellers, and selling items, regardless of profit, is how you move up the tier system which is beneficial to me. I don’t need to make money from this.

So anyway, after reading subsequent posts from IdaCrackersGhost, it seems that he/she was planning to cut me out of the process anyway. That doesn’t really surprise me, since we never had a formal agreement of any kind.

It’s so easy for people to overlook the nuance involved in the notion of disability. I certainly did before becoming unwell.

I find people often misunderstand that wheelchair users are not all entirely paralysed or that the reason it doesn’t appear that one fifth of the population are disabled is that they don’t realise when they are seeing a person with a disability.

806,"In the hope of helping with your anger by explaining what the bartender's logic might be, although I don't know if this applies to where you specifically live.

Where I am serving a drunk is not only closure of the bar by government but a nearly open and shut lawsuit that can leave the owner of the bar living on an unemployment handout from the government with not a penny more.  That has to do with law being highly protective of bar patrons for a variety of serious reasons ranging from drunk driving to sexual assault by means of deliberately impairing the victim.  Nobody's saying that everyone who has a drink becomes instant trouble, far from it, but under law the people serving drinks have to take that very seriously.

I was once at a table in an eatery that served alcohol and mentioned a bit too loudly that I felt buzzed from my drink.  My friend explained to me that I had just made myself a very serious potential liability to the owner of that bar without the staff having recourse to do more than observe me closely.  In fact we were both asked if we were driving and replied truthfully that neither of us had a car and we were travelling by public transit bus.  When we left our completely orderly dining experience a staff member was outside the door to the eatery observing us at the bus stop until we boarded the bus.  No, they weren't being obstreperous buttholes but as per that old song in fear of the long arm of the law.

I feel that it's not necessarily anyone being a butthole to anyone else.  Certainly it's important to minimize drunk driving and risk to women (anyone!) who could have their boundaries violated as a result of intoxication.  That isn't necessarily prevented by refusing to serve someone who's intoxicated and for sure not by mistaking a sober man with a health issue for intoxicated, but you will get that if a barkeep has been scolded by their boss about not paying enough attention to that kind of thing; there I'm just speculating but there may be something situational contributing to it.

You were perfectly proper to do what you did and I encourage it.  Businesses treat that as feedback rather than something that always calls for personal response depending on the number and variety of paying customers and their own time and money available to respond to you directly; but they likely will take this seriously and address it with staff as you have it in your hand now to make them look awful by alleging bigotry against a medically limited man.  It would be hell for them to prove that you were wrong about that and people would simply mention to each other that it had been alleged against them and that has a lot of power over a retail business like a bar.  At the very least any legal professional advising the owners will explain this to the owner and make sure the owner is aware of any risks to them.  In law people say things such as ""belt and suspenders"" which does not refer to looking stupid with your jacket off but rather to making extra sure nothing bad will blindside you because you didn't account for it in advance.

Sorry for the long reply but I just wanted to tell you what I feel could help you orient yourself in this situation and hopefully feel empowered to handle your own feelings.",,,,Sirisalo,,,1573956217,t5_2qhe8,t3_dxa3p7,t3_dxa3p7,6,1581973744,0,0,f7pydut,disability,,,,,

810,"Hey, 21 yr old cane user here! 
1. Use whatever helps you, whether it reduces pain, aids in stability, or just makes you feel a little more secure. You don’t have to explain to anybody why you’re using it unless you want to. And don’t let anybody tell you you don’t need it cuz who cares, nobody is pulling out a cane at 20yrs old for no reason. Why would you, the fact that you even thought you might need one means you probably do because it’s not hip or cool to have an effin cane okay it’s not the next trend it’s a mobility aid that is needed even if you *can function* without it, you shouldn’t have to just because society says you’re not old enough or disabled enough or whatever 
2. There is so much stigma and ignorance surrounding being a young cane user. It’s insane. I have people tell me I’m faking or worse point and gawk at me like a circus freak. People think it’s sooo funny to make old person jokes and gross men take the opportunity to comment on how they’d like me to grasp their stick.

813,"Sorry, I wanted to reply sooner, needed to find out where my mum wrote down what happened at the assessment (she makes notes of this sort of thing, same for doctors appointments etc. Too much for my brain to keep track of and my memory is crap). Keep getting distracted. 

In 2017, I had my face to face Work Capability Assessment for ESA. I went with my mum and we were dropped off outside by my dad, I had a panic attack on the way in. The lady who assessed me was a nurse and it was all recorded. We basically went through my conditions and how they affected me, and what I do day to day and the help I need etc. There was more of a focus on my mental health issues. I asked why she didn't want to know more about my physical health stuff and she said she ""had all the information [she] needed"". I had no physical exam because she said she was concerned about injuring me and also not knowing enough about my physical health conditions/disabilities. At one point she left the room to do something as well (dunno what) and she phoned my GP in front of me because of concerns she had about my wellbeing.

Few weeks later I got a letter stating I was put into the Support Group (aka Limited Capability for Work and Work Related Activity in UC terms). My mum then got the copies of the report and some other stuff which stated why I got put into the SG (due to severe functional limitation - it upset me when I read that) and when I would be assessed again. 

I got reassessed the tail end of last year and stayed in the SG without a face to face assessment.

I do also recieve PIP at the Enhanced Rate of Daily Living and the Standard Rate of Mobility for my mental and physical health issues/disabilities.",,,,collectedd,,,1573102310,t5_2qhe8,t3_ds3tbp,t3_ds3tbp,1,1581008180,0,0,f6rfl97,disability,,,,,
814,"I doubt she was trying to be mean but it’s hard because I have some serious trauma from a pain management doctor being verbally abusive to me when I first became disabled. He told me pain wasn’t a real disablity and there was no reason I couldn’t work so I must just be lazy. Because of that I forced myself to keep working even though it caused more degradation to my spine and eventually my hip making my physical limitations even worse. I hated myself for years because I felt like a fraud for being on disability and I’m still learning how to accept that. I barely have a relationship with my parents because they think all people on SSDI are a drain on society and don’t deserve help.

I get that she wasn’t trying to be mean but I’ve had so many doctors out right call me lazy and not really disabled despite having a majority deformed spine, nerve damage, arthritis and fibromyalgia:( The hospital that botched my last spinal surgery refused to let me be treated at their pain management department because the head doctor there told me it was more important for a woman my age to be trying to have kids versus trying to manage my pain and go back to work. This woman was probably not trying to be malicious but so many people in the medical community seem to just hate young people with chronic pain assumption we are all lazy or drug addicts.

855,"&gt;Disability (which I believe is on a spectrum) is an identity 

Hmm...I do and and don't agree with this. On one hand, I know I'm grumpier, foggier, less friendly and motivated due to my conditions. On the other hand, the tenacity and resourcefulness with which I've handled this has always been there, and has even grown through the experience. I don't know that disability (dis-capacity?) is part of my identity, but it is very much part of my daily reality. 

&gt;and it feels like once you've taken on that identity, you can't go back and people will always view you differently. 

I do agree that people view me differently as my ""invisible illness"" has started to show, but while I could only ever imagine it being negative, but mostly, that's been an unexpectedly positive. People have stepped up to help and accommodate, and the more vocal I was about my limitations, the better and more tailored the help was. Even simple things like friends asking me to tea instead of on a walk, dropping me off at the front, one friend even brought an air mattress out to a field so we could enjoy some nature since I can't hike or anything. I thought it would wreck my relationships, but it's strengthened them. 

&gt;Today, I am sick and in more pain but no one will see this, only the night I went out.

I feel this so hard...and then they won't understand when you're flared and can't go out. I've started sharing more of my story on Instagram so people can understand more. Today I'm missing out on seeing my family, in the next town over. I really wanted to go and did everything I could to not be flared for the trip, but, out of the blue I worsened. 2 days before, I was happily engaged at a dinner party, not feeling too poorly and looking fantastic with lipstick and hair done and all. 

&gt;I've been encouraged to apply for some disabled student support but I just can't bring myself to do it.

This is where I wonder if the language trips us up. Would you apply for student support if it was called something else—maybe a program like, ""Chronic Illness Support"" or ""Friends of Fatigue""? Or even something vague like ""Extra Spoon?"" Something that felt more tailored to you? 

I sure would. Applying for ""disability"" feels weird, and it's clear getting chronic pain cases + ""vague"" cases like fatigue through is really tough. And don't even get me started on the all-or-nothing-ness of disability, which really limits disabled folks from moving forward. But I feel like I could do more, and contribute to society more, with some sort of...boost for discapacitated people. 

It could look like: monthly stipends, ability to use a shorter line at the checkout and such (or benches provided), more scooters at grocery stores so you didn't feel like you were taking someone else's, better AFFORDABLE grocery delivery options (or even the ability to shop ahead and just pick up the bag without going through the whole store) a worldwide ban on fluorescent lights, stricter noise pollution control, mobility aids at airports that can be independently operated, more maps of everything so you know where to park and how far you'll need to walk and can plan, and on and on. 

I still don't use all the disabled services available to me, even ones that would help, but I am working on it.

I'd rather have something incase people don't understand. Than be completely screwed with no voice and no likelyhood of them hearing. Phoning people is a really hard thing with no voice.

Maybe something like this might help with talking on the phone, I really need that, cause I have soo many things to use the phone for. Dentist. Doctors. Psyc. Hospital. The council. Etc.

862,"I can confirm that from indirect personal knowledge.  I the 1990s I knew a young couple, both disabled, who were receiving so-called Family Benefits because they were a couple although they had no children and weren't planning any.  At the time they might have been married or still common-law but they were still in their twenties.  Their family benefits were around $2,100 a month.  Because they lived in a large city/small town with terrible public transit they walked to the grocery store and then took their groceries home by taxi.  On their Family Benefits, partly thanks to much lower market-rate shelter costs, they could afford to rent a whole floor of a house but would of course not have been able to afford any equity-building payment arrangement.  They later broke up and lived separately and were still each receiving nearly as much as my current disability benefits, which are amounts publicly disclosed by the government that issues them as they're the same by geographic area for all single recipients with no dependants.  I point this out because their Social Assistance as singles with no dependants was NOT disability benefits and today would be issued in smaller amounts under different terms.  In fact, during the brief transition from working man to disability benefits I was on Social Assistance signed off by a physician as not obligating me to conduct a job search, and the non-shelter component was $240 a month.  That may be different now but my disability nonshelter component is likely at least twice that much; while, thanks to the old much cheaper shelter costs, prorating to less than the flat Social Assistance monthly balloon payment that each of those young breakers-up got.",,,,Sirisalo,,,1573787173,t5_2qhe8,t3_dwh6ta,t3_dwh6ta,2,1581866775,0,0,f7jv0g1,disability,,,,,

Quitting working was the hardest thing I've ever done and finding value in my life on disability has been a challenge. I spent the first year-and-a-half just recovering and trying to get my body to settle down a bit. 


The past year I've spent focusing on researching things that will help me improve, committing to my physical therapy making myself do it as much as I can, and trying to find some hobbies that work with my capabilities and that also gets me outside of my head for a bit so that I can use it as part of my mindfulness training. 


Now I'm trying to figure out ways I can be supportive of the people in my family without it being detrimental to my own progress and stability.

923,"Eventually, you'll have a map in your head of the good pavements, doors etc. and it will just feel normal going from a to b. You'll automatically go down routes that work for you.

If you have the money, a height adjustable desk would work well, but if you only need it up a few inches, you could just put some planks of wood under it.

Mine was quick too. I don't  know if you ever stop grieving really. I think I'll always mourn the life I had and could have had. I had a sewing room up a spiral staircase with a big cutting table and loads of room then all of a sudden I had nothing. I still don't have much in the way of personal space in our flat, but I have a desk and storage for my machines (even if I need a hand getting them out) so it is better than it used to be.

Can you get a grab rail to put vertically at the top of the stairs to help? Walkers are great, but they aren't the best at not moving about in my experience.

When it gets to the winter, it probably is worth taking your charger with you if you're going further than normal, but it will probably be fine most days without.

I don't often leave the UK, but it is for environmental reasons rather than anything to do with my disability. It is perfectly possible to leave the UK, but it isn't something I do very often. If you're talking about London in the UK then I wouldn't worry about trying to get a car. You would be quicker getting the tube than trying to drive. We are actually spending new years eve in London and I'm probably not going to bother taking the car because it's more hassle than it's worth. It'll be public transport the whole way.

Most cities in Europe have more than good enough public transport that you can just use buses, trams and trains from the airport and everywhere you want to go. Some countries might not have laws in place to ensure that restaurants, hotels etc. have level access, but I have always found people to be incredibly helpful when it comes to trying to get about. We did go to Budapest one summer, which was really good. Public transport was wonderful and in the summer all the restaurants have tables on the street so it doesn't matter if it isn't accessible. All the museums, art galleries and general sight seeing places were as accessible as they could be and you get yourself plus one other in for free because of a government scheme for disabled people.

There are accessible travel companies that can help you organise trips. I know there's one that will organise fully accessible tours of Iceland, another will take you up Machu Picchu.

You'll automatically go down routes that work for you. I find it helps to check out journeys on street view just to check what the pavements are like before you go to a new place.

If you have the money, a height adjustable desk would work well, but if you only need it up a few inches, you could just put some planks of wood under it.

Mine was quick too. I don't  know if you ever stop grieving really. I think I'll always mourn the life I had and could have had. I had a sewing room up a spiral staircase with a big cutting table and loads of room then all of a sudden I had nothing. I still don't have much in the way of personal space in our flat, but I have a desk and storage for my machines (even if I need a hand getting them out) so it is better than it used to be.

Can you get a grab rail to put vertically at the top of the stairs to help? Walkers are great, but they aren't the best at not moving about in my experience.

I don't often leave the <LOCATION>, but it is for environmental reasons rather than anything to do with my disability. It is perfectly possible to leave the <LOCATION>, but it isn't something I do very often. If you're talking about <LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> then I wouldn't worry about trying to get a car. You would be quicker getting the tube than trying to drive. We are actually spending new years eve in <LOCATION> and I'm probably not going to bother taking the car because it's more hassle than it's worth. It'll be public transport the whole way.

Most cities in <LOCATION> have more than good enough public transport that you can just use buses, trams and trains from the airport and everywhere you want to go. Some countries might not have laws in place to ensure that restaurants, hotels etc. have level access, but I have always found people to be incredibly helpful when it comes to trying to get about. We did go to <LOCATION> one summer, which was really good. Public transport was wonderful and in the summer all the restaurants have tables on the street so it doesn't matter if it isn't accessible. All the museums, art galleries and general sight seeing places were as accessible as they could be and you get yourself plus one other in for free because of a government scheme for disabled people.

There are accessible travel companies that can help you organise trips. I know there's one that will organise fully accessible tours of <LOCATION>, another will take you up <LOCATION> <LOCATION>.

933,"Honestly, it's hard to say how long it will take. I was told the same stuff, and then I was surprised by how quickly I was awarded once I did an appeal after the initial rejection. I did take (very good) advice from people insisting I get a lawyer, and she was *amazing*. She thought of stuff I hadn't even realized could help my case. Once I gave her a list of all my doctors over the years, her secretary contacted them and they got all my documents, then paid for it all for a small fee (I think $80?) in order to maximize my chances of winning. I had my trial hearing in January, and then come March, I was told that I had won my case. I had money in my account about a month later, if that. They also deposited in a portion of my backpay (I think you get it every six months?) and then my monthly check, and everything's been on the up and up since. Before I hired my lawyer, I was told that I probably wouldn't see the judge for at *least* two years. She got that bumped up to me getting a trial date within three months.

It helped that my lawyer had been working in disability law for a very long time, and she knew the ins and outs of the courts like the back of her hand. I was reassured that she would help as best as she could, and she certainly did. I mean, of course she would try her best -- disability lawyers don't get paid unless you win. If you don't, then they're just as out of luck as you are. I harbored no false pretenses that she took my case to just help out the disabled. She had a dog in the fight, too, and getting a portion (I think they can only get up to 30%, but I'm almost certain she only wanted 20%) of my backpay was her reward. It worked out for both of us. She got her 20% of my backpay, and then that was it. They don't get any portion of your monthly payment. It was a one-time thing, and we're both happy.

So it's kinda hard to say how long it'll take. I thought I would have to wait years, like everyone else.

I’m an amputee, so sometimes in a wheelchair and sometimes ambulatory. And some days I have no pain, and some days I’m miserable.

You don’t ever know what someone else is going through. The only way we fight for invisible disability to be accepted is by owning who we are and being proud of it.

957,"Hi, 

You would be the best judge of what you can or can't do once you improve and depending on what those improvements bring to you. If you are asking if you could work from home or work a job a couple of days a week and not lose any SSI, it depends on many factors. 

Yes, if you are living with someone and have no bills to pay, it is less likely you will get the full amount since this is money meant to help you cover the basic costs of living. As you say, though, minimum prices for renting a room in your area seem to be high compared to the maximum SSI, so that is a trade-off. 

You can also explore Ticket to Work options that may help you find employment that allows you to work for a specific period while still receiving the full amount of SSI assuming you are approved. 

When I first started working out of uni, I was part of some programs that helped me to be able to work for a short while without it affecting disability payments or my rent ceiling. I've been working a while now and no longer get disability, but I try to stay on top of any changes in the laws.",,,,DjinnOftheBeresaad,,,1574121347,t5_2qhe8,t3_dxwrfs,t1_f7zyle7,2,1583365152,0,0,f805u6i,disability,,,,,

If approved for state, the state will pay you up to 12 months, depending on your doctors orders. The state pays about 55% of your base earnings in the previous year. If approved for private STD, they will pick up the difference between what the state pays you and what the policy limit is. You will have to periodically (like every 6 weeks or so) update your medical stuff with both entities. After 6 months, private STD ends and if you have been paying for private LTD you will apply for that. If you don’t have that or are not approved, the state will pay for up to 1 year (so like months 6-12). After that you’ve either got the private LTD and you’ll need to decide if you’re going for SSDI, which is a whole different beast.

The other benefit is SSDI, it is a Social Security benefit that you had to pay into through taxes on your salary when you worked. The amount that you paid in and how long governs how much your check will be. The average check for 2019 is $1234 per month, although if you were a high earner it can go up to a max of about $2600 per month. In addition, if you have eligible dependents, you can collect approximately 50% of the amount of your benefit for those dependents.

A caseworker was working really hard and therefore ended up with twice as large a caseload as coworkers getting the same pay, so of course coworkers found that caseworker hillariously stupid within the workplace.  The caseworker adjusted by doing the least work that's acceptable and is now seen as a Rightful Person and Upstanding Citizen by those coworkers by acting like a lazy asshole at work.

This has to do with how high the personal cost of living of an employee is, which ONLY depends on whether the employee is a parent of middle-class kids or not.  The cost of raising a child drove the first cultivation of wild crops and thus agrarianism and since then every single bit of civilization and technological improvement.  Kids have always cost three arms and a leg because they consume more than any other humans while producing nothing because that's how it has to work.  The choice of real dedication to your job always means either your don't have kids or you pay a nanny to raise your kid (more often daycare while you go to work).  Otherwise, because of your kids, you have to do the least paid work for the most money.

As disabled people we rarely have a middle-class kid in the sense of the kid having middle-class spending power: organized after-school semischools such as team sports, clothes that cost more than a disabled person gets all month, that kind of thing.  Many of us don't have kids at all because people don't trust us to have the money for a middle-class kid and everybody, regardless of their own economic status, wants to have middle-class kids.  Our disability has nothing to do with it because a rich man who's paralyzed from the neck down still ends up being the spouse of a dedicated caregiver whose whole professional career is in reality being such a spouse.  While that doesn't necessarily mean having kids once you're quadriplegic, it doesn't stop you from continuing to have middle-class kids no matter your bio sex or gender.  That tends not to be the case if you're disabled from early in life because then the more money your parents have the more they park you in an expensive hotel euphemized as a residential health care facility or boarding school.  The Harry Potter conceit is silly as Harry's parents weren't boarding school parents and boarding schools were for other people's intolerable wankers and fuckups, not for young elite achievers with Parsifal mentalities.  Not once in history did a young elite achiever survive with a Parsifal mentality; a Himmler or Rumsfeld or Hillary Clinton mentality was indispensible and always will be.

1132,"I went down this road about 2.5 years ago. Once I had the initial approval and was deemed disabled from ""my specific job"" , they pretty much let me be for the first 20 Mos. 

As we approached the 24 Month review for ""disabled from all work"" , the company contacted me and needed ALL the paperwork redone by everybody who was treating me or had treated me sinc emy initial approval.  

They also requested doc notes from these medical providers. I ended up getting copies of everything myself and sending it to them and I made an appt with my main doctor to get my paperwork redone. 

I did have some trouble leading up to the 24 month as different reps from the insurance company were involved in my reevaluation and they kept asking for info that had been provided previously and telling me different things in terms of what was needed.

The people on the front line taking my calls all told me different and conflicting info. I got to where I just always push for a callback from my case manager and pose my questions directly to them. It was very frustrating.

1135,"LTD is a completely different ballgame than SSDI or SSI. With government disability you have to prove that you're to disabled to participate in gainful employment or hold a job regularly. With LTD you are fighting a private company who has a financial incentive to deny you so they get more money. With LTD often times they will deny you if you don't have a chance of winning SSDI because the LTD company will make you apply and they get paid back everything they paid you. If they accept you for LTD and you don't get government disability, they lost a bunch of money but if you do get it they break even. So if you can't get a lawyer to appeal their decision (which isn't necessary, you can appeal yourself) that tells them you are probably not going to pursue or win SSDI and they don't want anything to do with you. Just request all the information in your claim. Reprint it and send it all back with all of the ""new evidence"". Make it so big they can't possible read it all in 90 days.

What happens from here on out depends on your actions.  Your e-mail isn't very specific.  For instance, you mention that you have talipes, which isn't a common term, and I'm certain that whoever read this e-mail was forced to investigate it on their own.  I think that you were better off describing, in your own words, your exact condition.  This way, there's no confusion about how others may perceive your appearance.

You also weren't specific in your interaction w/ the bartender, other than to state that you were, ""...humiliated in front of my group of friends as I was denied service.""  What exactly did the bartender say to you?  How did they humiliate you?  The question of them instituting their policy of not over-serving is going to hinge on what the bartender told you.  If they said that they were refusing service, b/c they believed that you'd had too much to drink, that would be well w/in their rights, since they have a legal responsibility not to over-serve, both as an establishment, as well as each bartender individually, since there can be heavy fines, civil suit compensatory payments, and possible jail time involved in cases, where someone over-served caused serious bodily injury to others.  If, on the other hand, they stated that they wouldn't serve you, b/c they didn't want ""your kind"" in their bar, or they diminished you based on your disability, that's a whole other story.

You have to remember that they do have the right to refuse service to those they feel are inebriated.  It's a judgment call.  However, if there is a pattern of them over-serving others, you may have a case against them.  Your job right now is to be honest w/ yourself, and determine what the bartender was actually doing.  Were they simply doing their job, which may have embarrassed you in front of your friends, or were they truly discriminating against you?

If you choose to file a complaint against them, you'd need to seek legal guidance.  If you choose to correspond w/ this establishment again, I would recommend you take a few different tacks.  First, sound conciliatory, almost deferential, in your tone.  You want to come across as being completely reasonable in asking for whatever it is you want.  You don't want to come across as unhinged or someone looking to use your disability to punish others who don't treat you exactly the way you feel you should be treated.  This would not make you sympathetic to a judge or a jury, regardless of your justification.

Also, be clear and concise in the what, when, where, (your perceived) why, and how of events that transpired.  If you write again, mention the establishment by their full name and street address.  Tell them what day, date, and time you were there.  Tell them the name (or description) of the offending bartender.  Clearly explain your interaction, including your condition, and quote the bartender accurately.  Tell them who witnessed this.  Know the law where you are, and tell them why you believe they violated it.  And finally, either clearly state how you want them to resolve this, or ask them how they intend to resolve this.

You sign a contract with the organization and you get the dog and return it when it retires (or washes) and you are then paired again with another dog to meet your needs. But you can also have orgs that charge a prity penny for privately trained dogs some you end up owning the dog and others the fee you pay still means you return the dog when it retires. 

There is also owner training which is legal in the US and Canada (but might not be in other countries, so if traveling outside of north America that could be a issue), though within canada it varies on the provance to what rights OT has vs Program (program tend to have more rights granted then OT unfortunately in a few provadences). 

Cost wise virtually no program covers the upkeep of the dog, that is 100% you, including annual vaccinations and emergency care (some programs will help with emergency care or required you give the dog back in the event of emergency care being needed). Also some programs require you par contract to feed specific food to their dogs others have guidelines of what you can n cant feed and other that dogs your feed it what you wish. 

Some insurances will require you to pay extra to have your service dog on your plan others the dog isnt even covered unless you make sure to add it and depending on breed some might not even cover you at all or drop all coverage you have with them do to the dogs breed.

If self training it is a good idea to hire a trainer who knows how to train the dog to do the tasks that you will  need to help your disabilities, also having a behaviorist evaluate any dog that is to be your potential partner if you have 0 experience with dogs goes a long way to helping prevent a washout (doesnt garentee it, but ups the chance of it not happening).

1179,"I've done the invisible illness to cane transition at work in my early 30s. Short answer - keep it simple, general, and short. They don't need to know it's getting worse.

Long answer-
My experience was that it is mostly very annoying. People seem to think it's rude to ask about it in a group but perfectly fine if they get you alone. At first, this meant having awkward conversations with a bunch of people I'm not really friends with several times a day every day. It took a long time to work through all my coworkers. One couldn't get me alone so he messaged me instead. He never replied and then acted weird the next time I saw him. :/ Anyway, I got annoyed about the situation and reccomend making bingo cards or something. Or just making premptive explanations in groups to cut down on this.

Almost everyone assumed I had hurt myself and seemed to be waiting for an amusing anecdote about my clumsy accident. People were then awkward and uncomfortable when that wasn't the case. They still asked overly personal questions or wanted an educational seminar on my disease. They said stupid things like telling me it's the wrong answer if they ask how long I'll need the cane and I said indefinitely. They'll offer terrible advice like doing squats and yoga and essential oils. You might be able to reference that you hurt your back in an accident a while ago and are having some issues right now. That seems like it might be a socially acceptable answer.

Once I worked through the people that I see regularly, it got a lot easier and the benefits for me outweigh the annoying period where everyone kind of freaks out. If you find yourself thinking longingly of a cane and how helpful it would be, get one! I still occasionally run into people trying to have those conversations but I've learned better ways to minimize them. Sometimes just saying and repeating ""I'm fine"" when they start to ask what you did to your leg/knee/foot/whatever will work. They might be a bit awkward but will sometimes take the cue that they can treat you like usual. Other people don't and will persist in asking about it. Rude! A short but acceptable explanation and quickly moving on can work too. My standard is saying I have muscle weakness which I usually have to follow up with saying it's a genetic thing. It's often enough for them to be satisfied and let it go.

I only mention the disease name or say something more specific if I'm in the mood to have a whole conversation about it. Most people aren't familiar with what I have so then they ask about it and then we're having a whole conversation about it and a lot of people I think don't feel like they can change the topic once we're there. Or something. I'm not really opposed to talking about it (except when it's the same thing for the 4th time that day), but it's a buzzkill and conversation killer and people can ask at wildly inappropriate times.

1203,"This is a loaded question. First we must ask, what is disability? And that's a loaded question too.

Disability is:

a) the medical model - ""viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care""

This means understanding disability as a defect from the idealistic body that must be fixed.

b) the social model - ""disability as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society""

This means understanding disability as natural variations of the body that are limiting from the social environment.

c) the identity model - ""disability as a fluid identity which means that any person can become disabled at any point in time""

This means understanding disability as an individual identity within a group that changes over time and is in relation to social impact.

1227,"Honestly this is an issue with any pilot social program.

I work in community development and regardless of what project we're planning - free tutoring for highschoolers, playgroup for young mothers and kids, peer mentor program for disabled university students, bilingual cooking and nutrition classes for recent settlement etc

When we're seeking sponsorship for grant applications, or when we're networking with other organisations as part of project planning, when we're recruiting a steering committee that consists of people from the target audience, everyone is on board and crazy enthusiastic about the project, everyone raves about how vital and useful that program sounds and offers their full support.

And then we launch the program and a few people drop their support for logistical reasons (""oh, it's running on a Tuesday and Thursday? That doesn't work for us, sorry"") but a huge number just ghost us.

We ran a program earlier in the year that was supposed to be a peer mentor program for highschoolers with disabilities looking at their next step. We had volunteers in university, tafe and trade who had volunteers ready to link up with highschoolers.

We had 5 different highschools confirm that they had 5-10 students with disabilities who would benefit from the program, but when we went back with flyers and enrolment forms the reps from the school got flaky with terrible excuses like ""oh, most of the students have already got formal support in place"" (yes, but that formal support from the education system ends at graduation, this peer support is something they can have long term) or ""oh, most of these students are only disabled under the social model of highschool, they'll be fine in the real world"" um, excuse me, just because you see things like ADHD, ASD, dyslexia as ""childhood learning disabilities"" doesn't mean that young adults and adults in *the real world* don't struggle with these conditions and wouldn't benefit from some peer support.

It was infuriating, we begged to just have a 5 minute speech with the classes so the students themselves could decide if this program sounded good, but the school admin/careers reps were acting as gatekeepers, the same reps who sponsored us when we submitted the project idea to the council to get funding!

The reality is that people do want these services, but there's a lack of conviction in getting these programs to actually happen, and pilot programs especially are easy to fail because you have fewer numbers, possibly not the target audience, less funding, less marketing.

We managed to scrape our project together with just 3 highschool students (who approached us independently after we spammed Facebook and instagram and posted in various disability support forums).

We reported back to the funding body and got given a larger budget for next year, we were able to buy our way into highschools with ""disability awareness incursions"" (basically we paid the school to let us run a 1 hour motivation speech that mentioned disability) and we now have 15 enrolments in the program for next year, and it's not even the end of this year.

I don't know what specific advice I can give, other than to push those who seemed interested harder, you may feel like you're hassling them, but honestly if they aren't going to support you, you might as well hassle them until until that bridge is burned since that's a rickety bridge in the first place. Keep expanding the network of people you engage with to run pilots, revisit the project idea and make sure that the issues is lack of follow through from sponsors/support/cofacilitators and not another barrier such as transport, times/dates/fees.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1572593773,t5_2qhe8,t3_dpy3gs,t3_dpy3gs,3,1580526047,0,0,f5zxo56,disability,,,,,

1238,"Hi friend, really love this post. Totally get where you're coming from. I have chronic pain and fatigue from EDS, as well as gatroparesis. I also experience brain fog, though not to the degree of others. As I see it, disability is a spectrum. Some people get too comfortable with the label and see it as an equalizer--I have a friend with mental illness who thinks she is disabled on par with me, a part-time wheelchair user who has severe physical limitations, whereas she has emotional limitations that do not manifest physically but stop her from doing stuff. The fact that she uses this as an excuse to get out of stuff and whine about how sad her life is is another story....patience is running thin. I know that sounds unsympathetic but I take responsibility for my mental and physical health, while she throws herself pity parties and burdens us with invitations. I do not want to diminish her disability, as it is a disability that limits her activities and function; it does this in a different way than it does for you and me.

Ability is a fickle thing. For me, my disability is mild-moderate enough that I ***can***, but sometimes I really ***shouldn't***. This is the nature of invisible illnesses: they live inside us, not outside. For me, it manifests when it feels like, which is rarely when it is convenient for me. So I don't LOOK disabled until I do, but I feel disabled every day. Chronic pain for me means some days are better than others, but it doesn't go away.

People are reluctant (but sometimes refuse) to call me disabled because my disability magically disappears and reappears on the outside. They have this black and white point of view that disability is a visible, obvious, and static phenomenon. Rarely are these people actually disabled. I embrace the term disability because it's a spectrum, and I'm careful not to play oppression olympics or compare myself to others who have it worse. I feel comfortable and qualified speaking and advocating for disability in general, but I know (unlike this friend of mine) to be careful to acknowledge the different types and severities of disabilities, instead of lumping them together and presenting myself as the all-knowing disabled expert. It's tempting to do this because I'm on a campus where I'm the only wheelchair user (albeit part time) and the most vocal disability advocate, but it's all about citing your sources and making space for people who are more qualified to speak on a more specific topic (eg. blindness, deafness, para/quadriplegia).

It sounds to me like you're reluctant to label yourself as disabled because some people have it worse. Perhaps you're reluctant to accept supports like mobility equipment and handicapped stickers because other people need them more. But you've made an important distinction between ability and capability. People like us are able until we're incapable. Sometimes ability to do something is possible yet dangerous. That's what makes disabilities like ours fluid. I imagine that you're afraid what people will think if you're sometimes presenting as incapable when other times you are--this is the hardest part, an emotional hump to get over. I'd recommend trying to get a sticker and using it only when you need to, avoiding van accessible spaces if you can in case someone with a ramp needs to park. If you use the supports you need when you need them, you could save yourself a lot of trouble! People are going to talk and stare, and they might harass you for it, but that's their problem that they don't understand. If you can convince yourself that this is for your safety out of necessity and get used to it, you'll feel a lot better.

Lethargy,  sudden need to end whatever it is I am doing and go any direction and keep going until it starts to ease off. 

Yall get help. What you are feeling is your own projections and your own fears and if you are not careful, it ca  start to define you. You have to let your shrink help you snip the rot from the threads and tie them back together in a new and clear net to hold yourselves together.

I wonder how much though is that we are expecting too much from people?

Maybe people aren’t dicks and maybe they just don’t get it? Maybe if we could work on our own acceptance of understanding that people aren’t perfect.

1262,"Under no circumstances AT ALL should anyone approach a working service animal regardless of what disability the handler has. It's the law. Even for PTSD. If someone distracts that dog even just a tiny bit, that's all it takes for it to lose its train of thought, and miss a cue to alert you to an oncoming episode. The dog is constantly watching you and observing your body language. As far as getting grants, there really isn't such thing. At most, some veterinary offices will give discounted visits or procedures if your dog is a service animal. But insurance companies won't give a dime, even if you present medical documentation of your conditions. The only way to get grants for food or equipment is if you get the dog through a program that offers it, which is rare. I hope that helps! Also, a common rule of thumb when selecting a breed for service work is Poodles, Labs, Goldens, and rough or smooth collies. German shepherds aren't very suitable for psychiatric-related tasks because they are known to feed off of their handlers emotions, which can ultimately lead to disaster. I hope that helps!

I completely agree that pedestrian safety is a genuine reason to utilise a disability placard and parking space - if you're condition makes it dangerous to walk across a parking lot that's a very real reason to be able to park closer to entrances.

But is the danger of walking to the entrance greater than the danger of driving with this condition? If it's safe enough to drive, what additional risks do you face as a pedestrian?

1295,"I understand. I saw at least 5 therapists with similar feelings about the whole thing. I FINALLY found a therapist (who I hated at first, and now credit with changing my life years later) who worked differently. 

She came from a Somatic Experiencing/Peter Levine background. The idea is that clients are stuck for a REASON and just powering through that reason (like FORCING yourself to eat with the other hand) doesn't help dissolve the reason and can even make it more powerful and entrench. 

There's no advice to follow. My therapist always says you will organically make changes and do things when you are ready, and not the other way around. I thought it was bullshit at first, but it's true. Things that seemed impossible and stressy before just aren't now. I don't know exactly where the shift happened. Her work is straight up magic. Sometimes it was so subtle I wasn't sure we were even doing anything. Like, no way would she have you just switch hands eating. You'd start by talking about just thinking about it, for a few seconds, and then work through the resistance that comes up. Sounds crazy, but. it. works. 

The hardest part was just starting to go. I wish I'd found her first, before all the other ""meh"" therapy that just felt like ""tough love"" or ""frustratingly empathetic listening."" I had nothing in me when I finally made it to therapy, but somehow she helped me create a reserve where there wasn't any resiliency before. 

Going to therapy was in the end, so much easier than the constant struggle that is feeling like you feel.

I saw at least 5 therapists with similar feelings about the whole thing. I FINALLY found a therapist (who I hated at first, and now credit with changing my life years later) who worked differently. 

She came from a Somatic Experiencing/<PERSON> background. The idea is that clients are stuck for a REASON and just powering through that reason (like FORCING yourself to eat with the other hand) doesn't help dissolve the reason and can even make it more powerful and entrench. 

There's no advice to follow. My therapist always says you will organically make changes and do things when you are ready, and not the other way around. I thought it was bullshit at first, but it's true. Things that seemed impossible and stressy before just aren't now. I don't know exactly where the shift happened. Her work is straight up magic. Sometimes it was so subtle I wasn't sure we were even doing anything. Like, no way would she have you just switch hands eating. You'd start by talking about just thinking about it, for a few seconds, and then work through the resistance that comes up. Sounds crazy, but. it. works. 

The hardest part was just starting to go. I wish I'd found her first, before all the other ""meh"" therapy that just felt like ""tough love"" or ""frustratingly empathetic listening."" I had nothing in me when I finally made it to therapy, but somehow she helped me create a reserve where there wasn't any resiliency before. 

Going to therapy was in the end, so much easier than the constant struggle that is feeling like you feel. 

I don't think it changed me as a person so much as let me be the person who was in there, constantly squashed and twisted by bitterness and fear. I feel more me than ever before.

I know this because I have asthma and heart arrhythmias, and both of them act up more when I'm stressed. It's gotten to the point that I can tell how stressed or anxious I am by how bad my symptoms are, before I even start to notice my emotions.

I don't know if this is applicable to you, but I wonder if maybe your initial TBI symptoms are being aggravated by your stress levels, the way my asthma and heart issues get worse when my depression acts up.

The thing is, when we have symptoms related to stress, the symptoms are *real*, and the stress is *real*, and the very susceptibility to stress that makes things worse is part of your disability. As I mentioned, I have depression, and that is every bit as real a disability as my asthma. If your symptoms come partially from stress, that doesn't make them not-real and it doesn't make them your fault. You didn't choose this.

I do think part of your stress is coming from feeling purposeless, not being able to adjust to this big change in your life, your changing abilities and your changing lifestyle. Changes suck and when you lose something you have used in the past to define your identity or your purpose, you can feel like you're worthless or purposeless.

Major life activities include things like: Caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, etc.

Needing to use a specific part of the gas and break pedals to drive would not be a substantial limitation to a major life activity.

He also ""had it all,"" at least in comparison to the average person around the world, so your contrary statement makes little sense here. 

Many people who are not disabled do not serve life sentences for murder for various reasons, and there is statistical data on that trend. Just as many factors go into deciding the ultimate recompense to be paid for the crime of murder.

Still, none of this comes close to proving that what you say about the entitlement of disabled people is ""common knowledge.""

1387,"I can assure you the person assigned to your claim would love nothing more than to approve your claim and keep it approved with minimum work. You’ll hear people say how they want to close your claim etc. none of it is true. 

Keep in mind they are limited by the documentation in the claim. For example let’s say you have a knee replacement surgery. Now for someone whose job requires them to stand and walk all day the recovery ranges from weeks to many months. Some people heal slower maybe due to age or comorbids like diabetes.  Some people half ass their physical therapy. Some don’t. 

Point is if all they know is when you had your surgery then of course they are going to need updates. Likely every few months at least. Maybe you needed a revision surgery. Maybe you healed faster than most. Maybe your stable but have balance issues. Whatever the case is they need to know what that is so they can make sure contract is being administered correctly. 

Your employer chose the terms of the Ltd policy. Not the insurance company. The amount your paid, how long your paid, whether it’s mandatory to participate in any vocational rehab, how long until your eligible etc. all chosen by your employer. 

All the insurance company does is administer that policy. Some policies are own occupational specialty   This means a 28yr old surgeon can have a bad knuckle in one finger potentially be approved until age 67 even in perfect health otherwise. 

Now most policies are your own occupation for 2 years. Then to continue on benefits you must be disabled from any reasonable occupation. Reasonable meaning you have the education or training needed to be hired for it. Has to pay usually at least 60-80% of your old job. And you can physically do it. 

Company Ltd is a bridge. It’s either there until you get back to work somewhere or until you are approved for ssdi because if you truly can’t work in any reasonable occupations they will approve you. At that time you’ll likely get a small amount from Ltd and most of your benefits from ssdi. 

Contractually speaking it is your responsibility to provide the insurance company with ongoing support of disability. Some conditions are progressive regardless of treatment. Parkinson’s, dementia etc. . however by far most conditions people can and do improve with treatment.

1429,"Ask your doctor for blood tests.  They can check for protein and many micro-nutrients. Products like Ensure are designed specifically to provide adequate nutrition to adults with trouble eating. If you are both overweight and malnourished, you are likely getting enough carbohydrates and fats. It will more likely be protein and/or micro-nutrients like vitamins and minerals that you are missing.  


Track your consumption/snacking. What are you actually eating in a day. What nutrients does it contain. Are you keeping all of it down? Work on adjusting your habits to make sure you are eating foods that stay down, eating at times of day that work best, and eating a variety of foods. When you figure out what you are missing, it will be easier to make needed adjustments.  


Frozen veggie blends are an easy addition to a snacking routine. You can eat them frozen, or microwave them. Add them to some hot broth and you have soup. Smoothies are a great way to get fruit and veg in if you have texture issues. Just throw things that you like in a blender, add juice/water/ice/nothing and drink. Or buy the pre-made ones.

Maybe investing in a good dishwasher (plus good soap packets) that you wouldn’t have to wash the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher might be good for you? Also you could get a bar height chair and sit while washing dishes. That’s a recommendation from my OT that helps me. I try to sit as mush as possible to conserve energy.

My OT also suggested keeping as many things as possible at chest height. So you aren’t having to bend down or reach up. I keep my most used pots and pans on the stove now and I have all my laundry stuff on a waist height shelf (in small lightweight bottles and refill every 6-8 weeks).

Also for laundry, I changed the way I do my sorted loads. I now sort as I’m changing and I sort by whites, colors - go in dryer, colors - hang dry. So on days I need it done but don’t have energy to hang stuff, I do the dryer stuff because that’s easier and I don’t fold. I wait for a “good” day to do the higher energy cost loads.

The only record that concerns me is the Agoraphobia diagnosis. It basically consisted of: 

1) A meeting with my Psychiatrist, during which we discussed the past year+ of experience and he realized, ""yeah, this describes Agoraphobia"". We had always been so consumed by trying treatments the Depression and Anxiety over the years that it just never came up (also due to the fact that the Depression/Anxiety prevents me from working, whereas I would have no problem at my job with only Agoraphobia!)

2) Meeting a Social Worker within a week of that Psychiatrist talk. We discussed the plan to focus strictly on Agoraphobia treatment - however, we met twice and it was clear that she would apply the same unsuccessful approaches used by all of my therapists over the years. I was discouraged and, being Agoraphobic, it was more than enough to convince me to no longer travel to see her.

This is when I decided to try a different approach of changing my environment. By moving in with my parents, they could essentially hold my hand throughout the process - providing sociability, structure, and being by my side when experimenting with exposure.

This is it. How I wish we had the science to scan the brain and say, ""here you go judge, I do have Agoraphobia""!

Can this potentially be enough for an attorney to take on my case?

When I could eat more things, sandwiches were huge. The trick for me was getting a lot of neat condiments so I could make them a little different. If you can’t use a knife you might be able to get someone to help you prep like tomatoes and lettuce ect to put on them. I like using sprouts because they don’t have much prep.  

Deli salads, potato salad, tuna, chicken , egg ect were very helpful to me when I could have mayo

Cheese as a meal is underrated. Especially with crackers and fruit and nuts ect. You can even make it feel fancy

Instant mashed potatoes.

Frozen or microwave rice

Hot dogs/sausage/kielbasa/ precooked bacon

Protein bars and shakes if you’re into that. ESP if you combine them with something to chew

Microwave popcorn 

Easy Mac. Especially with some real cheese in it, I like mascarpone.

Spaghetti O’s are great if you make them then mix in shredded cheese and maybe some croutons- same with tomato soup- it gets all melts and good from the hot liquid

Instant oatmeal- but like get nuts and fruit and cream and do it up. I can no longer dairy, and I used to prefer just normal cream, but my grandma likes to put coffee creamer in hers, and it’s a little sweet for me but also ingenious because you can have whatever flavor you like easily. 

Chicken nuggets. Condiments are also the key to not getting bored here. Or making a chicken nugget sandwich.

Cream cheese and precooked bacon sounds gross but it’s super filling and yummy

You can microwave eggs supposedly 

Bagels and cream cheese

Chips and hummus

Batch cooking when your boyfriend is home, or, better yet, getting someone else to batch cook because it can still be pretty exhausting.

Trader Joe’s. They have so much prepared food. If you don’t have a Trader Joe’s, hopefully there’s something else good like that- wegmans is amazing if you have one. I can also tell you what easy stuff I get from Trader Joe’s if you have one.


Tools I’ve gotten creative with for my problems that maybe could help? But like ignore them if they don’t work for your situation. 

I use a toaster over, and my apologies if this won’t work for you, but I would think it might be safer because you can get ones that turn off automatically. I also like to get those foil disposable pans and it’s super easy to put whatever I’ve got into the pan  and put it in my toaster oven and set it to however long it needs to cook. frozen French fries, veggies, cookies, frozen pizza , hot sandwiches, waffles are easy things I like

I have an instant pot, and I don’t know if it would be safe enough, but if it would be, they’re great when I have a couple extra spoons, I like to take mine and sit watching tv while I cook. The sauté function is on a timer and it’s in a pot, but I can see how it could be a burn risk . Would pressure cooking be safe?

1531,That is great advice. I get massages at least once a month. As you noted I stayed with the same massage therapist and they learned my body and know what works and doesn't. Clear communication is important. My lower back is a 'dangerous' place to be poking around and over time we have been able to hit the spots. My hip flexors are usually the worse. My therapist uses a combination of deep tissue and therapeutic. Not sure if you have to get fully naked at every place. Like you said it is easier to hit some spots but I usually just wear some loose gym shorts and my therapist was fine with that. And you should definitely speak up during the massage if it is too much pain or call out areas you don't have any feeling/sensation so they can be mindful of pressure to apply. And if you get the deep tissue massage you may feel sore afterwards which is normal. Good to know the difference between regular soreness and actual pain/damage.,,,,[deleted],,,1573748294,t5_2qhe8,t3_dw31oi,t3_dw31oi,1,1581831959,0,0,f7hvn8h,disability,,,,,

1541,"You've been conditioned to have negative eating experiences your whole life, to the point where just the idea of eating is a negative experience, on top of the sensory issues and body image issues you may have

Psychosomatic symptoms can be the result of negative conditioning as well, like you may experience stomach pain and indigestion caused by the anxiety of eating. Your gut bacteria is interacts heavily with our neurotransmitters because they are also hormones. Did you know a significant amount of serotonin (90% of it) lives in your stomach? Serotonin inhibits gastric acid secretion so if your levels are low (anxiety, depression) it can disrupt the process or disrupt your gut flora which are necessary for processing the food properly and absorbing the nutrients

Have you tried therapy? It can be hard to find therapists with good attitudes about body issues and eating struggles that are also autism friendly but if you start with Autism-friendly from a neurodiversity angle and go from there you may have more luck. You may also have some luck with traditional ED therapists though they may not understand the autism profile as well or bring negative stigma / lean on stereotypes, there could be emotional labor involved

I think the best way to condition yourself to have a better relationship with food is to condition yourself to also have positive experiences with food. and that doesn't mean forcing yourself to eat food you don't want to, it means baby steps and widening your zone of control. It does mean introspecting to think about the conditioning you already have and what specific experiences shaped your small window of control, and trying to examine things you may be comfortable with but haven't considered before

Also, are you taking any supplements? Like vitamins etc? If your certain you're malnourished, a good place to start is with that, just to give yourself a little extra help while you're figuring out how to do better. You may want to see a doctor and have some blood work done to see where your health actually is right now, often I think my health is worse than it really is and it makes me paranoid and anxious. I have the opposite end of the eating spectrum issues, I control my life by eating too much. A few times I have gotten blood work expecting the worst amid doctors that are lecturing me about diabetes etc are and they're usually surprised that my blood work looks better than theirs aside from being chronically low in vitamin D and sometimes iron (thanks, Endo)

Your health may be better than you think, or it may just be a few areas that need specific attention. Taking supplements isn't an ideal treatment plan because you may be high levels of some vitamins and minerals and areas low levels of others, especially if you have a really restricted diet. Variety is the best solution but it's not attainable for everyone. Seeing a doctor isn't always feasible either, emotionally or financially

Also I'm just sorry in general that you're having such a hard time with this. My husband has also struggled with this his whole life, I have tried a lot of things to help him but ultimately it's something he has to do on his own. He has recently started using cannabis to help increase his appetite so he can eat enough to put on muscle. He finds increased motivation to eat more when he goes to the gym because it's a simple formula, he sees encouraging results that motivate him. But the motivation to go to the gym in the first place comes from starting with feeling alright with yourself (that was a long journey) and wanting to feel even more alright with yourself",,,,valicat,,,1573155932,t5_2qhe8,t3_dt0m50,t3_dt0m50,3,1581052110,0,0,f6tyyje,disability,,,,,

1577,"Thanks so much for your input! I absolutely agree with you on the being careful not to label or lump everyone into one group. Challenges vary for everyone. I've got friends with chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, POTS, and other like disorders and they wouldn't consider themselves disabled, but their conditions certainly hinder their ability to work. 

With situations like those/yours I don't think full-time employment is necessarily the best option because you're likely going to have on and off days and that doesn't always work with a 40-hour work week. I work 40 hours a week sometimes more and those hours have some flexibility but not enough to  take full/multiple days off weekly on a regular basis. So much of my work has a time limit and as long as I can get it done within 48 hours I'm solid but I do have to stay within a certain window of time. So flexible but still stuck to particular guidelines

Listen to your body! Especially with a cheap equipment like a cane, get an adjustable one at first so you will be able to adjust its height if you feel any wrist pain.

As for long term effect, nobody knows how they will age, but over all, you will have far less issues if you don't over-excert your knee by putting all your weight on it.

Another option I see – with or without the cane – is a knee brace that will keep your knee in its normal angles. But that's more costly, unless paid by 5he NHS, needs more careful adjustment, etc. 

As for using a cane at 20, it's unusual, but has a few benefits apart from saving your knee.

For example, I used to run a lot for soccer and for track. I loved running. Now I can still physically run, but I don't. Why? It causes a ton of pain and I would be incapacitated for a week. I could technically run a block, or farther, but will I do it? No.  

Now I use the disability center resources at my campus to get to my classes via golf cart because if I walked the distance to class I would, throw up, have to lay on the ground for a long period of time or pass out, get up, try to walk back home and not be able to go to class.

1665,"You seem to have concerns that your lawyers' interests aren't necessarily aligned with yours, but please try to sit down with your lawyers and discuss your concerns. As a lawyer who handles cases in this area I can tell you that it is difficult to structure fees in these cases. There are so many variables. 

ERISA is just a federal law that governs most insurance benefits provided by employers. Generally courts are pretty deferential to insurers in ERISA cases, and there are really no penalties, other than attorneys' fees, for denying claims under ERISA. 

When you talk about the 2-year thing, I think you mean that for the first 2 years of benefits, you have to show you can't do your old job  (""own occupation standard""). After that, you have to show you can't do any job (""any occupation standard""). This is how most of these policies are written. Usually if you go all the way to court and win on the own occupation standard the insurance company will get another chance to review if you meet the any occupation standard in 2 years. Then you are back in court again if they deny you.

These cases are hard to win.

I think *in general*, though of course there is no universal rule, it’s more common for people with one discrete, specific disability or physical “impairment” to find work, while chronic illness beyond a mild or at most moderate level is hard to accommodate.

For me, the barrier is really how ill I am, day to day - organs not functioning too well, having a lot of trouble with nutrition and hydration, can’t maintain a comfortable blood pressure and heart rate even with meds, etc. All of that plus pain means I tend to have all my energy sucked up just doing meds and physio and trying to eat; what’s leftover is barely enough for basic hygiene and a bit of “distraction” (Reddit on my phone, audiobook etc).

1753,i don't know what is your disability. I am no  person's bitch to do as they say because they are disabled unless they really need it. All others are entitlement. I am friends with the roomate. I didn't ask her to change  breathing patterns because I am disabled and se has to do as i say otherwise she is a bad person. I overstayed to my ex so what's the deal? Are you entitled to psychological evaluation because you are disabled and i don't care about you somehow if i don't plead guilty? The majority of people are of intermediate intelligence and they don't think. They don't understand when they are getting manipulated by someone. Like the children that try to manipulate you todo as they say.  They were telling me to stay because they are abusers. They wanted to fin an excuse for their abusive behavior. They totally match the disabled deafblind person. I can totally converse but I don't work wih magic spheres.

1760,"A lot of energy is saved by sitting. With a washing up bowl you can soak, scrub and stack sitting at a table. Greasier pots that need a lot of water would still need to be done at the sink. If you have a cupboard at your sink look into a bar stool, you can open the cupboard and tuck your knees under. Use a rolling stool or chair while you sweep the floor with a long brush and move it from room to room. Sit in the bath or shower in old clothes to clean, as long as you don't use any corrosive cleaning products. Sit to peel and chop vegetables. Sit to iron and fold laundry.

Generally what I find easiest is doing bits in a spare minute rather than a set time to clean where you're pushing yourself all at once. Going back to the dishes, I wash a plate while I'm waiting for the kettle to boil. Scrape anything left off my plate at the end of a meal. Avoid oily or greasy meals which take longer to wash up after. Think about using plastic plates, they come in so many nice designs now and are great if you're worried about dropping things. They're tiny things but added up actually washing dishes takes half the time.

Look at your pacing in general, your docs should be able to help with this. Think about your day, are you wasting a lot of time moving around, taking multiple trips between rooms? When I clean or cook I have a tray to put everything on for that task, which saves me going back and forth for things. I have a wheeled base that I can put heavy things on and push with my chair. Keep things in the rooms you need them, this might mean you have multiple of the same cleaner in the bathroom and kitchen. 

Plan out where things will take you the least effort to reach and use and move them there. An Occupational Therapist can be invaluable, especially if they can visit your home or see pictures. They can make suggestions for storage or physical tasks around the home you don't even know exist. If you're in a backlog at the moment, decide how you want to do things going forward and hire a cleaner. If you can afford it, hire one once a week, but if not get someone in just once to help you clear up the funk and reorganise. If there are other people in your household, have a conversation about who is responsible for what to take some of the pressure off you. If you have kids, responsibility for tidying toys and scraping plates can be taught early. I've found that star charts for the whole family including parents are great for accountability and motivation. Unless you have teenage kids, in which case I'm so sorry. 

RE tech toys it would help to have a list of what chores are hardest and what about them makes them hard. Tumble dryer is a miracle, they're not as ubiquitous here as they are in the US but great for things like sheets which fucking suck to hang from a wheelchair. Roomba I can't use as I have rabbits and it doesn't do hay. Dishwashers you have to stack and remove, I find it quicker to wash unless you have a large family. I love my steam cleaner, minimal effort, multiple surfaces, no bleach or caustic cleaners. A canister hoover will be less effort for you to move than an upright. Look at replacing current hand cleaning tools that are useable but sap energy with ones which are lighter/hand a longer reach/better grip.

ETA: Realised I didn't really touch on the cooking which is what really saps the energy from me. What's your diet like? When I'm in 'fuck everything' mode but not quite at 'hey look, an NG tube!' level of appetite, I do NOT want to cook. I don't want to think about the right balance of nutrients and how much I'll have to chop and blend so I don't choke on my dinner. This is where meal prep is invaluable. During a good period plan out a variety of meals that you like. On other good days cook a large batch, portion, label and freeze each of these meals. Get a friend to come in and help you, chop veg and chat. Buy pre-chopped veg, where I am it's often in the freezer section. Then all you have to do it heat and eat, max one bowl, knife and fork to clean up after. If you have a large freezer you can do portions in microwavable containers and even skip the bowl. 

I try to have ten meals worth of nutrient dense food in my freezer which normally tides me over enough to get over a bad spell or see a doc for further treatment. Without them, I can guarantee I wouldn't cook and with GI issues your off-the-shelf options are minimal or nonexistant. I also have a list of meals ranked by how easy they are to make. Great day? Yep I'll make that fancy dish with five separate components. Average day? Eh, pasta or noodles with some veg in there, some cooking but minimal prep. Bad day? Something that just needs heated or can be eaten cold. 

You can obviously also do this day-to-day as well, lots of info on meal prep out there for anyone who wants to conserve their time and energy. Some meal preppers chop a huge pile of veggies for a few hours at a time to make a month's worth of meals. Some people take ten minutes of chopping to make a week's worth of dinners instead.

1781,"Heyo! Local L. V disabled punk stepping in here! 

For the screw style spikes, you'll want to use an actual leather needle as it will make your life easier to poke the hole in for the spikes. PRE plan where you want to put the spikes with a dark marker or use a white gel pen. (Depending on your leather color!) 

Make sure the thread part of the screw is 100% free of leather before screwing the top on. Squeeze with a pair of pliers for extra security. 

Studs require more dexterity and be very careful not to drop them, those prongs will get stuck in your feet and someone will have to use a knife edge to pry them out. 

Your local fabric shop will likely have some leather in the rements section for half off, so I suggest checking there. You can simply wrap and cut the leather to size,  use a needle to make holes and lace with a shoelace.

I eat more calories if I'm grazing throughout the day, so I keep a lot of snack type food within arm's reach.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""cut your check."" Do you mean you already get SS and are wondering if it will go down if you are approved for a room, or do you just mean will they cut you a check in the metaphorical sense?

To tie that back to earlier, if you are not on any of the programs yet and need to get approved because your disability is too debilitating to do any work, yes, you'll need to show extensive medical documentation that you can't perform any kind of gainful activity. However, some people do work and remain on disability with reduced benefit amounts as well. I did for some time.

&gt;They have this black and white point of view that disability is a visible, obvious, and static phenomenon.

My friend who had a cliff jumping accident is never, ever going to stand up or regain her leg strength (barring some sweet inventions in the future). She's visibly, obviously, and statically disabled. To me, that's what a ""traditionally"" disabled person is—dis. abled. Literally not able to move her legs, under any circumstances. 

For me to take that label of ""disabled"" feels like a bad fit, more than anything. My struggles are different, and one of them is just a lack of space, products, visibility and concessions for someone like me. The lack of predictability is one of the most disabling things for me...while at the same time I bet a parapalegic would love to occassionally have bouts of non-parapalegia. And the lack of obviousness and visibility can be a huge advantage or a huge embarrassment, depending. 

I don't even think I \*do\* always have it worse...there are certainly times when a traditionally disabled person is waaaay ahead of me, because they have the technology or medical research or whatever to be capable of doing something I can't. IE, my sit-ski friend who can sit-ski all day. She can't use her legs, but she can use her arms. Even if I did get a sit-ski, it wouldn't give me the capacity to pole myself along. 

In fact, just thinking about that comparison makes me cringe a little...but if there was space for people like me, with a name and understanding, I wouldn't have to compare my dis-capacity with someone dis-ability. 

I like what you said about a spectrum, maybe that's part of the answer—like how the queer community grew from pretty much just binary gay when I was a kid, to include bi, then trans, then gender spectrum ideas and fluidity and nuance. It too started with a very ""static"" definition of what it meant to be included, morphed into something bigger and more inclusive, detoured into some factions and internal backlash, and now, hopefully, will soon just become ""people,"" seamlessly included. 

At the same time, I think the ""I can but shouldn't""s of the world need a bit more airtime first, just to help the world know we're out here and maybe the community does need broadening or spin-offs.

1800,"I use a manual wheelchair as well as a small mobility scooter around the house and yard. When I purchased my current house in 2006 I remodeled my kitchen and installed a Frigidaire “professional” fridge/freezer separates and would never go back. These are “affordable” clones of higher end Sub-Zero type units. Each is a completely separate unit the size of a typical residential fridge/freezer combo and can be installed side by side as a pair with integrated surround (to appear as one large unit) or trim packages are available to install separately or skip the trim to install freestanding. Looking at the web page, MSRP is about $2500 each but I’ve seen them retail for considerably less. 

I can’t imagine anything else, frankly. A full size door gives great access. They have relatively ample door bins. Pull outs for produce in the fridge and pull out wire bins in the bottom of the freezer. 

The doors open 180 degrees and I can reach almost everywhere. I do sometimes use a teacher if small items get shoved to the back of the top shelves. They are also “counter depth” so not super deep. 

The only issue you might have is that the ice maker (may be an optional thing, I can’t remember) is at the top of the freezer and dumps into a bin on the top shelf. Easy for me to grab the bin and pull it out to access but I have full upper body mobility. No ice/water in the door, if that is something you want. 

I also don’t think they are the most efficient thing ever. Especially since I throw open the door wide to access, but that wide access is a real benefit. When I’m at someone else’s home I always worry about banging into their bottom freezer or not reaching a top freezer. At least you have full height to put most used items within easy reach in either unit. 

Mine has been reliably running since installed. I did replace the thermistor on the fridge defrost unit a few years ago when the fridge didn’t seem to be getting as cold as I’d like. Never completely failed but the coil was icing. I’m handy and fixed it from the inside with a $20 part. Otherwise I’m perfectly happy and would buy it again if I needed to. 

When looking for parts, many are interchangeable with other brands. I believe this unit is available under several makes so it might be worth shopping around. I believe the current model number of the fridge is FPRU19F8RF. The freezer is a similar number.

My doctor signed something for a 3-year pass. Does that mean I'll get license plates or just a hang tag thing? 

I've decided to treat confrontation as an opportunity to educate people kindly on invisible disability (even though my urge is to say something caustic or sarcastic). That said, I've also given myself a hallpass to not be the fuckface whisperer—especially on a high pain day.  

I know how it looks. I might need a close parking space, and then using the store scooter may not be that actually helpful. And yes, I might try to conserve steps on shitty errands and then blow some of my limited mobility wandering around a pretty field to soak up some nature &amp; sanity. But, how I accommodate my shitshow of a body only has to work for me. 

I've already committed to never taking the last disabled/van spot, though, and of course, always being happy with a ""close enough"" space whenever that works. Generally I time my errands at low-impact times anyway (makes going to the store way faster/more painless/less loud)—this is really for crowded concerts, the airport, etc. when I just can't catch a break.",,,,RecoveringIdahoan,,,1573956550,t5_2qhe8,t3_dw43tf,t1_f7ovtcd,2,1581974145,0,0,f7pz789,disability,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to paste a bit of something that I wrote over in r/tax, for you or anyone who comes along who might be able to answer the more specific questions. 

I can't tell whether I can only withdraw in advance of an expense or if I can reimburse myself after an expense? If I can reimburse afterward, is there a time limit between the cost and the reimbursal? 

People have to go out and buy things for me. If a receipt shows their credit card, but I reimbursed them for it, what documentation would I need to show that I paid for this?

**Housing -** would renters insurance count here? 

For **personal support services**, I'm not sure what that encompasses. I get homecare through Medicaid but I am in self-directed care (CDPAP) which means I hire my own caregivers. Would the cost of craigslists and [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) advertisements count? Would the scheduling program that I pay for count? 

**Prevention and wellness** \- what does this mean?

**Health -** I'm on a specific diet as directed by my doctor but I'm not sure what documentation I'd need to have food costs count. Would supplements count? OTC meds?

**Basic living expenses** \- I get a bit tripped up here because it says that these categories have to ""relate to their blindness or disability and are intended to maintain or improve their quality of life."" Does that mean, for instance, that toilet paper isn't something that I could count as a QDE? Maxi pads? Clothing? Household cleaning supplies? Does it matter that I have to get extra personal and household supplies because of my caregivers?

Would something like Amazon Prime count, since I can't go to the store myself? 1password because I have memory problems and have trouble keeping track of passwords?

My 10 year old son has CP and Ive been slowly adding on a number of home automation pieces over the last few years to help him do things a bit easier.  The system is predominantly amazon/echo dot based, mostly because if you shop for dots on sale, they’re super cheap and I basically have one in every room.  I gave up on security, LOL.  Largely, they work really well - using a variety of 3rd party hardware (Wemo, TPLink, whatever) he can turn his own lights on and off, his bedroom fan, he can page us from any room in the house, etc.  That’s been a great feature, since he needs to be able to call for us at 2am but leaving a baby monitor on all the time wears on a 10 year old boy’s soul).  

The only real problems we have are problems that everyone has - 200 different protocols and dozens of ecosystems that may or may not talk to each other well.  Or they may right now but may stop next month.  We have quite a few procedures that are built on IFTTT, but we have things like Nest support getting discontinued.  I’ve got a Harmony Hub doing some work that lets him voice control the TV, but honestly that’s barely worth the configuration misery it takes to keep it happy.  

To your point, what exactly is it that you’re looking to solve that is at the device level, not a the ecosystem level?  I see a few comments that are focused on speech impediments, and I do agree that there may be a real opportunity in a device that you can “train” beyond unimpaired speech for individuals.

2031,"I had a dream interview recently. I thought I knocked it out of the park but I did not get the job. A lot of my friends and other professional speculate that they had somebody in line already and this was a sham interview. Government work. I don't think that is a unreasonable assumption. But of course there's a part of me that makes me think they rejected me because of my wheelchair.

I'm very fortunate that I believe my prospects of finding work is pretty good. I know geographically I'm very restricted. I can't move anywhere that has snow in the winter or has bad public transit. So there are definitely some limiting factors for me. What I'm afraid of is losing the ability to go to work everyday.

I was as respectful as I could be, and was just straight and told her that I didn't feel like the two of us were able to communicate effectively (this exactly what I said, I know that because I was nervous and practiced saying it ahead of time lol) and that I would like to switch to a different counselor.

As soon as I said that she stood up, said ""we're done here,"" and walked out of the room. The secretary set me up with a meeting with the supervisor and things got much better very quickly. I was assigned a new counselor (which ended up being the director because the person they set me up with ended up taking a leave for medical reasons) and it's been night and day.

It took maybe another month, but they set me up with the TWE (allowed me to have input and kept me in the loop), got that done, have been officially accepted for services, and I am currently working with them on my employment plan.

2040,"This is correct. Anything under $880- doing this from memory, if you make less than $880 it wont count as a trial work month. Anything between $880-1220 counts as a trial work month. After 8 months of trial work if you make over $1220 you could lose your disability... in college that won't be a problem.

Near graduation consider looking into employment with the Federal government, you can get jobs through recent graduate program as well as schedule A hiring. (Preferential hiring for people with disabilities) .

I have a graduate degree in Education- used my schedule A letter at a job fair and got offered a GS-4 position on the spot with no interview. The way the government works every GS-# gets a base pay and then a locality pay based on cost of living. My base is around 12.50/hr with locality pay I'm making $14.54 without an interview. There are some variations but college degrees usually range in the GS-5 to GS-7 which is currently 16.27-20.15 an hour to start. Locality pay to adjust for cost of living gets added to that. They have one for ""rest of the country which is 14% (why they dont raise base pay 14% and do away with this locality, since everyone gets it -is beyond me)

Then there are other considerations, like engineers get paid more than social workers so a bachelors in engineering wont start at GS-7 they might start at GS-9.

2045,"Yeah it's soo true. I guess I've just got to hope people are kind enough with it. Most people seem okay with trying to listen or wait etc but the experience of people being douches about it does put me off using a phone. I'm currently a week into no voice at all (I had it for about 4days prior to that). So it's never a guarantee when it'll be there or not. I can't go oh I'll make a bunch of calls tomorrow, cause I could try to speak in the phone and nothing comes out, which has happened.


I'm not the most tech minded so I'm not sure how to use most things on my phone etc which probably doesn't help. I just got a new phone too so I'm even less sure on what it can do. I'll definitely look into the real time thing though. It's nice to learn because I just can't predict it. Generally I lose it a few days to a week at a time then get a few days free and I'm back with no voice again. But I get bouts of it where like earlier in the year I had no voice for a full month.

It's always hard to say which thing to pursue in life is certainly worth the pain that went into pursuing it; my advice is to work as hard you can at fighting the good fight without the fight changing you. If the event that started the fight never leaves your consciousness, that's a whole other thing but don't let doing good change your outlook on the good still left in the world. Do what you want but always be sure you're doing it for yourself and never for ""the principle of the matter"" even though the situation most definitely warrants something to be done. Care for your causes as much as you can but don't lose yourself in fighting injustice. The warriors who don't know which battles to fight in come back only as memories of the people they once were.

2071,"I’m also here to say to try weed *shrug emoji* 

I’m 24 and when I was around 18 I was quite literally dying of my eating disorder. My doctors tried pretty much everything including a bunch of different anti-nausea drugs but every time I even smelled food my whole body would go into complete revolt. What I could eat I couldn’t almost never keep down. 

I don’t really like being high, but THC is very, very good at suppressing nausea and CBD and other compounds in indica cannabis are very very good at stimulating the desire to eat. It is quite honestly the best medicine we have to treats nausea and lack of hunger, trust me, I’ve tried all the others.

Weed saved my life. There is a lot of stigma around it but it’s just a medical drug like any other medical drug. It can be abused but it can also really help. I remember crying with joy the first time I ate after smoking, it felt like a revelation. 

I don’t know where you live, so you may not have access to cannabis or cannabis products but I’ll give you a little run down on what I suggest.

Probably best option: a vaporizer pen that takes cartridges. Very little smell, easy on the lungs, effects occur quickly, small and easy to use. Carried in almost all medical or recreational shops. 

Easier to get option: the herb and a pipe. Cheap, easy enough to find even if you live somewhere where weed isn’t legal. Smelly, and can be rough on your lungs, but still works quickly. 

If you have asthma or lung problems: edibles. I don’t like edibles, partially because you have to eat them before they work. There are thc/cbd pills though that I prefer. Edibles are not well regulated even in legal states, and they can take a long time to kick in and the high can last way too long. Still they will work and can work if you need them.

You’d probably want an indica strain, it’s the kind of cannabis that generally promotes hunger and suppresses nausea the best. If you can find one that has both CBD and THC in it (a one to one ratio)(someone selling to you will know what all this means if you are confused) that is definitely your best bet.",,,,Merrinberry,,,1573171818,t5_2qhe8,t3_dt0m50,t3_dt0m50,8,1581069040,0,0,f6uyfly,disability,,,,,

2083,"I’m sorry to hear this. I’m a coder and got a concussion 3 years ago. It took me a year to even get the correct diagnosis of what happened to me. Super easy to trigger migraines were a HUGE component of it. My migraines were not painful, I just thought that’s what brain injury felt like. When I actually started some treatments for migraine it was fantastically different. 

That said, I also had a preexisting mood disorder that got a lot worse and was undiagnosed. Depression (not major depressive disorder, just an episode of depression) happens to a large number of people post concussion. Depression causes psychomotor retardation which...feels like brain injury. My mood wasn’t really affected, just my energy level and ability to concentrate. And injured my neck too. symptoms of neck pain? Trouble concentrating. 

I asked all my doctors if they knew any psychologists that specialized in brain injury. I found one, he had a three month waiting list but was totally worth it. 

So 5 months is getting into the annoying long tail of concussion recovery. The evidence base doctors are working with to guide treatment sucks.

Also, the response by the city buses is just strange. The para-transit option isn't for people who don't live close to a stop, it's for people that can't use normal buses. So the proximity to a stop really shouldn't matter.

There are a few “interesting” tweaks for the Google Pixel phones if you want to root them where you can use the Google Assistant to speak for you and transcribe messages. You can customize the strings for when it picks up the phone. But, it still requires that people be okay waiting a little bit while you type a response for them, which as you’ve seen can’t be assumed - even with doctors. Still, for any rooted customization, any OS update can wipe it out and take your voice away from you again without notice.

There are even some pretty cool apps like CorentinJ’s Real Time Voice Cloning that lets you use old recordings of your voice - or in your case the times when you may be able to speak - to create your own Text-to-Speech model so you can have a little bit of individuality, as opposed to the ones that happen to come pre-loaded on your phone.

I am another person with no anniversary of a terrible day as I have always been disabled. 

Though I can say that I relate to your post in a different way. Instead of having some massive disabling event that have an anniversary of, I have the anniversary of a suicide attempt. And I kind of have the same feelings of ""I survived"" every year it passes with the same cycle of anxiety and tension followed by buoyancy. 

So, not the same life event but feel those feelings yearly and for the most part am happy I am here to live and make choices, too.  I am trying to learn to live my life and be accepting of the way things are.  

&gt;For the first few years I seemed to ""forget"" the day, wouldn't remember it until the day after.

&gt;Then I started remembering and noticed that the days leading up to the anniversary were filled with tension, as if I were preparing for the accident all over again. Then after November 17 rolled past I'd feel much more buoyant, more upbeat as if I had survived again.

I doubt any other government funded body could get away with such a shockingly low accuracy rate, but they don't care because it's about denying disabled people vital funding which they are happy to use as about way to save money in their budget while letting rich corporate buddies pay only a fraction of owed taxes.

2162,"Maybe try talking with parents who have similar physical limitations as you have and see how they make it work.

My mum’s gotten progressively worse since before I was born so to me it was all normal growing up.  We were much more responsible kids because we were taught early on not to dart or get into fun yet dangerous situations.  You’d be surprised how adaptable kids can be without being resentful as long as they have a loving parent who gives them opportunities at times to experience normal things they can’t do with their disabled parent.

Darting can be mostly prevented when the expectation is that the young kid holds onto your grocery cart, wheelchair, or your hand...zero exceptions.  

Just because you come from a long line of broken marriages doesn’t mean you can’t break the cycle and learn healthy ways of interacting.  It is hard work but not impossible.  Maybe you could even join a support group or have monthly counseling.

Being scared of screwing up shows you do have a lot of good parenting skills already.

If you don’t want the burden of having kids, that is a valid reason...but don’t let fear get in the way of something you truly want.

For all your not wanting your ex you're very upset that this person took him/was chosen by him. Let it go. It's none of your business. The fact that you think everyone is out to sabotage you because clearly they must be jealous is textbook mental illness.

You have *no* idea about what it is to be disabled. You also, like most able-bodied people, have no idea that you live in a world designed to cater to your body and your abilities. So you do not see all the 'special treatment' that you receive because for you it is normal and natural. Something you take for granted.

You also seem to think that 'reasonable accomodations' only come in a few forms. They don't. 

If a noise that you are making (that you have the ability to not do) is hurting someone because of an impairment they cannot control and you don't stop when asked hey please stop it's hurting me...you deserve what you get in terms of people thinking you're an asshole.

It's not 'special treatment'. I don't know how to get it through your head.
I don't expect people to cater to my every desire but I do expect to be treated with dignity and the same respect as you'd give anyone. I expect accomodation so that I may have the same freedoms, choices and enjoyment out of my life that you do.

What you term special treatment is the things I must ask for to achieve the things you are given and take for granted.

It's not equality I'm after but equity.
It'd be even better if the structural barriers/ableism I face were removed all together and institutions/public spaces etc. were designed to meet the needs of everyone, but until then equity.
To put it another way:

I don't want just access to the same material resources you have as an able-bodied person. Due to the barriers of ableism put in my way, if given the exact same resources you will flourish in ways I simply cannot.

If, however, I am given accomodation to compensate for that disability (what you term ""special treatment"") in addition to the base resources we both get then we now have the potential to reach the same place.

In other words, an elevator being reserved for me to reach a second floor isn't special treatment. If we were both given what you deem 'equal treatment' like only access to a staircase then I would fail due to barriers whereas you would not. Likewise if you were allowed to use the elevator simply for convienence then you'd likely use something you don't need and disadvantage me further.

Anyway. You said it yourself. Your issue is with this one person. But you came in here ready to attack and label an entire group of people and experiences that you do not understand because of them.

We live for it.  It makes prepared foods (like grocery Rotisserie chicken) 100x's better and we love all the veggies we've cooked in it.


I use it every single day as it's much safer for me than the stove or oven and the food tastes dramatically better than microwaving to me.


I cook frozen foods in it as well as fish, chicken, pork and the cheap steaks we get on sale are decadent. We call the steaks ""meat candy"" (that sounds a little dirty, now that I think about it). ��

2202,"It's difficult to give a good answer based only on this information, but you can likely explain to him that what he is doing is not appropriate without making him feel like his disability is a part of the issue at all. It is difficult to gauge his level of understanding based on this is what I mean, and you may know more about that depending on your interactions with him.

Do you know if he is on his own, or if there is someone else you should be talking to about this?

Again, it really depends on his specific issues, and his level of comprehension, but many carers for people with mental disabilities explain the ins and outs of relationships and what is or is not appropriate without ""pulling any punches,"" (at least, the ones I know who care for mentally disabled people do) so to speak, and they get what is what pretty often.

I can't suggest a specific course of action here, though, as the info is too light.

Some of what you do may depend on what he is doing, specifically. The calls are relatively easy to deal with. Showing up and waiting for her, and other things, may need a different approach depending on what is happening and how it is affecting your employee.

2204,"For countless disabled individuals there last chance at living a functional life without relying on other humans was a service dog. While the alerts and psych tasks often get called into question, the response tasks are life changing for their handlers. I have a friend with brittle bones that are incredibly easy to break, so her dog will act as a barrier between her and crowds so that they bump into the dog rather than her which in the past has caused broken bones. Myself have fainting spells that are triggered by postural changes, my dog's item retrievals are invaluable for keeping me out of the hospital. Those are just two examples with more tasks per dog, but saying that most disabled people who use service animals could us alternate technologies or therapies is ignorant to wide variety of things that can be mitigated by a trained animal. Additionally service animals more often than not are treated with the utmost respect and compassion by their handlers, just because a few bad apples are in the bunch does not mean all apples will be bad. 

Yes, I agree they are the most expensive and draining in terms of treatment options and they do unfortunately cause issues for those fears/phobias and allergies that is unfortunately another unavoidable aspect. But the good thing is that neither individual's rights are greater than the other, both must be accommodated.  Which might look like one individual being rushed into an appointment while the other remains in the waiting room, or they might be served in different sections of the business, or something else as that looks different for every situation. Alternatively taller men with dark skin cause me to have panic attacks, does this mean men should be restricted from public spaces because of their gender? Yes, I am working on it with my therapist but that is beyond the point the tasks our dogs perform allow us to have equal opportunities as our healthy counterparts, making them equivalent to a cane. I am just saying it is a slippery slope to say that just because something negatively impacts a group then it should not be allowed in public spaces. I am not sure what you mean by having them as pets, so I can't touch on that.

I am not sure what the point of saying that saying one group of assistance dogs being more useful or valid. It really is not unlike saying that somebody's experience is invalid because they are bisexual and not homosexual, both are LGBTQ+ and deserve respect as the human beings they are.

Besides, paying for college in general is unfair enough. Anything you can get, you should take. Get your education, study the thing you're passionate about, and don't be ashamed of it.

Getting an education is something everybody ought to have the opportunity to do. When the world's just, that means disabled folks too.

He was a brilliant man. He is in therapy to stop the decline, but what he lost will never come back. 

In two years, they will probably try to push him into another job, but there are mitigating physical factors  and he must make 60% of former pay - at his age, in theory, it is unlikely he'll be pushed back to work - but I've heard horror stories, so.....

2229,"Absolutely, *especially* when I'm in my wheelchair. I don't use personal assistance, but it still happens to me anytime I'm in public with another person. Anytime I have a friend push my chair for me, it doesn't matter if I'm the one that ordered my own food, if the waitress has a question she'll direct it to my friend. I've had people direct questions to my 10 year old cousin accompanying me to the store! I've had someone address the random guy behind me in line at the supermarket as if he were my aid. I've had people come up to me and ask if anyone is here to assist me or if I came here ""all by myself"".

I just have to look very alert and attentive all the time, I pointedly (and often somewhat passive-aggressively) respond to questions directed at the other person, and I've also found that if I'm chatting with my friend while they push me, for some reason I guess seeing that I can function and interact like a normal person makes people much more likely to address me normally? Another tip I've found is being the one to speak first. If I'm going up to a store clerk for help, I'll be the first one to say ""hi, I had a question"" or whatever, and if we're ordering food at a restaurant, I'll be the first one to place my order so the waiter doesn't finish writing down my friend's order and then ask, ""And what will she have?"" as if I can't hear them -.-'",,,,nolosh,,,1574954549,t5_2qhe8,t3_e2uxan,t3_e2uxan,3,1584002046,0,0,f8yyeqi,disability,,,,,

1. Seeing as how they are doing NOTHING to treat me or even find out what is causing my symptoms, it's no big loss if I fuck around with them and *continue* to not receive treatment.
2. I'm in therapy and doing great. Ranting online and finding the humor in a shite situation is how I've survived my various diseases for so long.
3. I feel my attitude is right on point as they have done nothing but ignore me, my symptoms, and my questions. Every appointment I ask questions and they NEVER answer them. But if the husband asks questions they sure as shit answer HIM no problem. But I'm the one with the shitty diseases, not him.

So, yeah, I'm salty af right now. *I* know how serious this shit can be. I also know that my vision is being affected and that shit can be permanent. I like being able to see, thanks. 

I need **some** way to get the fucking docs to actually *maybe* pay attention to me. If it takes making and bringing funny signage with me to do it, then I'll do it. I mean, what do I need to do to get them to actually listen to me for once? Dress in drag and do the hula? C'mon! 

I have tried speaking one-on-one about it. I have spoken to his dept head. I have tried writing to him. I finally just threw in the towel and did a written grievance with the hospital.

I asked my vendor and he told me it all comes down to insurance reimbursement. The chair doesn't cost nearly thst much to make, but the reimbursement is so low that the company is forced to wildly inflate the price just to make ends meet. That way, when the guy from the insurance says they'll pay half of what they ask for and go fuck yourself, they'll still make enough to keep their doors open.

2273,"I'm going to assume you're a manual wheelchair user so if you're taking a powerchair then a lot of this advice will be different.

You need to tell the airline about your needs ASAP. They might require information about your disability and/or a fit to fly letter. You can't normally turn up on the day and expect them to have all the assistance you need.

Tell them you are going to stay in your wheelchair until the gate. This will avoid you having to get pushed around in one of their transit chairs for the day. If you want to do any shopping in duty free, then tell them you want assistance to meet you at the gate or they will just zip you through super quick so they can help someone else.

Make sure to effectively communicate with security about your limitations with regards to being searched. I normally transfer to another seat for a pat down while they search and swab my wheelchair.

From the gate, if there are steps up to the plane, they will put you on a kind of room on a lift on wheels which will give you level access to the plane. Once you are at the door to the plane they will ask if you want the aisle chair. I would recommend this even if you are ambulatory as people won't move so you could be on your feet for several minutes even if it is only going a few metres. Before they take your chair away, remove anything fragile or removable such as bags, attachments and seat cushions. If you have a pressure relieving cushion, sit on it for the flight.

Your wheelchair will be taken and put in the hold now. If you need to use the toilet during the flight, just ask for the aisle chair to be brought to you and they will get you there and back.

Once you arrive at your destination, your wheelchair will be brought to the plane. This will only happen after all other passengers have left so don't panic if it seems to take forever. It is a good idea to give your wheelchair a quick once over at this point. Check for damage, but also just give the wheels a tug and make sure that the pins are seated correctly as now is the time to sort that. 

This is normally the point where I tell them I don't need any more assistance, but if you need help with bags and getting a taxi then let them know and they can send someone to help.

2283,"I have struggled with moments of being self-conscious about this. But I just remind myself that the wheelchair is an amazing bullshit detector, and will weed out the type of people that I wouldn't want in my life (people with a huge implicit or explicit bias against the disabled, ew). 

My confidence to put myself out there has resulted in the most amazing friendships and right now I'm in a relationship with a really awesome person that thinks I'm great and recognizes that being disabled doesn't take away from that but instead gives me a unique perspective and life experience. 

I think it also has helped me to know within myself that I've got super marketable qualities when it comes to the whole dating thing. I'm genuinely an awesome person and I make sure that I practice self-love and compassion. My disability doesn't cancel that out, and I don't want anyone in my life who thinks it does. 

I do share your frustration though, I see how people look at me and I hear how they talk to me when I'm in public, and I do work hard to not let that discourage me and get me down.

Boom, one word says in all.

Also , be less prescriptive and more 'guiding'.

Allow free play with loose parts - junk / recyling. random outdoor toys

Give the ASN child a very visual prop and see what happens. Let stuff happen.

Start super simple ideas "" build this!"" - ""Hit that!"" - ""Jump on this!""  then walk away

Push boundaries by showing the limits at start of play 

But always find a way to say ""Yes"" to boundary play.

Let the other kids explain the game to ASN child - find a way to move the play forward.

Children are very, very resourceful and flexible - the other two will include him if they can.

Even if he is just watching them and he goes and copies their antics after they leave a play space, that alone is very powerful

Also this

 

1. All children and young people need to play. The impulse to play is innate. Play is a biological, psychological and social necessity, and is fundamental to the healthy development and well-being of individuals and communities.
2. Play is a process that is freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated. That is, children and young people determine and control the content and intent of their play, by following their own instincts, ideas and interests, in their own way for their own reasons.
3. The prime focus and essence of playwork is to support and facilitate the play process and this should inform the development of play policy, strategy, training and education.
4. For playworkers, the play process takes precedence and playworkers act as advocates for play when engaging with adult-led agendas.
5. The role of the playworker is to support all children and young people in the creation of a space in which they can play.
6. The playworker’s response to children and young people playing is based on a sound up to date knowledge of the play process, and reflective practice.
7. Playworkers recognise their own impact on the play space and also the impact of children and young people’s play on the playworker.
8. Playworkers choose an intervention style that enables children and young people to extend their play. All playworker intervention must balance risk with the developmental benefit and well-being of children.",,,,FANGtheDELECTABLE,,,1572984374,t5_2qhe8,t3_ds1jt4,t3_ds1jt4,2,1580931730,0,0,f6n3zzt,disability,,,,,

2350,"Yes, this is exactly how I'm feeling and it's so exhausting and upsetting to have this mental battle 24/7. Even reading the comments, I'm comparing myself to you guys, thinking I'm not sick enough but then I remind myself of the bad times, when I've been really held back by health problems.

I've been encouraged to apply for some disabled student support but I just can't bring myself to do it. I feel like a fraud, even though deep down, I know that my health gets in my way quite a lot. I've had to start a health diary to almost remind myself of how much I have to deal with on a day to day basis because I mentally block it out and try to act like I'm healthy and normal. 

Disability (which I believe is on a spectrum) is an identity and it feels like once you've taken on that identity, you can't go back and people will always view you differently. You suddenly can't live your life as you did before (your comfort zone) and you feel like you're being watched if you were to have a good day/time.

When I was out, the pain was still there but I could let myself get distracted for a moment that evening. Today, I am sick and in more pain but no one will see this, only the night I went out.

The actual diagnosis is not as important as documentation of symptoms that prevent you from working.

But you would need documentation of impaired working memory.

One issue I’ve been having is just how expensive it has been to be disabled. *Everything* seems to be marked up somehow. It is killing me financially. In fact, the other day a local redditor offered me their unused ramp for free when I asked about them in a sub. I had a board just sitting on a 2x4 at my doorway but of course it fell down every time and I couldn’t use it alone. So for awhile I couldn’t go anywhere without help but now I need a little less which is really nice. I can’t wait until I can take my wheelchair anywhere I need or want to go! Right now I have to use my rollator pretty often but I’m really unsteady and it zaps my energy so I end up falling a lot or just being able to do less that day. Right now it’s icy and cold out so I’m stuck inside but I had been planning to go to the fabric store today. These sorts of issues make me feel like my bedroom is jail sometimes. It gets frustrating. We bought our house before we knew what was causing my illness. After we found out it’s much more serious and permanent. Our brand new house has stairs that I can’t do alone. The previous homeowner painted over some cracks in the banister to hide it’s broken state, welp, I found out like 24 hours after we moved in by falling right through when I held on. Upon further inspection, both banisters were similarly broken. To say we were livid is quite an understatement!
