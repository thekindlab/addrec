23,"iirc it will count as income for the month you sell, but if you spend it before the end of the month then you could potentially have the benefits back the next month. obviously verify that with someone from social security, i'm not a professional etc. if you have an ABLE account (requires that you were disabled by age 26, you can qualify with a doctors note if you applied for SSI later than that) then you could put it in that without it impacting your assets, as i think the account can receive 15,000 per year without it being income for ssi.

if you have someone else sell it and hold onto the money for you to help you out with expenses at a later date then i am pretty sure this would be considered fraud, which would probably mean permanently losing benefits if social security finds out. you could give it to them and let them keep the money as a gift though.",,,,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,,,1567531935,t5_2qhe8,t3_cyuqb2,t1_eyukzel,1,1576027592,0,0,eywl1yc,disability,,,,,

29,"Good question.
Note: I will only comment on physical disabilities as I have limited knowledge about the workings of mental disabilities aside from ADHD.

Problem Solving:
When we have a physical disability, we face numerous barriers that stand in our way when getting from place to place or doing something else physical. These barriers can come up fairly often, and we need to find a way to get around them. This means we must problem solve to determine what the best way of getting around those barriers are. While there are able-bodied people have great problem solving abilities, our case is unique because we must solve problems like that to survive, so we get a lot of practice in doing so.

Observational Skills:
Because we have a disability, we tend to be very observant and aware of our surroundings and what could be a danger (or just a nuisance) like curbs of sidewalks or ice covered pathways. We also tend to be more observant of people and behaviours, as we rely on people being patient and accommodating to get through our day-to-day lives. This observational habit (which also could be called awareness) is something that everyone has to a degree, but those of us with disabilities rely on it even more in order to survive each day.

Greater Empathy:
This one is not necessarily the same across all people with disabilities, as there are many who have become hardened (as a result of several things). However, because we have a setback ourselves, we are generally able to emphasize more for others who experience setbacks of different kinds as well.",,,,JaminGotJams,,,1569869175,t5_2qhe8,t3_dbbto8,t1_f214x8w,3,1577991470,0,0,f218eu6,disability,,,,,

40,"Plenty of physical disabilities allow for recovery. Not all, obviously; but some.

I was born with congenital hip dysplasia, which resolved completely with bracing and doesn't cause any problems now. Some cases of diabetes are curable with diet. Celiac disease and PKU can be fully managed with diet. Some people with rare diseases go from ""incurable disability"" to ""curable illness"" when their disease is researched and someone finds a solution.

But while those people have those conditions, they're disabilities. Often times the solution isn't total; the celiac disease is always going to require the dietary adjustment, the kidney recipient is always going to have to take anti-rejection drugs.

I left my mark, even though it was much smaller than I had hoped. When I went through the disability process, I was shocked at how careful they are. I learned that many people try to get out on disability even though they might not actually be permanently disabled. I fought hard to keep working. I left so much on the table.

104,"&gt;Your ex broke the co-tenancy and probably the lease if he/she hasn't notified the landlord. I assume you don't have a roommate agreement either... This whole thing is dodgy. I get it, I've been on benefits, but you pretty much chose to ignore all the relevant laws when you did this of what you're supposed to do w/co-tenancy and the landlord.

When my boyfriend moved out, we told the landlord and asked him if I could get a roommate. We didn't tell him we broke up, only that the bf had to move to look after his gramma, which is utterly true. The landlord allowed it, but has kept his right to approve of my roommate, which involves a background check, and he is wierdly persnickety and with criteria that is based on ""vibe"" half the time. The landlord himself drew up a six month sublease for my roommate. 

It turns out, the landlord rented us a ""two bedroom"" apartment with an illegal second bedroom, which is, I think, why he is being so weird about having two individuals live in an apartment with two supposed bedrooms.

A doctor could prescribe special sunglasses for your migraines or a reasonable accomadations might include you being about to come into work before the lights are turned on.

The doctor should be able to give you a note stating that you can't work, and they should fill out a statement for LTD.

155,"There's lots to know, and each chair should be individually tailored to its user.

You may need gloves - I prefer half-fingered leather gloves.


You may need better grips - I use Surge LT grips.


You'll need a cushion, but it may not need to be very expensive.


You'll need some sort of bag to carry stuff - I have a bag that clips onto the back of the chair, but you may prefer a backpack on your shoulders.


You might need a smaller bag to sling over your body to hold your phone, cards, keys and money.


If you can, find a flat space where you can practice rolling - you'll want about 100m length, with few people around, no bumps and totally horizontal ground/floor. It'll help with gaining strength and stamina.

Look for places where you can practice going up and down small steps - up to 3"" drop and perhaps 5cm step up. It'll help when you find these small steps when you're out and about.

Because if you don't get a handle on it, it won't matter which able-bodied person you date -- it will still come up, over and over.

225,"It’s wonderful that you’re thinking about this. Two things that immediately spring to mind:

1. If you are involved in planning an event, whether it’s socially (like a birthday party), or for school/work (like a club meeting), try to keep access issues in mind as a normal part of the process. That doesn’t mean you will always be able to be perfectly 100% accessible, but you can, for example, include info about access when you are contacting people about your event; you can try to pick a venue that is wheelchair accessible (and has an accessible toilet!); you can label food with ingredients or allergens if that’s a concern. Don’t expect yourself to get everything right, and be open to a long-term learning process. But even *trying* and seriously working to be inclusive is already an important step, and over time it will become easier and easier.

2. You will find that sometimes, people around you will challenge others’ disabilities, although not necessarily to their faces. But some people find it hard to accept that ambulatory wheelchair users exist (i.e. people can walk but still need a wheelchair – so you might see them get up out of it!), and that people who look totally healthy might need to use an accessible toilet, or a disabled parking badge. A good way to be an ally is to help take on some of the burden of pushing back against people who question “invisible” disabilities. People who are in that position have a particularly difficult struggle in some ways, because they often feel less valid than people who are very obviously disabled (like wheelchair users), and yet they may have just as strong a need to use – for example – a special toilet. If someone you are spending time with says, to you, behind the person’s back, “THEY don’t look very ‘disabled’...” – it would be great if you can say something like “They might have an invisible condition like Crohn’s Disease, we can’t tell just by looking.”

I am severely physically disabled and because of that was at one point severely depressed &amp; suicidal.

Plus six of my own specialists confirming my physical disability.  They still denied me.

So I don’t know where you’re getting this “20 year olds with anxiety” thing but it’s a myth.  Their own government doctor said I was disabled.  I had been hospitalized for suicide in the previous year. Nope.  That is not an easy status to get.

Now, on to your situation.

You need a lawyer, period.  It comes down to a lawyer simply having the key words, phrases, &amp; info to show total disability. You can afford one, the way they do it is they charge 25% of back pay  capped at $6000 max. They take it out of the disability back pay when you are awarded, so the money never passes through your hands and you don’t pay unless you win.  You can’t get through without it.

When I finally got in front of a judge, she actually apologized for having to bring me in, asked me no questions, threw out the old decision and told me she’d never seen so much evidence of a disability in her entire career.

316,"When I first got ill it took them a long time to permit me SSD. Right around that time, and I was finally diagnosed, hubby went into A. Fib on the night before Thanksgiving, also the day after he had his life insurance checkup which he passed, but would not have since then. Anyhow, he was admitted into the hospital and didn't come home until Monday. The bill came and was over $7K. We tried to get help from Medicaid to pay it, so some young thing called me to do the application over the phone. At that point, we still had a car each and as soon as she heard that, she said we wouldn't qualify! She didn't want to know what kind of vehicles we had or how old they were. We also had two mortgages as we were trying to get into the house he was building and then selling my house. About 7-8 years later he went into a bad bout of it again. The doctor told him to go to the hospital, even though sicker than a dog, he called the business office of the hospital to tell him that he/we had no money to pay the bill, etc. When we got the bill, this time we wrote to the hospital billing office and reminded them that they had told him to come in anyhow. This time the hospital 'paid' the bill as a charity case. He is self-employed so when we were filling out the form for Medicaid this time, they wanted to know how much he made in his job. She wanted to know the gross receipts before any expenses were taken out. So if he had made $10K for the year they didn't want to know what he had netted such as $1K.  I have no clue how segments of our society can get on welfare and Medicaid at the drop of a hat. While those of us that didn't grow up in that sort of situation are totally clueless. Next year, because he has no longer the ability to do his money-making job I am feeling a bit confident that perhaps we can get him on some insurance via Obamacare that is a whole lot less than the $145/month he pays and that doesn't include his medicine co-pays. My state doesn't allow  MC for those not making enough income.

The only thing special we get is if our income is low enough for a year because I am on SSD I can apply for a tax rebate of some of our home insurance. Some years I get it and others I don't. I also used to get a license plate discount depending again on how much we make. But most of these types of benefits, you have to know about to get it.

But you are right that many programs exist to help out folks such as ourselves and others on this forum but we just don't know how to access them. I still remember at a job I had at Arby's one of the 16-year-old girls saying she was pregnant and when the other girls asked what she was going to do, she replied that she was going to go on welfare as all the   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  did! The man she had been seeing was married and about 26 And at her age he should have been jailed for statutory rape! Instead, let's let the government handle the bills instead of the baby's father!

I have just about always been poor yet I take care of myself and supply my needs until I could no longer work and had to receive SSD.

I told him that people try it at least a couple times a month; he said it had never happened to him.  We'd both been chair users for almost 20 years.

We figured that it was indeed probably a gender thing.  Especially since I have never -- NEVER -- had a woman try this with me.  It is always men who either ask me if I need a push, or try to start pushing me without asking.  I don't think they understand how scary it can be to suddenly have this strange man come up behind you and grab you and take control of your body.  I mean, you'd think it would be common sense, but we all know common sense often goes out the window when it comes to able-bodied people and disability.",,,,xj371,,,1567353366,t5_2qhe8,t3_cyap69,t3_cyap69,41,1575927624,0,0,eyqtshs,disability,,,,,

Art works, in part because it reflects an experience that the audience can relate and to be continually shown experiences you can't relate to is really, really hard. The reason its not enough that an actually disabled person was cast is because the art you are discussing is a visual medium, and if the person cast lacks any of the visual signifiers of disability there is an argument to be made that there is no performance/visual of disability or even impairment being shown. 

If the impairment is shown in other ways - eg. fatigue, demonstrative pain and/or coping mechanisms of tha.

Mental illnesses are very much disabilities. I've been diagnosed with more than I can count on one hand, many of them for myself personally are more debilitating than my physical disabilities and fall under abnormal psychology. If something inhibits or limits your ability to function at a certain level in daily life, it is absolutely a disability. 

I think it's especially so with something like OCD since it's (usually) a chronic issue rather than acute. The symptoms are persistent and one of the defining characteristics of OCD is that it affects you on a near if not completely daily basis. Physical disabilities are the same - my inability to stand for more than a few minutes without pain the way people without my physical illness can and my inability to perceive reality in the same way people without my mental illness can affect me just the same in that they inhibit me from doing certain things on a regular basis without some sort of assistance. One is just helped with a wheelchair, the other with antipsychotics.

There are a multitude of able bodied, mentally ill people who receive disability based benefits like SSI. Things like school accomodations whether it be an IEP/405 plan in high school to your college campuses provided help are designed both for people with physical and mental disabilities. 

The bottom line is that you're someone who experiences a set of symptoms in your life on a regular basis that require some sort of assistance, whether it be via therapy, prescriptions, or accomodations, to help you function and do things that those not affected by your symptoms would otherwise be able to do without them. No different than someone with a physical disability. Just because your symptoms are ""invisible"" doesn't mean that they don't affect your ability to navigate through life as much as someone's who are. But don't get caught up with labels either - just because someone meets the criteria of being disabled doesn't necessarily mean they want to be defined as such. My advice to you is to use whatever terminology you feel best suits what you experience in life and feel comfort in knowing that what you do use can change.

Best to you, I hope you get all of the assistance you want with your OCD and continue to better yourself for yourself.",,,,softmikaela,IST/FIBRO/ND,,1568692764,t5_2qhe8,t3_d57lkh,t3_d57lkh,4,1577083787,0,0,f0kzjit,disability,,,,,

356,"You shouldn't feel bad. Disability certainly should be portrayed more in art, and when it is, it shouldn't just be a quick reference to someone's disability, and then never brought up again. It should be prominent. For instance, I'm a huge fan of videogames, which I consider art, and one game I played had the main characters disability right in front of you for an entire level, and showed you just how powerless a disabled person can feel. 

The game is Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, which is renowned for it's first-person, power-fantasy-like combat. Blazkowicz, the protagonist, is bound to a wheelchair (temporarily), and basically has to roll around the first level in that wheelchair, shooting Nazis and defending his friends. At one point, he's captured, and the antagonist forces him to the floor, insults him for his supposed ""weakened"" state, then promptly kills one of his closest friends, forcing him to watch, powerless to stop it.

Being disabled pretty closely to the way Blazkowicz was, that scene really resonated with me. Even though it was a pretty gruesome and messed-up scene to watch, I was still very happy that the designers managed to so accurately portray the inability and hardship that can come with disability, and I wish that there was more media out there that was in-your-face about it. Maybe not to the extreme that Wolfenstein took it, but in a nonetheless similar manner.

363,"Was this your initial application you were denied on? Many are denied on 1st application and reconsideration (if your state has that, some don't) and have to go on to a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge. There is a higher chance of being approved at the hearing level than at other levels of application and appeals. It is very important to continue appealing for SSDI benefits if you cannot work anymore.  
After the first denial many people get a lawyer, your chances of getting approved with one are higher.  Disability lawyers typically do not require payment unless you win disability benefits, and then their payment is taken out of your back payment if you are awarded any. The standard rate is 25% of back payment or $6,000, whichever is less. If you do not get approved the lawyer will not get paid either. This is why disability lawyers typically only take on cases they feel would win. 
If you have no or low income and will not be able to afford insurance premiums you should apply for Medicaid and see if you qualify.  Keeping up to date medical records is important. The whole process of proving you are no longer capable of having substantial work due to disability is less what injury or illness you have, and more how those keep you from working.

No. A restaurant is a public accommodation and a place of public accommodation must remove barriers when it is readily achievable to do so.

No. A restaurant is a public accommodation and a place of public accommodation must remove barriers when it is readily achievable to do so.

My best advice is to get legal aid, and to go to your doctors pretty regularly for check ins, even if there isn’t much they can do for you.

I've seen a fair number of young cane users catch flak, with older people not understanding why ""someone so young"" needs to use it. As if it is somehow only a mobility aid for the elderly.

I don't really understand the 150/175/200 percentages there, but my SSDI income is just a hair over the $24,000 limit for household of 1. It will also be taxable since it past the threshold, so there's an additional expense that I can't yet account for. Might be able to find out how much it will be taxed or maybe I can ask them to lower my annual amount to like $23/24k so I can be exempt from taxes.

Also, in 2018, I've been to the ER like 10+ times (no joke) for heart-attack-like symptoms. Had one overnight stay for a stress test and recently had an heart ultrasound and CT scan.

472,"Wow so many questions to unpack mind if I number it?

1. This issue has been happening more than a year. The first time it was happened was in August of 2018 I both legs gave out and no matter what I did I couldn’t move them or get up. 

1.2. I wasn’t taking birth control at the time of the first fall. I’ve never had an IUCD only oral. But it seems to contribute to the high levels of copper.

2. Yes, I do have warning signs. My legs feel weak and jello-y if that makes sense? I also begin to slow down by a lot and my legs start feeling like lead. I can’t tell the exact moment I’m about to fall but I know that I’m going to. It feels like my muscles lose its tone I can move but it’s very limited. I can’t stand without assistance and I can’t seem to lift my legs when it happens. (Do you think it’s nerve and muscular?)

3. I wouldn’t say that there’s emotional (or physical) factors besides that fact that I’m ashamed of this disability but I do feel some weakness when I’m stressed but but most of the time it’s not guaranteed I fall every time I’m stressed.

4. I do feel fatigued when I’m about to fall. After I sometimes get a dull headache. 

5. I do feel pain, when I hit the ground I fall either directly on my knees or when both my legs give out on either my left side or right (which doesn’t hurt as much). Sometimes I can catch myself and I just do this squat before I fall which puts a lot of pressure on my knees. After the falling episode though I get these intense cramps in my legs.

6. There has always been this numbness in my thighs like I touch them with my fingers and the sensation is dulled I can feel the fingers but not as much and I can’t feel pressure as much on my thighs.


7. It can take anywhere from 30 minutes - the next day for my legs to feel normal. sometimes I get lucky and it lasts maybe 20 minutes. 

8. It’s interesting you say that! I do have headaches constantly and for the most part I don’t black out when I fall. But I had sort of a fainting attack. I felt myself blacking out but I was awake (I felt like I was dying) and I couldn’t get up from the floor and I when I tried to I would just fall over also everything was very tuners vision. it was strange. It went away in about 10 minutes but I digress, I am known to faint. (Were you asking wether I faint in general or do I faint when I’m about to have a falling attack?)

9. The MRI was to test for MS. They focused on my brain. They didn’t find anything that was abnormal. But then again this was about a little less than a year ago.",,,,nananera,,,1568144509,t5_2qhe8,t3_d239ol,t1_ezsyitk,2,1576614119,0,0,ezu36yq,disability,,,,,

P. S. As someone with multiple ""invisible"" illnesses I wholeheartedly agree with the other poster about keeping and promoting an open mind about our unique set of struggles on feeling valid or disabled enough. We struggle enough with ourselves on if we deserve to use the accessible toilets or when we should use mobility devices that it deeply hurts when others question it too. Just because we don't seem disabled doesn't mean we aren't. Opening the minds of those who question us is very important.

490,"I don't know about ""sane,"" but I have a mantra I live by. ""This isn't my fault, but it is my responsibility."" 

There are things I can't do. Sometimes that will make me upset or frustrated. There are things I'll never be - able to live alone, able to have children, able to be athletic, able to go a week without getting my port accessed, able to walk without stumbling, able to exist without pain. At 24 that sucks, but other than medical issues I've created an amazing life for myself.

We're scrappy. We take situations that have no solution and make them work anyway. That's inherently worth something - find a way to apply it and build a life off it. These conditions weren't a decision we made, but life happens and we don't really get to choose another one. 

This doesn't mean don't give yourself room to grieve or feel the symptoms or anything. And it doesn't mean ""just be positive!"" because fuck that noise.

515,"I think it would be disengenous if you didn't critique the position, but you are doing that. 

The assumption that she would be playing a disabled character isn't unfair, it is the norm for characters to be played by an actor who has a specific reason for being cast and as you rightly state, oftentimes that is due to their impaiment. 

I think you hit on a good phrase with 'meaningful way' - tbh its not about whether or not you wish the actress to be more disabled, its more that you want representation of that lived reality. You want the character to be more disabled perhaps, and the actor being disabled had led you to hope that they would be. The disappointment you feel is because you were expecting a reflection that you didn't get, and that can feel like an implict invalidation of that way of living. 

Disability Studies and Performance theorists say that the idea of an 'abled role' is something that needs interrogated. But, you're right - it is new to have a character whose is both played by a disabled actor, and whose whole arc isn't disablity: both have been done, but not together. From what you describe though, this has almost gone to the opposite extreme and seems to be ignoring the disability, and that's disappointing.

I - personally - don't see your response as wrong, some people would argue that there is no 'wrong' response to a piece of art.

537,"The baseline my rheumatologist goes by is pain on a scale of 1-10, most drs use similar scales. I get asked this question every time I see her, or get my monthly Infusion. That creates a paper trail in my medical history that SSA can use to see extend periods of intense pain. Documentation is the key. Not just pain rating, but make sure your drs (any/all of them) note down what activities are difficult or impossible for you to do. If needed keep a journal for them to include in your chart/records of symptoms. It doesn't matter what is real, it matters what you can prove. There are tests and exams to measure inflammation and pain, if you are not seeing a dr to treat this pain regularly then you should start. Social Security doesn't care about partial disability, if you are able to work enough (by their standards that is about $1200/month or more). 

In this vein, if you cannot do your normal activities without pain or taking strong pain meds, document this. 

If you decide to file, I would consult an attorney. Disability based primarily on back pain can be difficult, an the attorney can answer questions and tell you if you have a good shot. They will usually offer a free consultation and are limited by law how much they can charge. They are also paid on contingency out of any back pay you are due.

In the meantime, if you aren't already seeing a specialist for this issue, request a referral to a pain specialist or whomever your gp feels is appropriate. You can also request a referral to pt for an evaluation to see if a mobility aid or pt would be helpful. 

Sorry for the novel, but I've been there with the ""working through"" chronic pain. Sometimes it is worth it, but if it is to the point that you can't manage both work and a life, you should explore your options.

545,"Thank you so much for answering all those questions, it helps us get a better idea of what you're experiencing, maybe someone experiences something similar and can share their story.

I've had my own confusing journey to diagnosis, I work in community health and have a background of nursing. So while I haven't personally experienced anything like you describe I'll give my advice based on my rudimentary understanding of health. But of course I am just a stranger on the internet so this is more about things you could ask your doctor for further information, and not actual management or diagnostic advice.

If the issue has been happening before you started birth control, then birth control is not the cause, whether the birth control is making it worse or not isn't really an issue at this stage, because it sounds like you're looking for answers as to the original cause - though if your doctor does strongly suspect your birth control is making it worse I'd still recommend looking into other birth control options for a while to see if it can make you more comfortable in terms of your symptoms.

Cramping and weakness in your legs are important symptoms to consider in understanding what's causing this, it isn't something like cataplexy, but it could be something like peripheral neuropayhy or peripheral palsy.

The fact that your legs take up to a day to feel normal makes me think this is both muscular and nervous, now the headaches may be unrelated but since your doctor was worried about MS, two other conditions I'd recommend ruling out/investigating would be Charcot Marie Tooth Disorder and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies, these two conditions are like a localised version of MS, they don't affect the brain so a brain MRI won't reveal much, but they cause similar issues with the nerves mylein sheaths, just localised to the nerves in the legs/arms etc. A neurologist would be the specialist to ask about this.

If the headaches are related then it might be worth asking your doctor if there is enough indication to investigate ""tethered cord"", it's essentially a spinal cord issue where your nerves get ""attached"" around your tail bone instead of flowing freely. This can cause thigh weakness and the jell-o sensation, as well as headaches.

If you have a family history of autoimmune disease, Polymyositis might also be worth ruling out. It causes inflammation in the muscles and results in weakness, cramping and an inability to move the muscles. It can wax and wane (ie, flare up, then go away for a while). Milder cases may only effect one or two muscle groups, such as only noticing symptoms in the legs. 

These are things you can ask about if your doctors current treatment plans for high copper are not helping at all. And again, these are just things I'm thinking about because of my own experiences with my diagnosis, I am not a doctor and my ability to hear hoof beats and identify horses or zebras is not reliable.

But I know how stressful it can be to have embarrassing and challenging symptoms and have no idea what's causing them, sometimes having specific things to ask your doctor about can help.

Make sure you find a doctor who will listen to you, understand what your health goals are (managing symptoms vs finding the underlying causes) but who will also help explain why certain concerns or ""webmd diagnoses"" are unlikely and not worth testing for and describe things in a way you can understand.

It's ok to be undiagnosed, that's something I've had to come to terms with, that despite my lack of a label for my condition my symptoms are no less real, I don't have to be embarrassed, because it's not my fault that there is something different about my body and modern medicine can't fully help right now.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1568193192,t5_2qhe8,t3_d239ol,t1_ezu36yq,3,1576646236,0,0,ezvrpiq,disability,,,,"Thank you so much for answering all those questions, it helps us get a better idea of what you're experiencing, maybe someone experiences something similar and can share their story.

560,"Thank you. We need to support each other, not turn on each other. I got upset because I felt imbicfuturistic was doing to me what the OP is here complaining about. I hate hypocrisy.

I'm a budgeter and a planner. I wasn't always debilitated to the degree that I am now, so while I could work more, I started a very flexible, lucrative gig that would pay residual income, and purchased the smallest, cheapest house that I could, outright, so mortgage wouldn't be a concern whenever I did have to stop working. I gave in and accepted that I needed Medicare about 6 years after my doctor started suggesting that it was time. I was awarded SSDI in less than three months because of the severity that I had let things get to and how impressed everyone was with my planning and foresight.

We had to sell the home I owned outright to use the equity for my medical bills. We had the leftover liquid cash to buy the only two things needed for the new home, so I found them at 10% store cost and saved the other 90%, which has been spent on medical costs in the four years since.

I was lucky that I could work a lot until things got too bad, and I made choices that set me up in a better position when that time came. I'm not apologizing to anyone for the fact that working my ass off when I could and planning this life since I was 20 years old provided me with enough at ONE time to buy second-hand furniture.

I'm happy to help and advise anyone, but I won't continue speaking with people who want to have a pissing match over how bad we have it. We all have it bad. Every post in this thread was made from bed because I had surgery on Tuesday, and I have two more surgeries coming up in the next three months. The past several months, I have been in the hospital one week out of every three. My husband and I had rooms next to each other at one point. I just sold several things we loved to buy a refurbished iPad that I need to continue working at all.

Disabled people need to stop treating other disabled people like shit because their luck isn't quite as craptastic as yours is and because others clawed their way to a slightly better position.

562,"The down votes weren't from me, I understood what you were saying, and it's very true, too. I think I'm a bit lucky in having about 10 years of paperwork showing definitive proof that's what I have and how bad it is. He's not one to just throw a diagnosis in and call it a day, it took about a year before he was sure, and a little longer to be certain.

The narcolepsy diagnosis is still relatively new, but I have all the criteria to meet type 2, I at least have that going for me.

I spoke with an attorney this morning who will be making a house visit soon to help me fill paperwork for SSI instead of SSDI (which I don't qualify for due to not being able to work the 10 years). And until I know what to do or how quickly we can move this along, I'll apply for food stamps for the meantime.

It's definitely rough because I used to be a very active person, I had a great memory, creative (illustration), and to experience all of it slipping away, most especially art, has pressed my depression even further. I could pull out full illustrations in a matter of hours to days, but now it takes me days, weeks, months (over a year) because I can't use my hands, arms, shoulders, back, and my ability to clearly visualize is muddy and scattered. It honestly sucks, I love illustration. Used to do conceptual illustration for gaming companies, worked on a comic for myself, and now I barely lift my pencils, touch my paints.

I guess because my husband didn't want to do those things it made it easier for us to accept a few days apart.

The question. Can you be upset? Yes. Ofcourse you can. You are entitled to your feelings.
Should you force him not to do things he enjoys. Hell no.
If you don't expect him to stop you doing something he doesn't like, why would you do it to him..

I do believe compromise is a thing too but if you can physically handle yourself for a few days in one capacity or another, let him do his thing. You aren't one person. You are two. Allow one another to be yourselves and express that as needed.

My husband adds. You could make an agreement that once they are back you agree to do something that you can do together.

Second, only the conditions for which you have official diagnoses and documentation of will be considered by anyone (private or government) reviewing your case for benefits. Your suspicions of narcolepsy won't count for anything.

Third, your at-will employer cannot fire you based on your disability/health conditions and are legally required by the ADA to make ""reasonable accommodations"" to help you maintain your health and well-being. Go to your company's HR representative (not your boss or coworkers) with documentation from your doctor citing your need for accommodations such as a fixed and regular schedule. If they refuse to make a reasonable accommodation for you and fire you as a result, you can sue.

Fourth, the Social Security Administration won't care what you can or can't do while unmedicated. In fact, they will deny your claim if you aren't making every attempt to treat your condition. If you are medicated for your documented conditions and STILL remain unable to work (for at least five months and for an expected year at minimum), you might qualify for benefits, both SSDI and SSI (if your assets are below a certain threshold).

Fifth, if you do qualify for SSDI, you are permitted to work as long as you earn less than a certain amount. That said, if you were also approved for SSI, you'd likely lose that once you started earning almost anything.

So overall, no. There are no **government** benefits (at least in the USA) that would let you take a breather from work. It's an all-or-nothing system. Best advice I can give you is to request the accommodations you're legally entitled to for the conditions you have proof of, and get an actual diagnosis for your narcolepsy so you can either a) make requests for that condition as well or b) file for disability for it if it becomes fully disabling.

Good luck!  


Edit: Also, the SSA defines disability as an inability to do ANY job, not just the job you have. In other words, they won't award you benefits just because you can't continue to work your CURRENT job. If they (and for that matter, you) think you'd be capable of doing something else with a more regular schedule, etc. then you won't qualify for benefits.",,,,NeuroGeek,Chronic Illness,,1568688797,t5_2qhe8,t3_d531k6,t3_d531k6,2,1577081616,0,0,f0kuy6l,disability,,,,"Ok, so first off: there's no such thing as ""temporary"" disability benefits, at least not when it comes to government benefits.

All the travel and other adventures I’ve had in the past has been facilitated by using a wheelchair, even when I was still walking better. 

Do you believe your family would be supportive of getting a wheelchair? Would they push you? It’s also helpful to use a chair in airports as that is such an exhausting part of travel. 

For Glossier, I would contact them and see if there is any way to skip the line because of your disability.

666,"Hey, I'm sorry that you are going through this. I am disabled with several invisible illnesses and even after 6 years my husband's family don't fully understand my conditions. Sometimes it  takes finding a  round about way to  explain  it. Eg one of my conditions is autonomic dysfunction.  In short the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This may affect the functioning of the heart, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, pupils, and blood vessels.
The way I had to explain it to my partners family  was imagine I am a car  the engine is the heart/brain. If there isn't enough water, it can overheat and stop working. You dont have enough petrol so car with crash out. Etc. It helped them understand that condition a little.

I too have trouble getting my parents to accept my conditions, though they are hereditary. My parents refuse to believe that mine is already worse. 

Maybe if your parents saw your partner on their worst day ( I know it is dreaded by your partner but it may be only way for them to understand). As for them accepting that you plan to spend the rest of your life with your partner,  in time they will just have to accept it. My now husband,  told his mum that he  didn't care if she approved of me or not. He knows what he is  getting into with my health,  and he loves me regardless. If she couldn't accept it, then she is welcome to leave his life. 

If you ever want to chat, I  am happy to.  I have many years of experience with invisible illnesses.  I've learned to adapt to certain things that  I  can't change.

I mostly meant ""pay in cash"" btw. If your roommate isn't a drug addict or a prostitute, the landlord probably doesn't care much if he's paid timely and be willing to overlook these matters. If either of you is a habitual drug user, plays loud music or is otherwise offensive, start looking for a new apartment. Your ex broke the co-tenancy and probably the lease if he/she hasn't notified the landlord. I assume you don't have a roommate agreement either. 

I would pay part by check and the rest in cash personally, but you should probably talk to a lawyer. This whole thing is dodgy. I get it, I've been on benefits, but you pretty much chose to ignore all the relevant laws when you did this of what you're supposed to do w/co-tenancy and the landlord.

""There is no need to file taxes simply because a person owns an ABLE account. The program may ask that you complete an informational form and hold on file.""

Other research confirms that ""the program"" means the financial institution that holds your ABLE account. So it looks like if you don't  owe taxes in that state and the state doesn't allow deductions for ABLE accounts, you don't need to file in that state.

I wrote to MA tax board to ask them directly as well, and I'll update when I hear back. 

I've searched the IRS tax codes and the only thing that I have found is that it looks like withdrawals from ABLE are counted in your gross income.

We tend to tell the people around us that we are fine and don’t spend the time to think about what steps we take to survive, so meeting with the lawyer ahead of time was helpful in that respect. 

He didn’t do much during the heading but he told me what to expect. He said the hearings are audio-recorded and that is why it is important to ask the judge to change positions if you aren’t comfortable because if the judge says you were able to sit comfortably for an hour and you didn’t, you can appeal and the audio will show you had to move.

When I say ""recover"" I don't mean never being able to function and live fully and lifelong without being debilitated or in any way by the symptoms of a personality disorder. That's very much a thing and that's what recovery usually defines so in that sense yes it's very possible. What I mean when I say that is moreso when people treat PDs in particular as though they're acute, or something that form in late adult years. The verbiage has different meanings definition wise but I'm more equating the situation where someone insinuates that someone with a chronic mental illness from childhood can be ""cured."" PDs in themselves are chronic in that they form early and affect a person for years. So while someone with a PD themselves may vibe with the term recovered when referring to understanding how to cope with their symptoms in a healthy way etc etc, when other people say it to someone with a PD it tends to have a harsher tone if you get what I mean. It just personally makes me feel weird when someone insinuates a person can make a full recovery from abnormal chronic disorders, it feels too much like a ""well that isn't a physical disability therefore it can be 100% cured"" thing to me you feel? No disrespect to ppl with chronic mental illnesses who use the word recover, it just hits a little different and feels kinda talking-down-ish to me when coming from someone else. But again, that's more of a personal opinion, I just threw it in because a lot of people I've talked about similar things to before have felt the same way about it.

828,"This may be a weird one, but my mental hack when I was getting used to a cane was to think of it in the same way as I've learned to think of a zit on my face, or a new haircut I'm not totally styled on, or something in that vein. Which is to say:
- I know as much as I feel awkward about it, nobody really cares because they're focused on their own life. I know IDGAF about someone else's zit except maybe the briefest bit of empathy cause shit can hurt, and I imagine others feeling similarly. 
- if someone *does* judge me harshly or poorly for such a little thing that's outside my control, is that really a person whose opinion I care about? Generally not. 

Of course mobility aids are much more useful than zits, but I found using that existing mental foundation gave me a jump on getting over feeling self-conscious. 

Nobody's ever treated me poorly or rudely with my cane - if anything I just get more people holding doors, offering seats,  and offering to carry things for me, so it's made my life easier on a number of fronts by making my disability more visible.

857,"I couldn't get any 'official' help when buying my chair, but the salesman of the mobility aids company I used was an expert at measuring people up to get the right chair, so you may not need an OT's help getting the right chair for you.


For me, this is what I wanted/needed:

1) Light weight: I have to carry my chair up and down some steps, so I wanted a light weight chair. These are often known as active chairs.


2) Folding handles: I didn't want the push handles sticking out all the time, so the handles had to fold down.


3) Lowered back: I wanted a lower than usual back rest so that I could twist round more easily and access the backpack that hangs off the back of the chair.


4) Manual chair: I wanted to push myself around, so I needed a manual chair. It can be great exercise for the upper body.


5) Folding chair: I wanted a chair that could fold so that I could get it through narrow doors and into tights spaces.


6) Larger front wheels: If you're out and about on normal pavements/sidewalks then you want 5""-6"" front wheels to get over all the cracks and potholes.


7) Replaceable cushion: You'll need a cushion to sit on, but you can start with a cheap one and see how it goes - mine cost about $25.


8) Tyres: I have solid tyres due to a lot of broken glass on pavements, but others prefer lighter inflatable tyres which are said to give a smoother ride, but I'd be worried about getting a flat tyre a long way from home.


9) Better rims: I live in a hilly city so I needed firmer grips than usual so I can get enough power into the pushing. I use Surge LT grips and they're great for me.


10) No arm rests: I found I didn't need arm rests and not having them saves some weight. I do have mud guards on the wheels and they are a necessity.


Standard Features: most chairs come apart so that they can be fitted into cars. The big wheels pop on and off by means of a button on the hub. My front wheels also come off and the chair folds to give a smaller loading size. Many fixed frame chairs have a folding back to minimise carry size.

In the end, you need to have a good think about how you'll use your chair, and that should define the features you need and which ones you don't. The more customising you need, the more expensive the chair. However, my first chair fitted 80% of my needs and cost $450 and would have been fine for a few years. (I found the money for a chair costing $4000 which is a perfect fit, otherwise I'd still be using my first chair.)",,,,BlueBear63,,,1569049779,t5_2qhe8,t3_d735k1,t3_d735k1,1,1577308160,0,0,f0xw002,disability,,,,,

925,"Another field to add burn out to is teaching. My mom is a second-grade teacher and has been for 20 years. She taught while pregnant, while breastfeeding while dealing with toddlers and a drug addict husband. She dropped her 3 months old off at daycare and went to school to take care of other people's babies. More and more kids come in not knowing 1st-grade material. There aren't enough TA, Paraprofessionals, counselors, special day classes, nurses, therapists or hours in the day. There's a reason the stereotypical old teacher is bitter and mean. 

I think one of the reasons that this goes so unnoticed is that teachers, nurses, firemen and all the other professionals you mentioned are not part of our everyday lives. Even if they are, you are either very close to them and have a social dynamic to your relationship, or are detached through a professional one. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that out of the 24 sets of parents my mom talks to, conferences, troubleshoots with, accommodates and serves though her hard work, over 90% would underestimates the amount of work she puts into teaching. Some would even claim that it isn't enough. 

You are 100% correct that we need to elect people that care about these professionals and wants to invest in them. But we don't need to wait until election season to start caring. We can start by reaching out ourselves. Getting to know our kid's teachers. Thanking our nurses. We can volunteer our time. Community service work, a classroom volunteer a batch of cookies for the local firehouse or the nurse break room. At the very, very least, we need to check our own behavior. Are we being patient? Are we being gracious? Are we thinking about this person as someone there to help us or as a complete individual?

And I’m tired of people with disabilities getting type casted. I want to break that stigma by either getting a role of an average person living life who just so happens to be in a wheelchair or being one of, if not the first director in a wheelchair. 

If I can gain the fame and awareness I can direct it to these issues and help more people with disabilities in true roles in tv and film; not just “that person with a disability and that’s their character’s gimmick”.

961,"I’ve moved from state to state frequently for jobs, and it can make a big difference. For example, I moved from a flat city with public transport (easy to negotiate) with a lower cost of living to an expensive rural area with lots of hills and no public transport. The lifestyle change that has gone along with it has been pretty rough.

However, while there can be good doctors in any location, your likelihood and options of finding someone who specifically works with your conditions is most likely higher in a bigger city, *especially* if the city happens to have medical school teaching hospitals. You’d also be more likely to have different specialists that deal with your condition to choose from.

After two years of messing around with some incompetent specialists in my new rural area (I’m talking medical malpractice incompetence), I got my doctor to refer me to specialists at a hospital in a major city 4 hours away. The difference in care is amazing.  In rural areas, hospitals will kind of take who they can get, but research and teaching hospitals in big cities are more competitive for jobs.",,,,KittySnowpants,,,1567362171,t5_2qhe8,t3_cycdql,t3_cycdql,1,1575934566,0,0,eyr7ehr,disability,,,,,

1031,"There is enough wealth and resources in America that nobody should have to live in poverty. We're propagandized to hate the poor and punch down so that the rich can live lives of luxury and excess. It's not even that taking care of everybody would even reduce their lifestyles that much. For example, Jeff Bezos* could feed and clothe every homeless child in the world and still be the richest man on earth. (and before anyone says this isn't true, JB could easily come up with $11b in liquidity if he wanted to)

Why doesn't he? I suspect that cruelty is the point. Dehumanization is the point. The fact I'm unable to work right now due to my chronic illness makes me scum. The homeless vets? Also scum. If the people comfortably surviving in this world DIDN'T see poor people as scum or objects of pity then capitalism would collapse. How can someone buy (for example) a $100k sports car to add to their collection and be aware that someone like me would have their life completely transformed for about $3000? If our positions were reversed, I simply wouldn't be able to to. I'm not saying I'd live a completely austere life, but I'd be too wracked with guilt to live the way most multi-millionaires and billionaires live. People imagine the only alternative to the capitalist hellscape we live in is 60's style soviet communism with breadlines and dull lives. Meanwhile, we produce 2x the food we need and throw most if it away while people starve. There are more empty homes than homeless people. Landfill are filled with NEW clothing and other consumer goods because giving them away would reduce the value of next years crop of goods.

The dehumanization we (the 99%) endure is a feature of capitalism. It's so extreme that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse because of it. The thing that gives me hope is that in 50 years we'll either have some form of eco-socialism or communalism that doesn't dehumanize the poor...or the rich people will be choking to death in their climate change bunkers as the 6th mass extinction unfolds.

*As an aside, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffet drive old crappy cars. They do this so they can look in the mirror and not hate themselves. It's to maintain the illusion that they're not greedy monsters. Which is weird, because if you're rich, driving a new car with modern safety features is actually an investment nobody would begrudge.

Why doesn't he? I suspect that cruelty is the point. Dehumanization is the point. The fact I'm unable to work right now due to my chronic illness makes me scum. The homeless vets? Also scum. If the people comfortably surviving in this world DIDN'T see poor people as scum or objects of pity then capitalism would collapse. How can someone buy (for example) a $100k sports car to add to their collection and be aware that someone like me would have their life completely transformed for about $3000? If our positions were reversed, I simply wouldn't be able to to. I'm not saying I'd live a completely austere life, but I'd be too wracked with guilt to live the way most multi-millionaires and billionaires live. People imagine the only alternative to the capitalist hellscape we live in is 60's style soviet communism with breadlines and dull lives. Meanwhile, we produce 2x the food we need and throw most if it away while people starve. There are more empty homes than homeless people. Landfill are filled with NEW clothing and other consumer goods because giving them away would reduce the value of next years crop of goods.

The dehumanization we (the 99%) endure is a feature of capitalism. It's so extreme that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse because of it. The thing that gives me hope is that in 50 years we'll either have some form of eco-socialism or communalism that doesn't dehumanize the poor...or the rich people will be choking to death in their climate change bunkers as the 6th mass extinction unfolds.

*As an aside, <PERSON> and Warren Buffet drive old crappy cars. They do this so they can look in the mirror and not hate themselves. It's to maintain the illusion that they're not greedy monsters. Which is weird, because if you're rich, driving a new car with modern safety features is actually an investment nobody would begrudge. They do these token gestures, like driving an old car or writing million dollar novelty checks (pocket change to them) to charities they own for PR and to assuage their guilt.","[{'start': 2059, 'end': 2067, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 304, 'end': 312, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 40, 'end': 50, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

 They chewed her out about sending such a note. That she should have sent it to disability along with supporting documentation.  Yet work also sent me a note a few days prior that they were terminating me if I didn't show documentation.  They did say they would email disability and ask.

1041,"Hello, I’m disabled and I work in operations and compliance at a credit union and I just want to assure you that checks being held under Reg CC (the regulation that outlines when and how financial institutions can hold checks) are not being invested. That, to my knowledge and in my experience though I cannot cite the specific regulation, would be illegal and very easy for auditors to spot. 

What’s happening when checks are held is the FI is preventing loss during the time it takes for the check to clear and for them to actually receive the money. Especially since fraudulent government benefit checks have been increasing in circulation.

I always encourage researching a FI’s policies and fees before opening an account. But, the best you can do to avoid holds on what are often much needed funds is take advantage of direct deposit. Not only does direct deposit make funds available within 1-2 business days (if even held at all), but for many disabled folks who may have difficulty getting out of the house it makes getting your money much easier! 

Also, avoid mobile or digital deposits if possible. Most FIs follow reg CC guidelines for digital checks, but they don’t have to. Digital deposits are held under much more scrutiny since the checks aren’t presented in person and are more subject to fraud.

1050,"I had a similar experience in college. I was 34 when I was trying to get a BA and I hit the barrier. After the first diagnosis I was mad at the world and I wrote a paper for one of my classes that was brutal. Thankfully the professor was amazing and she asked if she could read some of it for the class. I did not realize how angry I was at the world until she read it out loud.

For me the anger never went away and I had to learn to control it and for the most part now about 7 or 8 years later I can most of the time. It still shows from time to time and I have to step back and look at the situation and say is this the best option. 

Trying to thread the needle between advocatacy and hostility is hard because the rest of the world is going to test you constantly. Knowing when you need to advocate vs when you are just picking a fight is another major challenge. 

Later in my BA I wrote a paper on people's understanding of disability and all it thought me is that even the people that are supposed to help people with disabilities do not understand the needs of this diverse and highly misunderstood population. And if that statement did not scare you it should. 

There is nothing that I can tell you that will help you other then do not be afraid to speak up for yourself. Tell people what you want clearly and do not take no for an answer. That is how I operate with regards to my disability. I get told all the time that ""we"" have never done this before. And my response is OK then last make it happen. If they push back I say I am hearing a lot of reasons why we can't do ""x"" let's start thinking of ways we could do it. 

Force the framing of the conversation so that the expectation is one that they are expected to do it. I also like to say this if they are completely shut down and unhelpful. I know this sounds hard but I bet not attempting to comply with civil rights legislation will more then likley be far worse. I save this for if they are not willing to do anything as it is a gamble. It may make your situation worse it may scare the person and get them to come up with new ideas. Just remember set the expectation that they are required to do something and if they don't there is a conciquence. 

Disability advocatacy is a balance of the carrot and the stick and knowing when to use both. It is hard to tell when you start but you get better over time. 

Also remember you are not required to accept the accommodation(s) that an institution comes up with unless it resolves all of the needs that you bring up in the disability request. I almost always say no to the first thing presented to me and push for more. 

I hope this helped. I may not be a good resource for you as many people do not like my methods but I can point at some of my accomplishments and say they must work as I have seen some success.",,,,TollinginPolitics,,,1569702088,t5_2qhe8,t3_d8x2zs,t3_d8x2zs,1,1577804881,0,0,f1qjodp,disability,,,,,

1070,"Yes, you have a disability. It may not be a permanent one--you may recover from your OCD, and your depression may go into long-term remission--but it's lasted more than a year, at the very least, and that's a disability. If you need accommodations at school or at work, you have the right to ask for them.

I know the stereotype of ""disability"" is somebody who has a permanent, stable, visible physical impairment; but that's a stereotype that doesn't represent reality for many (most, perhaps) people with disabilities.

Disabilities can be episodic, like episodic major depression. They can go from not affecting you at all to affecting you profoundly. Many physical disabilities also involve flare-ups interspersed with periods of more typical function.

Disabilities are long-term (we don't call an episode of the flu a disability even though it is disabling), but they don't have to be inevitably life-long. Someone who has cancer probably has a disability--but if the cancer goes into remission long-term, they may no longer have a disability. That doesn't make the cancer any less of a disability while it exists.

It seems very possible to me that the recruiter could have passed on that info and it unethically influenced their decision to bring you in for an interview.

Uh, $450 is hardly ridiculous to spend on furniture if it's quality stuff.

* **DINING ROOM SET** (from a couple looking to downsize--which means it's likely at least 7 pieces if not 10.)

Do I have a spare $500 just laying about often? NO, but it's not unreasonable for even me a disabled person to figure out how to save and budget money for large purchase once every few years. Especially when the person you are replying to has a husband. How do you know that's not their Christmas gift as a couple for two years from all of their parents? Maybe one of them gets $15 a week ""under the table"" watching their neighbor's kid after school?

She was fine with more like 200 or less but the minimum amount was $350 for the SSI rules so I'd have more money at my disposal.

For some, both Dx (EDS and fibromyalgia) are accurate, but a few people get the fibro Dx simply because their docs are not familiar enough with EDS to recognize it.

1145,"I am in agreement. The only real rules in the breed is that you mix a lab and a poodle and see what you get. This is a serous problem as you can get all kinds of problems. 

When I looked at training a service dog I spent almost a year finding the right dog and turned down 5 or 6 people and was turned down 1 time by and very good breeder what did not think that I was a good fit for the dog. 

I kept track of that dog and he was right. The person that got her turned her in to a great duck hunting dog so props to him for making the right decision. 

that same breeder helped me find the dog I ended up training. And again he picked a great dog for what I was looking for. A good breeder can do this extremely well and fits the dog to the person not the person to the dog. 

The reason for this is if you have a dog that was intended for hunting as most are and all of the prey drive shows and it wants to go outside and chase and hunt they will not make a good service dog. If you have a lazy couch potato they will not make a good service dog. A good breeder can see this in the puppies development over 8 to 10 weeks and can guess surprisingly effectively at how good they will be at specific tasks.",,,,TollinginPolitics,,,1569527127,t5_2qhe8,t3_d9hqal,t1_f1il3rk,3,1577687320,0,0,f1jrv2p,disability,,,,,

If you work for an employer with a pension plan, your eligibility for the pension was priced into the insurance when the underwriting was done, if the employer elected to have retirement be considered deductible under the plan. The same is true for employers who pay into FICA and who have a provision for deducting SSDI. 

Another way to think of it - if offsets for work comp, SSDI or pensions are not included into the plan, the insurance would be far more expensive due to added risk, and as a result you might not have had the coverage to begin with.

1182,"You can qualify for SSD/SSI even with an invisible illness but it is hard. 

Paperwork is your greatest ally, and at least one doctor (usually PCP) who will help you sign and fill out paperwork. An evaluation by a physical therapist on a day when you're at your worst is also important. (Disability paperwork is not geared towards illnesses that fluctuate, so you need to fill everything out as if you're answering on your worst day.)

Also having a good history of doctor appointments is really important, including diagnoses, and building up a list of medical professionals they can investigate to vouch for you. Put down every single diagnosis you have, because they are forced to look at how all impact your ability to work together, not just the ""main"" debilitating condition. It's hard if your disability isn't on the automatic acceptance list (mine wasn't) but it can be done.

Before that, I tried to keep working at my job until I literally collapsed at work and had to convince them not to call an ambulance. I then had to quit after tying loose ends, figuring I'd get whatever it was sorted out in a few months and be back at work. Hah.

Took me two years before I was able to get on SSDI, I was lucky I started working very young so despite being disabled in my early 20s I had enough work credits to qualify. My spouse supported me completely during this time. I was mostly bedridden, and had to not eat or drink while he was gone so I didn't wet the bed. Ate one meal per day for years, my teeth ended up demineralized from malnutrition. Bed sores bc I couldn't bathe myself and my spouse was busy working 10hr shifts so I went months without bathing. He also just wasn't prepared for full time caretaking on top of working full time. 

It was not a good time, especially since private insurance doesn't cover in-home care and because I was married to someone working I didn't qualify for state income care.",,,,noeinan,POTS/EDS,,1567466296,t5_2qhe8,t3_cypxfg,t3_cypxfg,3,1575993305,0,0,eyumn8e,disability,,,,,

With the last of the boomers reaching retirement age, moving from CPI-W to CPI-E is a no-brainer.

I have long advocated that the Social Security system needs change to bring benefits in line with the true cost of living. It is not just Social Security that needs reform. So many of our institutions are outdated. Indeed, the Constitution itself is outdated, but who do you trust to make changes? I think Congress needs to create a list of all the problems facing the nation, prioritize and systematically address issues including revamping the entire social safety net to come in line with the needs of the people of today. Our forefathers never imagined the technological advances we have achieved, thus did not plan our laws and government for them.

I used to live in Vegas. Vegas has to reinvent itself every so often to keep tourists interested. So too does government. Not to keep us interested, but to address the needs of a changing populace.

I have long advocated that the Social Security system needs change to bring benefits in line with the true cost of living. It is not just Social Security that needs reform. So many of our institutions are outdated. Indeed, the Constitution itself is outdated, but who do you trust to make changes? I think Congress needs to create a list of all the problems facing the nation, prioritize and systematically address issues including revamping the entire social safety net to come in line with the needs of the people of today. Our forefathers never imagined the technological advances we have achieved, thus did not plan our laws and government for them.

1329,"Physically and mentally disabled adult Disney nut chiming in on this post because it's a good and important discussion! Disneyland and i believe Disneyworld actually have a program in place to help with this!

I am almost fully wheelchair bound at this point in my life and also have a very long slurry of mental illnesses that debilitate me further. I adore Disneyland but I would absolutely not be able to handle it without the Disney disability pass. The second you walk into the park, go straight to the main information building (in Disneyland in CA it's City Hall, not sure about the other parks) and request the disability pass. The cast member will ask a few very non invasive questions (ie. How does standing in a line/crowd affect you? How do loud sounds affect you? What sort of accomodations do you feel you might need?). They're very good about not stepping over boundaries and they never ask for any proof or even ask what your disability is. I often go to the park with my other friends and family members who also have mental disabilities and not so much physical, but really can't handle the overstimulation of the park. This is a life saver for all of us.

Once you have the pass, it's put on your ticket and works like a fastpass but for any ride in the park. There are information kiosks spread throughout the property, and when you want to go on a ride, you request a ""wait time"" for your pass. If you wanna go on Splash Mountain but it's a two hour wait, instead of standing in line they give you a time to come back in two hours, and you then either go through the fastpass line or the exit depending on the ride. You can only get one wait time at a time, but you can stack a fastpass on top of it. So while you're waiting for your 2pm wait time to Splash Mountain at 12pm, you can get a fastpass for Indiana Jones for 3pm, and then spend your time waiting going on small dark rides with shorter lines and you've got a whole 3 hours planned out to avoid the lines.

The only downside is that non disabled people are getting smart to this. I started doing this years ago, but when I went to the park early this year, the disability lines were packed with groups of teenagers, young parents with about 5 kids in tow, and strollers as far as the eye can see. This pass is most commonly used by adults/children with sensory issues, and as someone with PTSD and autism, I'm pretty good at spotting kids who definitely don't have any problems like this. Once again a service meant to help disabled people is being taken over by non disabled people who wanna cut corners.

At the end of the night we had to turn in the wheelchair I borrowed and get on a tram to go to the bus loading area. I heard that there was a long walk and my body was not up to that so I took a fried and got on the ""accessable"" tram. 

It dropped me off as far away from the buses as possible. All the other trams got closer. The only other people on the bus we're teachers and tag alongs who has no problem with the walk. My half dead brain didn't even realize the problem until the tram had left. It took about 45 of waiting, pleading for help, franticly calling friends, and nearly fainting and crying in front of a tram driver for them to send two staff members over to wheel me over in a wheelchair where they proceeded to drop me off at the front of the bus loading area leaving me to find and crawl to my bus.

1363,"Hi. I have two pictures. The first one is dumb and boring but incredibly significant. It is of a crosswalk which I took on the very first day I got my first wheelchair almost 15 years ago. I was nervous to cross the street with it. I felt stared at. I felt like I'd get stranded. It currently hangs on my wall at home. The second picture is still on my phone because I took it two days ago and I'm not home at the moment. It's a picture of me visiting Machu Picchu in Peru after three flights, a van ride, a train ride, a bus ride, and getting carried up the steps by three local Peruvian men. I could tell you about all the pictures in between but trust me, there are some good ones. 

All I can tell you is that if you think having a wheelchair or any assitive device will make your life better, then you get that fucking wheelchair and cross the street. Then you cross the city. Then you cross your country. Then you go wherever the hell you want to and you leave everyone who doesn't help you live a great life behind.

Every ounce of pain and discomfort and angst you feel now can be eased by using tools to help you live a great life.

1393,"Well, I don’t know your circumstances, but TPD Discharge isn’t just dependent upon having a disability, it is dependent upon having a total and permanent disability or terminal illness that will result in imminent death within so many years (I forget the exact number of years) or your inability to work. After proving through the Social Security Administration or your doctor that you have a TPD and the Department of Education approves your TPD, you have a 3 year probationary period where if you return to school or get a job (I think you *may* be able to get a job if you earn less than the Federal Poverty Guideline or a lower limit), you will have to repay all of the loans discharged due to TPD. 

After the 3 year probation, I’m fairly sure you cannot get Federal Student Loans. And if you can,  I can almost guarantee you that you would not receive a second TPD Discharge. 

If you finish undergrad + grad school in a timely fashion without much incidence, you are probably going to have a hard time claiming TPD unless you can demonstrate drastic decline or imminent death occurring near the end of or after completing your studies. 

Usually the general premise is if you can graduate in a timely fashion, you can probably work a job. Now that’s not always true, but that’s how the TPD Discharge program and agencies like the Social Security Administration operate.

Edit: If you think you meet the TPD Discharge requirements and you know that your income will be significantly affected for the rest of your life and thus your loans will cause a bigger undue burden for you than able/working people, then IMO, I would do the TPD for undergrad and forget about grad school.",,,,thrashing_throwaway,"ASDmoderate, severe HSD, ADD, CF+OI, chronic migraine",,1568993421,t5_2qhe8,t3_d6w9oc,t3_d6w9oc,2,1577273647,0,0,f0vwf70,disability,,,,,

1438,"Just going to paste from another comment in case you don’t see it OP

Someone said they were told if you could do well in a zombie apocalypse then you might not be disabled. This was my response to that as someone with mental illness. 

Idk. Because ADHD would theoretically be perfect in that situation and they think that’s why we have evolved to carry it. When we were sitting around the fire, ADHD was an asset since the slightest rustling on the edge of the circle of light would grab their attention and cause them to focus on it. So walking dead type situation? We would be great. We might also do some dangerous stuff like accidentally poison ourselves which is a common danger  in unmedicated ADHDers today. But we’d be good at being alert and hyper focused. But in modern society we can be heavily debilitated and disabled. I’ve read a few ADHD researchers say that ADHD is the most debilitating of all mental health illnesses within psychology. Their argument is that ADHD untreated has devastating outcomes like raising probability of being in a car crash by 40-42%, reducing life expectancy by as much as 15 years, reducing lifetime earnings, increasing suicide risk, causing secondary symptoms such as depression and anxiety, increasing risk of teen pregnancy and suicide, increasing probability of drug use and prison time, as well as leading to some of the leading causes of death in the western world (heart disease, suicide, type 2 diabetes, etc). A lot of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia will get angry about this and say that it’s completely inaccurate to say that ADHD is worse than bipolar and schizophrenia. I’m not a researcher so it’s only what I’ve read. I do have adhd and bipolar disorder and I can say with certainty that adhd would have taken my life long before bipolar ever did. How do I know? I was diagnosed with and managing bipolar disorder for several years without much improvement. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed with adhd at age 26 and received medication that my symptoms improved greatly and I was able to focus on the left over bipolar. I’m still debilitated by a lot of adhd and bipolar but medication helps me at least live a relatively quality life. I know disability is a spectrum and it’s hard to see certain things like adhd as a disability but in a lot of ways that’s what makes them so covert and difficult to live with.

It’s hard for people to understand what it’s like to have your body tell you to kill your self. For no flipping reason. Your brain just SHIFTS and suddenly all the memories of being happy are gone. You can’t access them. You start to become convinced you’ve never been happy. This always happens. It will happen again. Friends and family have to tell you that no, it has passed before and will again. Just keep fighting through the down mood and it will pass. And it does. And the sun comes out again. And you get a few months before it comes back if you’re lucky. Repeat the rest of your life. How crazy to think that your own brain makes you believe that you should die. Depression in a lot of ways feels like an auto immune disease where it attacks itself. I become very tired and everything hurts. Physical pain. They’re getting closer and closer to showing that depression may be a physical disorder. I’m hoping I will see better answers and treatments in my lifetime.",,,,Comrade_Soomie,,,1568720380,t5_2qhe8,t3_d57lkh,t3_d57lkh,1,1577093209,0,0,f0lje1l,disability,,,,,

(2) doing stuff to help other people when i am able (again, instead of focusing so much on myself). that includes friends, family, people on the streets, etc. basically if i can help, do it. then when i'm legitimately not able to help other people it's okay becuase i know i did what i could. there are also some volunteer opportunities where people are understanding and flexible of disabilities.

1.) The standards for ""disability"" differ between the VA and the SSA. What qualifies as a disability for one may not necessarily qualify you for the other. Not saying you don't deserve SSDI (I certainly wouldn't know) but it's not a given just because the VA considers you disabled.

I am assuming there is no one else who could go with you.

And tbh if you need to change who your carer is you might have to if your mother does not stop drinking.

Basically, it's not realistic at this point to just have your mother take care of everything if she cannot take care of herself.

I was in a similar situation where I was very isotalted with my Mom and moving out was the best thing for me.

I am a DME supplier and make it a point of pride that I can convince some teens and young adults to get equipment when they are hesitant. Every single one has been so greatful after delivery and following up that they got it.

I tell them 2 things. 

1) less people are looking at you than you think

and this rings true for EVERYONE, we are too busy thinking about work/school/projects and our own lives to think about trivial things. When someone out of shape goes to the gym 99% of the people that see them are thinking ""you got this"" ""good for you"" ""now that's motivating""

2) own it, make a part of who you are. Get a favourite colour, put stickers on it or get a vynil that has a motivational word or what ever. Be unappolageticaly yourself. Easy to say but the equipment can be fun and when you make it your own, you take pride in it and want to have it/use it. 

While in University I broke my back and couldn't handle sitting longer than 5 minutes. I took notes standing in lecture hall. 100-250 students in each class, by mid semester everyone recognized me as the guy that stands in class. This was for the entirety of my BSc. Made getting notes and partners easy, everyone knew who I was! I would say ""hi I'm the guy that stands in class"" and people would always say yah I recognized you. Easy opener to making friends

in terms of training, yes! with litigation and everything being such a concern in this industry me training someone isn't really allowed. However, me demonstrating how a product is used is totally acceptable. It just has to be very carefully understood that I am demonstrating, not instructing.

You know how, when training a dog, you give them a treat every time they do a trick/a good thing so that they'll do the trick/good thing more? Humans also work that way. When you have the obsessive thoughts, you presumably feel bad. You want to do the compulsion, and if you do it, you feel a little better. The thoughts are the command, the compulsion is the trick, and the reduced anxiety is the treat. Every time you act on the compulsion, you reinforce it and make the urge to do it stronger in the future. 
As an example, I hate touching dogs because they feel dirty. If I touch a dog, I feel like my hands are covered in dirt, so I wash them. Once I wash them (once or twice or 4 times) I don't feel dirty. I'm teaching myself that the way to stop feeling dirty after touching a dog is to wash my hands (a lot). The way to break the cycle is exposure therapy where you're exposed to the scary thing and can't react with the compulsion, but that takes time and should be done w a therapist. Don't blame yourself, but do seek help.
A lot of people with depression do experience suicidal thoughts, but less than 10% actually go on to commit suicide. Additionally, depression is episodic. It doesn't last forever (although things like anxiety disorders can cause feelings of depression for a longer time).

So far, it appears to be a role that can just as easily be done with an abled actress playing an abled character. 

Yes, you're exactly right: I wanted a representation of a lived reality--one that she surely must deal with sometimes-- and it had nothing to do with wishing her to be more disabled, because I surely do not. 

Now I'm starting to feel like I'm too heavily invested in this at all, but there is so little representation that each time it comes up, I get quite invested for a while.

I hope that current residents can find homes in the area and stay close with their friends that they currently live with.

Edit: I just realized that the residents that make and sell stuff at the concrete store won’t be able to do that anymore. It breaks my heart that they’ll be moved to some care home and not be able to participate in their craft any longer.","[{'start': 602, 'end': 610, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

1578,"As someone who has been raped and is now disabled, I can confirm that it's the same sort of repeated trauma. I'm pretty sure this is part of why my condition had declined to the point it has. Combined with systemic issues like poor medical care and working myself to the point of sickness to just scrape by. I went from a healthy young adult who was doing school and work and had a social life to a complete shut-in due to being stuck in bed most days. 

After I moved to at least 12 different cities and towns across 4 states to avoid homelessness, I became totally isolated and there is no chance of me getting hired anywhere despite my urge to make a living for myself. I'd love to do school just to keep my brain active but I can barely do leisurely tasks, so I hesitate to even consider classes. While none of my conditions are curable, they can be managed but the medical system has utterly failed me. I almost died from a lack of adequate treatment earlier this year and I'm 99% I'm only around to type this now because I'm stubborn and I did the research and ordered meds from the internet. 

All of this has happened over the course of about 10 years now. The combination of the questioning/doubts/biases over  being raped an/or being disabled really wears you down. It's like I've not been able to recover, even for a little bit. Wish I could take a vacation but it's not an option. Look up C-PTSD and repeated microtrauma and you'll see that we are not alone.

If he couldn't tolerate that, I might use something called a switch, which is basically like a big button.

1603,"It all depends on your view of what ""manly"" means.

Manliness, or masculinity, is one of the most warped concepts in society. Because men were (and still are) the ones who did most of the heavy-hitting physical work, the standard for men became associated with physical and mental strength. However, this is extremely toxic.

The toxic aspect of this concept is that men are measured by how strong they are physically and how hardened they are emotionally. Obviously, for men with physical and mental disabilities, this would deem us non-manly.

But we have so much potential in so many aspects of life because of our disabilities. Sure, we aren't able to do everything that an abled-person can, but we can also do things better than a typical abled-person (better problem solving, better observational skills, greater empathy).

So, what an I trying to tell you? Masculinity should not be a measurement that you try to score high on, because it is based on toxic attributes that don't make you a better person. Instead, strive to be the best person you can be, and you should do just fine ��",,,,JaminGotJams,,,1569866801,t5_2qhe8,t3_dbbto8,t3_dbbto8,7,1577987226,0,0,f211t4d,disability,,,,,

1621,"&gt;Long story short I'm unable to work most jobs and have applied for social security 3 times only to be denied because of my age. They even say while my injuries are severe I don't have enough work history.  Even though I've worked since I was 13 and I'm 33. 

Individuals of all ages can be approved for Social Security Disability benefits (SSDI), as long as they meet certain stipulations. 

A disability claim is evaluated by the Social Security Administration (SSA) according to vocational factors and medical guidelines. 

Depending on work history and medical issues, it's possible that a person's age is a factor in determining disability, though individuals are not automatically disqualified for benefits just because they are/aren't of a certain age.

The main determining factor for approval of a SSDI claim is ability to work. If the SSA determines, after evaluating medical records and recommendations by doctors - that a person is unable to engage in any sort of gainful employment, then chances are they'll be awarded Social Security Disability benefits, regardless of age.

Have you gone through the appeals process after rejection? You wrote that you applied three times, but didn't mention any appeals. This is important because   over two million disability applications make it to the Social Security Administration on a yearly basis, and less than half of those are approved during the initial application process. The remainder are left to fight for their benefits through a disability appeal process.

Filing multiple applications isn't as effective as filing an appeal to a rejection.

&gt;My issue is I live in public housing and they won't accommodate me and say they don't have to because I'm not on social security.  My doctor even wrote them a letter stating I needed a one story apartment.  Is there anyone else going through this or can help me out. What do I do? Thank you

You do not have to be on disability benefits to qualify as disabled and be allowed to request disability accommodations in housing.

Public Housing is covered by The Fair Housing Act, which has it's own definition and understanding of disability/disabled.

“Any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment.”

“In general, a physical or mental impairment includes hearing, mobility and visual impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex, and mental retardation that substantially limits one or more major life activities.”

“Major life activities include walking, talking, hearing, seeing, breathing, learning, performing manual tasks, and caring for oneself.”

You do not need to “prove” to your landlord or Housing agency that you are disabled. If your doctor or provider writes that you are disabled, this is all that is needed. 

You may want to research The Fair Housing Act further to see how to word a reasonable request. If you still encounter issues, you may be able to talk to a disability rights advocate for assistance.",,,,cereduin,,,1569631859,t5_2qhe8,t3_d54ifx,t3_d54ifx,2,1577761730,0,0,f1o15gv,disability,,,,,

I also think some portrayals are good and effective sometimes, though.

1644,"That is why I said *documentation* is important. Chronic pain becomes disabling when it is chronic enough and at a high enough intensity to interfere with daily activities needed for life, like making or eating meals, hygiene, or even walking to the bathroom. 

For example I live life at a 3-4 most days. There are (many) days where the pain increases to a 6+ when I do something like make dinner or drive to the grocery store. There are some days where that baseline pain is 6+, or that I can't do more than stagger to the bathroom and back to bed. I could ""work through"" the pain, but that required copious pain meds, to the point that I wouldn't have been safe to drive home. It would also compound daily, so 1 moderately ""bad"" day would trigger a bad week or more if I worked through the pain. 

Childbirth on the other hand causes intense but temporary pain. Sure temporary may mean several weeks or months before total recovery, but the pain will lessen and eventually go away. Chronic pain is, well, chronic. It may go through periods where the pain levels vary, but it is almost always present.",,,,joiedumonde,,,1567450960,t5_2qhe8,t3_cykmdf,t1_eyu03ei,2,1575983322,0,0,eyu1yjq,disability,,,,,

1647,"Speak to your main doctor, always. As you've noticed paediatric care is very different, the advice for an adult is always going to be different than for you while you're still growing.

There are canes with seats if you need a break or a family member could carry a lightweight folding chair for you. You might also be suitable for a rollator which allows you to walk normally when you can, lean when you need to and have a seat if you're going to be waiting a while. A physio may have other suggestions, you might be suitable for (joint) braces or other devices. As you're going with family I wouldn't worry about peripheral vision, they can help you out.

1672,"They were wrong. If you are on SSDI you *can* be approved, but you aren’t approved just because you’re on SSDI *unless* you have a 5-7 year review date which most non-terminal patients don’t have.

Assuming you don’t, you’ll need to go online and download the application from nelnet, and bring it in for your doctor to sign. You then mail that, along with alllll the supporting documentation you can find (basically all the info from your diagnosis, plus the last year or so of medical records), to nelnet. They take about 60 days to review your application, and may approve it, deny it, or ask for more info. 

By contrast, if you have a 5-7 year SSDI review, you just print the letter off with the application (that you sign for yourself) and mail those in for an automatic approval.

If you’re going to apply, you can call in to your loan servicer and have your loans put into forbearance for 12 months so you won’t pay a dime while you get this all sorted out. Even if you don’t, though, when you’re approved you’ll have all the payments you made between the date you mailed your packet and the date of your approval returned to you by the treasury about 30 days after your approval.

1689,"Idk. Because ADHD would theoretically be perfect in that situation and they think that’s why we have evolved to carry it. When we were sitting around the fire, ADHD was an asset since the slightest rustling on the edge of the circle of light would grab their attention and cause them to focus on it. So walking dead type situation? We would be great. We might also do some dangerous stuff like accidentally poison ourselves which is a common danger  in unmedicated ADHDers today. But we’d be good at being alert and hyper focused. But in modern society we can be heavily debilitated and disabled. I’ve read a few ADHD researchers say that ADHD is the most debilitating of all mental health illnesses within psychology. Their argument is that ADHD untreated has devastating outcomes like raising probability of being in a car crash by 40-42%, reducing life expectancy by as much as 15 years, reducing lifetime earnings, increasing suicide risk, causing secondary symptoms such as depression and anxiety, increasing risk of teen pregnancy and suicide, increasing probability of drug use and prison time, as well as leading to some of the leading causes of death in the western world (heart disease, suicide, type 2 diabetes, etc). A lot of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia will get angry about this and say that it’s completely inaccurate to say that ADHD is worse than bipolar and schizophrenia. I’m not a researcher so it’s only what I’ve read. I do have adhd and bipolar disorder and I can say with certainty that adhd would have taken my life long before bipolar ever did. How do I know? I was diagnosed with and managing bipolar disorder for several years without much improvement. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed with adhd at age 26 and received medication that my symptoms improved greatly and I was able to focus on the left over bipolar. I’m still debilitated by a lot of adhd and bipolar but medication helps me at least live a relatively quality life. I know disability is a spectrum and it’s hard to see certain things like adhd as a disability but in a lot of ways that’s what makes them so covert and difficult to live with.",,,,Comrade_Soomie,,,1568720212,t5_2qhe8,t3_d57lkh,t1_f0lewv6,1,1577093140,0,0,f0lj8h7,disability,,,,,

1693,"The short answer is no you do not have to tell the employer during the application or the interview. You do if you want accommodations after you are employed. 

The much longer answer is you might have to during the interview process if there are parts of the job that will require accommodations so that you can clarify your needs and see if the organization is a good fit. One thing you learn over time is that the ADA does not make people magically understand how disability works and there are many things that an employer can do to make your life very difficult. Often times discussing it early in the application process will tell you how much the employer will be willing to work with you. I like to call the HR department and ask for clarification on a specific job duties or what an average work day will look like. What the work area looks like. I have a bunch that I use. If I get push back at that point in the application process it will more then likely be hard to work with the HR department in the future when I need accommodations so I move on to other options. This makes the process take longer and eliminates tons of options but I can say this. When I did this and had time and found one that took my requests seriously the pay off on the other end was great and when I needed a job and did not have the time to be picky my experience was not near as good with one exception.

1717,"Wonderful blog.

My problem: I (F22) am in college. I was seriously injured just after my freshman year, causing me to need a wheelchair full time (my legs are smushed). Before the accident, I dated a lot and was sexually active. After the accident and some time to recover I wanted to start dating again. I had no trouble meeting guys from school (I am studying chemical engineering, the male to female ratio is in my favor here). We would go for lunch, ice cream, coffee, and sometimes dinner. However, the guys I was with somehow thought I was too fragile and would not get physical. Like most girls I expected the guys to take the initiative in such matters. Really, although my legs won't work everything above my legs worked fine.

I finally realized that I was going to have to take a little more intuitive myself. I was with a guy after a nice dinner, back in my apartment. We had been making out but he kept his hands to himself. It was obvious from the lump in his pants that he was interested, but he seemed afraid to express it in any way.

My problem: I (<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>) am in college. I was seriously injured just after my freshman year, causing me to need a wheelchair full time (my legs are smushed). Before the accident, I dated a lot and was sexually active. After the accident and some time to recover I wanted to start dating again. I had no trouble meeting guys from school (I am studying chemical engineering, the male to female ratio is in my favor here). We would go for lunch, ice cream, coffee, and sometimes dinner. However, the guys I was with somehow thought I was too fragile and would not get physical. Like most girls I expected the guys to take the initiative in such matters. Really, although my legs won't work everything above my legs worked fine.

I finally realized that I was going to have to take a little more intuitive myself. I was with a guy after a nice dinner, back in my apartment. We had been making out but he kept his hands to himself. It was obvious from the lump in his pants that he was interested, but he seemed afraid to express it in any way. So I told him that I would need his help getting ready for bed (I really did not). So he helped me out of my shirt and it was becoming even more obvious that he was very interested. After helping me remove my skirt and panties and then lifting me into the bed he was really excited. I pointed out to him that there was room for him and nature took its course.

So now I know that I have to take a little more initiative. I ask guys to go out with me and then take a little more initiative when things get more physical.","[{'start': 32, 'end': 51, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Feel free to PM me if you want to know more about this and some other issues that I have faced and haven't seen talked about.

  There are 2 big things you could do that will really help disabled survivors:

1. If you find anything that promotes awareness on that subject,  share it. Spread it as far as you can!  Even if you just feel like making a post about that huge issue one day, you might really make a difference. 

2.  Most importantly, be sensitive.   A lot of disable people have a lot of trauma in their background.  You don't have to walk on eggshells around us, but just showing  disabled people that you know this and care can make a world of difference!

Making friends with people with disabilities is the same process as with anyone else, although perhaps with a bit more mindfulness and maybe flexibility. Look for common interests, respect boundaries. It's probably easier for adults to gauge the comfort level someone has with sharing about their disabilities than it is for a middle schooler (not that it's easy for adults). Maybe they could remember to add ""if you're comfortable with sharing?"" to questions about health or limitations.

Some of the autistic people at my school get picked on for it. They tend to not have very many friends and there's this whole set of stereotypes and assumptions people make and it's not, well, it's not great, it's not good, it's very very bad. 

I'm such a believer in the prioritisation of mental health and the importance of it that it hurts me to know that there are people subject to trauma and to abuse because of a disability and because of the mystery and ideas, badly researched, stereotyped ideas, sorrounding said disability. Even at my school. 

Do you think that there is something that I can do, maybe a system I could suggest setting up to stop this? Everyone knows the ""report bullying"" thing doesn't work. It just doesn't. You don't get taken seriously and even still a bully knowing they were reported is only going to further isolate and stigmatise you. Be warned it's never just one person and people start to see you weird. You just can't report it half the time.

I would love, if you would not mind, to discuss your experiences.

If you find no viable results after exploring these links, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you find resources relevant to you, but unfortunately many home modification financing and grant options for people with disabilities are either very local specific so I'd ask that you please state where you're interested in finding a home and need funding.

Finding property managers that accept section 8 are also difficult to find. And you'll be even less likely to find a realtor who knows much about disability unless they specialize in it (maybe see if there are realtors near you that market to seniors?). Many are uneducated and suspicious, but some are outright discriminatory!

Also, attending university with accommodations can be very different from the ability to work a job that would allow a disabled person to live without external supports. Also disabled people are more likely to accrue undue higher tuition debt over time for having to drop classes, retake classes, and not being able to reach the minimum credit hours per semester necessary to reach “flat rate tuition.”

Under IDEA, a student actually doesn't need a medical diagnosis to qualify for special education (and, in fact, the existence of a diagnosis isn't enough to qualify on its own). It is true that they do need to fall into an identifiable category, and some organizations like the National Association of Special Education Teachers is now pushing back on that. The logic is that if we can group similar children with similar types of behaviors or similar needs, it's easier for us to provide services. 

Of course, the reality is that one child with any given classification can be very, very different from another. For example, since I was only ever evaluating young children, something like 90% of our cases ended up as Developmentally Delayed. That included kids at polar opposites of the ""delayed"" spectrum. Good school districts will still try to use the social model -- they'll modify their own systems to adapt to their individual learners as much as possible. Bad districts... won't.

1995,"Since my disability is visible, I guess I am not in a great position to offer any tips on this, but I would like to try nonetheless. 

Without knowing more about your disability, you do say that it ""affects your life greatly."" That to me, would signal that you may want to disclose it relatively early in the online relationship. 

Having said that, it also really depends on how much or many of these effects are seen by the person. Probably not at all, if it is online. If that is the case, it might work better for you to disclose it only when you think things might be going for a face-to-face. Otherwise, it would be normal not to mention it, IMHO. 

You also say you can pass for abled, and I am not sure if you mean just online or not. If it is IRL, it may not be necessary to disclose this even during the first meetup. 

And although you view it as a significant disadvantage in life, there is every chance the person you are with will not, especially if you've been able to form a strong bond online.

2002,"I think you've hit on a big part of this for me, and why my feelings are so conflicted. I think it is great a disabled actress was cast in the role, and it's also fine that it appears to be the role of an abled person. This might not have been as big a deal had I done enough research to know any of this beforehand. I guess in a way, I also made an unfair assumption that she'd play a disabled character (because we often have to, if we get into acting at all).

It's a visual medium where I didn't see the disability I was expecting represented in any meaningful way. I know that there are many invisible disabilities, too, but this typically is not one. 

I think that is why I feel bad. Because for me, what you say ""it is not enough just to have a disabled actor,"" is at the heart of the issue, and I feel bad for feeling that way. I think it should be enough. But I wanted to see some disability on-screen. I definitely do not want the actress to be ""more disabled"" even though she has a progressive condition, and that's another reason I feel bad. I wish her all the health. 

I guess in a way, this is just very new. A disabled person, who doesn't necessarily display impairment (if it's a physical and typically visible disability), and cast in an abled role? How often do we see that anywhere?

I feel like it is disingenuous of me to be disappointed in this way, and yet, I am. But I think you've explained a big part of why I feel this way and why it might not be so wrong to feel it. 

Part of my excitement is also that the character has kind of a cool job that you don't often see disabled people getting into; I wanted to see how the disabled character did that job, and it seems like I won't see that story.

2012,"A few ideas:

\-Get a good haircut. I also have thick curly hair. I find mid-length is easiest. Too short and it's hard to style, too long and it's heavy/takes forever to dry. A good haircut will make you look polished with minimal effort. 

\-Comb conditioner through hair in shower with wide tooth comb before rinsing out, and apply styling products to hair while still sopping wet. This is basically the devacurl method, if you google it you'll find lots of youtube videos.

\-Buy clips in different sizes to keep your hair out of your face and mix up the style throughout the week. This makes it less noticable if your hair isn't the freshest, if you're switching up how you wear it. Also, if you use clips you won't damage your curl pattern with elastic bands.

\-Febreeze is great if you want to rewear something and it's gotten a little smelly in the armpits. Take the garment off, spray the offending area, and wait five minutes. Works great.

\-Lint roller is really effective for removing skin flakes, lint, other stuff on your clothes.

\-Great accessories (interesting glasses, statement earrings, scarf) go a long way with helping you look put together even when you feel like garbage.

\-When possible, keep sores covered with a bandage of some sort. This helps prevent secondary infection, and to some extent protects your clothes.

The ABQ location has been terrible.  We took the chair in for its annual service and despite us telling them in advance to just order all the parts that were on the replacement list they refused to do that until they'd viewed the chair.

2052,"I have another idea for a story that you should do. One of the major issues that people with disabilities face is the transition from school/college to work. It is very hard as the skill set that you develop with or without accommodations does not transition very good to most working environments. 

This makes it very hard to work at ones education level and as a result the unemployment and underemployment rate is very high across the country for this population of people, myself included. 

This is basically unknown or completely misunderstood by the majority of the population and makes it very hard for people with disabilities to work with social service agencies and government institutions that are designed to help them. 

It would also make it much harder to apply for loan forgivness because if a person has a degree or education most people would assume they should be able to work. What they do not do is take into consideration the effect the disability has and if that makes it so that they can not work in their chosen field. So they end up working in a different field and as a result they have a degree in a field they can not work in. 

This reduces their employment opportunities and over there life time their earning potential in almost all cases. This then makes it difficult if not impossible for them to pay back the loans for a degree in a field that they can not work in.

2061,I am no expert and not a lawyer but from my understanding you need to have a documented condition to get disability. It is easier to get disability with a doctor's long term documentation of your illness but if your illness and its impact on you makes you eligible for disability then you should be able to get it after a few doctors visits.  It may just take more effort. It will depend when you were diagnosed as well. If you were diagnosed years ago and didn't see any doctors your case will seem very suspicious and it will be scrutinized and possibly denied depending on your illness as to why you didn't see the doctor. If you self diagnosed yourself and just now went to a doctor for the first time and got diagnosed you would look more reasonable to get disability.,,,,madmax727,,,1568748072,t5_2qhe8,t3_d5ks0a,t3_d5ks0a,1,1577111659,0,0,f0mm2gg,disability,,,,,

2093,"Make sure they're fitted properly for your height *and* arm length. Make sure you are using them with the correct [gait pattern](https://www.verywellhealth.com/) for your medical needs.

I've used forearm crutches since I was 15 (I'm a part time user due to a congenital disability, so I have used them long term but not every day) so my experience may be different because I have different crutches for a bilateral impairment. 

They *are* painful, but there is a huge difference between ""phew, arms aren't meant to be used for walking, I'm achey and exhausted"" discomfort and ""these crutches are actively doing my body damage because they're not right for me"" pain.

I second the advice to get a fanny pack and backpack. Store commonly used items like phone and wallet in a fanny pack on the front of your body, and larger items in the backpack, get a well fitting backpack to avoid any extra pressure on your shoulders.

Get a really good reusable water bottle and if you are a coffee drinker get a reusable cup with a lid that seals tight. This way if you're trying to carry drinks from one room to another you don't have to do the awkward ""stick a finger in the cup and clutch it to your crutch and spill half as you walk"" manoeuvre, you can just throw it in your bag till you sit down.

For getting plates from the kitchen counter to the dining table, other than just hopping/hobbling around my house, I have a trolley on wheels, it looks like a metal instrument trolley you'd see at the dentist, it's lightweight plastic and was $5 from a dollar store. I put my stuff on that then I just sort of take a step, balance myself, then push it with one of my crutches, take another step, balance, push it a bit more, until I'm at my destination.

In public, I try to eat at places with table service, buy things I can put in my backpack, or I just ask the cashier extra politely ""would you be able to put my food on that table right there after I pay? I know you don't normally do table service but I can't really carry a plate and drink, I'm sorry, thanks""

When shopping I try to make sure I start with a totally empty backpack, because I do have to stop at each shelf, put the item I want in the backpack, put the backpack on and then keep going. When I get to the check out I make a huge show out of empting my backpack completely onto the conveyor belt. I have had a security guard approach me and ask what I'm doing, I'm upfront and just say ""I know it looks dodgy but I can't carry a basket or push a trolley, I need my hands for walking, and regular shopping bags bang against the crutches, I could trip. I'm happy to be searched upon exiting the store"" 

I've heard that in America some stores have electric scooters anyone with a disability can borrow, and some stores even organise for a ""bagger"" to escort you and help you shop if you call ahei. But that's definitely not a thing here (we don't even have baggers - so another tip for shopping, go at a quiet time and also pick the check out line that's already slow and full of older people so everyone will be patient when you slowly bag your items, don't use the express lane even if you only have a few items, because you probably won't be able to bag it at an express speed) 

Because I use forearm crutches I'm able to carry small things between my fingers while still resting my palm on the hand grip. So I'll hold cash, receipts, small things I'm buying, things people hand me, paperwork for work in my fingers just to grab things and move to the side, then I'll organise my bag once I'm out of the way. 

I also use a lot of hair ties and random bits of string to tie various things to my crutches, like my bus pas swipe card, that way I'm not fishing around in my fanny pack for it.

I've definitely chipped teeth trying to hold things in my teeth because I was too lazy to stop and get my bag off my back. So probably don't do that....


There's no shame in buying some elastic wrist stabilisers or getting some kinesiotape/sports tape to strap up your wrists and shoulders before a walk.

Buy some tiger balm/icy hot and apply to your shoulders, elbows and wrists after a long day to reduce any inflammation and keep them functional for the next day of walking, especially as you are getting used to crutches, because even when fitted properly, unless you used to regularly hit the gym it's likely you are using muscles you don't normally use and/or using them more intensely than you normally would and demanding higher endurance from them.

Find a pair of any boots or shoes that he likes the look of. Order his shoe size, and 1 size bigger, and 2 sizes bigger. Try them all on with and without the orthotics, and send back the ones you don't need.

[The UK’s unwritten history of disability](https://disabilityhorizons.com/2016/07/uks-unwritten-history-disability)
&gt; In the early years of the 1900s, people with mental or physical disabilities were branded as “feeble minded” by politicians and scientists. 50 years ago, there was no safety net or welfare system to support disabled people. And it was only 20 years ago that the UK passed laws making discrimination against disabled people illegal.

The disability rights movement is one of the youngest social justice movements in human history.

to learn more.  

Attitudes definitely won't change without more education and exposure for PWD. But unfortunately, change is slow, and changing human behavior with education is possible but many curriculums don't even include the history of people with disabilities or their social justice movement efforts... which would allow for more understanding, empathy, and overall inclusion more. 

At least the physical environment was a positive, though!

I encourage you to at least try to educate yourself and those around you about the history of disability if you really want to see attitudes change. It's best to be prepared to educate and advocate for yourself long term than rely on the kindness of others, no matter how difficult it may be.",,,,mayisir,,,1568056624,t5_2qhe8,t3_d1ssse,t3_d1ssse,2,1576548414,0,0,ezqa17d,disability,,,,"

2116,"Yeah, it is. Of course it is. It varies, obviously, with how effective the exact illness is at keeping you down, but there's always something that's a pain to do, no matter what the problem is.

Showering, shaving, and using the restroom is what I struggle with, personally. There are various other small things that can be a hassle too, like pouring drinks or brushing my teeth, but the small things don't bother me, really. The former three are the things I dread the most. Every time I even think about doing them, dread wells up in my chest. But I do them anyways, and then try to make the most of my time before I have to do them all over again. And of course there's not being able to really leave the house. It's all I can do to not go insane from going stir-crazy. Imagine being in the same place for 4 straight years.

In the end, though, it's all a mindset thing. The whole ""you can do anything you set your mind to"" and ""keep your head up"" things don't work for me, but they work for others.

If you've got quick release wheels, try swapping the wheels and seeing if the lean occurs on the opposite side. If it doesn't, it would rule out the rear wheels, but it might mean your frame or axle is bent.

If that's the case, consider still going to a local bike shop or contacting a metal shop in your area because they might be able to twist it back in place for you.

I've been a disabled dependent my entire adult life (13 years), and know no other ways. I've been brainwashed into believing a lot of misinformation about my options to keep me serving my family.

What you can do differently than me, knowing eventually you'll need help, is to actively learn everything you can about now, while you're healthier, before the shit hits the fan. (My Dad died and my thief Mom has been able to thrive in a fuckton of outright abusive ways. I just want to be independent, but I can't learn everything I've never known overnight. It's f***ing painful.)

Make a guide for yourself of your plans. Have everything in writing. Create a vast support network. Nurture your existing relationships now and create new ones.

Prepare yourself for the possibility that you'll forget your favorite memories. Create things *now* that will jog your brain later, even as your condition worsens.

I was trying to get them to sign a schedule A, pay for my computer certs and a physiatrist eval.

They refused to sign a Schedule A until I completed some course for people w/ID/DD (which I don't have) which bordered on extortion (and which they had told me was a physiatrist eval)  and I suppose operates on a quota or kickback system.

I am very isolated, so I use it as an opportunity to visit.  I've found most everyone enjoys talking and that the more upfront I am about myself and my situation, the more comfortable/helpful/supportive and friendly they are.

2277,"That you can perform limited walking only on some days (and you should go with your lowest estimate here) and you can’t know which days those will be until you wake up in the morning. That a job that expects you to do limited walking, expects you to be able to do that every single time you work, which is impossible. (If there’s a job that allows you to just show up on the occasions when you feel up to it, I haven’t heard of it.) And that even if you could walk every day, the persistent vomiting would still be there. You can’t be a reliable employee if you have to go vomit all the time. I have a bladder disease, and SSA took into consideration that having to go to the bathroom four to six times *per hour* would make it virtually impossible for me to hold onto any job. That wasn’t the sole basis for their decision, but it factored in. 

The SSA is not playing fair with you. They ignored things like the vomiting and the hospitalizations, and cherrypicked one thing you said as a basis for denial. Their goal is not to help you. Their goal is  to turn you down. They have limited funds to go around, so their goal is pretty much to deny everyone. You need to stand up for yourself. When you tell them about the vomiting, describe your worst day. Same with the walking. Describe your worst day. Give the highest number of hospital visits you’ve ever had in one year. Your lawyer will tell you the same. 

The presumption is you’re an adult who needs a job you can support yourself on, including housing and food, clothing and general necessities, transportation, healthcare, and whatever I’ve forgotten to include. That’s what substantial and gainful work means. 

Look, I don’t know if you’ll get approved. But it’s *definitely* worth taking it to a lawyer. If you lose, the lawyer just doesn’t get paid at all; it’s not your problem. It’s how the system works. You might be billed for, like, their photocopy costs, but nothing much. Which is why they’re not going to take the case at all if it’s hopeless.

2301,"If you want to try qualifying for disability based on depression/ IBS: The first thing to do is start compiling a lengthy Medical Record. This is *imperative* for qualifying for SS(d)I, even with an attorney, to have at least a few months of diagnosis/treatment prior to your initial application. If you do not have insurance, inquire at your local Dept. of Human Services for Free Clinic resources in your area. If you have painful or dangerous episodes, go to your local ER... relentlessly, if necessary. There is probably a state-funded mental health clinic that can treat you outpatient if you do not have access to traditional doctors/insurance.   
Once you have your diagnosis/ treatment plan... Follow That Plan as best you can and if it doesn't work, go back to the treating physician. When you are with your doctor, really focus on telling them how your illnesses keep you from performing your Activities of Daily Living (ADLs.) Sometimes you will get referred to physical or vocational therapy to assist with your ADLs. If these therapies work, great... if not, tell your treating physician/therapist you need further accommodation, and why. At this point, you've applied for benefits.  If you have a sufficient medical record, the SSA makes a determination based on your record, if not... you go to a Examining Doctor, who may or may not even specialize in your condition. Probably you will get turned down at initial application level. Get an **attorney** when this happens.  
All throughout your case waiting to appeal/get a hearing... KEEP GOING to the doctor. Really focus on telling them WHAT you can't do, how you compensate, and what (if anything) will make it easier for you. Get as many pages of diagnostic testing and treatment notes into your Medical Record as possible. Do you need the restroom every hour? How long is each trip? Can you *run* to the restroom and back to your workstation? Why not? Have you tried *many* medications for depression? Why didn't they work? So some cause suicidal thoughts and others make you nauseated? These are just examples, but we have to be SPECIFIC when speaking to our doctors to make sure the *right words* get into the Record.   
I'll stop typing for now, but I hope this helps somebody somewhere get the process started.

2307,"My s/o loves to travel and sometimes we do that together. She has to adapt to me a bit, so she can't always do it the way she would like. But many times, she's able to go without me. She used part of her holidays to go to South Korea recently. And while I know she would have a good time with me there with her, I also know she had a pretty amazing time being able to do things and see the country (her first time there) in the way she wanted, without me. And I'm okay with that. 

It's certainly okay to be upset, but I would think most of the upset would come from ""I wish I could do those things with you"" and not ""I wish you didn't want to do those things.""

My partner and I share many common interests, but she has ones, and ways of acting on those interests, that I just can't do. Or, not as well. It would be very cruel of me, IMHO, to be upset in a way that I insisted she alter her life in a big way for me like that. She already goes to great lengths to make this all work (as do I).
