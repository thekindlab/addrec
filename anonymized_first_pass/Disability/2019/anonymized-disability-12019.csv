9," I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I can relate. I was diagnosed with a rare connective tissue disorder in my thirties that had been overlooked my entire life, despite many many symptoms and problems. 

I spent eighteen months in bed reading medical journals trying to figure out what was wrong with me and why nobody took me seriously about my injuries and issues.
 
 I wanted very badly to be wrong about what I discovered. A geneticist confirmed the conclusion I had come to, down to the subtype. Everything made perfect sense now, a kind of weight was lifted, but then I also knew that both of my kids have it, too.

 I try my hardest to be involved with them every day, even if I have to hang out with them in my bed. I worry that they won't be able to do all the things they'll want to in life. But I never tell them that they can't achieve their goals and dreams. My family keeps me going. 

 What little things in life do you still find joy in? Do you ever look out your window at the trees and birds? Do you have any plants inside your room? 

 I've found that greenery is so aesthetic pleasing and plants require so little to thrive. 

Your thoughts, emotions, opinions and experience matter. You've contributed so much by choosing to relate to people. That's beautiful and human. Keep it up.

Once a decision is made they send a letter to the congresspersons office saying “hey we made this decision”.

If Social Security finds that your contribution to the business is SGA, it will find that you are no longer disabled.

Here's the rule for the countable income test: If your countable income is more than $1,220 a month (in 2019), your self-employment will be considered SGA and you will no longer be eligible for benefits, unless you can show you are not providing significant services to your business.

48,"Go to school? Yes, you can! 

You are well below the poverty level so FASFA will pay for it. They will even give you a bit extra to help pay bills. You do have to go full-time though, a minimum of x-amount of credits per term. 

Community colleges will assist you with any issues relating to attending classes and your disability. There are counselors to help with this. 

Attending college does NOT effect your benefits. 

Contact your community college. Just get the ball rolling, it really isn't too hard, they will assist you. 
I applied online first thing. They ask in the application if you are disabled and also provide info about applying for the grant money.

49,"I am in the post-discharge monitoring period after having my loans discharged in 2017. You can apply without even being eligible for SSDI or SSI, though a doctor has to complete forms certifying your disability.  If your disability review schedule is less than 5-7 years, then your doctor also has to fill out this form.   After you are approved for discharge, you go into a three year monitoring period where you are able to earn from work no more than the federal poverty level for a household of two.  Your benefits or other passive income are not counted toward this limit, only income from work. You certify your work status and income each year. After three years of monitoring, your loans are permanently discharged.

There really is a general attitude that if you have a disability, you are non sexual. Sex is somehow out of your expected life experience and somehow you won't desire sex. (that is an example of infantilization I referred to earlier.)

I don't know if other associations and communities try to fill that gap. There are tons of disabilities that don't have an association or community to fill in the gaps.

You are so close to graduating!  If your VR counselor thinks you can do it, please try.  There are two reasons.  The first is that you will have an accomplishment that will make you feel good about yourself.  The second reason is that it will help you if you pursue a career.  As to the career, if your Voc Rehab counselor can't do career guidance/planning, call your State's Employment Department.

You have 3 chances to apply. You do it once with enough work credits and doctors saying you can no longer work, if you get denied then you only have 60 days to request a reconsideration. After that, if you get denied again, you have to ask for a hearing which can take +2 yrs for it to happen. If denied again, another year or so at appeals, if its remanded back to a judge, another year or 2 until another hearing. Sometimes a long process. Been helping people get on Ssd A few yrs now.

Then I got to 6th grade and it really progressed and I needed more than just a language disorder diagnoses and ADD diagnoses.

122,"I have lived in neighborhoods with an HOA and ones without.
The advantage of an HOA is that my neighbor cannot paint his house purple with pink polka-dots.
The disadvantage is that I can't either.

There are others in the neighborhood who can't mow their lawns or maintain their yards. (elderly people, those who are too busy, those who are out of town for extended periods, etc.) For all of those, there are landscaping companies or individuals who provide that service. In some cases, the HOA provides the service (and includes the price in the dues). For all others, you contract with the individual or company directly.

Most likely, there is no rule that you must maintain your yard. The rule is that your yard must be maintained (by someone). You agreed to that covenant (rule) when you bought the house. If you don't like it, you should sell your house and move. However, HOA or not, if you live in a house with a yard your neighbors will expect your yard to be properly maintained. There are apartments and condos without yards if you don't want to have someone maintain the yard.

He's pretty sure EEG would be the most difficult to pull off, lots of time and lots of training and who knows how effective  it would be. But a combination of voice commands and eye tracking could be really effective, and really convenient and really achievable. I personally wouldn't want to use a remote control, unless I can get the drone to bring the remote to me without having it in my hand.

Now on the side note. Medicare only pays 80% of your visit and what it sounds like is happening is your paying the other 20%.  From your description it doesn't sound like you have a supplement plan.  

I forgot if you mentioned when your medicare started, but their is a specific supplement I pay 125 a month with no deductibles or co pays.  You are only able to sign up for that the first 6 months of being approved for medicare or not again until the age of 65. That's beneficial if like me you have a few doctors appointments a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

Very stressful

Very long hours

Running a small business is very, very tough. You need to be cut out for it to make a go of things, and hard business skills are more or less essential.

What if they need to film the parts before an accident? then they need an able-bodied version of him.

Of course, it takes an able-bodied person (or at least one who can easily stand and walk) to put the chair on and off the carrier, fold up the ramp, etc.  *sigh*  Oh -- and it got stolen off the back of our car.

Now we've just got a drive-in van, where the ramp comes out the side.  They make those with hand controls and such, where the wheelchair user can actually drive themselves.  If possible check out the company United Access, and see what kinds of things they offer.

I'm weirdly fortunate that I've been disabled my entire life. I've never known life without pain and limitations. My condition (connective tissue disorder with mild dwarfism that also impacts...well most everything) is degenerative and has been getting slowly worse -- but it will not kill me. I do  know what it is like to not be able to do what I once could and to know that I will never regain what I had and it can be horribly depressing. I want you to know it is ok to feel down and angry sometimes. Too many people take the whole positive thinking thing too far and suppress emotions that are bound to come out as stress.   


The key is going to be finding new dreams, new goals. Those goals may seem smaller and less grand, but they are no less worthy.  Know that whatever you do workwise/school wise, you have the chance to touch other people's lives. I don't mean by being a living example to put on a pedestal (that can suck). I mean by being a good human being doing small good things for others you spread goodness.  Small things can have an amazingly big impact.  I do most of my good virtually (due to limitations and getting sick ridiculously easily).  But I'm told that running an online support group is still helping others.    


You can still be passionate about ideas and issues.  For example, there is so much that can still be done politically/activist/educational from home as far as ringing those phones and writing those letters.  \*Most\* people will not do anything grand, even if they live til 100.  Sometimes our little lives are where we live.  Sometimes I have to stop being politically active because my life needs attention.

311,"After I got divorced, I spent a few years on various dating apps. In my info I wrote straight out, that I was in a wheelchair and why. Like that, it was kinda out there. I did go on a few dates via those apps,- I also got very bizarre offers such as ""I will pay you to drive over my naked body""-kinda stuff. After dating via apps for some years, I kinda gave up on it. It seems shallow and very superficial. It feels like most people are just looking to get laid for the evening and I have never been into one-night stands.  


After a year more or so of being single, I decided that I was better off alone. And then I spent even more of my spare time playing computer. I played Guild Wars 2 and a guy there started to talk to me. He was 10 years younger than me and from Poland and I'm in Denmark, so I never considered him as a possible partner at this time, just one of the ""gaming guys"". He was very sweet and annoying the fun way and made me smile all the time. We spent more and more time playing together and at some point we started flirting a bit. I kinda went into panic and one evening, I decided to tell him. Up until this point, we had never spoken about ""that kind of stuff"", but I felt, that our friendship and situation was about to either go down the love road or the opposite, so I knew I had to let him know. So I told him. His response was: ""Erhm... I also have something to tell you \*pause\* I'm wearing bracers!"" I had no idea why he mentioned it like that. Like it was the same as being in a wheelchair because of Muscular dystrophy! I ended up laughing and he did too. Apparently he didn't care about my wheelchair, because he continued to flirt with me and we started to talk on Skype while we were playing, and after a few more weeks, I said to him: ""We either need to stop this, or you have to come to Denmark to see me"". The weekend after I picked him up in the airport and even in the actual airport right as he saw me and came walking to me, he stopped in front of me knelt down in front of me, gave me a huge hug and kissed me. I was blown away and we had a long distance relationship for 1½ year or so and then he moved to Denmark and we have now been together over 6 years.  


Afterwards I did ask him why he mentioned his bracers, and apparently he said it, because he thought it would make me feel less bad to tell about the wheelchair. He is wonderful and I can never imagine being with anyone but him.

The second item sounds like it can at least partially be attributed to roommate stuff. It is always hard to share living space and these things are best to be brought up during a house meeting or similar.

It's bad enough that Medicare funds are being drained faster than what it takes in, just like the social security system, which is also being depleted. 

You also need to factor in our medical staff is undermanned. Even in the medical field, which provides better paying jobs isn't staffed well enough for the demand even those care costs is so high. Jobs will be even harder to fill when lower pay is offered for all these proposed positions to fill. Take my region for example, over 850,000+ population and there's only 3 pain management clinics that can prescribe opioid rx's, they're packed to the gills with patients, yet there's no one else opening shop to fill the market even though it's an easy profit, and the several other management clinics are too afraid because of the opioid epidemic brought to you by the same government that you want to have  socialized medical care from.

I get it, a socialized system sounds great in theory but, it's just a theory and more socialized systems don't really work well because we don't live in a perfect world. As it is right now people that are on disability and have Medicare can walk right in and get an x-ray, under socialized plans, it's already proven that'll take months to get anything that's above remedial care, that's the problem when everybody's waiting in line.

Forcing for profit systems in an already troubled field without any plan to cover every base is a horrible idea, even here there's no evidence brought at all that says how it's going to work, except for new taxes being distributed to cover some of the costs. Concepts blurted from candidates, like bernie, that want political gain hardly show any real plan to execute their idea because they haven't gotten past the win stage.

Furthermore having the government regulate another sector it's just not good, it's already bad in many other sectors, how much worst you think it's going to be when they regulate the end-user, it's bad enough that countries that already have socialized medicine force their users to wait extended times to go in for visits or even worse, deny care because you don't have a good enough reason under their definition.

What I can say is it's okay to be angry. You're probably going through the stages of grief right now and that's a roller coaster. Your feelings, whatever they are, are valid.

It sounds like you still want to ""do things"" with your life. That can, of course, mean very different things to different people, but it sounds to me like you want to achieve a a goal society deems ""big"".

Some ways you could still do that without too much stress or activity are :
Write a book; Start a kick starter to fundraise for a cause you believe in; Be a social media coordinator, maybe even for a campaign; Freelance write articles (I used to do this) for magazines, newspapers, etc; Get TEFL certified and teach English online; Write a blog raising awareness about the subject of your choice

Those are all the ones that popped to mind off hand, but there are most definitely a lot more! I know this is only one tiny slice of your concerns, but it's something.

381,"Ok, so I have Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and everything that could have gone bad has gone bad.

In May 2015 (I was 29 at the time) I was admitted to the hospital because of low blood pressure because I was bleeding into my lungs. While I was in the hospital, and before I was diagnosed, the illness started to attack my kidneys. I was in the ICU for a week, had ~1L of blood drained from my lungs (at least that's what my mom said) and had a week's treatment of plasmapheresis. To get the illness under control I was infused 1200mg of prednisone for a week. But I survived.

For a year+ I was on 100mg of oral prednisone and Cyclophosphamide, which didn't work at all and I had another bad relapse in 2016 and had to spend a week in hospital where I started my Methotrexate and Rituxan treatment, but was able to bring down my prednisone to only 5mg

I now have Rituxan infusions done every 6mths for the inevitable future 

However the prednisone did its damage and I contracted Avascular Necrosis in BOTH of my knees (this is so incredibly rare) so I spent the rest of 2016 and all of 2017 in a wheelchair. But by 2018 I was able to get out of the wheelchair, with lingering knee pain, and able to walk around!

In June 2018 my body started to negatively react to the Methotrexate so I was forced to stop taking it. My doctor then tried to lower my prednisone to 4mg but I had a very small relapse so I quickly went back to 5mg and all is well. Relatively

The reason I sharing my story is because my life isn't all doom and gloom, things will get better for you just as things are finally getting better for me. Wegener's isn't the death sentence it once was, in fact the doctor in the ICU back in 2015 flat out said if this happened 2yrs ago, 2013, I would have probably died because they would have had no idea how to treat.

414,"No. The only way that I would take any insta-cure med would be if it only rid me of particular symptoms...if I could pick and choose which ones to drop. For example, there is no scenario where I can use my degree of sensitivity to loud public places to my advantage. Nor is there a time where I could really use a mute episode. 

The reason I wouldn't want a total cure is simple. Autism is a part of me. It has shaped parts of my personality and I wouldn't be nearly the same without it. I don't see autism as an ""all bad"" thing. Hell, what would this world be like if there had never been any autistic people in it? And I'm not just talking about the super intelligent savant-types either. We all have something to bring to the table, just as much as anyone else. We all have the good and bad in us, but its just a different kind of good and bad than what the general population deals with. 

I'm starting to rant. But I really wouldn't want a cure. I wouldn't have my many shortfalls, true, but I feel like it would just be trading in what I do have for a whole other set of potential problems.

the new ICD-10 code for FSHD is…

The new ICD-10 code for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is **G71.02.** 

The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (**ICD**\-10-CM) is a system used by physicians and other healthcare providers to classify and code all diagnoses, symptoms and procedures recorded in conjunction with hospital care in the United States.

Codification means a disease is assigned an individual code so that it can be easily recognized within a health information system.

Assigning an individual ICD 10 codes for FSHD will:

* facilitate the surveillance of FSHD;
* will allow more accurate estimates of the condition’s incidence, prevalence, and survivorship;
* allow for tracking of mortality and its causes, injuries, symptoms, and health visits;
* help to identify factors that influence health status and secondary conditions;
* be used to compare health information and outcomes across hospitals, regions, clinical settings, countries, and even across time in a given location;
* serve to track reimbursements;
* facilitate the evaluation of guidelines (implementation, adherence, and impact).

And – at a time when therapeutic treatments for the specific forms of muscular dystrophy are being approved for the first time in history – the ICD codes will enable health information systems to identify patients eligible for these therapies, evaluate the impact of those therapies over time, and ultimately improve quality and quantity of life for those living with FSHD.

435,"If you've been denied by 2 judges, with lawyers each time, that suggests is an issue of documentation. 

Have you gotten a copy of your medical records and reviewed them? Incomplete or inconsistent records can easily sway a case. How much a doctor documents (and the way they say it) is important. If you don't have copies of your records, you can request a CD copy of your file from SSA that will have everything. 

The other factor to consider is *how much* and *what type* of treatment you are getting. Just seeing someone once a month isn't going to cut it. Not taking/refusing medication or other treatments also looks bad. Essentially you have to show SSA that you've tried **everything** and your condition is still disabling. 

There is also the possibility that your condition is just not serious enough to warrant disability. At the ALJ level, the approval rate is about 60%. They roll over medical records and other evidence from claim to claim when you refile, so the second decision had all the information as the first as well (more records increases chances).  The disability criteria is strict, and although a person may feel they are disabled and struggle with their illnesses, it isn't enough. 

As for where you go from here - the #1 priority needs to be your health. Focus on getting treatment and doing what you can to get better. If you do that, the medical records will show it.

You can start the application online, fill out the forms, and obtain your own medical records and take them to the local SSA office to be scanned in to your file.  As you continue receiving care, submit those records to your examiner. Don't be afraid to call about once every 45 days and inquire if they have everything they need.  

An issue popped up in my case. I am legally blind, which meets a disability listing and should have been automatically approved.  However, a vital medical record got missed during my case review and I was initially denied.  My lawyer said to immediately appeal.  Thanks to the advice I received from some of our awesome fellow redditors, I called my disability examiner's supervisor and made my issue known.  They found the record and decided that they had indeed made a mistake and reopened my case.  Two weeks later, I was approved.

I cannot allow myself to think too much about everything I've lost because it's overwhelming and I spiral into dangerous spaces that I don't really have the luxury of time to indulge. I feel the unfairness and it's agonizing but it also simplifies my choices. I can only do as much as I can for as long as I can and the precious moments that I do have are focused on what brings beauty to my life, what brings me joy and what is meaningful to me.

I couldn't stand at the sink to brush them properly, so I was only able to dry brush once in a while. It would have been worse, but not eating actually saved the teeth to some degree-- they were less dirty so didn't get as much bacteria.

530,"I started losing my hearing in my early 20's.  I imagine it's harder for you as a younger person, but it gets much better with age. By my late 30's, I was 60-70% deaf in both ears.  Unlike most hearing loss, I lost the spoken tones first.  I'm at about 80% hearing loss now.

I fought getting hearing aids as I didn't want to admit it was that bad, but it started affecting my ability to perform my job and I finally gave in around 30 years old.  

I have found that if I am up front with people about my hearing loss, they are generally very nice about making sure I am understanding the conversation.  I let them know that if I don't respond or say the wrong thing, it's likely I misunderstood/didn't hear. 

I have learned to lip read over the years and that, along with context really help me follow along.  

Yes, the more people there are, the harder it is.  I generally sit next to someone who I know or who seems nice and let them know I am hearing impaired and they clue me in if I miss something in the group speak.

I often repeat back what I think people have said if I don't quite get it to clarify and it more than often ends up in hilarity... And they correct whatever I misheard. 

The hardest part was figuring out how to work it into my job as I was often in large conference rooms with 20-30 people and it could get loud.  Fortunatley, there are wonderful assistive devices now and I was able to get a few Bluetooth speakers to put around the room that would connect into my hearing aids and help me hear everyone better. It wasn't perfect and I still missed some things, but it certainly was good enough.

Good hearing aids can also connect into ""loop"" systems at theaters and events that use advanced sound systems.  Also, they can have different programs suited to a restaurant environment, area with background music, or one on one/small group settings.

I'd also suggest talking with a therapist that specializes in helping someone cope with hearing loss as they will have more tools to help you specifically. 

We are now learning sign language as I too will be completely deaf one day.  However, crazy as this is... I am also learning to speak German as my daughter's fiance and his family speak Deutsche. Nuts, right? 

Deaf lady learning German... it's fun and they are helping me learn to understand them and reproduce their sounds. It's definitely wayyy more work and I don't expect to master the language, I just need to be able to do some basic communicating and lip reading. 

Hang in there. It'll be okay. The sooner you embrace it and make it part of you, the better it'll get.

559,"I'm sorry you lost your previous job. I would have thought they would be more accomodating considering they knew you before accomodations were necessary. Not a classy move on their part.

With new retail hires, planning for/offering accomodations tends to be difficult. Because of the physical nature of corporate retail positions and the breadth of essential job functions, not many accomodations can be made upfront. People who need to sit often can't bend, walk briskly from one end of the store to the other, etc. Too many accomodations can put a lot of additional work on other members of the team which isn't fair or sustainable long term. If you need to sit, I could also see them worrying that you cannot preform other essential functions and not want to hire you just to have you quit or refuse to do other portions of the job. It isn't personal, I've witnessed attempted hires with accomodations go south fast. They could have been seriously burned by past employees.

You might have good luck with teller positions. Usually banks will allow and/or provide stools. Likewise, the little desks where they open accounts pay well and also allow for sitting. There are also call center positions that pay well and have all employees at desks.

If banking isnt your thing, small family owned retail shops could be a great place to check. Boutiques are generally much more employee friendly in regards to reasonable accomodations because they are smaller and the work is less physically demanding/fast paced. Many automatically provide cashier seating.

Hotel front desk positions might also be a good position with reasonable pay if they are available. I've seen many places provide staff seating and I've heard good things from friends at those types of jobs.

I would highly recommend steering clear of restaurants, super markets, or small family owned food joints.

572,"Thanks for the info. I’ve tried so much stuff. It’s not like I did therapy for a year and said “I’m depressed, I can’t work.” I’ve tried over 20 different medications over the years. I’ve spent years in therapy and continue to go. I’ve been admitted to an intensive outpatient program 3 times as an adult and once as a teen. I had the same judge for both appeals unfortunately. Apparently my previous psychiatrist had conflicting things in my reports and when I asked her to write a detailed letter for my appeal she didn’t put any detail and said basically that the info is in my medical records. It just doesn’t make sense to me why the person from Social Security who was at my appeal said he would have approved me if it had been up to him, but I’m not “bad enough” according to this judge. It honestly makes my suicidal thoughts worse with every denial and I don’t know what to do. This isn’t at all how I wanted or planned my life to be and it feels like such a slap in the face when they come back claiming my issues aren’t severe enough.

573,"Full time powerchair user, but can walk a couple steps.

&gt; Do you use a wheelchair footmuff/leg warmer? 

Nah. I've never heard of this term for it, but I've seen the concept before.

&gt; If no, why don't you use one?

It would limit my mobility, since I use my legs for things (like holding doors open, standing, etc). It looks like it would impair using my lap, too, what with it being covered in excess fabric; and I use my lap a lot, so that's an automatic no. And I wouldn't want to sit on it all day, or get up and down to take it off during errands (doing a jacket is enough of a task). And if it's not long enough to be sat on, then how would it stay up/on, without something obvious like an outside velcro strap?

&gt; Do you wish you could, but you don't like the look/design?

Well, I very much don't like the design. It has too many negative connotations for me, like use for a nursing home or 'adult daycare.' And I can't help feeling like it's basically a straight-jacket for legs. I don't even have an interest in fashion, but some things (such as this, and ponchos) make me feel like even my clothes are patronizing me, and people themselves are patronizing enough as-is. It would have to look/be very ""adult"" for me to consider one - which again would be tough because I'm tiny and it's likely no one would make that in my size... 

&gt; What would make you use one? 

I guess I'd consider using one if I knew I would be outside *all day* in very cold weather, doing nothing but wandering around or something. Like at a park or outdoor museum. Don't get me wrong, I see the benefits, and one of my biggest problems in winter is my legs - not feet - are always cold (almost painfully so), but the negatives outweigh them as they (commonly) are.",,,,kikellea,,,1546461095,t5_2qhe8,t3_absnmb,t3_absnmb,1,1550785268,0,0,ed3mdku,disability,,,,,
574,"It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. And I had completely the wrong impression of it. The PT who did the test wast trying to push me to my limit, because that’s now what people do everyday at a job. Besides, I failed most of the tests. For instance, I was supposed to walk a mile at 2 mph. I walked less that .1 mile befor I was limping too much to continue. He had me repeat a few tests, once at the beginning before I was worn out, then at the end when I was exhausted. My fine motor skills were terrible, gross motor was almost as bad. I can’t balance, can’t stand, sit, walk. I think overall it will seriously help the hearing. I have invisible disabilities. This gives me empirical evidence that shows how limited I am. 

It was also very eye opening to see how disabled I am. Its so easy to focus on simple pain and fatigue without seeing all the details. It’s been a lot to come to terms with. And physically, I’m still struggling to recover. I was completely nonfunctional for about two days. I’m back to my normal routine, but everything is still much harder than usual.

* Depression

I'm here to make two observations:

1. I'm NOT a doctor, but it's POSSIBLE that all of your symptoms are related. If your biggest problem is your EDS, consider consulting a sleep physician. Maybe a neurologist specializing in sleep medicine because they'll also be knowledgeable about your seizures.
2. You CAN get disability for the things you're suffering from. If you can't work and at least one doctor is willing to testify to that, you can absolutely get disability. I'm living proof.

The 2 big questions - are you on SSI or SSDI? how much money are you earning with your job?

Whether you are on SSI or SSDI, the current SGA amount is $1,200/mo (gross, not net).  

So as long as you are making under this amount, they won't cease your benefits. However, if you are on SSI, your check will be reduced 2:1 for what you make over $65.  Your SSDI check will always remain the same. 

If you are on SSDI, your benefits will not just be ceased if you work over $1,200. Each person gets 9 non-consecutive months to earn over SGA without it affecting their benefits. After that, anytime you earn over SGA you won't be due a check that month. If you go a certain amount of time working over SGA (I don't know how long it is) they will eventually cease your benefits.

659,"It makes sense really. I'm not saying it's a good thing, just that the reason behind it isn't malicious, and is sound if you ignore the social ramifications.

Like it or not, movies are an art form supported by profit. It takes a decent sized crew, a cast, set and props, etc. The only way for those things to be together is to pay people. The only way currently that can pay that much at once is established studios. Those studios have to  turn a profit.

Casting is both a major expense and a key factor in successfully drawing viewers.

As such, the lead performers *have* to have the ability to put butts in seats.

The more profound the disability, the fewer roles are going to be possible. You can't sub in a paraplegic in Tom Cruise's mission impossible role.  So the chances of a disabled actor having enough success to draw viewers is lower. This in turn makes them less likely to get roles they would otherwise be right for.

It sucks, but that is the the essence of it.

But there's another factor that isn't as obvious. Insurance. All films have some degree of it, and the requirements for it are strict. You don't hear about it much, but very often there's someone on set representing the insurer.  The more an actor is on screen, the more possible it becomes that they would run afoul of restrictions. 

It happens in tv as well. Watch some mythbusters and they're pretty open about being unable to do some stunts and tests because they'd violate the policy in place. Movies have similar problems.

A disability just adds to the complexity of that and drives up the cost for the film.

Again, it sucks. But it is a contributing factor.

Then you run into individual issues. Disability of any kind comes with problems to overcome. Shutting down a set while the lead deals with spasms isn't ideal. The rigors of catheterization, medications,  position changes, dysreflexia, bowel programs, and all the other crap a person has to deal with are *major* problems while trying to film. It can certainly be done, but it increases cost and time. With shooting schedules being tight, a fifteen minute delay can ruin a day of shooting. 

And you can't forget that even mild disability comes with truly bad days. Every actor would have some, but a disabled actor is likely to have more of them. Delays cost. Unions have very tight rules about workers getting paid and overtime. An actor that *might* cost an extra twenty thousand because they needed time to deal with a leaky colostomy bag isn't going to be considered as useful as one without.

It sucks, but it makes sense.

I used to do a bit of community theater before I became disabled. Even at that level of production, you could spend hours every evening rehearsing. Now, if I'm on my feet for more than twenty minutes, my leg goes numb. How the heck would that work out trying to rehearse? The role of ""dude with a walker"" comes with extended work. Work I can't do. The level of accommodation I'd need to be able to make it to opening night would make getting there take at least twice as long.

For community theater, that isn't impossible because the crew tends to be volunteers anyway. So they might be willing to spend the extra time every single rehearsal. But it would mean they'd be wasting their time waiting for me. Five minutes here, five minutes there, and now they end up getting home a half hour later every night. That's less sleep for work the next day, time they didn't get to spend on other things. All so one disabled dude can participate.

On that scale, it can still work because profit isn't a factor.

But a movie can't afford the cost, or it'll never get made.

I have worked 40 hour a week jobs but have issues with management at times because I cannot just sit in a chair for hours on end. I have to get up and move usually after 2 hours. The end of the day is when I need to move the most due to compression issues. 
I even tried to go part time and I was a barista and eventual shift manager at a Starbucks. I loved it but had an issue with some lazy coworkers who did not carry their weight nor do their jobs. It made my job that much harder because I had to clean up after them. We had random health inspections and I will be damned if I don't pass. Unfortunately, it wore me down too much. I had to leave. It was a very hard decision but when I came home, I was exhausted and spent. 
I am told that because I have red hair, I handle pain differently. I do know my threshold is higher than many. My doctors have noted that. I found that staying active works best for me. 
I have a great intellect and have won many awards for my work. I just usually end up dealing with some person who does NOT want to give me the protections having a disability entails. Despite having doctors notes and the whole deal. *sigh*

I live in the states and have Universal Health Care it's one less thing to worry about

Unfortunately I enjoy MJ and that sucks up all of my extra money. effectively I'm a shut-in between November and March. When the white plague descends upon us. Unfortunately this past summer the home health aid who had been here for a year and a half decided to seek other employment and my insurance was unable to replace him I had to go into an assisted living facility where I stayed for 90 days. It was chance that I ran across the gentleman I did. Unfortunately it turned out he has chemical dependency issues he's a user and abuser of people and substances. I decided after his first betrayal of my trust that I didn't want him to be the aid and resigned myself to living in the facility. After a series of posts on Facebook cataloging the deficiencies of the facility his girlfriend volunteered to take care of me at my apartment for free until they secured there home aide certification numbers. What ended up happening is the girlfriend had an old knee injury flare up and she was effectively no longer going to take care of me. Making me fall back on the crackhead as my only help. He steals little things here and there. But he does show up to wipe my ass and get me out of bed. 

I live in a college town but it's far enough away from a major population Center for there to be a drought of caretakers. I think about ways to kill myself a lot. I've got about 5 years before I lose the rest of the mobility in my arms and won't be able to pull the trigger anymore. My 3-year plan is to move to the state capitol a much more metropolitan area and guaranteed to have services for someone in my condition. But the prospect of living as a quad for the next 20 years at the mercy of morons does not appeal to me. I think about driving my chair out to the highway and dodging in front of a semi. Unfortunately I don't have the courage to do it. Due to my smoking habits I don't have any extra money to participate in society. I stay inside at my battle station playing DotA poorly. I know we are on the cusp of advancements in science that have the possibility of helping my condition but it's really just an optimist hope no more substantial than a fart.

711,"I'm so sorry you're having a rough time.
Ableism sucks and people generally cannot control the urge to stare and wonder.

I was diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder about three years ago. I spent eighteen months in bed, unable to do much of anything because of the pain. I researched all of the weird symptoms I had and starting putting the pieces together. I saw a geneticist and hoped I was wrong about the conclusion I came to. I got it right, all the way down to the subtype.
It never felt so bad to be right!

I've struggled a lot with feelings of anger about being abused as a child, about being denied medical care and being called a liar.

I was adopted by my father, who had a chronic illness and he treated me terribly. My half - sister was a golden child and I had to look after her because of her genetic condition. It was cruel and unfair.

Have you looked for any online support groups for your diagnosis? I actually made friends with someone in my neighborhood who has the same condition I do. It's rare to find people who understand what I'm talking about, let alone understand what is like to live like this. The hardest part is that I had two children before I was diagnosed. They both have the condition as well.

My terrible upbringing have me great insight, however, and I am able to recognize symptoms in my children and help when they need it. I always take them seriously about pain or being tired. I help them with mobility and we modify things for fine motor ease.

The world is unfairly difficult for disabled people, but we are tough and smart and resilient! We are powerful advocate for our health and refuse poor medical advice and care. The most empowering thing I've found is learning our rights through the Americans with Disabilities act! I contribute to online reviews like Google maps and yelp regarding accessibility in business and parks, stores, grocery, etc.

Keep your mind busy and learn as much as you can until the day you die. You can experience so much of the world that was previously unreachable by way of the internet. We're so lucky we weren't living this way a hundred years ago!

Again. False. When you are on SSI you can have 1 car and 1 house that are excluded from your asset calculation.

Unsolicited advice that is completely optional to read and obviously optional to acknowledge or like or anything:

It may be worth while to have a conversation about where you two are relationship wise. Like is he happy being with you otherwise or is he potentially sticking around for other reasons (don’t think about that too much though). Relationships, as you know, are sometimes rough. But it sounds like he really cares for you. 

It may be helpful to discuss how things can be switched around in the house to make things easier. It could be as simple as having a cooler or one of those mini fridges in your room or somewhere upstairs depending on your layout. That way, he could load it up once or twice a week, or whatever, and you’d be able to have access to drinks, snacks, etc. Maybe a bowl on top for dry snacks or fruit, depending on your dietary needs. If a cold storage thing isn’t an option, maybe just some snacks or dry goods somewhere upstairs. 
Although it may seem simple, it would allow you to have some type of independence and if he gets stressed about you eating, that would help that situation, too. 
I’m all about finding creative/nonconventional ways to work with disability. 
The best deals on mini fridges are usually around back to school and Black Friday. Coolers will probably be coming out on sale soonish, I would think.

He signed up for free soccer on weekends, got a gym membership at a rock climbing facility, started movie nights with the boys with a beer afterwards, etc. This made such a great impact on my husband that I no longer felt like I was holding him back or making him feel guilty for going out without me. Now no one wants to be the one left at home while the other is out having fun, but his health is just as important as mine.

795," The new ICD-10 code for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is **G71.02.** 

The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (**ICD**\-10-CM) is a system used by physicians and other healthcare providers to classify and code all diagnoses, symptoms and procedures recorded in conjunction with hospital care in the United States.

Codification means a disease is assigned an individual code so that it can be easily recognized within a health information system.

Assigning an individual ICD 10 codes for FSHD will:

* facilitate the surveillance of FSHD;
* will allow more accurate estimates of the condition’s incidence, prevalence, and survivorship;
* allow for tracking of mortality and its causes, injuries, symptoms, and health visits;
* help to identify factors that influence health status and secondary conditions;
* be used to compare health information and outcomes across hospitals, regions, clinical settings, countries, and even across time in a given location;
* serve to track reimbursements;
* facilitate the evaluation of guidelines (implementation, adherence, and impact).

And – at a time when therapeutic treatments for the specific forms of muscular dystrophy are being approved for the first time in history – the ICD codes will enable health information systems to identify patients eligible for these therapies, evaluate the impact of those therapies over time, and ultimately improve quality and quantity of life for those living with FSHD.

804,"Strongly agree with everything /u/lostinalphabetsoup said. Tailoring is the way to go as so many clothes look rubbish on a seated frame. I use a manual and find that many tops are too tight in the arms, if I go a size up they look baggy everywhere else. I wear a lot of sleeveless top/floaty scarf/blazer combos which is smart and comfy, though remember if it gets warm and you remove your blazer you'll have to be comfortable with bare arms. Agree with many to get a short blazer in a neutral colour and get it tailored, if you go to an independent seamstress/tailor it's not expensive. If a formal environment or you will be sitting in on formal meetings, a couple of smart blouses too. More casual environment, tops and cardigans are fine and there are enough options you should be able to buy something off the rack. Peplums are great as are the similar style that flows from right under the bust. If your boobs stick out further than your belly, the loose fit style of blouse popular at the moment is good, just long enough to end at your thighs. It'll skim over your boobs and hang nicely. 

Trousers are easier, there are lots of stretchy options out there that look smart. Go for a high waist/use a belt if you lean forward a lot, or wear a long top untucked so you're not flashing your bum. If you're worried about the noodle legs you can go for trousers with a straight cut (flowy at the bottom) or balance fitted pairs with a pair of long boots. Be careful of the heel height on shoes if you have a fixed footplate so it doesn't raise your knees up too high, it looks crap and depending on your disability might end you with sore knees/hips at the end of the day. If you use a cath bag, I find straight trousers with a semi-thick fabric to be the most forgiving to both the taped tube and hiding the bag along your calf. I'd skip the skirts, with work-appropriate options you'll spend way too much time wondering if you're accidentally flashing someone. 

Definitely consider your cleavage, remember everyone is going to be looking down to speak to you so you don't have the leeway of a standing woman. Neckline  against the skin. Remember your hair for the same reason. Accessories are good. Get a bag that isn't a rucksack if you have to carry a lot of stuff. I have one that attaches to my backbar so I don't have to balance it on my lap while pushing, and a very small lap bag for my purse/phone/keys. My large bag was from TKMAXX, they have a lot of unusual bags which can be better for chairs!

Also make sure your wheelchair is *clean*, it doesn't have to be factory perfect and of course it'll pick things up traveling, but a basic wipe down in the evening to make sure you're not presenting a frame covered in mud is sensible.

And have fun! While a professional outer is important, the people you work with will remember you and what you contributed more than exactly what you wore.

852,"Yo. There's no harm in trying!

 It depends a little on your location and government. I have Syringomyelia with no Chiari, but have met alot of people who have it.

It truly depends on the severity of the physical symptoms (or I guess you could say what those symptoms cause). I tried to go for disability and they asked me questions like: ""do you need to use the hand rail when walking up steps, if you don't use the rail, would you fall?"" or ""do you fall/trip often"" and things like that. How your everyday life is impacted.

Where I live (Aus) you need solid diagnosis to even try to apply. So if you want to include your mental health, you would probably need to at least see a psychologist. 

If you haven't already, you should join any kind of group (whether on Facebook or other) with other people with Chiari, IIH, EDS and SM. I found on on Facebook, but it only generally allows Australians and maybe NZ I think. That way you can talk to people in the same situation as you and they probably have gone through the steps for disability.


There's nothing bad that will happen if you do apply and get knocked back. Honestly if you get knocked back I would suggest applying a second time too.

Since Chiari and IIH are generally pretty invisible, you just need to remember not to sugarcoat your symptoms. Make a list of every single symptom, no matter how insignificant it is. For example, even if they don't effect you too bad, still include them, google Chiari and SM and compare what you feel to symptoms you find, you might realise you have specific symptoms you had just attributed to another.

Crappy fine motor skills,
Wasting muscles in hands, wrists and general weakness.
Numbness,
Unbalanced walking,
Hard to swallow or choking easily,
Sleep disturbances,
Are you tired constantly or sleep terrible? Check out the possibility of having sleep apnea, and add it to the list if you do.
Being dizzy or having bad vision,
Nausea,
Pain and weakness in arms and legs,
Vertigo (and knowing the difference between vertigo and just dizziness),
Vomiting,
Facial twitching,
And the list goes on.

864,"One thing is that not all disabilities are visible. Autoimmune diseases, for example, can be debilitating, but typically go unseen. And for some reason people often assume we’re “faking” or just “feel a little sick.”  For example, I have a couple Autoimmune diseases that make it difficult to walk long distances without the assistance of a cane and in the future, possibly a wheelchair. It can also have a negative affect on my breathing, so i legally qualified for a handicap tag. However, when I go to the store and park in handicap, because I’m young and “look healthy” I often get dirty looks from people, and just today I was followed and berated inside of a target. This person told me that I “don’t deserve to park in that spot” even though I need to. Just because she couldn’t see my disability, she accused me of faking and was unnecessarily rude. She even went as far as telling me that she hopes I get seriously hurt so then I could “rightfully” use the spot. 

I believe all disabilities need better representation in the media, but I would really like to see a disability that isn’t particularly visible in everyday situations.

Also, if you have to provide a replacement rental vehicle, that's going to run you close to $200/day.

Used ones tend to fall into one of three categories: insanely high miles, really old, or very expensive.  At least that's how it seemed back when I bought ours.  We ended up buying a pretty old but very well-maintained one with low miles.  Get it serviced yearly to keep the ramp system in good working conditions.  Best darned purchase ever made.

Just a couple of recommendations (I hope you don't mind), if you can get in touch with other students with a disability who use the support services, ask them if disability services actually provide the support they say they offer. Also, ask what the academics are like at implementing the learning access plan accommodations. If you are on campus and have a physical disability, I recommend checking out how physically accessible the campus is ahead of time.

I say this because the uni I attended, the disability support services lists all the supports they offer but they are terrible at actually supporting students with disability and you have to keep on and on them/chasing things up over and over.

924,"I filed my application online and then my wife and I received some questionnaires regarding my functional capacity in the mail.  We filled them out and submitted them.  As I received care and had tests, we took the documents to the SSA office and had them scanned in to my file.  I would then call my examiner after 10-14 days to confirm receipt.  I’d call about every 45 days to check the status of my case and to see if there were any issues.  

My biggest tip would be to get your records, make copies, and submit them yourself.  That way you know that your examiner has all of your documents and you know what your records say.  And don’t be afraid to communicate with your examiner.  By making sure he or she has everything needed to review your case, you can make things go as smoothly and quickly as possible.  I applied in early April, was denied in early July, and approved in late July after my case was reopened.  There’s a five month benefit waiting period from your disability onset date.

If we actually started investing our money in the American people -- like other countries do in their citizens/workforce to be competitive -- we wouldn't need to reduce benefits at all.
3. Investing in STEM pipelines at public PK-BA is necessary to train our medical workers domestically instead of relying on developing countries like India to indefinitely be brain-draining their physicians to the US.
4. ""Socialized insurance"" is redundant. Even private plans are based on actuarial assessments and pooled risk.
5. From the  accounting perspective of insurance, singlepayer plans in every other developed nation actually do save money while yielding better results. Even Trump admitted this when he praised the Australian system. No perfect world is necessary.
6. By definition, M4A and singlepayer are public goods/services. M4A competes with the existing private extortionists, while singlepayer would directly replace them except for premium/luxury plans, as in the UK.
7. Health care and insurance are some of the most heavily regulated industries and licensed professions in existence already, with good reason. No investor is entitled to profit off of someone else's basic survival, although health care workers of course deserve appropriate compensation.
8. Bernie's M4A pitch is a compromise, as he has advocated for a Scandanavian-style system specifically since the 1970s. Anyone in US public life looking for ""political gain"" doesn't run as an independent democratic socialist for 40 years starting during the Cold War. Bernie strong record as a ranking member on House Veterans Affairs demonstrates his consistency over time. Like him, hate him, or simply disagree, the Senator is indisputably authentic.

955,"I met my now partner on Tinder. We don't really have that much of a romantic story but we have been together for a little under 6 months now and it's been going great: we moved in together 2 months ago and he has now become the official dad to my 2 cats ! 

At first it was really hard for him to know what to do when I was in pain or needed medical attention, but he was eager to learn because he wanted to help me as much as he could without being annoying. So everytime something new came up I told him what was going on, what I was going to do or not do along with what he should do or not do. It wasn't always perfect on the first try, but he's a fast learner and he listens so things are well now. 

Still now we encounter new situations that scare him or make him feel helpless but we always work on that and when I know that he really feels like he should be helping I simply ask for a hug or just take it and for us it works, it makes things easier. 

I sometimes get non-verbal (I suffer from selective mutism) and that's probably the hardest situation we have to face. Thankfully it doesn't happen often but when it does he's often lost because I can not communicate with him and he doesn't know what to do except ask questions or hug me which are both frustrating because he doesn't get an answer and feels like he can't help me get out of that zone. One possible help is sign language, we both learn a few words every week, and these simple words 'eat, drink, bathroom, okay'  are really helpful when I am able to use them.   


I realise that I make him sound like he's almost really taking care of me, but that's not the reality of things. We manage to have a really balanced daily life, we both have chores that match up our capacities, we help each other with simple things and he spends way more time being my lover than he spends being my unofficial carer.

Anyway, that's already too long. I guess all I wanted to say is that love is possible and very much real. I found a man who loves me for who I am, disabilities flaws and all, and that I love with all my heart, all his imperfections and quirks included. 

I consider myself extremely lucky that I met someone so understanding and willing to learn with me how to live with my really recent disabilities.

A. And there are a lot of situations that are dire, but unfortunately common. A lot of people applying (especially for SSI) are in danger of not paying rent. So if 60% of the applicant pool is having the same problem, it’s not really critical but rather the norm. 

A dire needs request doesn’t always result in a faster case processing. It kind of depends on where it is in the process.

i also have bipolar type 2. that one i would probably cure. but i spend about 50% of the year wishing i was dead or having some sort of existential crisis. its just too overwhelming. yeah, i would take that pill... actually i kind of do take that pill. it makes life really dull but at least i can deal with my emotions. i can definitely see why a lot of people go off their meds. mental health disorders make life interesting even if it is painful. everything feels so intense and i can get so passionate. on the pills things get a little bland. but in the end the pills are better.",,,,SecTrono,,,1546928906,t5_2qhe8,t3_adrby2,t3_adrby2,1,1551054947,0,0,edjmj9p,disability,,,,,

I have a condition where my spine/brain disagree about the amount of spinal fluid I need, causing an overabundance. I'm unfortunate in that I had a botched LP and mine moved very quickly, blinding me and causing brain damage, but otherwise, my condition is currently stable.

I was approved right away, due to the spine issues from the botched lumbar puncture, the brain damage from having severely high pressure, and the vision loss.

Other than them wanting more and more paperwork as they kept losing pages, I never had any real issues with getting approved.

If you have a good medical file built up, with proof of attempted treatment and the like, you should be approved fairly quickly.

1086,"Are you currently working? And what is the treatment plan for your stenosis?

All conditions are looked at based on their limitations/symptoms *despite* treatment. So if there are still viable treatment options that you haven't tried, that will factor into the decision.  

There is also the ""12 month"" rule for disability - a person's condition has to have prevent, or expected to prevent them from working for 12 continuous months. So, again if this is a relatively new diagnosis or you have upcoming treatment, they could decide that your condition won't be disabling for a full 12 months. 

People get approved for all hosts of impairments. The diagnosis does not matter, what matters is how the impairment impacts your functioning. Some people with stenosis are approved, and others are not. 

A consult with a disability attorney won't hurt you. If you do decide to go that route, I would recommend meeting with a few attorneys. Some are definitely better than others and all handle cases differently. ",,,,RambleRamble,SSI/SSDI Examiner,,1546438402,t5_2qhe8,t3_abnafa,t3_abnafa,2,1550771889,0,0,ed2tsmb,disability,,,,,

As far as treatment goes, I was just recently diagnosed although the pain has been an issue for a quite awhile now. So treatment as of now is nurontin and Baclofen for the pain, physical therapy for 4-6 weeks, and a referral to a neuro surgeon.

The more treatment that you have tried, the greater your chances of getting disability. If you apply now, the worst that will happen is you are denied and then you can either reapply or appeal.  

As another back-problem sufferer, I feel you pain (pun intended). It probably seems a bit hopeless, and the thought of a degenerative condition sucks, especially if you are young. 

A lot of people over look PT, or don't keep up with it after they stop going to appointments. But flexibility and core strength are going to be vital for you moving forward. It took me a few years to really appreciate it.  The strong muscles will help to better support your back.  I do some light stretching every day, and yoga about 3-4x/week (just at home with an app, nothing crazy). Due to another medical issue, I have been out of my routine for about 3 weeks, and the deconditioning is starting to set in. My pain levels have gone up significantly. 

Neurontin is not a fun drug, but you will eventually get acclimated to it. I took it for years, and every time they increased my dosage I would have a few weeks of those symptoms you describe. There are several drugs in the same family - Neurontin, gabapentin, lyrica, gralise are the ones off the top of my head. If you don't have success with one try a different one. 

Oh, the other big thing is take care of your mental health. Pain can cause depression, and depression makes pain worse. I've had good success taking Wellbutrin - its an antidepressant but is known to help with pain. Cymbalta is another one commonly prescribed. When I started taking it my pain levels did noticeably drop - not sure if the pain is less or I just feel better about it...but it helped. 

Anyway, I know you asked a question about SSDI and I gave you a bunch of unsolicited medical advice. Sorry.

Im not judging OP or their condition, as he/she really did not elaborate on his/her actual disability. I am just saying (as you seem to agree) that if you can play video games with both hands, there really should be no reason that you cant do work that relies on using those same hands. That opens up work in pretty much any field where you sit at a desk and use a keyboard (the majority of jobs these days).

I have perhaps a different perspective on disability than many here in that I am actually significantly disabled but I work full time (was trained into a field I could do by the VA) - so I am of the opinion that many disabled people could indeed work if they were trained into a field that is accommodating of their disability. This retraining is something the government should fund for anyone that is disabled and wishes to do so.

I feel that too many people sell themselves short in life by letting their disability dictate their station in life rather than putting in the effort to work with a career counselor and entering a retraining program too get self sufficient.

Of course, this does not apply to everyone. There are people with profound disabilities that would get in the way of any reasonable type of work - and I am in no way belittling them or calling into question their ability to work.

1168,"TWO?! Shit. The two-person universal law has been instituted.

Let's see if I can put it a slightly different way then. **If** someone has a self-proclaimed ""severe"" mental health condition(s) that they themselves have problems managing (i.e. ""treatment resistant""), then **I'm not sure** it's fair to bring a partner into an actively and emotionally problematic situation, especially if it's so complex that nobody understands it.

If people ""don't understand"" your conditions very well, maybe you should consider what you actually explained to them. Especially before you go putting words in people's mouths when they try to give you advice that you asked for. Goodness.

After 20+ years dating while disabled, I know I still occasionally feel bad about past instances when I put my selfish natural desires in front of other people's feelings and emotional well-being. It was selfish of me because I knew I wasn't emotionally stable during a few of those relationships, and I presented myself and initiated them regardless. Through two decades of experience, it's very easy to see that I shouldn't have been dating at certain times in my life. I made my own problems more difficult to manage, and worse yet, I shed them onto others, and hurt those people. It was all avoidable. I knowingly put myself in those situations, so I can't skate responsibility just because human beings don't think completely rationally during the mating process. It's a shitty thing to do to other human beings.

By the way, you mention a failed relationship, but the reason you gave for the downfall actually had nothing to do with your disability or mental health - or your partner not understanding them. It was about money.",,,,nopovlikemine,,,1546672413,t5_2qhe8,t3_acoi7n,t1_eda4wub,2,1550897473,1,0,edaacg4,disability,,,,,

When people have these overt displays of religousness in the work place IMO its more about ""look at me"" rather than an actual desire to help

I haven't applied for disability benefits and I guess I won't. I'll just continue this pattern of being unable to find and maintain employment because that is my only option. 

I've held 12 jobs since this time in 2014. My mental health is definitely impacting my ability to find work. Employers don't want to hire someone who worked at 3 different jobs in the last half of 2018 (all in a 3 month period with the longest job lasting 3 weeks.)

It's not that I'm UNABLE to work. It's that my mental health is affecting my ability to find and maintain employment.

1228,"One of the things that has helped me the most, and this was even encouraged by my long time therapist is to think about what would be the perfect place for me to work. This includes the type of industry, the hours - large corporation or small family type feel. I have actually been able to procure employment by focusing my efforts in this manner. What ever your stressors and triggers are - you need to find a place that will allow you to work through them. Someone mentioned freelancing below, and that is a great area to try! One thing about freelancing, you will need to market yourself. It will require obedience and I have freelanced in the past, but when I am deep in the throes of depression, not having the ""accountability"" as some of my other jobs with structured hours have - it is not always a good fit for me. If you have that kind of dedication, absolutely, go for it! I do believe that focusing and fine tuning your efforts will positively reinforce your job search. Also, if you look at it accounting wise, you are wasting time trying for positions you are not qualified to do. It is better to invest your time for something that you want to do and to make an amazing cover letter and resume that fine tunes your skills to prove to that employer you have what it takes! Time is our most valuable resource. Say you want to work at a vet's office - look up every vet's office within your area, check out their websites, run some reconnaissance to see who is actively hiring and how you can apply to work there. Look up any sort of extra schooling or training that would be required that can be state sponsored or even an adult enrichment class taught at a local college (they are cheaper than regular classes). Take the time and research how you can be better, take the time and figure out your stressors and triggers so that you can try and actively combat them when they arrive. I have been in years of therapy. It took years for me to find out how my brain twisted things, and I am still learning how to handle my own anxiety. Working on yourself is an ever evolving process. What works when you are 20, may not work when you are older with different stressors, such as a family. Just commit to working on you.

1247,"I was accepted on the first try. But many people aren't. If not, don't get discouraged; just get an attorney and they'll take care of it. Obviously you'll never be rich on disability but anything helps. In Texas it seems the average disability check is around $1,000/month. (I'm not sure if that changes per your location or what.)

Some states have special organizations that help disabled people with medical expenses you can't pay (and sometimes even educational expenses), so look into that as well. (I just got lucky from Google searches. If you're in Texas, pm me and I'll let you know about what I've found here.) 

Also, you can often get scholarships and sometimes even complete funding for college. (I can't work in the same field anymore due to my disability, so I had to go back to school.) Many universities have a disability services center and they're very happy to help you with your accessibility needs.

After 2 years being on disability you'll get switched over to Medicare... Obamacare helped me out until then.  When I got switched over I chose part C. There are some exceptions to the 2 year wait requirement... I think organ failure is one if that applies to you. 

Definitely keep up with medical appointments, therapy, etc. Educate yourself on your conditions, what to expect, etc. That can be hard and make it seem so bleak, but try not to lose hope. It helps to meet fellow patients too. Their experiences will amaze you.

I encourage you to reach out to others who are disabled, even if it's not specific to your disability. It's therapeutic to find others who know what you're going through.

1339,"Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I'm not sure how keeping someone in a vegetative state for over a decade is promoting their dignity.  There is a difference between disability and 'no ability'.

I can't see any positives as a disabled person from working with the pro-life community.  Actually, I would argue that a pro-choice position follows most logically for a disabled person.  I want to be able to make choices about my medical care in all areas, and being able to make those choices promotes my dignity.  I expect to be able to make choices about all of my medical issues, including reproductive health.  It would be awfully hypocritical for me to then say that others should not be able to make choices about their personal reproductive health.

Furthermore, depending on the disability, a pregnancy could be very dangerous or life threatening.  No birth control is 100%, and a disabled person who is unable to carry a pregnancy without harming their health should be able to have healthy sexual relationships just like everyone else.  Many disabled people have less income, to the point that supporting a child would be nearly impossible.  Leaving no option to terminate an unexpected pregnancy is pretty much implying that those individuals shouldn't have sexual relationships, and telling a certain group of people that they shouldn't be able to have the same type of relationship as other people does NOT promote dignity.

I'm disabled.  I've had two successful pregnancies, and have a GREAT high risk doctor.  And if that doctor told me that terminating a pregnancy was necessary to preserve my health/life, then I would terminate.  My children need their mom. 
 Dignity is providing the choice to protect a person's mental, emotional or physical health.

There is nothing dignified about taking away someone's choice to have a medical procedure (termination).

The problem here isn't dignity.  The care of the disabled isn't something that we prioritize as a society, and that means that the caregivers providing for disabled individuals aren't paid enough to attract more qualified staff, as well as enough staff to maintain a more beneficial caregiver to patient ratio.",,,,owlandfinch,,,1547016152,t5_2qhe8,t3_adnchf,t3_adnchf,6,1551099376,0,0,edm9lkj,disability,,,,,

I was first alerted by two different pharmacists of the dangers in the interactions between Ibuprofen\* and my prescription medications (including my intestines bleeding), the second whom suggested I bring this up with my doctor, which I did.

1357,"I don’t think this is “deeply personal” or a question of big pharmaceutical cartels as some people have suggested; it’s just the way medicine works sometimes. Many, many good and worthwhile medications have side effects that can kill you if they aren’t controlled for. The only personal part of the decision is how much risk you want to take, and how much damage you’re okay with your body absorbing today that may require you to take additional meds next year.

There are medications that can be very helpful to us that have very bad side effects. At a very basic level, if you’re on a constant and massive amount of ibuprofen, but you like your stomach to *not* have gaping holes in it, you’ll need to take something to counteract the fact that ibuprofen eats away at your stomach lining. People who have cancer need to take anti-nausea meds with their chemotherapy — when not taking the chemo isn’t an option, you could still die anyway if you aren’t taking the anti-nausea meds and can’t eat/digest.

Medicine basically falls into three categories: killing something in your body, forcing your body to *do* something it *doesn’t* want to, and forcing your body to *not* do something it *does* want to. Whether it’s kill a sickness, make more serotonin, or not feel so much pain, every medication is forcing your body to do something that doesn’t come naturally to it. Our bodies are extremely complex and not 100% understood, so sometimes the *best* way we know to do something still has adverse effects. Hopefully in the future we’ll discover better meds without side effects, but that’s not today.

Sometimes the side effects are on a “wait and see” schedule. I get blood tests to check liver function, etc. annually, and the moment they dip I go on meds for the side effects to avoid literally dying. Other times, the side effects are either so guaranteed or can manifest so quickly and so severely that being on additional meds for those side effects from the outset is the best idea.

So it sounds to me like you need to ask your doctor two things: what side effect this is for, and whether this is preventative, or whether you may have had test results come back that indicate you *need* these meds *now*. If you trust your doctor and they say you need them, take them. If you don’t trust your doctor, find a new one you can trust. The only other alternative is to quit taking the medication that you *know* helps you because it has a side effect that needs to be managed by another medication. In that case you’ll switch to a different med that may not work as well but will very likely eventually have side effects that need to be controlled for anyway.

I’m not saying that endless secondary and tertiary meds to control primary and secondary meds is okay, but one medication to control side effects is completely normal and not anything I would be concerned about.

Edit: To be clear, if this is an issue of controlling for dizziness or fatigue, that can be a personal decision. Typically, though, doctors don’t proactively recommend medication for those types of side effects unless you’re complaining about them, because they are relatively rare. The reason my reply is worded so strongly is because you said your doctor *proactively* told you that you need this new med to control the existing one, which makes me think it’s for something more serious like protecting liver or kidney function (or it’s something you’re already complaining to them about that they’re trying to alleviate for you).",,,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1546963887,t5_2qhe8,t3_adtksa,t3_adtksa,18,1551068591,0,0,edkfpfw,disability,,,,,

I am actively trying to improve my health and drop the frequency/dosage/number of meds I am taking, if at all possible.  I am also looking to replace any I can with something that is less harmful to me.

The accessible changing room at many stores gets used for storage or becomes popular because it’s bigger. Our local beach has an access path halfway down but you can’t reach the water or sand from it. People often park vehicles so they obstruct the sidewalk and no one cares (police). Snow is not promptly removed from public sidewalks even in high traffic areas. Ramps are built at unreasonable angles and called accessible. There is a local restaurant with all booths, no tables available as an option. Handicap accessible bathroom stalls do not always accommodate a wheelchair properly, and I have had to remove leg rests to get in and out or been totally unable to use them.

~ Heavy non-automatic doors in public (restroom doors, restaurant doors, etc.) They're so difficult to push open yourself if they're heavy, as many disabled people lack the core strength to do so.

~ Not enough handicapped parking. Go above the legal requirement. In today's times, our population is aging and even young people have health problems too. 

~ Handicapped parking spots not near the entrance of the place. They'll put them near the wheelchair ramp in the curb, and sometimes that's so far away from the entrance door. Very difficult for those who can't walk far.

~ Public places without wheelchair ramps (apparently there's a loophole somehow).

~ The entrances to places for disabled people very inconvenient (often longer distances). Every time I go to the theater I have to walk twice the distance and enter at the side because I can't walk up stairs to enter at the front. 

~ Stores having few shopping scooters or all the batteries are dead.

~ Any steepness of terrain.

~ Wheelchair ramps or steep sidewalks too steep to roll up myself. If I'm not with a caregiver that day, I have to depend on a kind stranger to push me.

~ Older buildings not up to present-day ADA building code. (Churches especially and particularly tight corridors and not wheelchair-accessible restrooms).

~ Steps/stairs without handrails.

~ Lack of elevators in multi-level buildings/stadiums (or 1 only on one side of a huge building so you have to walk all the way across it to get there). 

~ When no caregivers are allowed to sit with you in handicapped/wheelchair/disabled seating at theaters, stadiums, etc.

~ Rugs are the worst. Tripping hazard and difficult for wheelchairs.

~ Store aisles too cluttered with merchandise to allow a wheelchair to pass. Also, just clearance to maneuver a wheelchair around the store.

~ In large stores, only one set of restrooms is problematic. It'd be ideal to have restrooms at both the front and back. Disability (and even old age) can make it impossible to hold it while you walk all the way across the store to the only restroom at the back.

~ No trashcans in public restroom stalls is annoying. Can't flush used catheters down a toilet, and they're a hassle to hold onto to throw away outside of the stall, as I'm also carrying my assistive devices and medical gear.

~ The baby-changing tray thing in the handicapped stall. Those should be in separate places so the disabled can get to the big restroom stall we need. Time is of the essence for us, and mama shouldn't have to wait on us to change the baby either.

I will add on that while I do not personally require it, almost nowhere in my area is actually wheelchair friendly. If the chair can get to the door, the door is often not wide enough to accommodate or opens in such a way that it is almost impossible to navigate. Or that the building itself might be completely accessible, and they might have the appropriate parking spot but then the slope to get onto the sidewalk is not made wide enough for most wheelchairs.

OP, there a couple of things that jump to my mind immediately, based on my experience. The first is to reach out to your local tenant's rights organization (may take a little Googling, but most places have one). They should be able to put you in contact with attorneys that will be willing to help you pro bono or for a reduced fee, although based on your post it seems like this would be information to keep in your back pocket and not necessary yet. They may also be able to connect you with local non-profits that can provide you with emergency assistance. My second thought is to reach out to your local Metro United Way, which is sort of a non-profit clearinghouse. Again, they should be able to connect you with multiple resources. And third, and I know this is annoying, stay on top of your caseworker. Call him/her every day until you get  a response. It is likely that your local HHS offices are overwhelmed with people in the same boat as you at the moment, in addition to being short-staffed due to the shut down.

I'm not a wheelchair user so I can't comment on use or transfers (though I know that generally after abdominal surgery I've had weight restrictions for lifting things for 4-6 weeks of nothing over ~10ish pounds so that could affect your ability to transfer?  It's definitely something to discuss with your docs.).

Yes, I've had worse constipation after surgery due to anesthesia and opiates for pain.  Taking a stool softener is helpful, as is anything that normally gets things moving whether it's coffee or prunes, staying hydrated helps too, as does moving around as much as you can.  There might be alternatives to opiates for pain...but I'd still guess you'd probably want the opiates for a day or two minimum (at least I have!).  I have pelvic floor dysfunction as well and that tends to get worse/more spasmy after surgery, partly due to pain causing the muscles to be tight, partly due to me not being able to do my normal PT for several weeks, but that's something where ymmv and upping a dose of muscle relaxants (if you're on them) for the recovery period may be helpful, depending on what you and your docs decide on.

I'm not sure how you're defining ""rough terrain"" in a wheelchair, but on my way home from the hospital after my surgeries, my parents have *not* always been good at avoiding potholes in the car and it has been not great? pain-wise, but it's not awful either, and the increase in pain has been brief for me--just the jolt of hitting it and then it's back to the baseline post-op pain.

You should not have any problems with rough terrain or transfers.

1503,"I've had a partial hysterectomy but I do not use a wheelchair but hopefully can be of some help. 

Pain and discomfort depends on how they will do the surgery,  if they do an abdominal hysterectomy you'll have more pain and discomfort since they will have to make a bigger incision across your abdomen and you'll spend a few nights in a hospital and face a longer healing time.     If they do it laparoscopic there is less healing time and three small incisions and you may only have to stay a night in the hospital, there will also be less pain and discomfort. 

Mine was a laparoscopic partial hysterectomy and after the first week I was fine, having my gallbladder out was much worse than the hysterectomy for me.      So now on to the questions. 


Yes, you'll have more constipation, I can't say if in your case pain medication will make it worse, but usually opioid pain medication does have the side effect of making you constipated.    If you need to take pain medication, see if you can also take a laxative to help with the constipation.     Increase your fiber intake and water, that will also help.   

Using your walker or wheelchair will also depend on the type of surgery you will have.    I was able to walk fine afterwards, so using a walker shouldn't be an issue even over rough terrain.  You are going to be in pain and discomfort because of the surgery, this shouldn't increase that.   However if using a wheelchair over rough terrain might cause more discomfort and pain,  if you need to do so, go very slowly so your are not jostling yourself around too much.    

I cannot answer the last question and I would advise you to speak to your doctors about that.

1505,"I was using forearm crutches and a 4-wheel walker at the time of my laparoscopic hysterectomy at 24.

I don't use a wheelchair though so I'm afraid I can't offer my experience in that regard. I Don't have CP, at this stage I am undiagnosed, My doctor suspects ClEDS or MCTD, and Tethered Cord (I'm still waiting to see a specialist). I have muscle weakness and parathesia in my legs and difficulty toileting.

I had to fast the usual 12 hours prior to surgury, My GYN recommended that because I have issues with delayed gastric emptying I start to the ""colonoscopy diet"" (low residue) 3 days pre-op, then the ""clear fluids only"" diet 2 days post op, then fast for a full 24 hours instead of 12. Following surgury I stuck to a low residue diet with lots of sorbitol rich fruits until I felt like my vaginal cuff incision was well fused and passing stool was comfortable. For me, this happened around day 6-7 Post op. Most of the pain with passing stool was caused by using my abdominal muscles to help bear down, I would take a pillow with me to the bathroom to hug when I peed or opened my bowels for about 10-11 days post op.

As for opiods, I didn't use any, I had my surgery performed with ketamine due to previously having issues with the morphine and propofol ""magic milk"" that's usually used for general aesthetic in my country, I had a few doses of diclofenac in post-op recovery but I didn't get anything on the ward because all they had was panadol but I hate the way it makes my head and back feel. Once I was fully alert I was allowed to use a heatpack.

Transfers were difficult for the first week, I've never used a hoist or lift - I can imagine if you currently use a hoist for transfers it could potentualy cause a lot of pain post-op, especialy if you cross the harness over the abdomen.  I needed a pull cord assistance at first.  Despite the pain, My advice is to avoid being in one location for two long, try to make a transfer from wither bed to chair, chair to walker etc every few hours. That first transfer of the day is the worst, your muscles around the incision areas tighten as you rest and it felt like they would tear, I knew they wouldn't, that's just what it felt like. Again, I hugged a pillow as much as I could while using my other arm to help control the transfer, If you have a lumbar support belt, i'd suggest putting that on just for transfers so that will hold your abdomen tight. Don't wear it all the time, as you need the muscles to recover on their own without relying on the belt for support.

If you are able to use a walker instead of a chair, I personally found that more comfortable. The staff at the hospital used a transfer chair to take me around for various imaging and pathology tests before discharge and that was incredibly painful, it was a weird electronic chair, like a power drive forklift and it jolted to a stop every time which really hurt my abdomen. The walker was much better for me because I could take it slow and focus on the muscles I needed to focus on and I could predict how a movement would feel, I could bend and straighten as nesessary, sometimes hunching over felt comfortable, sometimes trying to straighten my torso was better, when I was seated it was hard to have the flexibility but I guess that depends on your current postural limitations.

My biggest advice is to drink water like a drowning fish. It might seem counter-intuitive because at first it will hurt to pee, I got my catheter out 24 hours post OP and I was going to the toilet every hour on the hour. But this worked in my favour, My pee was very diluted so It didn't burn at all despite the catheter making my feel a bit ""torn up"". Plus, having to get up from bed every hour even during the night meant my muscles didn't get a change to get too stiff and sore, all the water and movement stimulated my bowels so I was able to avoid constipation.

I was very lucky, My surgery was smooth and uncomplicated, I didn't even need a drainage tube. I've had several other surgeries and this was by far the least painful and my fastest recovery. I was back to my full normal range of work and duties within 2 weeks, (It took 8 months before my vaginal cuff fully healed enough for actual sex, but that's because of my surgeon using the wrong stitches for my underlying condition)

My bed neighbour had the same procedure a few days prior to me, she had been in her bed for 4 days post-op and was only just starting to transfer from bed to commode when I got back from post-op recovery (4 hours post-op) meanwhile I was able to get up and use my walker all the way to the bathroom 8 hours post op. 

Hysterectomies are very individual in terms of recovery, My neighbour was very unlucky in that she had a lot more pain and weakness following hers but she still handled it like a champ. It's very hard to offer advice because you might get lucky and have limited pain, or it might be a very painful and limiting surgery.

As for opiods, I didn't use any, I had my surgery performed with ketamine due to previously having issues with the morphine and propofol ""magic milk"" that's usually used for general aesthetic in my country, I had a few doses of diclofenac in post-op recovery but I didn't get anything on the ward because all they had was panadol but I hate the way it makes my head and back feel. Once I was fully alert I was allowed to use a heatpack.

Transfers were difficult for the first week, I've never used a hoist or lift - I can imagine if you currently use a hoist for transfers it could potentualy cause a lot of pain post-op, especialy if you cross the harness over the abdomen.  I needed a pull cord assistance at first.  Despite the pain, My advice is to avoid being in one location for two long, try to make a transfer from wither bed to chair, chair to walker etc every few hours. That first transfer of the day is the worst, your muscles around the incision areas tighten as you rest and it felt like they would tear, I knew they wouldn't, that's just what it felt like. Again, I hugged a pillow as much as I could while using my other arm to help control the transfer, If you have a lumbar support belt, i'd suggest putting that on just for transfers so that will hold your abdomen tight. Don't wear it all the time, as you need the muscles to recover on their own without relying on the belt for support.

If you are able to use a walker instead of a chair, I personally found that more comfortable. The staff at the hospital used a transfer chair to take me around for various imaging and pathology tests before discharge and that was incredibly painful, it was a weird electronic chair, like a power drive forklift and it jolted to a stop every time which really hurt my abdomen. The walker was much better for me because I could take it slow and focus on the muscles I needed to focus on and I could predict how a movement would feel, I could bend and straighten as nesessary, sometimes hunching over felt comfortable, sometimes trying to straighten my torso was better, when I was seated it was hard to have the flexibility but I guess that depends on your current postural limitations.

My biggest advice is to drink water like a drowning fish. It might seem counter-intuitive because at first it will hurt to pee, I got my catheter out 24 hours post <PERSON> and I was going to the toilet every hour on the hour. But this worked in my favour, My pee was very diluted so It didn't burn at all despite the catheter making my feel a bit ""torn up"". Plus, having to get up from bed every hour even during the night meant my muscles didn't get a change to get too stiff and sore, all the water and movement stimulated my bowels so I was able to avoid constipation.

I was very lucky, My surgery was smooth and uncomplicated, I didn't even need a drainage tube. I've had several other surgeries and this was by far the least painful and my fastest recovery. I was back to my full normal range of work and duties within 2 weeks, (It took 8 months before my vaginal cuff fully healed enough for actual sex, but that's because of my surgeon using the wrong stitches for my underlying condition)

My bed neighbour had the same procedure a few days prior to me, she had been in her bed for 4 days post-op and was only just starting to transfer from bed to commode when I got back from post-op recovery (4 hours post-op) meanwhile I was able to get up and use my walker all the way to the bathroom 8 hours post op. 

Hysterectomies are very individual in terms of recovery, My neighbour was very unlucky in that she had a lot more pain and weakness following hers but she still handled it like a champ. It's very hard to offer advice because you might get lucky and have limited pain, or it might be a very painful and limiting surgery.

Plan for the worst, hope for the best, that's all you can do. ","[{'start': 3488, 'end': 3496, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Many days I have the choice between power chair, which is on the more extreme end of visibly disabled, various amounts of braces, cane, or doing the unwise thing and just walking around pretending to be abledbodied and suffering for it later.

It's a toss-up honestly. Being visibly disabled, in my experience, people can easily get annoyed with you for being slow, in the way, taking up resources, but a lot of the time they are more ""permissive"" and won't try to actually interfere with you taking up more space or using a disabled resource. They also infantilize you and touch you nonconsensually. Being invisibly disabled, you get pushed aside and yelled at for taking the bus seat, the parking space. And for me (a black guy) it's dangerous to be acting unusual in public without an explanation.

You have to decide for yourself what to do when presented with different situations. Sometimes, it's better to just let ignorant comments roll off your shoulder (as I'd recommend with people passing you in the hallway); other times, it's worth advocating for yourself (as I'd recommend with your teachers). Whatever you do though, don't *justify* yourself. You don't owe anyone an explanation nor an apology for moving a little slower than they do. And while your teachers are entitled to an explanation for your tardiness, they aren't (legally, ethically, or personally) entitled to your medical information. You may, at times, need to provide *verification* of your disability (to the Social Security Administration, for instance), but never *justification*. You don't owe anyone an apology for being here.

This short essay makes even invisible illnesses relatable to people who have never suffered from one. Or just explain that not all disabilities can be seen. You can't see pain, deafness, cognitive differences...
2. Get sassy. Don't be rude, of course, but know that a *little bit* of attitude can end a line of questioning. For instance: When someone tells you that you don't look sick, ask them what, exactly, a sick person might look like. Or ask where they got *their* medical degree.
3. Kill 'em with kindness. Say ""Thanks. I'm glad to hear I look better than I feel"" to anyone who tells you that you look good/healthy/able-bodied.
4. Make a joke. This one varies by situation.
5. Advocate for yourself. If your teachers don't honor your medical pass, speak to them privately and respectfully. Explain that the school has agreed with your doctor's assessment that you need accommodation and if they have concerns, they may bring them up with the school. If the school or an employer won't give you *reasonable* accommodation, remind them that both the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are on your side, and that your lawyer would be happy to explain that to them.

1620," In my experience, being able to pass as an able bodied  person has its advantages and disadvantages.  I was born visually impaired. So unless you pay really close attention to the movement of my eyes or watch me read something and saw how close it has to be to my face you would have no idea. The only issues I ever had was sometimes if I had to ask  for help finding or reading things people didn't believe me. I get comments like ""Why don't you do it yourself it's right there can't you see it?  

When I was 14 I got into an accident and broke my neck.I ended up a quadriplegic. I can't walk, have limited arm movement,   and no use of my hands.( I'm actually typing this on my cell phone with combination of my nose and voice recognition so forgive any typos)
My issues since my accident 22 years ago has  been mostly people making assumptions about my disability. They mostly assume but I can't do as much if I actually can.


For example anytime I go anywhere I have to have someone come with me to open doors, handle paperwork, and anything else you need full arm extension and finger movement for.  Quite  few times I've been out people will totally ignore me and ask the person that with me questions about me rather than asking me directly. Most of the people who I've come across that have done this who said that they figured I wasn't able to talk or communicate. They're completely caught off guard when I can speak intelligently and incomplete sentences.

I think the thing that annoys me most is people staring.    That drives me fucking nuts. I know people aren't doing it to be rude most of the time. I think people are curious and want to know about my disability just don't want to offend me . That's why I've always told people if you have a question ask. As long as they're  not trying to be a complete asshole when asking a question. I pretty much answer any question because I'd rather have people get some knowledgeabout people with disabilities rather than going on some stereotype they have in their head. Hell, I don't even mind being asked for the 300 time if my dick works .  As long as people just stop staring.

I definitely miss being able to pass off as abled bodied at times

1633,"A good basic guideline is the British broadcasting company guidelines found here : http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/subtitling_guides/online_sub_editorial_guidelines_vs1_1.pdf

I would personally say they are the best most straightforward ruleset for subtitles, they might mainly apply to TV but it works the same way for games. They also have a lot on style options which I know you can't do (though you really should it makes a big difference) and timing as well as some textual stuff. 

As for specific points 
.1 When you are including non dialogue sounds you aren't trying to phonetically spell out what they say you are giving the deaf reader an indication of what they are type of thing they are vocalising that we can't hear. If that makes sense. We might not know what eurgh sounds like but we know what a disgusted noise is. 

.2 there are some general use of punctuation to convey emotional or intonation such as (!) for sarcasm in the pdf above but most of all you convey emotion or intonation the way you would in a book

.3 this is the sort of situation where a deaf person could probably get from context that there are drinking sounds being made. So you wouldn't include it. Same reason you don't include every tiny sound unless you want to convey atmosphere. Only time where you would describe the sound is if it something that brings extra context to the scene. You would say (gulps) if you want to tell the viewer that they are drinking fast something that a hearing person might infer from the sound that a deaf person might miss. 

I am not an expert by any means but I hope it helps. 

A good rule of thumb to ask yourself ""is this relevant? and what does a relevant sound convey to a hearing person that I need to convey to a deaf person? And how best to do that?""

.2 there are some general use of punctuation to convey emotional or intonation such as (!) for sarcasm in the pdf above but most of all you convey emotion or intonation the way you would in a book

.3 this is the sort of situation where a deaf person could probably get from context that there are drinking sounds being made. So you wouldn't include it. Same reason you don't include every tiny sound unless you want to convey atmosphere. Only time where you would describe the sound is if it something that brings extra context to the scene. You would say (gulps) if you want to tell the viewer that they are drinking fast something that a hearing person might infer from the sound that a deaf person might miss. 

I am not an expert by any means but I hope it helps. 

A good rule of thumb to ask yourself ""is this relevant? and what does a relevant sound convey to a hearing person that I need to convey to a deaf person? And how best to do that?""

1646,"I'm hard of hearing but I'm not a gamer so I'll relate my experiences with TV and movies.

* I would prefer ""groans"" in brackets (so I know the character didn't say the actual word). Sometimes I see an adjective with the noise, e.g. ""low moans,"" ""high-pitched screams.""

* I wouldn't need anything for shock or surprise if I can see it on the character's face. Noises only; we can infer the rest. If it's a noise that can't be described with something like ""gasp,"" maybe ""startled noise"" or similar. I've never seen just punctuation used.

* I wouldn't need anything for drinking unless it's relevant to the plot in some way. Is he gulping because the director wants us to know he's in a hurry, or that he's really thirsty?

* Captioned noises should be noted if a character reacts to it (or if we're supposed to). If a door creaks open slowly and there's a monster behind it, ""door creaks"" creates suspense. Same with a knock at the door, a phone ringing, a dog barking, police sirens, gun shots. 

* I also want to know when people are speaking but it's NOT meant to be heard or understood, e.g. whispering. Sometimes the captions for this are ""unintelligible whispering"" or ""speaking foreign language."" Then I don't feel like I've missed something.

1665,"Congrats on getting a hearing! I actually had 2 hearings for SSDI and ultimately got approved for it in Sept 2018.

By far the biggest tip I have for you is to emphasize how **difficult** it is for you to do things due to your disability. My dad, who helped me apply for the SSDI, told me not to even express happiness/being relaxed during the hearing and not to even mention regularly doing stuff like housework and volunteering if you're not ALWAYS on the ball about it and up for doing it (I still told the lawyer helping us and probably also the judge that every once in a while I did a bit of housework or errands, but it was still incredibly difficult for me and a massive time-suck compared to for other people), because then the judge could assume that you could do stuff like janitorial work no problem and refuse to approve disability payments. Being downcast and weepy if you're easily like that will very much help your case. If you get approved, then keep up this demeanor until at least getting back to your transportation to get home. 

Apparently what also helped me in my case was that I very obviously had bizarre intonation and constantly went off-topic during the hearings, prep work with the lawyer, and re-evaluation by my Regional Center.",,,,ThisIsMyRental," Moderate Autism, Anxiety, heavily suspected depression and OCD",,1547379848,t5_2qhe8,t3_afb993,t3_afb993,6,1551312265,0,0,edyvxyy,disability,,,,,

Sorting by flair doesn't affect one's front page, as you pointed out as a downfall yourself. It becomes a game of hiding the multiple posts a day, which is very tedious. You're basically telling us to unsub if we're upset.

I don't agree that threads about someone's SS(D)I's case generate discussion, nor are they good excuses for ""content."" They don't discuss *disability,* they want specific information or validation about welfare that often doesn't apply to anyone else. That... doesn't pertain to people with disabilities, it pertains to that person with that body in that situation.

Which brings me to the big one: ""Disability"" does not inherently mean ""welfare."" It's a part of many people's identity, which I bet is /u/yukonwanderer's point. Being on welfare is not an identity, and is certainly not something inherent to being in a disabled body. Just because Americans call SSDI ""disability"" doesn't mean much, it's just slang and it's extremely ethnocentric.

Instead, ""disability"" *could,* and should, cover a **TON** of content. It has the potential and reality to be an extremely broad topic covering the physiological, emotional, sociological, scientific... among other applications. It's a fair complaint to ask why this sub's mods lets individuals who are usually ""one and done"" posters dominate, instead of trying to build community and awareness and insight. 

A sub's name usually indicates the topic: /r/CrossStitch, or /r/Games, or /r/aww. This is not /r/welfare, let alone /r/AmericanWelfare or /r/SSDI. Where else should someone who is interested in disability as a topic go, that has anywhere near the amount of posters? Not only is /r/disabled much smaller, it also has the same issue as being an /r/SSDI wannabe, so that answer doesn't work; likewise, often a topic is wider than sharing it to a fractional demographic like /r/Deaf or /r/spinalmuscularatrophy.

The only point I agree with you on is, yes, it would be harder for an individual to get views and responses, but half the time they don't even need any help, they just need to wait couple weeks for an answer **or** there's a better sub that can help them.

1734,"Issues such as whether you can go out to lunch fall under Activities of Daily Living, or ADLs. Impairments can range from Mild to Profound, and are part of the criteria for a person to be diagnosed with an Intellectual or Developmental Disability (IDD), which used to be referred to as mental retardation. 

For example, PookaProtector is able to do the task (going to lunch) with preplanning. From a diagnostic perspective, this could be judged to be a marginal, or perhaps a mild impairment (and by no means am I trying to minimize your difficulties). However, coming from the IDD field, I would consider this particular task achievable with accommodation (a wheelchair, accessible transportation and venue, planning, etc.). 

Consider a person with an IQ that is right at the borderline of qualifying as a component of an IDD. If the person does not have a certain level of impairment in their ADLs (ranging from being competitively employed, being able to independently manage their finances, being able to live independently, etc.), that person would not be diagnosed with an IDD.

The definition of a disability differs whether you are referring to physical disabilities (or limitations), IDDs, or mental health issues. It's an interesting topic for discussion. A person with morbid obesity may be disabled physically, due to a mental health disability. 

tl;dr - I suppose a baseline definition could be that a disability is a departure from ""normal"" functioning, however defined, based on criteria established by the professionals within the particular fields in question.

1751,"What is the ""actual definition"" that you ascribe to? in disability theory there are quite a few valid definitions of disability depending on the framework or ""model"" that defines it. the two most contemporary are the medical model and the social model. the medical model is the easiest to grasp it defines disability as deviation from a medically set norm (i.e. an abnormality with the physical body that is in this framework considered an issue) 
judging from you description i would hazard you ascribe to this interpretation of disability. this is not necessarily wrong, you just also need to consider the other way of thinking about disability called the social model which upholds the idea that it is not the body that is the cause of disabilty but the fact society prevents the full participation of differently abled individuals. in other words society is the origin of disability. what the medical interpretation of disability considers to be problems are in the social interpretation akin to expressions of diversity.

 because of this in the social model of disability, much more things can be considered to be a (catalyst for societally induced ) disability than in the medical model. furthermore  if this interpretation taken to the extreme, anything that causes dificulty participating in society could be potentially be viewed as such.

all of this just to say that what is or isn't or should or shouldn't be considered a disability is subject to valid interpretation.

1791,"Idk...I could rant against Uber/Lyft from one perspective, rant against taxis from another perspective. If you have the option to transfer into an Uber/Lyft, then by all means. They’re definitely cheaper. One could debate whether that’s because they’re better businesses, or whether it’s because they’ve shirked all the obligations and costs of taxi companies (such as, */cough/* outfitting accessible vehicles). I’ve definitely ridden in some over-priced scam taxis, no denying. 

But from another perspective, if you can’t get out of a chair/mobility device and need an actual accessible vehicle, then it’s Uber and Lyft that are the scams. Adding fake “options” to their apps to pretend to be wheelchair accessible while being entirely not. Fighting against ADA regs and employee benefits regs to artificially prop up their absurdly low prices...

Keep your chin up, make sure your husband has your back, and build up a thick skin. I don't know these people, I don't know if it would me more effective to be playful about it or matter of fact. Depending on who I'm with, I'll either just say ""well I can't walk very far without my disco stick so I'd better take it. We'll get all my cripple perks, it'll be awesome"" or, if I'm with my more ornery and opinionated family I'll say ""I need it, and if that were up for discussion I wouldn't be using it.""

Regardless, having your husband on the offense, ready to back you up is absolutely vital. ",,,,SwiftlyGregory,,,1547569666,t5_2qhe8,t3_ag5ypr,t3_ag5ypr,6,1551410300,0,0,ee4n10l,disability,,,,,

I will tell you this: People WILL stare at you. There's no way around that. You just have to know that you need it.

Additionally, being part of what folks call the Cripple Punk/CPunk community has also helped me. I connect with other young folks with disabilities, learn new cool ways to decorate my aids, and make funny memes about being disabled. 

Lastly, I would suggest doing something super wild with your appearance. Dye your hair a cool color, wear funky socks, something that will make people ask about that before they get all rude about the cane.

1874,"It's not just about assuming they can't take care of themselves, it's also about assuming they can't provide consent or that it's somehow not appropriate to ask for permission.

If I saw a seemingly able-bodied person at the grocery store juggling their bags and looking like they are struggling, I wouldmn't just snatch their bag from their hands and smile proudly *look, I'm helping*, I'd say ""Do you need a hand?"" as I walk up to them and wait for them to say ""Oh, yes please"" or ""Nah, I'm right""

In fact, I've had that exact situation happen - I only use my forearm crutches for gait support some of the time, some days my disability is 100% invisible or to use a highly contentious term, I'm ""able passing"". If I drop something like my wallet or my hand while fumbling with something else (which happens a lot because I struggle with grip) people will say ""Oh, let me get that for you"" and they give me a chance to say ""No thanks"" and they respect that and keep walking.

On days I'm using my crutches, when it's arguably easier for me to actually bend over and pick stuff up because I have my aid for support and balance- people just swoop in, Pick up my wallet, and don't say a word, just hand it back to me, smiling like they deserve a cookie. 

Many able people i've discussed the issue with (and i've discussed this issue a lot because I used to be a facilitator for employer disability awareness training, and ""Ask before you help"" was an entire module) say that people with disabilities are rude or bitter for getting upset over people ""Just trying to help"" but they are missing the point. It's not about helping people, It's about treating them as autonomous people with a right to independance, personal space and consent.

Pushing a strangers wheelchair without consent is the equivalent of walking up behind a person on the staircase and picking them up, throwing them over your shoulder like a firefighter and walking up the stairs with them on your back saying ""You sounded out of breath, I'm helping"". Would you do that to an abled person who gets puffed on stairs? No? So why are you treating people who use wheelchairs so different from able people? 

The other issue is this assumption that we *need* help. Yes, Many hands make light work, help can be useful even if you can do something yourself, But there is also pride and a sense of independence and self worth that comes from consistently doing things on your own. Take a cup of tea, It's nice when someone prepares and brings me a cup, that's a kind gesture. But I also enjoy the peace and mindfulness that comes with pouring my own cup of tea, I like to have a balance of the two experiences, and I like to be in control of when I accept help and when I do things on my own.

When you have disabilities that *force* you to always accept certain kinds of help from people who are educated on the type of assistance you need, it becomes even more important to have the option to do the things you can do for yourself by yourself.

The bottom line is that if you don't have permission to provide help, then regardless of your *best intentions*, you are not helping, you are violating a persons consent, and able people need to get this through their brains when it comes to people with disabilities, especially people who use wheelchairs, and people with visual impairment who often experience strangers grabbing their hands or arms and dragging them around - That it is not ""Helping"" if you don't ask first, it is terrifying, belittling, and for a split second you have to wonder ""am I being abducted?"" which is not what receiving help from a kind stranger should ever feel like, so don't do it!",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1547613556,t5_2qhe8,t3_agbwmf,t1_ee5rudu,6,1551438186,0,0,ee6anm4,disability,,,,,

At the end of the day you're a person too, with wants desires and sometimes needs.  The chair sounds like a need, although you might not want it to be.  And that's alright, nobody changes right away.  But it's something you'll get over time, even if someone explains it by screaming truth to your face...you have to live it.  Your experiences will eventually put it in perspective and you'll look back wondering what the problem was.  Same thing happened to me.  I had to get comfortable with a bipap at night.   I thought it was the worst thing ever but after all the problems I learned it wasn't just a suggestion.  I really needed it and benefit from it despite my excuses for avoiding it so long.  

On the other hand, since it sounds like you're trying to come to terms with your disability, all I can say is don't look at yourself as or feel disabled, it doesn't help.  (I'm going to get all hippie for a second)  Yeah sure there's empowering bullshit about being disabled, blah blah we're all amazing, but disabilities or handicaps are a social construct.  If you broke down everyone's quirks, limitations and junk, everyone is or feels disabled in some way.  Can't stand crowds, can't stand for more than an hour, can't get along with political rivals, etc., yeah everyone, each person has some issue that complicates their existence so instead of drawing an imaginary and poorly defined line somewhere and giving it a name, just realize it's all bullshit.  Technically, everyone has a disability that obstructs them somehow, so in my book it's not a thing.  Right now using 'disabled' is better at describing a separation of people.  Despite a wheelchair or maybe outbreaks of pain, at the end of the day you're still you're still you, there's just some adjustments or different ways you're handling situations.  I mean come to terms by calling yourself disabled or whatever, that's cool, but just know it's a poorly defined word for a complex set of circumstances by people trying to simplify everything.  So if you want to 'deal with that real quick' as you put it, just be honest about what's happening, what you're going through, and what you need to be yourself.  ...or, you know, go the other route and start panicking because you finally understand you're disabled now, so everything has changed!  Scream, ""WHY ME!!????????"" and lash out at everyone.  Also, cry.

1915,"You are frustrated over some common misconceptions, and some of them are things no one who works for SSA can do anything about as congress creates the laws that generate the policies. 

First and foremost, "" I was extremely careful to apply for SSI because I do NOT have the credits for SSDI."" 

it was a good idea to apply for SSI if you don't have the work credits, but one of the requirements for the SSI program is that an applicant must apply for any and all other benefits that they are potentially eligible for, and since the Social Security Administration administers both SSI and SSDI, an application for SSI is an application for SSDI. If you have filed an application online, you have filed for SSDI and you would have indicated on that application whether or not you would like to file for SSI as well. If you indicate ""no"" it generates what is called closeout language (If you file an application by X date then we will consider your application to be filed as of todays date"". If you indicate ""yes"" then, if possible, the internet application will process your claim as having filed for both, but there are many, many, many exceptions, so most of the time it does not work that way and if it does the information submitted to the office is basically blank.

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to, ""On January 11, 2019 we talked with you about your eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). **b**ased on that talk, we have made an informal decision that you are not eligible for SSI.""

I'll try to explain how it would work if I pulled in your claim. On January 11th you submit your claim for disability benefits online, based on the letter you received it does not sound like the medical information was submitted, so on January 12th when your claim comes through on my list I ""receipt"" in your application on our application mainframe system, whatever date I receipt it in as will end up being the date that I ""talked to you"" on the letter. When that claim first comes through I'm going to print and store your application summary and request any required evidence that is missing - the summary and the evidence request will be different letters. When these letters print the computer system will put on the notice, ""On January 11th we talked to you about your eligibility for x"" or ""On January 11th we talked to you about your application for x"", or whatever we were doing online that day even though no one talked to you. Is it unclear? Yes, but that is how the notices print and that is the language that is required to be in the notice. 

Here's an issue I see with what happened in your claim though. When you file that online disability application and you indicate you wanted to file for SSI but for some reason your application is excluded from the online process, then your local office is supposed to make 2 attempts to obtain your application either by phone or mailing out a paper application. Based on what you've described it sounds like the representative just mailed you a ""close out"" notice, which is definitely not the only thing they are supposed to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Pardon? So what's the confirmation number for? What do you want me to send medical information for? If I ""didn't apply,"" how/why are you contacting me?""

The confirmation number would be for the SSDI application online. An application was submitted, just not for SSI - is that your fault? No, but for whatever reason you were excluded from online processing for that benefit type. You indicated you wanted to file for SSI so either way they're going to do medical development, they might as well request that from you now while waiting for the SSI application to be formally submitted, or maybe the claims specialist is going to attempt to develop the medical back to when you were last insured for SSDI benefits

&amp;#x200B;

These types of situations are common and you're right in pointing out that its a lot of bureaucratic nonsense, but the representatives can only work with the systems that are in place if the computer brought the SSDI application through but couldn't capture your SSI then you're going to be getting notices saying you didn't file for SSI, because at that point you technically haven't even though you tried to.

The letter that you reference stating that there was an informal determination of SSI eligibility probably has the number L-991 in the corner. The L-991 serves to notify you that no SSI application was filed, and you have 60 days to submit an application to preserve your filing date of January 11th. 

There should be a phone number and extension of the person who took your claim on one of the applications. If there is, then that’s the person to call to take an SSI application over the phone.

1953,"I'm not who you are replying to. However with sensory issues it can be like feeling certain textures in your mouth will literally make you vomit.

With food allergies it can be really hard, depending on the food shelf. You don't have the luxury of picking your own items or even putting things back that you won't use. 

For example I used to go to a food distribution site weekly. It was mostly pasta, sauces, a processed meat item and 1 or 2 produce items and maybe a gallon of milk if you got there early.

This summer my son was diagnosed with celiac disease and now he can't eat 98% of the food that they have for distribution.

The local food bank is a little bit better, but again we wouldn't be able to use most of what they offer, and you can only go once a month. I can't go ""hey I know I am supposed to pick 3 to 4 boxes of cereal, and 3 pastas... But can I get meat or produce instead?""

1956,"Sensory processing disorder, common almost to universality among autistics, and sometimes found in non autistics, is any neurological processing differences of the senses. In the case of food, this is most commonly a subset of tactile processing differences and issues with food texture, other possible food concerns related to sensory issues can be severe difficulties with taste/smell, and difficulties with interoception and sensing hunger/thirst/fullness. Most foods hurt so bad I puke from the pain. 

And I don't know about your food bank, but you don't get to pick anything yourself at ours. You line up at one end of the church gym with a box, and walk to the other end, and the volunteers put things in your box. If you try to tell them you are allergic to something or need something specific, they mock you and call you ungrateful, or flatly say they don't allow picking or exchanges. I've seen them deliberately give people in muslim or jewish clothes pork and tell them that if they really *needed* to be at a food bank, then they'd eat what they are given.

The truth is without the safety net I'm dog food I'm grateful for it and there's no way I can ever pay it back, for my side of the street I'm able to cultivate gratitude, and pay it forward when i can.","[{'start': 144, 'end': 152, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
2052,"I'm really sorry you feel judged by your neighbors. Those people obviously don't know you well, and I agree with you about the jealousy stuff. I think it's hard for people who feel like they're working as hard as they can to make ends meet see someone receive assistance.

I think it's important to state that they have no place to judge you, and certainly should not be harassing you, or saying you don't need benefits. Your life and your finances are none of their business, and you deserve to receive the assistance you deserve, regardless of what they think.

I'm sure you're frustrated, they sound really aggravating. I just want to point out the line ""no good husband drug addict."" Look, I don't know you, and I don't know them. I just read your post, and smelling pot near their home does not a drug addict make. Cannabis can help symptoms of countless conditions covered by disability, and the use of it hardly makes a person ""no good."" Maybe their front lawn is full of dirty heroin needles and you failed to mention it, I don't know. But it sounds like there's a lot of judgement flying both ways, and if there was an inspector at their home then they went through the same process you did to receive the same benefits you do. It sounds to me like you don't think they deserve to receive benefits, which is exactly what you're mad at them for.

I think both of y'all need to mind your own business, it sounds like everyone in this post is just trying to get by with what they can. I'm glad you're getting the help you need.

Then, there's the blindness advocacy groups. The NFB is known for suing ***everyone*** outside of blind circles, and for passing what are little more than gripe letters *within* the blind community, as well as having a toxic, almost ableist view on how to be blind that excludes people with multiple disabilities.

Neither group really does outreach to show us as a group of normal people who have some extra challenges based on how inaccessible the world is.

On the note of leeches, blindness groups specifically wanted blind people to be able to get SSI, while the Deafness group argued that they don't need the handout.

On the subject of infantalism, there's also the whole intersection of Hellen Keller's speech sounding like she has an intellectual disability, apparently, and the fact that she's seen as a normal blind person, while the other side is people like Daredevil where there are no issues, and very little in-between.

It's similar to what many Autistic people face, in that there's the assumption of being either ""low functioning"" or a savant with no in-between.

I'm fairly certain I could not cope with my sensory processing differences in a healthy and safe manner if I lost sight entirely. I use tactile and visual cues to compensate for a near total lack of proprioception, allowing me to manually walk.

2124,"&gt; I also wonder why there are a lot of Deaf people and very few blind people. Did they build a Deaf school because of that?

Other way around, there's a bunch of Deaf people because they just stay here when they graduate. The Deaf school is the state deaf school, the Michigan school for the Deaf, and it's been there for like, 100+ years or so. They take boarding and nonboarding students, so people come stay at the school for 12 or so years, then decide to just settle here, because they're familiar and comfortable with the area. Because of the high number of deaf people who settle here after school, some people learn sign to better serve them. Most places have at least one employee who can sign, and if you're deaf and rely on sign, you become familiar with the schedule of the people who can sign at places you frequent.

&gt; Maybe the blind people don't need any help? Most blind people are NOT completely blind, (meaning that they have some usable sight) and blind people can walk by themselves. They CAN shop and give plasma. 

Of course they can. But they aren't doing it at the plasma center I was going to, or on the 4 bus routes I ride most often. I talk to *everybody* when I can. Only the two I mentioned are blind and riding the buses I do. One time there was a third blind person on one of the buses, but the bus driver mocked him and told him if he could see to cross 5 lanes of traffic, he could see to find and signal his stop himself, and refused to help him find where he was going. I haven't seen him since. I'm sure the blind are living full, exceptional lives, but they aren't doing it on the buses I ride, which they'd kinda need to in order to get to the most used stores and services.

Did they build a Deaf school because of that?

Other way around, there's a bunch of Deaf people because they just stay here when they graduate. The Deaf school is the state deaf school, the <LOCATION> school for the <PERSON>, and it's been there for like, 100+ years or so. They take boarding and nonboarding students, so people come stay at the school for 12 or so years, then decide to just settle here, because they're familiar and comfortable with the area. Because of the high number of deaf people who settle here after school, some people learn sign to better serve them. Most places have at least one employee who can sign, and if you're deaf and rely on sign, you become familiar with the schedule of the people who can sign at places you frequent.

&gt; Maybe the blind people don't need any help? Most blind people are NOT completely blind, (meaning that they have some usable sight) and blind people can walk by themselves. They CAN shop and give plasma. 

Of course they can. But they aren't doing it at the plasma center I was going to, or on the 4 bus routes I ride most often. I talk to *everybody* when I can. Only the two I mentioned are blind and riding the buses I do. One time there was a third blind person on one of the buses, but the bus driver mocked him and told him if he could see to cross 5 lanes of traffic, he could see to find and signal his stop himself, and refused to help him find where he was going. I haven't seen him since. I'm sure the blind are living full, exceptional lives, but they aren't doing it on the buses I ride, which they'd kinda need to in order to get to the most used stores and services. They're probably taking paratransit or something, but they aren't on the regular buses.

Your state insurance will only pay for this or that and you wind up getting referred to internists or other general doctors who may have no experience having disabled patients.

Destroyed my trust and really exacerbated all the mental health problems already attendant with being disabled. I had one particular one, Dr. Neil Boside who was such a scumbag that I refused to see a doctor for about 2 years.

You're not alone. In America, when you're disabled you start on insurance for low income people. If you don't have financial or family support and you are disabled, the system is designed without your needs in mind whatsoever.

And he slam dunked it through the goddamn bureaucratic hoop I'd been launching shots at helplessly for a decade.

It's also frustrating for me to have people ask ""oh, is this your carer?"" and I always have to reply ""no, this is my spouse"" like, yeah, he occasionally takes on the role of a support worker, but that's not his job, he's my partner, last I checked supporting each other is part of being in a healthy relationship regardless of your abilities.

My sister just went through this last year. I got reapproved no problem, because I save up and pay out of pocket to go see the third best neuropsych in the country because the medicaid/low income mental help here is extremely bad at anything autism related. She can't afford to do that, so she initially got told what you did and appealed as you are.

Her lawyer (the one she'd used when getting initially approved) had her sign a thing saying she'd give x out of each check for y months upon reapproval, and she was able to get her full benefits throughout the appeal. Once reapproved, whoever handles SSI distribution started paying him directly and depositing the rest in her account like normal. I want to say he takes $25 a month, but I don't know for certain. I know it leaves her enough to cover her rent and power, although she'd probably have a hard time affording food, hygiene and homecare products if it weren't for foodstamps and food and commodity banks.

2360,"I wear ones from MeUndies. They’re amazing, but it’s a bit of a double-edged sword. MeUndies is a subscription service ($15/month?) where they send you a new pair of underwear every month. The upside is that they prioritize comfort, and make them out of the softest material around. The downside is that that material isn’t as durable, so right as I’m about ready to unsubscribe I notice a pair is starting to fall apart. 

I like their trunks and their boxer-briefs. I think trunks are easier in a wheelchair because they don’t get bunches up as much, but I noticed that I don’t look as good in trunks as I used to, so I switched to boxer-briefs.

It’s a bit of a luxury, but they’re so damn comfortable. It’s possible they fall apart faster on me/us than they would on an able-bodied person because being seated causes some extra rubbing against the fabric. Overall, though, since there’s always a new pair coming it isn’t a big deal.

They come in super fun prints, too, if that’s your thing, and they’re often seasonal (I just got my Valentines ones). My SO gets a kick out of it when we both get the same print.

2392,"Interesting point re: ablebodied people having an easier time getting into the story if they see someone like them portraying disability. I think that's true, and I'm all about ablebodied people seeing things from our point of view.

I just feel like portraying someone on film is not a guaranteed way to learn about them. I've seen many insensitive or ignorant comments from actors who no doubt spent a lot of time preparing for roles as members of underprivileged groups. Hopefully not-too-tangential example: I still remember being greatly disappointed ages ago when I watched Boys Don't Cry and I read interviews with Hilary Swank, who I already liked, and saw her call her character (Brandon Teena) a woman, despite being in a movie where the *whole point* was her character's fight to be taken seriously as a man, until he was assaulted and murdered for it. As a trans kid, I took away from Swank *still* not getting it that a) cis people would always portray us because we had to live on the margins like Teena, and b) nothing would ever make someone understand and respect me as a trans person; we were just curios for cis people to enrich themselves with.

2394,"First thought on the video itself- Something is off with the audio, It jumps from the left channel to the right channel, its drastically quieter than evry other video i've ever watched on you tube (I had to turn my PC and you tube volume to 100% and turn off my air con and hold the speaker to my ear to hear you)

But that's really my only note for the video itself, your script/speech pattern is really engaging and concise.

On the subject material: I think it entirely depends on the role and the disability in question and how the script portrays the character with a disability.

Should able bodied actors be chosen over equally qualified disabled actors? hell no.

Should script writers be limited to wrote a character with a disability in a way that allows actors with similar disabilities to be fully qualified? No, there shouldn't be a limit to art.

What do I mean by this? Lets say that a writer wants to tell a story about a character who's life changes in a matter of days due to a traumatic incident or rapid illness- In some scenes there are flashbacks to a time when the character is able bodied, and in other scenes the character has a disability, (it may or may not be plot relevant.) An actor with a disability may not be able to perform the tasks the script demands for flashback scenes depending on the nature of their disability. The writers could arrange for flashbacks to take place so long ago that they could be performed by a child or teen actor/younger actor who is able bodied, but that would change how the story is told.

Another example could be filming situations that pose a danger to the actors medical condition, as an example off the top of my head, if you were telling a story about a character who happens to have a seizure disorder and you wanted to show a scene in which the character was exposed to a trigger and experienced a seizure you would want to walk the fine line between picking a realistic seizure trigger, but not endangering the actor or audience members with similar seizure disorders, When it comes to young characters, child acting laws in yoir country of filming may entirely prevent you from hiring an actor with the same condition as the character.

Then there's the question of filming in general, the schedule and intensity of acting isn't great for anyones health - I would love to see representations of people with my chronic illness on screen, but I don't expect anyone with similar symptoms as me to be portraying those characters because I know I can't make it to a filming location or work for the many hours a day filming requires, I would hope that someone with a milder version of my condition can be hired to portray the character, or someone with great empathy who is willing to resaerch and do the role justice.

But the flip side of that is movies such as Unrest, in which the whole purpose was hiring people for whom the symptoms are reality, and changing the entire way movies are produced and filmed to be accessible to those actors/people.


If there is a way to make the acting process accessible, and you want your character to have diverse abilities or have a disability, then you should be aiming to fill the role with a disabled actor.

Hiring an able-bodied actor to fill a disabled character role should be a last resort (No disabled actors were willing, or no accommodations could be made to allow them to be able to film) *or* the actor should be in a prime position to use their new platform to advocate for disabled actors and disabled people on a genuine level.

If an able bodied actor is to play a disabled character, they need to do their research and dive deep. They have a responsibility not to sugar coat the experience of the character they are portraying but also not to talk about those people in real life with similar conditions as the character as some sort of ""inspiration porn"" or ""Pity party recipient"".",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1548738640,t5_2qhe8,t3_akvdxy,t3_akvdxy,6,1552192333,0,0,ef8jmpz,disability,,,,,

2418,"Definitely try &amp; avoid too much interaction where possible. Last uni semester I had one day where I had a 2 hour tute (language tute so 2 hours of conversation) followed by 2 hours worth of extracurricular (dancing, with partners). By the end of the 2nd hour I was usually worn out, and as the semester progressed it ended up being that by the start of the 4th hour I'd just be in shutdown mode, having to do non-social stuff (ie stimming on my phone for up to 45 mins at the worst) to feel the slightest bit up to participating for the end portion.

By the end of the semester pretty much the only reason I was attending that 4th hour (including for a makeup session when the teacher was sick, which amounted to several hours transport mainly for that one hour) was because I'd paid for it so didn't want to be wasting money by not attending.

Hoping my scheduling next semester won't take as much of a toll (I'm not continuing with those extracurriculars so hopefully that'll help somewhat).

Edit: realised I didn't tie this back in to the interaction you mainly meant ie on the streets/in shops. After the days I was talking about initially I definitely found I couldn't stand to interact anymore &amp; just had to go home &amp; take a nap. Given the amount of contact on public transport it was pretty difficult to stop from getting overloaded again. On top of this there's a public transport stop near my uni that spruikers are always around trying to sell things to uni students, which was probably the worst as they're very hard to get rid of, particularly when you're travelling outside of peak hours so they can target you better (ie I was leaving uni mid-arvo this particular semester, when student crowds are mainly morning 8-9am and arvo/evening 4pm-6pm).

If I realised I needed something from a store (ie supermarket) I would never get it on the day given shops tend to be crowded &amp; you have to interact with staff etc. That was always left to another day when I knew I otherwise didn't have too much going on socially at uni (ie another of my days I had a lecture &amp; tute in the morning, several hours of nothing, lecture in the arvo - only really one social hour so could mostly work with that).",,,,argonautory,Autistic,,1548779058,t5_2qhe8,t3_akz24c,t3_akz24c,2,1552213585,0,0,ef9syrj,disability,,,,,

i have mixed feelings. being very allergic to some kinds of cats, i would be really upset if an animal that i was allergic to was allowed in my workplace. it could actually send me to the hospital.

but i have also worked in a couple of jobs that allowed regular dogs and it was AWESOME. they lifted spirits and reduced stress so much. in a small office where everyone agrees, its highly recommended.

-

i bet this will hassle more innocent people with support animals than it will catch people who are conning the system. even if a person is desperate enough to lie about this sort of thing it probably means on some level they actually do need the animal close to them for emotional reasons.

-

as someone who tries to be an advocate for all disabilities i think this bill is just hateful and petty... but something does need to be done to protect people with bad allergies. they also deserve good health and access to public spaces.

I understand how tough this is to enforce, I mean what can the cops do?  Sit on a parking lot all day checking these out one by one?  I just think it's something cops should do, occasionally, just so the threat is there.  As it stands they never do it and I think that just encourages others to abuse it.
