35,"Thank you for your response. I have been checking in on her daily. It has unfortunately taken a toll on her health. She’s conveyed to me having experienced broken out in hives, having complications with her breathing (asthma attacks and COPD flair ups, she has severe nerve damage on her left side from a terrible car accident and it usually gets bad during stressful situations so she told me that the pain has been unbearable and is usually under control to a certain extent, and has been breaking out in hives, lastly she had gotten MRSA while hospitalized for her car accident and it came back and had a major infection). I am a retired nurse so I think she feels comfortable talking to me about these things. She is one of the nicest women I have ever met. It’s unfair what they are doing to her. The latest thing the Board did was send her an email accusing her service animal of defecating on the stairs of our building and not cleaning it up (that two residents had to clean it up and complained). Trained Service Animals don’t do that. I find it hard to believe that not one but two residents wouldn’t have come to her and said, “it looks like there was an accident can you clean it up.” They are trying everything to make this woman’s life difficult. 

They have repeatedly told her not to bring her service animal to the pool. And, I know as a nurse the pool would be a great place for her to exercise and work out some of the trauma to her body. As it is a low impact exercise. But, she is too scared to go to the pool with all these issues.

44,"Hey, I'm a 30 yr old brain tumor survivor. I graduated college, worked at 4 different jobs (all of which I was or was about to be fired from). After the absolutely catastrophic ending of my last job, I spent a year or more searching for another job before I gave up and went on disability. I have impulse control issues, and many, many more problems, but I'm here to support you, not talk about me. I unfortunately don't have any resources for you to get a job, but I do have some advice and can offer some support. I agree that living on disability sucks. If you're not seeing a therapist and have the means to, I highly recommend it. It's helped me tremendously in coping with my situation (I recommend fining a cognitive behavioral therapist specifically). My therapist helped me come to accept my situation. It's a complicated thing. On the one hand working at a job of any kind can be incredibly rewarding. But working when you're disabled can also do harm to you. I've found that without the stress of a full time job, and not constantly being confronted with the ways my disability impedes my work, I'm actually happy for the first time in my life.   


It gets all the more complicated, however. I now have Medicare coverage and receive SSDI, which I believe (I'm by NO means an expert and could be wrong) you can only receive if you've worked a certain amount. 

Honestly that's about as much as I have to offer. I live with my parents and they support me, I'll probably be dependent on family for the rest of my life. I'm here if you ever need to vent or talk.

Her having low self-esteem doesn't give her a free pass to hurt people.  Don't be tricked into comforting *her*, if this is what's going on.

You have to set a precedent for yourself *right now*, a baseline for future relationships.  Yes, your disability does not come without ""issues"", but that doesn't mean you should be treated this way.  You have to value yourself and your company enough to draw the line where you already know it needs to be drawn (""being someone's consolation prize, they're ""punishment"""").  

I know that we internet strangers don't know anything else about your relationship and it's easy to say ""dump them"", but honestly, if I was in your situation I couldn't see anything that would make up for such a deep wound as what has happened to you.  Because now you'll always know what she really thinks of you, and how she really views your relationship.  Wouldn't you rather find someone who values you, enjoys your company, and wants to give to you as much as you give to them?

She could easily have asked for help due to her arthritis or just taken the form home to return later. 

I don’t always carry my cane, but I’m often unstable on my feet. That doesn’t give me license to demand someone move out of the disabled/elderly section on the bus so I can sit down.  I can ask, and they can say no. 

Coming from a place of trauma doesn’t excuse bad behavior. It can explain it, but it’s their responsibility to work through it enough so they can interact with people as neutrally as possible while keeping themselves cared for. 

Forgive my diatribe, I teach people how to communicate effectively from a place of trauma and how to have trauma-informed and sensitive conflict resolution-based discussions and it’s a passionate topic for me.",,,,thatsnotincense,,,1565298965,t5_2qhe8,t3_ckgogu,t1_evnqrvb,1,1573825620,0,0,ewddfrf,disability,,,,,

Big front wheels will help on uneven pavement or other uneven surfaces, but for steps or curbs you have to be careful.

As for the drifting, I also have a little bit of drift. I don't know if that's common, but I think it has to do something with the ""angle"" of the pavement.

168,"That's rough :( I wonder who put that sort of stuff into their head...  
If it helps: **Laziness isn't real**. Its not a real concept, because it relies on the idea that there aren't REASONS for things - which is false.The way I see it, there are two reasons to not do something:

1. You cannot do it. The reward for doing it isn't worth the pain it causes, or it is impossible. This is self preservation and a useful skill to have. There's no point working 60 hours a week to please your boss for a slight raise when its at the cost of loosing time with your children - not working 60 hrs a week is not lazy, its just not worth the prize.
2. It is not important. You feel indifferent or disinterested. This is what people normally mean by ""lazy"", but... why should someone do something they aren't interested in? I could be writing an essay on bicycle producers of the past 100 years but I don't give a shit. *That doesn't make me lazy.*  
If something is IMPORTANT to do but you DON'T do it: That's mental illness. Not doing, or feeling compelled to do, things to preserve your survival and comfort is mental illness.  
People being ""lazy"" is a dangerous concept for a kid to believe in especially. If they can't succeed at school because they feel disinterested in learning, or they simply cannot achieve their dreams, will they call themselves lazy?  
The only way to fix a problem is to identify whats causing it, and being 'lazy' isn't a cause, its a lack of empathy and understanding.  
I guess its pretty 'lazy' of someone to deem someone else lazy just because they don't want to actually engage with them.

175,"First off, it's good of you to look out after this woman.  It's quite kind.  It's nice that she has someone like you, who she can rely on.  Thank you for doing this.  

It's shameful that people discriminate against those that fall under the auspices of the ADA.  I would tell you friend that she should reach out to the local Housing Rights Authority (or similar agency) in whatever jurisdiction you live in.  Second, I would inform her to seek the services of a civil rights attorney.  She can look for one that specializes in housing rights, but it might not be necessary, since much of this is generalized discrimination.  If she's having difficulties accomplishing these tasks, you could possibly help her by doing some online searches and providing her w/ your results in an e-mail.  This might make it less overwhelming for her.

I would definitely have her speak w/ an attorney, however, since HOA lawsuits are quite common, and there are a number of states that require these disputes to be adjudicated in mediation sessions.  Therefore, tackling this from an ADA-claim angle may be the best way to go, rather than strictly trying to force the HOA to abide by your contract.

176,"That's terrible.  You never should've had to see that &amp; I'm sorry, both that she feels that way &amp; that you found out that way.  &lt;3  

I think deep down you *do* know how to feel about it.  A relationship without mutual attraction &amp; respect will never make it.  She's admitting to using you as a source of male attention/affection without loving you in return.  When she finds a different source of affection, she'll drop you &amp; you'll be kicking yourself for having wasted even longer with her after this happened.  The only thing to do in this situation is dump her &amp; get on with the process of rebuilding your independent life.  Grieving will be a big part of that because breaking up HURTS.  

Please don't let this awful episode affect your self image.  I know that's easier said than done, but what she's doing isn't necessarily about you at all.  If it wasn't you, she'd be victimizing someone else in the same way because SHE'S broken emotionally or whatever.  She clearly lacks empathy &amp; remorse which is a huge red flag.  You can do better, even if it means being single for a while.  But I understand the emotions involved and all that.

188,"Your high school GPA doesn't matter at all for attending a community college for transfer to a university as a Junior in-standing.  Only your college GPA will matter for transfer, in most cases.  You have a completely clean slate for transfer.  If you use this 2nd chance prudently by getting high grades in community college you could qualify for the best public universities in your state with full financial aid.  Being nearly 25 is an advantage for financial aid because you automatically qualify as an independent student and you'll probably get the maximum in federal and state grants and loans.  There are even some full-ride scholarships in InfoSec IT and loans that have government sponsored repayment by working for government agencies for a few years - agencies that are required to follow equal opportunity laws for disabilities.  These kinds of jobs usually REQUIRE a minimum of a bachelors degree, with a masters degree helpful and possibly needed to advance to higher skilled positions.

Guess where many of these govt agencies are located?  In VA, DC, and MD, of course, right in your area.

Many adult reentry students who did poorly in high school end up having higher GPAs and scholarship than average freshman, particularly when they're highly motivated because they see the value to the degree to access a specific career path.

Beside IT and computer related careers, there are medical technology careers in which a bachelors degree or higher is useful.  Many hospitals won't even consider applicants without degrees for these positions.

Let me put it another way.  What else are you doing that's more important than going to school?  You probably won't have to pay anything out of your pocket to do so.  You can always withdraw from school if you get a great job in your career path.  In the mean time, you'll be making progress to get a degree that officially certifies your education and that most employers DO recognize.  You might actually enjoy taking the classes specifically because nobody is forcing you to do so.  It's very different than high school.  

In the long view of potentially decades of working in a rewarding and enjoyable career, the time spent in college to qualify to access it is extremely short.   Every time you need to apply for a job, being able to proudly list your academic achievements along with your work history makes the process easier.

Do you have someone close to you, a friend, family, or counselor, who could help you analyze this situation and your feelings about it?

222,"First of all, I suggest that you use your disability status to maximize the amount of education and degrees that you can earn to qualify and to prepare yourself for an eventual career that you can make for yourself through entrepreneurship or find through government-positions.

If you don't have any college degrees or professional qualifications, then other people have no reason to give you credit for any skills and abilities you do have or that you gain with experience.   I also suggest that you spend some time researching which careers and professions would match your personality and desired workstyle, in addition to accommodating your medical conditions.   Read or listen to the book ""What color is my parachute? 2019"".  

You don't have to decide your career path right away.  Community college classes can be a good way to explore different subjects to see what you like and what you think will be worth the effort to pursue.  The classes can be fun and they help to keep you interacting with students and faculty to find hope in possibilities that you've never known or considered before.

One of my classmates in business school was a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic on a ventilator when I attended.  He was an A student and a pleasure to have in my group projects with him.  I know that it took him hours with his caretakers to get ready every day just to get to class and back, yet he excelled in his studies.

253,"Late response, but if your brother can quit long enough to complete the disability application/appeal/hearing process (and is approved) then he might be able to return to work after approval. ""Ticket to Work""  would allow him to earn a certain amount *in addition* to his SSDI or *with deduction* from SSI. If he's been earning only $500/month it sounds like he'd be eligible for SSI, which pays a max of $771/month. So, if he was approved for SSI, then returned to work, he would receive approximately $271/month on top of what he makes via employment. This may or may not be worth the (potentially several *years* long) disability application process. If he is an adult dependent of a qualifying caregiver, you may look to file the claim under that individual's record, which may qualify him for a higher monthly SSDI payment.

279,"Preface: I am hard of hearing/deaf and primarily communicate by reading lips (check my post history for verification.)

Slower is horrendous (I honestly thought this was widely understood amongst friends I’d be deaf community.) It wrongly emphasizes different parts of words, misshapen the mouth formations, and requires more work on the person “listening” than asking for a repeat of a key word. Think of a sentence “Hi, can I have two grande vanilla decaf frappes?” And say it as you normally would and and then say it slower. Notice that as you go slower you leave your mouth in position longer on some parts of words than others. This obscures the entire sentence rather than me usually just missing a small portion of it.

Edit: also mind you, lip reading is a huge misnomer. Usually it’s using a combination of context clues, knowing an individual speaker (I’m much more successful the more I know someone), using residual hearing, and then using the visual clue to put together “-i -ave -oo gr-e -I’ll de- frappes” to make the full sentence.",,,,graygoohasinvadedme,,,1564676016,t5_2qhe8,t3_ckgogu,t1_evpklxo,3,1573417175,0,0,evpluhm,disability,,,,,

I usually say something like “Hey my legs are not working, but my voice works just fine”. But just that fact that that happens ALL THE TIME is telling.

So I think it is a good thing for the world in general to see and hear us as the normal people we are.
If we keep giving people an option to ignore us and listen to a professional advocate we will still be unseen. So I feel we need to speak up ourself and not allow society to keep making us invisible.",,,,Smirgutt,,,1565803704,t5_2qhe8,t3_cq4sfe,t3_cq4sfe,3,1574133467,0,0,ewvcy6d,disability,,,,,

285,"Dude, be a mermaid.  I'm a chair user and that's my go-to costume.  Plus, w/the red hair?  It's a no-brainer.  Long ago I went to the fabric store, bought a bunch of shiny green material and made my own tail.  Decorated it with sequins and these silver coin spangle things I found at the craft store, attached them with glue -- not all over, that's too much work, just made clusters.  Then I actually bought some real, big clam shell halves, drilled some holes in them and threaded ribbons through to make the top.   But I can't wear them anymore because I'm much more busty than I used to be!  You could probably find a bikini top at a thrift store that would work.

I am visually impaired but it’s not yet to a point where it’s a real problem. I’ve started holding onto people again because for some reason or another my limbs will suddenly go dead.

It depends how hard a wheelchair is to use, I can’t even open a water bottle aha. I haven’t got a single muscle in my body. I’d have to use a manual one anyway because I have nobody to push me.

I can type paragraphs online but can’t open my mouth to a real person, huh.

I probably have an old ipad I can use for that kind of stuff, that’s if it still works.

425,"My response will probably be shorter than your post and won't include everything I'm trying to think of at the moment, but its brevity is not meant to be terse, just to preface this.

Some of what you're saying is stuff only you can answer. You mention trying to convince your parents that you ""should"" get a kitten, so really, they are the ones that, I guess, decide whether you ""can"" get a kitten. 

About running the cat over, well, I grew up around a whole farm of them and they are smart buggers. They are quick, and they will usually get out of the way. Though, perhaps not a very young kitten, until it is a bit older. You mention you don't control your wheelchair as well when you are excited or have something attached to the back of it. What do you attach there that interferes with that, and why does a heightened sense of excitement interfere with that? 

Cats are a pretty good animal to have as a pet for many disabled people because they pretty much look after themselves, so long as you remember to keep food in the dish and some water around. 

As for taking care of it, you mention ""helping to take care of it"" and ask how you might do that. But you would already know this, at least in part. *Can* you take care of a kitten, at least part of the time, seeing to its needs?  I don't think it needs to be an emotional support animal, but again, you would know this better than anyone else here would. 

You also mention your earlier kitten was given away because your dad was rough with it and you didn't know how to take care of it. 

Have both of those things changed? 

Once you can answer some of these questions, you'll be much closer to knowing whether it is a great fit for you and a new feline friend.

My only concern is the emphasis on ableism.  I think that if you're creating a society of activists to fight against the discrimination that is ableism, that's perfectly acceptable.  But, I think that if you want to be inclusive of everyone, it's best to go easy w/ the overt mention of ableism.  

This isn't to say that fighting against ableism isn't necessary.  I'm not saying this at all.  It is.  What I'm getting at is, I think that it's better to pick your battles and have propriety for time and place.  I think that you'll find yourself w/ a greater cross-section of the student body, if you bring able-bodied students in w/ the idea of trying educate them to understand, appreciate, and acclimate themselves to their fellow disabled students.  If you immediately jump in w/ an us vs. them ideology, I think that it will tougher.  And, you'll immediately alienate those individuals who are of the mindset that any change to the status quo disrupting their existence is just a politically correct maneuver, not something of real value.

Of course, once you bring in these types of students, you can then present the idea that we live in an ableist culture, which isn't good for anyone.

437,"Hi Rachel im Jack. Im sorry to hear you difficulties. I cannot walk but i can sit normally. But have a humpback and i think i kinda serious cuz my wrist and back dont have enough strength to handle my body. 

Actually i dont really know what can i do on exercising this aspect. So i always go to hospital to rehabilitate once a week even i dont think it is effective but at least keep my body from getting worse situation. The reason that i only go to hospital once a week cuz i need to go to cram school three times a week even on summer vacation like now. 

Answer to your next question,i do have close friends include males and females, my friends are willing to help me but they dont always have time to hang out for several days like living outside. 
Now i have a dream that is hanging out with my friends to another city to travel for serveral days. But you know. They wont always accept my invitation,i dont know they are really that busy or they just dont want to hang out with me for that much times. If my friends wont hang out with me then i just rather staying in my home and playing video games like a nerd. But im getting bored that stay at house all the time and dont want to be a guy that spent most of his life in house. Im a disability but i very like to hang out with people or just by myself. I very enjoy the moment i am at outside. So when my friends cant hang out with me. I very want to go by myself. I dont want to keep waiting. And the most important problem i need to deal with is moving my body and go into bathroom take a shower or poop. If my friends going with me i dont need to worry those things. But when by myself, thats a serious issue.

And for the cancer name or something, im quite sure that I've never seen a person who had same birth defect like me. So maybe im so rare that no one know what happened to my body. I look normal from my appearance except humpback. But inside my body it is still a mysterious.

Also dont worry i wont do anything that is dangerous to me like drink or take drugs. And i have several closed friends that grow up with me from elementary to senior high now. It just feel like you know they are your best friends but just wont hang out with you. Maybe at this moment you feel annoyed by i said HANG OUT for that many times or think im childish or selfish. The reason that i like to hang out because my parents  job seldom have breaks. Only just weekend they have space to be free. But they need to take rest during the weekend. But all i can do is staying at home and being bored or nothing to do except staring at the computer screen. I know people would tell me go reading go learning. But all i want to do is going out for several days to breathe freely. But seems like my parents dont have that much free time.

 Let me introduce the environment of my house where at. We live in Taitung in Taiwan which is a small city and the facilities for disabilities are lack.  Even i went out i not even know where im going lime i lost a destination. Just went out for nothing. I always want to go to Taipei as the capital city of Taiwan. Cuz there are much more convenient than Taitung. So that s my briefly introduction.

Thats why I always mention HANG OUT this word.

I dont really have questions or problems now, but i just like to express myself and communicating with people whether a stranger or a friend.

I have a mobility impairment but don't use a wheelchair for it, although I did quite a lot as a kid for the sake of my parents' convenience...

Anyways, there could be multiple reasons I suppose:

1. It is different, perhaps in their minds an ""exotic"" sort of conquest to add to their list. 
2. They may simply be wondering how intimacy works in that situation and what might be physically different about it.
3. They may have a kind of.... devotee nature that makes them want to be a caretaker (but you mentioned hookups and I guess this would apply to more long-term things).

I can only speak for myself, but I think wanting to hook up with someone for their disability can be just as bad or damaging as it being the only reason they reject an otherwise awesome partner. If it's your primary reason for hooking up... that's weird, I think. It's not the same as ""I just like redheads or nice butts"" or something like that. I guess you're right when you say fetish.

497,"I know it’s hard to cope with being different than you have been in the past, but if you think of the thoughts you have when you see someone on crutches with their leg in plaster (for example), you don’t feel scornful, disgusted or superior,  it’s more like a feeling of “goodness I’m lucky not to be in plaster on crutches” or a sense of compassion, or possibly you just acknowledge that doing simple things may be very difficult for that person. 

So most people actually have either a positive emotional response or a purely practical one to seeing someone with a disability.

Now, the hard part of having a visible disability is that it takes a lot of hard mental work to realise that people are likely to have the same sort of response to any accommodations or equipment you may need.  Just like you would if it were them. There is absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. 

Also, if possible, try not to compare yourself to other people whether they have a disability or not. It’s all too easy to say “I am not as bad as them so I shouldn’t complain” or “they have it so much easier than I do”. Neither of these thought patterns really help. 

What I try to do is remind myself that everyone has a scale of one to ten on their “how good do I feel today?” meter.  Now, as a person with a connective tissue disorder, I often dislocate joints. For me, it’s such an ordinary occurrence that it may only push my meter down by a point or two, whereas for my wife, it would absolutely send her meter into the negatives. So it’s quite possible that she can be feeling worse from an attack of hay fever on her “normality meter” than I could with a dislocated shoulder.  It’s just realising that everyone has a different level of “normal”. 

So you are possibly going to take some time getting used to being a person with a walker (which may feel totally crappy at first) but try to realise that eventually your “how good do I feel today meter” will soon accept it and it will just be another thing in your life.  No better and no worse than any other person.

Don't. If there is something you can't do in a wheelchair, just don't do it. If you absolutely need to do it, still don't. Many of us in wheelchairs did not have the capability of adjusting our cars or homes, so we had to live with what we had.

500,"Hey, I would just advise not to throw the word “lawsuit” around right away. This person is 100% legally wrong (and a total ass) but before threatening a lawsuit, especially if you don’t have any desire to actually go through with that, you can state very firmly that your legal right to accommodations is being denied and restate your requirements.  You do not need to phrase it as a question because it’s not a question, you are not asking, you are telling.  But I hesitate to tell you to throw the word lawsuit around because big organizations employ big law firms and they will immediately hand you off to legal and brand you as a “problem” going forward.  This is unfair and fucked up but a reality. It could affect your grades or your treatment by teachers in the future, and it’s hard to prove that.

So be clear, be firm, tell and don’t ask, but don’t threaten a lawsuit unless it’s truly at that point or you’re truly willing to throw down that way.  By making yourself seem empathetic, deeply reasonable, and legally correct, you’ll probably get a better long term result.

501,"I often need straws and am the kind of person who has problem asking because I'm also hard-of-hearing and afraid to talk to people extensively as a result. (Both disabilities are neurological in case you were thinking 'that's just a weird anomaly though', but I do think anxiety about being quizzed over why one needs a straw is the likelier case, especially for those who aren't visibly disabled.)

I'd always prefer to be able to go get myself a straw rather than ask someone, because communication in noisy places like restaurants is nigh-impossible for me and very terrifying as a result. Failing that, I'd rather be asked so I know one is available - but it's totally fair that you don't have the time to ask. It's possible a straw dispenser would just increase use way too much, though, in which case your solution is the best, and access to straw + not wasting straws &gt; convenience for me.

(Servers often refuse to speak to me and just speak to whoever I'm with like I'm a kid, which is definitely way worse - but I know it's a tough and fast-paced job and sometimes you don't have time to navigate those kinds of communication problems, and you want to make sure the order is right.

582,"I find myself in a similar situation with an AA, on a fixed income, and I live in Maryland.  It all comes down to if you have support or not and will your job provide healthcare.  Most of the jobs created since 2008 have been 'gig' and temporary.  Finding a 'good' job is difficult, even for educated 'normal' people.  The system doesn't do us any favors and makes it near impossible to get off.  Since the only real way to be financially independent is to go straight into a good job, 40hrs/week, with benefits.  Anything less and you mine as well stay on benefits since they are consistent (and include healthcare).  Even though they 'say' you can earn under a certain threshold, once you start doing so consistently they will shine a magnifying glass on you, and lose your benefits.  So (in my opinion) you can't work crappy jobs making 500/month because ultimately you will lose everything, which is why I say go for a real job or don't even bother.

It all comes down to if you have support or not and will your job provide healthcare.  Most of the jobs created since 2008 have been 'gig' and temporary.  Finding a 'good' job is difficult, even for educated 'normal' people.  The system doesn't do us any favors and makes it near impossible to get off.  Since the only real way to be financially independent is to go straight into a good job, 40hrs/week, with benefits.  Anything less and you mine as well stay on benefits since they are consistent (and include healthcare).  Even though they 'say' you can earn under a certain threshold, once you start doing so consistently they will shine a magnifying glass on you, and lose your benefits.  So (in my opinion) you can't work crappy jobs making 500/month because ultimately you will lose everything, which is why I say go for a real job or don't even bother.

587,"I understand the compulsion to help, I really do. My husband struggles with the same thing, and it can be really frustrating for both parties. I think it's more difficult for him to watch me hobble than it is for me to do the actual hobbling - in his head it would be easier if he just did it for me, but in my head I'm perfectly capable of clearing my own plate, and this is something I do all the time so if everyone could just calm down about it that would be great. 

Your boyfriend has been pushing his own chair for a while now, it's probably normal to him. The things that might look like a struggle from your perspective probably don't bother him, because he does them *all the time* and he's good at it by now. 

The most helpful thing you can do is let him *ask* for help, then provide it. And if he doesn't ask for help, you need to accept that. Unsolicited help can feel intrusive, condescending, or just plain annoying. If I'm in my chair, I want to control where I'm going, just like anyone else does - the whole point of the wheelchair or to provide independence and autonomy. When someone else pushes my chair, it takes that away from me, and us cripples have had that happen to us enough, thanks. I don't even like to let my husband push my chair, if that's an consolation.

Just know that you shouldn't take it personally if your boyfriend doesn't ask for help right away. Remember, he's with you because he wants a girlfriend, not a caregiver. He gets out of his car all the time when you're not there, so clearly he can do it well. It would be kind of like if he asked you if you needed help every time you tied your shoelaces, right?",,,,SwiftlyGregory,,,1565737877,t5_2qhe8,t3_cpzzy6,t3_cpzzy6,2,1574092907,0,0,ewszqxa,disability,,,,,

591,"Listen to music. That always helps my emotions flow the way I want them to, instead of letting them wreak havoc. I listen to metal and hard rock myself, and there's music in that category that can help you cry without feeling like shit afterwards, cheer you up (although happy songs are few and far between with this genre), or allow you to angrily vent, if that's your style. To me, there's nothing like listening to pounding, roaring metal when you're pissed off at the world.

Of course, you may not like the same music, but there's still plenty of stuff out there that serves the same purpose. I have no job, no pending college education, I'm forced to live with my parents, and I don't have a vehicle or friends with vehicles. I don't even have health insurance. For me, music is all I have that keeps me safe. Without it, I'd have gone under by now.

Another thing that could help you escape, just for a little while, is videogames. Getting lost in virtual worlds is a great distraction from the pain of reality. Of course, you shouldn't completely lose yourself. Running away permanently is never good. I mean, I play videogames at least 3 hours every day, so I guess that warning is rendered null and void coming from me. But still, great distractions.

599,"I have an invisible disability as well. (Totally fun!) I am also a wheelchair user when I need it. So, one thing that might help is to think about a wheelchair as an access tool like any other—it’s there to help you do the things you need to do, and there is no reason you should have to be in pain all the time just because you can technically stand. Use it on bad pain days—don’t use it on good pain days. If people give you a weird look because you can walk to get in and out of it—that is their problem.

Since you’re seeing a neurologist, I assume you have medical insurance of some kind? If so, you can talk to your neuro about writing you a prescription for a custom-fitted wheelchair. That way, your insurance will pay for some or all of the cost, and you can get a model that is made for the user to self-propel. Your doc doesn’t need to have an “official” diagnosis yet—all they need to do is write the script saying that it is medically necessary. It’s a bit of a process from there, which involves some waiting, having a wheelchair tech come measure your house, etc., but it can help you avoid eating all the cost.

If you do just want to buy your own chair without a script, I’ll just warn you against getting a $300 hospital chair off Amazon or something. The kind of wheelchairs that you see in hospitals are meant for someone else to push, and if you use them yourself for a while, you’ll totally mess up your neck.

611,"Posting here because I can empathize. My fiancé and I want a family but due to my chronic health problems (for which I’m on disability), I’m terrified I won’t be able to provide for my children the way I’d like to, at least not without sacrificing my health. 

My fiancé insists that he’ll be there, and that there’s always hired help. I don’t want to feel like I’ve outsourced the responsibilities of raising my children though. And I don’t want my partner to have to do everything, lest he grow resentful of my limitations. Not to mention the guilt and sadness I’ll feel missing out on things, and my concerns that I’ll get sicker and regret becoming a parent to begin with...

The list of my fears goes on, but I don’t mean to make your post about me...just wanted to commiserate and let you know that you’re not alone.

649,"Okay. :)

My kitten may have had abandonment issues that I wasn't informed enough to recognize.  At night, I'd go to bed and be lying on my back on my bed, and she'd climb onto me and knead the flesh at the inside juncture of my shoulder between my chest and my arm.  This may have reminded her of mommy cat's breast as I found out later that kittens who are still breastfeeding will knead their mother's breast in order to stimulate milk production.  Anyway, her habit of going behind the fridge may have been related to the fridge sounding like a large, purring cat from back there.  On one occasion a noisy building maintenance guy came in to work on the bathroom tiles and I was terrified that she'd slipped between his feet and gotten out into the hallway, but no.  She had somehow managed to squeeze between one wall and the base of the fridge, which was narrower than the rest of the fridge above it, and was hiding back there because it was her safe place of refuge.

Cats are generally claustrophilic.  They climb into boxes and bags because they like small, enclosed spaces.  That's natural and normal rather than morbid for a cat.  The small space behind the fridge, apart from maybe sounding like there's a big purring cat where the fridge is, is another attraction to a cat.  But it's usually hard to keep the floor clean back there and dust and other grunge gathers unless you clean it frequently, and the air back there is not healthy.  Also, a kitten may get her paw or nose or tongue too close to moving parts or parts that conduct electricity, and may eat any grunge that has piled up back there or lap up any leaks from the fridge you haven't noticed.  So either make sure she can't get behind the fridge or keep an eye on her to see when and how often she goes back there and how much time she spends there.

Related to that is the cabinet under the sink, where many people keep cleaning supplies that are toxic and can be fatal if a cat licks them.  Kittens are curious and they love pawing doors open.  Mine figured out super quickly how to paw open that cabinet door and it was the very divell for me to stop her from doing it.  In the end I had to get a lock installed on that door, which the property manager didn't much like but accepted.  No, cats can't pick a good key lock.

Because I did know that cats like small spaces, I had pulled some furniture away from the walls so she could go behind it.  That by itself is inadvisable as a kitten can easily get stuck or hurt when she does that.  But one piece of furniture was an old legless fibre-upholstered couch.  My kitten went behind it, chewed a hole in the fibre, and climbed inside the damned couch--when I wasn't home!  So I get home and call to her and hear her meow from what sounds like UNDER the couch.  I get so terrified that she's pinned under there that I grab one end of that piece of furniture and damned near lift it off the ground such that the next day I couldn't get out of bed and had to ask my doctor for back pain medication and get some bed rest.  Right after I lifted the couch, however, my back still hadn't cooled down so I didn't know that I had injured it.  All I knew was that she wasn't under the couch, so I put it back down and looked everywhere for her until I saw the hole she'd made in the weave in the back and was able to reach in and pull her out.  In the process I discovered three nails that hadn't been bent at the ends and were simply sticking up with exposed points.  I nearly died realizing that when I had lifted that couch I could easily have caused her to fall right onto one of those nails.  After that I darned near carried her around the apartment in my arms nonstop for the rest of the day until she must have been sick and tired of me.  She wasn't hurt but she was quite smelly from having been inside the back of that couch and other areas of the apartment where dust had built up because I didn't notice it--such as behind various pieces of furniture.

I ended up having her bathed by a groomer, and that was a bit traumatic for both of us.  When she was dry she had a lovely, glossy coat of long fur, but when wet she shrunk to a chihuahua shape, and her meows of misery were unique in a way I never heard before or since and shook me up.  Afterwards she kept sneezing until I took her to the vet and the vet found that she hadn't caught a cold, or anything.  She was perfectly healthy but I still had to pay the vet for the examination.

She was strictly an indoor cat, and there were only a few occasions when I took her outside.  One time was when the landlord had scheduled a building-wide fumigation even though I'd never seen any signs of bugs in my apartment or talked to any neighbours who had.  Apart from the usual bullshit of emptying my kitchen cabinets and piling everything in the middle of the room under a protective tarp so not too much of the spray would land on them, I couldn't leave my kitten at home.  On my way to work I put her in her carrier and took public transit to a friend's house.  My friend also had a kitten of a similar age and when I left they were play-wrestling.  When I came back after work they were still play-wrestling...well, okay, not still, but that was how it looked from my perspective.  Both cats had enjoyed themselves, but when my friend's kitten appeared to sense that my kitten was going home, he began vocalizing so miserably and just wouldn't stop.  My own kitten seemed to be fine with going home because she knew her own carrier and she knew me.  On public transit well after sunset, as this was in winter, half the damned passengers on the bus wanted to say hello to my cat.  One teen girl even had her fingers in front of the wire front of the carrier for her whole bus ride.  I didn't see any harm and my kitten seemed happy about it.

I ended up making arrangements with a freelance photographer for photos of her, and I gave most of the small sample prints to friends but still kept the main one I'd had enlarged.  Apart from making me aware that she had ear mites I hadn't recognized people seemed really delighted with her.  I'm happy to share a scan of that photo on a private basis so you're free to PM me for it if you want.  I don't want to post it publicly.

On another occasion I just wanted to go to a local park and took her there in her carrier as well, watching her carefully so she didn't bolt away from me.  She ate a blade of grass, and I thought that was strange.  Only later I found out that cats naturally eat small amounts of grass to make themselves throw up, as licking their own fur to bathe themselves causes some buildup of fur balls in their stomachs and they do need to barf up those fur balls.  That's natural, but if you don't know what it looks like when a cat is throwing up it's terrifying.  It looks like whole-body convulsions.  The goddamned devil had me cleaning the litter box at the time she wanted to use it to throw up and I was idiot enough to ask her to wait a few minutes and lift her out of the box until she started having what looked like convulsions and I nearly shit myself yet again.  A vet explained everything to me but there went another consultation fee and another round trip through town on public transit with a cat carrier.

I bought her a huge double dish with one half for food and another for water.  That dish was really intended for a dog significantly bigger than my kitten, but my stupid plan from the first was just to keep the dry food and water topped up and change the water from time to time.  She never developed a weight problem by being free to eat any time she wanted, but she got so used to the sack of expensive dry food I bought that she forever refused to eat absolutely anything else.  Well, okay, there were two exceptions.  Because I had deliberately found an apartment within walking distance of the office when I started a new job, I began coming home for lunch and opening cans of sardines, and she would beg without respite for sardines until I simply started putting a plate on the floor for her and sharing my lunch with her.  That was a good time, but it really wasn't fair to leave her all by herself in the apartment while I was at the office.  And if I ever wanted to be away from home for a few days it was something of a headache to make arrangements for someone to check in on her.  The superintended once told me that I was known around the building as ""The guy with the noisy cat"" as apparently she had once spent a prolonged time meowing for me at the door while I'd been at work.  After that I found people I trusted to visit with her during the day when I wasn't home, but it was an imposition on them and likely harmed my friendship with them.

I once had to do laundry and saw no harm with my kitten coming downstairs to the laundry room with me.  So I was carrying a laundry basket in both hands and she was walking around tentatively.  Everything was fine until the elevator door started to close, and suddenly she bolted for that door and damned near got crused by it.  I managed to stick my foot in the door just in time to make it open by sensor.  Then I had to put my basket down in the middle of the hallway because she began playing a game of run a few steps and look at me, and when I got close she'd run a few more steps and look at me again.",,,,Sirisalo,,,1566524543,t5_2qhe8,t3_ctqvzp,t1_exro2fh,1,1575324608,0,0,exrumq8,disability,,,,,
650,"Do you mean she can't take that you might not want little kids? You have some very valid reasons. I have CP and although neither I nor my partner want kids at this point (or likely at all) these are all things I have considered--I have to use a cane to walk and could not chase after a kid that wanted to run away, for example.

I get that your GF loves babies, that's cool and all. But fostering can have a positive impact on the kids' lives and both of yours. Adoption is also great, though I know that still leaves the issue of caring for toddlers. Myself and my siblings were adopted, and there are so many existing kids that need homes.

Do you mean she can't take your fear of it? You concerns are valid and you guys should discuss all of this if you haven't done it already. Unfortunately, our realities differ from ableds, and there are legitimate concerns. I do know of a few disabled parents, but they don't have the exact same issues that you do.

690,"That will probably work out fine, as you aren’t legally required to disclose any disability at any point in the process unless you want to, so more than likely, that is par for the course for your HR/accommodations officer. If it helps, when I talked to mine, she said that it is wonderful when people disclose early—as in, not waiting until their disability interferes with their work.  If you like, you could even frame the discussion in terms of performance, as in “I need this talk-to-text software and headset, and since I am concerned about disturbing my neighbors, it would be helpful to get soundproofing tiles in my cube as well.”

I think if you go to the ADA website, you can look up common examples of “reasonable accommodations” per disability types, if that is something that might reassure you before going into HR.

Bare bones, cheapest chair I can suggest for temporary use would be the Rebel by Drive. It's not an amazing chair, but it will survive a good couple of months use and abuse. You'll find them all over the internet around $120-180USD depending on site and shipping costs.

If you're looking for something long term that can handle some tough love and be repaired with parts sourced from a hardware store, I would point you toward the [RoughRider by Whirlwind](https://whirlwindwheelchair.org/). It's just under $900USD, has a bit more customizability than the cheap temporary folders, and can be repaired much more easily and cheaply than most other chairs.

There is a pretty big gap in between those price points, but there's an even bigger one still between these and base model rigid chairs or custom folding chairs under 20lbs. Realistically if you're looking for a long term, rigid chair you'll be spending north of 2k. Most base model prices are pretty much just for the frame, maybe some upholstery if you're lucky.

If, on the off chance you end up going custom, I'm a huge fan of TiLite. I absolutely love my Aero Z, though the dual tube Aero T looks slick too. If you've ever had someone else move your chair without your permission you'll definitely want to consider the fold down push handles.

So just make sure you've got all the issues your dad faces ready to talk about in detail.

There are plenty of people with disabilities who actually don't need the benefits because they don't need care or mobility etc. These are the people the state is looking to get off benefits.

734,"There are several types of potential disability benefits. Some states offer to their residents but most don’t.. Most full time jobs have short and long term disability plans that cover you. Then there is social security disability (SSD). 

Don’t know what state you’re in. 

To qualify for ssd you must be disabled from all work and it’s highly unlikely you qualify. 

However if you have short term disability coverage the main difference from SSD (aside from paying sooner) is that you do NOT need to be completely disabled. Just disabled from your own occupation. 

Everyone’s job has different physical and mental demands. A fireman needs to be able to sprint and carry 150 pounds. An accountant just needs to sit and be able to focus for extended periods of time. In your case you need to be in your feet all day. You would very possibly qualify. 

I’d recommend finding out if you have coverage as step 1. Then talk to your doctor about your pain and inability to stand and walk all day. Your doctor saying you  “can’t work” won’t hold water but if they say truthfully “limited only occasional standing and walking” then state what care plan is (testing, therapy, rest etc) very likely to get you approved.

Mentally ill people are in need of help. One of the saddest stories I ever heard was a new inmate telling me that the reason he held up a McD's was he was hungry and couldn't figure out any other way to get food. When he had eaten his fill he told them that they could call the cops. Others that could not on their own take their medication correctly. Saw one guy trying to renew his meds two weeks early at the drugstore because he had already taken them all. 

Many mentally ill people ARE locked up 'involuntarily' and it is the jails that they are in where they get basically no mental health care and when they have served their time, they are released back onto the streets to yet again ""lather, rinse and repeat"". One of our nurses left for a community health position and where she met up again with one of our ex-inmates, and he had been going for his care. He had stayed in jail without parole - his choice - served his whole sentence. One day they found him with a blood sugar reading of a 1000 and for those that don't know, the normal range is around 70-110 or thereabouts. These people can not take care of themselves. The guy that held up the McDs for food, I'm sure that the corporation would have rather given him food that he needed, rather than the possibilities of the tragic outcomes that could have happened. Our mental health system in the USA is a disaster and we should be ashamed that these sick people are left to try and function on their own.

765,"Artists will produce art regardless of whether or not they get income. Mostly because most of us see it as a way of life. Just like anything else, they still need to work to make ends meet, and thus we tend to make art not for a sole source of income but rather because it's part of our identity.

That said, buying art without capitalism means the benefactor would be the State. And the State would only endorse art that agreed with the State's ideals and philosophy. This is no different than a private buyer, aside from not being possible under capitalism in this example.

Thus, an artist making art wouldn't cease just because capitalism didn't exist.

It really was nice to date someone who gets it on a level no one else has ever gotten it with me.  Made some things very easy -- the ""education"" part of the relationship was pretty minimal compared to everyone else I had dated.  I usually have anxiety when first dating because of all the bathroom stuff I have to eventually explain, but most of that anxiety was gone with him, which was awesome.

There were certainly logistical problems; both our chairs wouldn't fit in his car, so most of our time was spent at my house.  We could at least go on drives while leaving my chair at my house, though.  And I will admit that sex was a bit frustrating.  We just kept having a hard time figuring out positioning that worked for us, even with cushions and toys and such.

Unfortunately, for me there wasn't enough of a sexual/romantic spark for me to see us together for the long term, so it didn't last.  Did the positioning issues have anything to do with that?

If you hold someone's hand the same way a child does, maybe other people tend to see you as a child. Or if you hold the hand of another teenager or young adult, they think you are dating him or her (and look at you because they think you are lesbian...).  
You might look on the National Institute for the Blind's website as they have suggested ways to help guide a blind person. I can't describe it from memory, but basically if your companion holds your hand or arm that way, you will be seen as a person with an eyesight problem rather than a kid. Maybe you'll face the ""poor cripple"" stereotype, but that's another issue.  
Finally, if your problem is seeing or reacting to stairs or other floor issues, maybe a cane would help being more stable or a white cane would help assessing the floor. And it will help a bit with other people's reactions. Besides, people would not look at you with angry eyes when you use the toilet for disabled people because you will be showing that you need the added support.

**Wheelchair?** Not knowing your limitations, it's hard to recommend a specific model. But if you can handle a manual wheelchair, you will certainly get more exercise by pushing a wheelchair a long time rather than by walking just a little bit before you get exhausted/injured/etc. So if you can push a chair (either with your hands or even with a combination of hands and feet), use one, find interesting places to go and do something. On that regard, maybe find groups or activities outside the home that you like, so you won't see exercise as a chore but rather as something interesting.

**Being non-verbal – not talking.** Again, why? Is it because you can't physically make a sound, can't control your mouth well enough  to have understandable speech or are so shy that you can't speak to anyone except your mother? But you say that you type on the computer. Why not get a cheap tablet and run some kind of text to speech application? I haven't any specific recommendation, but a basic tablet costs about $200 in Canada and there are many applications on Google Play that do text to speech. Besides, if you look around, you might find someone who has an old tablet that isn't modern enough for their needs and that you could get for next to nothing. Apart from that, if your handwriting is decent, you might also carry a notepad and pencil. It's a bit messier but you can't complain about the low tech aspect!

**As for your last question ""Is there anything that I can buy and says that I am non-verbal?""**  
Maybe. But is it necessary? You might prepare your own version and print it at home on a small card. And once you find the formulation that works the best for you, you could have it plasticised at any office supply shop (ex.: Staples). What should you write? Maybe something like, *""I have a disability and cannot talk However I can hear you. If you have a quick question, please make it a yes or no question; otherwise, leave me a few seconds so I can get my tablet and will be able to reply and discuss with you.""* (In a nutshell, tell them how to communicate with you).

**Staring at people (vs being stared).** Human beings are curious by nature, so it's normal to look at people who look or feel unusual. But there is a fine line between normal curiosity and downright impoliteness or rudeness. As for *you* staring to other people, I would say the same rules apply to you; however, quite frankly, if they are already staring at you badly, you are just giving them their own medecine.

I call my partner 'bitch' constantly. Its a pet name. Some people use ""pumpkin"", I say ""big bitch"" and he says ""little bitch"". In my country ""cunt"" is a common word used for your close friends - a term of endearment.

Calling someone stupid or crazy has no power by itself as words. All language is is barking - its the intent, emotion and context behind the barks that matters, not the sound.  
You shouldn't go around calling people anything they don't want to be called as a general rule, as its hurting them. It doesn't matter what the word is.  


My issue with the media calling violent offenders crazy isn't with the term ""crazy"" - its with the fact they feel the need to call them anything in the context of it being bad, outside of their actual factual actions. They may aswell call them ""ugly"" - its about as relevant to the situation. No matter the word use - the BARK is one of dehumanization.

878,"So we recently had to make this decision, as my parents are getting older (already disabled) and I am in a moderate decline in mobility. We live in a more rural (aka 2 hours from the closest large city, but we don't live in the middle of nowhere) part of MO, where land prices are not super expensive, but labor is still a huge cost. 

We were deciding between remodeling our current home, buying/remodeling a new home, or finding land and building to suit needs. In the end, the costs of building new were too great to justify given what will likely happen in the next 10-15 years. If you are younger and will be living in an area where you can recoup the investment, building to your own spec is likely the best, if most expensive option. It will save you money in the long run by being customized to your specific needs. Because my dad is likely to go first, mom and I figure that we will likely sell the house and move into a condo/less maintenance situation, so it didn't make sense to build for us. 

Ultimately, I spent 18 months researching and speaking to pros and knowledgeable amateurs at the [Houzz](https://Houzz.com) kitchen forums. I designed our new kitchen remodel that included converting my dad's old office into a main floor laundry and pantry, so that mom and I don't have to use the steps. Dad turned one or our basement rooms into his office with ensuite. He has access to the back yard/driveway and we are working towards converting the rest of the basement area into a guest suite with kitchenette. It was far from cheap, but I'd say we are 75% done with remodeling the entire house (built in 1973 and almost completely original until 2 years ago). We've probably spent about $100k total, including extending/redoing the concrete in the driveway to make it easier to access. 

Projects we've done: Removed all carpeting (except in the bedrooms) and replaced with laminate click flooring or tile. Redid the bathroom to remove the tub and put in a step in shower with grab bars. Redid kitchen to include drawer storage (to limit the amount of reaching overhead needed) and better storage and prep areas. Redid living, dining and hallway to improve viability and ability to use a walker or rollator.  

If you do decide to build, check out the houzz forums, as they can be most helpful. Also look into elevators. A lot of accessible houses are being built with elevators in mind.

We live in a more rural (aka 2 hours from the closest large city, but we don't live in the middle of nowhere) part of <LOCATION>, where land prices are not super expensive, but labor is still a huge cost. 

We were deciding between remodeling our current home, buying/remodeling a new home, or finding land and building to suit needs. In the end, the costs of building new were too great to justify given what will likely happen in the next 10-15 years. If you are younger and will be living in an area where you can recoup the investment, building to your own spec is likely the best, if most expensive option.

879,"I jumped (hopped?) right into full-time. After I got the job I went into the vocational rehabilitation office and filled out some forms for the Ticket to Work program -- the whole idea is you can go shoot for the moon and SSDI keeps paying out for a year while you're working. They cut it off after a year of steady employment, but you stay on the books for longer -- if your disability flares up or worsens to the point where you can't work anymore, SSDI picks back up.

They forgot to turn off my SSDI after a year, but I kept that money separate (and you should too, if they ever overpay you!) and didn't spend a dime, so I could give it back right away. Other than THAT snafu, it was a really straightforward, common-sense program that basically worked exactly as it should. Voc Rehab can also help people find jobs, but I didn't test that part of it.

884,"I doubt anyone likes that feeling.  I'm going to copy/paste something below that I commented on someone else's post when they asked about how to deal with being patronized to.  Maybe you might get something out of it:

""OK, so I've been thinking a lot about this and I'm just going to tell you what worked for me that made me let go of a lot of the anger I felt towards people who are condescending to me. Sorry it's so long. I've been using a chair for 19 years, but I remember the early years and how I was so shocked and angry about how differently I was treated. Eventually I realized that something had to change before I literally raged myself into an early grave.

Are you a white male? The reason I ask is because for many white dudes, acquiring a visible disability is the first time in their lives that they deal with real discrimination, and unlike women or people of color, they don't really have a mental tool box to draw from to deal with it. For example, when my mom goes to the hardware store male employees will often be patronizing to her (but well-meaning!). This has been happening to her for years; we women are used to dealing with this type of stuff. So when I landed in a wheelchair, being condescended to because of it wasn't my first rodeo. If you're a white male it might be a bit more shocking to you.

Anyway. For me, the way I learned to deal with the anger is something that may be a hard pill to swallow: You have to learn to be compassionate towards those who are being condescending and patronizing towards you. You might think, ""Why should I be the one who has to be compassionate towards these fuckers?"" It's because these fuckers are ignorant of disability. Like, literally ignorant. Ninety percent of the able-bodied community has NO IDEA about disability -- NONE. They don't know about wheelchairs, they don't know about TBI, they don't know about blindness, they don't know about living with Autism, they don't know about MS flare-ups...they don't know SHIT.

When it comes to disability, the vast majority of the able-bodied community is at the level of a first-grader. But they think they are at least at the level of a high-schooler. They are condescending to you because they THINK they know as much or more than you do about what's best for you. But the reality, which you and I know very well, is that we are the experts (duh). And you can't expect a first-grader to do algebra -- you can't expect able-bodied people to ""get it"". They won't. But they'll act like they do, and you have to accept this.

We are the parents and they are the condescending children who roll their eyes and think they know everything, and they act accordingly towards you. And as the parent, you have two choices: You can sink to their level and let them get under your skin, or you can be an adult and rise above and know that when it comes to disability awareness, the world is still at the first-grade level. It's unfortunate, but that's how it is. You have to, paradoxically, treat them like children: guide them gently, but don't let them get away with shit that's not OK. Set boundaries; be firm if needed. Use a clear voice, and if they don't respond, use your loud voice. Let them know who's in charge, but don't be mean. Be confident and factual.

You have to build maturity and compassion. It's hard, it sucks, and it shouldn't be this way, but it is. The hardest part for me is knowing that on top of all the other disability shit I have to deal with -- pain, limitations, poverty, discrimination -- I also have to be the mature one, I have to be the one who understands the very people who hurt me. Fuck that! ...But really, in the end it's about making my own life more bearable.

 Walking will do your Heart and your Circulation a lot of good, which is very important with any kind of Peripheral Neuropathy. 

Walking will also help keep your weight in check, which will have a direct impact on your pain- if you weigh more, it makes sense that walking would hurt more. Some people totally stop walking after getting a wheelchair, so you might have to consider that risk too.

927,"I'm a fan of dumbells. I'm not sure what level of strain you can endure, but avoiding bending at the waist at all -  
Lateral raises and Front raises serve me well for specifically working the shoulder/pecs. Very easy - dumbbell in each hand, stand straight and raise your arms to the side until 90degrees or in-front of you until 90 degrees, hold and SLOWLY drop. You might need to use a lighter weight than you would normally for curls, always start small.  


Skull Crushers. This is more of a tricep move. Lay on your back, hold dumbbells in each hand above your head then bend your elbows so the dumbbells almost touch the ground on either side of your head. Don't do this one till exhaustion - you don't want weights right near your head when an arm gives out!  


Pull overs - need a bench or table for this so your dumbbell can dip slightly lower than your head without hitting the floor.  
Grasp the head of a dumbbell in both hands, lay on your back and slowly, with straight arms, let it drop behind your head until you feel a strain in your chest. Lift till vertical and repeat.

The main has a lot fo anxiety whereas this character is incredibly confident and charismatic. Basically, in the context of this game their an extremely powerful and effective person as compared to the main, and acting as something of a role model. The reason I was worried is because the idea of having them have a disability came from that perspective, I personally don't think I've seen to many characters with disabilities who have that role, and even less so when the context of the story supports that effectiveness and confidence.

1046,"It's very annoying. What is worse, using the mobile wage reporting app, while very convenient, seems almost pointless in these cases because they use 3-month old information to make a determination about whatever your current month's payment should be. This results in near-constant ""overpayments"" on my end as well. If they would just look at the earnings I report every month, on time, there would be no issue. But they've decided it's more efficient to use dated information. I sometimes get multiple letters in the space of a couple of days apart in which they change the amount and then change it back. 

At the very least, I'd prefer to not receive physical letters, since I have the online portal and am signed up for paperless.

1084,"Took me 3 years and 3 denials to get approved, what you have and I have are largely similar, except I have psoriatic arthritis and not fibro. You need a lot of determination, don't get discouraged, and GET A GOOD LAWYER. I wasted time with the free lawyer they gave me and she was terrible and barely knew my case and never even called me, didn't even know my hearing was approaching in like 3 months. I dropped her then and there and found a good local lawyer who only gets paid if I do. He was leagues better and worked with me every step of the way and actually cared about me and winning my case. He almost didn't take my case since it was only a few months from my hearing, my sympathized because my other lawyer totally dropped the ball. So get a good lawyer early, keep seeing docs for physical and mental issues, keep getting your medications regularly, make sure you have a doctor that believes you are disabled because eventually, you will need them to file forms stating how disabled you are and how much they believe you, etc. 

Having on record that over those years my conditions had worsened, I required higher and higher doses of meds ti control pain and mental issues, had regular doctor visits etc really helped. It said in my final paperwork/ letter from the judge that he put the most weight with my rheumatologist's opinion and documentation, but I am also approved for major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is get a good lawyer early so that they can put you at ease about this stuff. There are no odds it's just about NEVER GIVING UP like my lawyer said. They deny everyone hoping like 50% or more will say F it and never reapply.",,,,_steve_rogers_,,,1565379571,t5_2qhe8,t3_co1efg,t3_co1efg,2,1573877062,0,0,ewgdql7,disability,,,,,

I started oxygen a few weeks ago... why do you need the tank? If you need it, oxygen level being low enough, it shouldn't be an issue... my doctor wrote a prescription and we filled it at a durable medical supplier who deals with oxygen.

A tip from experience: Don't get the tank - get an inogen. I was on the tanks for a month and hated them in comparison. I'm now on a portable concentrator and its much better. Insurance didn't pay, so I had to pay the $1500 for a refurbished Inogen G3 out of pocket.

1163,"For what it's worth, I have some advice:

&amp;nbsp;


1) Record the interview. You aren't allowed to openly record the interview unless you have specialist equipment, but record it on a phone or with a hidden video camera. That way you'll have a record of what was actually said during the interview and you'll be able to refute the total garbage that the DWP will read in the report.


&amp;nbsp;


2) Expect rejection. Immediately ask for a reconsideration, but expect rejection at that stage too. Go for an appeals tribunal, no matter how discouraged you are. The good news is the appeal people are completely separate from the DWP and they do a much better job of assessing people.

&amp;nbsp;


3) Prepare for a long wait, possibly over a year before you get to an appeal tribunal. Sorry, but it's a long haul. Go to Citizens Advice for help and use a food bank to help make ends meet.

&amp;nbsp;


4) If it goes as far as a tribunal, ask them to make any award for longer than the standard 3 years. If your dad's disability is permanent then you may get a 10 year award, which stops the DWP coming around every 2 years to strip your dad of his benefits.",,,,BlueBear63,,,1565338743,t5_2qhe8,t3_cnva03,t3_cnva03,7,1573850966,0,0,eweut56,disability,,,,,

1166,"I’m so sorry this happened to you. It’s not fair and it’s not right. 

I’m not sure if it’s helpful, but lately I’ve been thinking of taking care of myself as a full time job. When your body is running atypically, it may need different attention than the “average” person without a disability. 

Maybe you can think through some scripts of how you’d respond if this happened again. I do this a lot when I am disappointed with how something went down. I think it could be potentially interesting to start addressing your niece as if she’s smart enough to understand adult things. A lot of kids respond to that. 

“Kidsname, I realize you’re upset about not being on your phone, but the things you’re saying are really hurtful. Yes, I am living at home without a job and not attending school. This is because my body runs differently and takes a lot of energy (or whatever phrasing makes sense here) to manage. If you don’t understand why that is, let me know so we can talk it through.”

That’s being a little nice about it. The “you don’t understand because you’re too young” path can add salt to the wound. She probably was angry and embarrassed to get her phone taken away and lashed out and you were collateral damage. Still not right or fair. I think the goal would be to get things back to her but diffuse the situation. 

But you are in no way obligated to do that! Perhaps you can talk to your sister about this as well. Ask if there’s more you can do to educate her kids about your disability. 

At the end of the day, take care of yourself and don’t worry about others. But we live with others and frequently have to deal with them, so hopefully these ideas can help?

Disabled experience isn’t something you can just try on over an able body and then claim to understand. To be perfectly honest, the whole experiment sounds very Othering and dehumanizing. Which is the opposite of what you claim to want to do.

If it makes a difference, I echo the other commenters’s suggestions—watch the <PERSON> videos you’re already watching, read blogs and follow disability rights Instagrams, read Disability Studies articles and books. Go out and *educate yourself* on disability until you are comfortable enough to treat disabled people just like everyone else. Because we are just like everyone else—we just have to do things in a different way.

But trying on disability for your personal gratification does exactly zero to help disabled people, and, I would say, has the ability to cause active harm through objectification and dehumanization.","[{'start': 1192, 'end': 1200, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

1194,"NO. She can’t do this.  There are government enforcement agencies who deal in making sure the ADA is enforced.  Google the name of your county plus “ADA compliance” or “ADA file complaint”.  In my county I called a hotline and got a real person who started to guide me through getting what I needed and was going to make a call to deal with my apartment complex herself up until they shaped up.

It’s not for your professor to decide if your disability is “worthy” of an accommodation. She does not have that authority. It is her job to comply.  Honestly though, unless this course is required for you, you may want to see if the university can shuffle you around, because this professor is going to resent having to accommodate your disability, and I wouldn’t eat that bias to come out (intentionally or subconsciously) in her treatment of you or your grades

I’m sorry people suck so much.

Edit:  by the way, when it comes to the legality of your accommodations, you may need your doctor to go farther than just documenting your disability itself, and document exactly what you need (the specific tech) and why you need it (because carrying heavy materials exacerbates your condition and will make you sicker).

My paid parking space was destroyed in a storm (carport destroyed) and while it was under construction parking was a free for all in the “guest” spaces. I couldn’t walk more than a few feet and my apartment complex had legal paperwork showing my disability status, and a letter from my doctor, but the ADA office told me it had to be even more specific and outline why an unassigned space wasn’t good enough and literally how many feet from my doorway the space needed to be.

We, our society, has told people to ""shoot for the moon,"" for so long that we've forgotten that aiming for outrageous goals isn't useful. All we can do is compare ourselves to who we were yesterday, not who we would like to be, or who we respect the most, or who we hope to be in the future.

So rather than big goals, we set the biggest goals *that we think we can do* and work on those.... and they take practice. Maybe you'll make it through lunch today, but not tomorrow. It takes work and time to establish new habits and patterns of living. And we're going to fall back... a lot....

1302,"Since this is an RPG one thing to avoid is the character having a non- disability.
This is something comics do often. A character will be missing a limb, or be cripple, or have a sense impairment but also have tech like a mechanical arm, leg, ear, whatever; that is better then flesh and blood. Begging the question ‘why is he/she even considered disabled?’

Another thing to keep in mind is the difference between someone who becomes disabled and someone born that way.
Those who become disabled go through a period of having to adjust to having their disability and realizing their new limitations, new things they have to do everyday, and how much their life has been changed by it. Army movies do this a lot.
This can feed into the character depth if their new disability renders them unable to do something they once loved and they have to accept that. 

For those born disabled that is just part of them. They have lived with it all their lives and to a constructed their lives around what they can and cannot do. 

To use the horse example someone else brought up someone born crippled isn’t going to care as much about not being able to ride horses as some who used to before being injured.

I think the best way to show disability without us pitying the person or using him for easy sympathy is to show the maintenance. 
Probably the biggest way a disability affects you is in how much is added to your daily routine. 
The normal friend in your game for example can likely get himself up and ready in 5 minutes. For the person in the wheelchair it might take 10 minutes because he has to do more to get ready.
He can still perform the task just as well as anyone else. It just takes him longer because it requires more steps for him.",,,,ShadowSpider9,,,1566280100,t5_2qhe8,t3_cr0qm8,t3_cr0qm8,1,1575136624,0,0,exgxko8,disability,,,,,

1451,"I’m not certified or trained in any systematic way, most of what I teach is rooted in the communication styles one sees in relationship therapy (I’m heavily influenced by the BDSM/kink communities as well as more general psychology and therapeutic counseling) but honestly what usually gets used the most is what I term “military speak”. I was in the Army and found that their utterly basic (and at times incredibly cumbersome) method of communication both verbal and written would translate very well when discussing emotional topics. (They call it “breaking it down Barney style” as in Barney the Purple Dinosaur, basically reducing a multi step or complicated task to its barest components and starting there)

There’s also a lot of education and myth busting or common defense mechanism identification that goes on. It doesn’t always stick, to have a trauma-educated conversation means not only does one need to understand their own traumas and how that can influence their perceptions, they must also understand the other person’s trauma as well. I find the most difficult part of all of it is even if both people have suffered, if the trauma is different they can oftentimes fall into the trap of Trauma Olympics and it can devolve into who has the better “claim” to trauma. 

There’s a lot of good happening with discussing intersectional social justice issues and various other ways to communicate effectively.

1457,"A few years back my husband and I visited a guy that made parts for him in his work. We knew he was blind, he had no qualms about talking about. He went completely blind after birth I think it was congenital cataracts. His wife was younger than him, he worked from home with some interns to learn how to do what he did so they did the stuff he couldn't see. This guy was amazing he could speak and understand 13 languages including 2 different Chinese ones. I think the only thing that I thought was odd as you never see a couple doing this after they had been married a year or two and they had been married 30-40 years. He was constantly nuzzling her, and touching her in a romantic way, not just to be sure she hadn't moved away. They lived in a beautiful home, they both worked, she did the driving. interesting couple to watch. Throughout the years I have been around blind people or those that were legally blind and I remember walking by a dorm room one day and the blind girl's roommate was dealing with the zits and blackheads on her roommates face since she couldn't see them herself. That is a real sign of kindness and love which was emphasized at our college.

I'm not sure how much longer it will be, but my husband is going blind. He has a congenital eye problem and has had his corneas replaced twice. He hasn't been able to read even a large print book for several years now. He has two monitors so he can blow everything up big enough to see details. He tends to be oblivious about things that are tiny, like fruit flies invading the house, as he can't see them. We live rurally and are under attack by all sorts of critters all summer long and mice in the winter. I have learned to let him do what he needs to do unless he asks for help and he hates asking for help! He especially hates for me to have to drive him places as I end up completely exhausted due to my RA. So when we got married, he had trouble with his eyes, 17 years later it is much worse but at least we are learning how to handle things as needed. I do know that when my fabulously rich uncle that I have never met (LOL) dies and leave is all to me, I want to hire a chauffeur and a housekeeper and a cook.

Something I wanted to expand upon is that using a chair for a very short amount of time (~3 days) is not an immersive experience, even if you hardly leave that chair.  Some of us have used one our whole lives; for me it's been almost 20 years.  I fear that using a chair for only 3 days might give you the the idea that you've gotten a proper idea, the entire scope of experience, when really you've only gotten a mere fraction.  And I don't mean ""using a chair for 3 days is bad; using one for 20 years is 10 times worse!"".  I'm not talking exponential; I'm talking depth as well as breadth.  For example, [in this post on Dailykos](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/8/11/1878329/-The-Ebb-and-Flow-of-Kindness) I talk about how my personal journey with kindness has evolved over 20 years in a wheelchair.  This journey took me through years of grief, bitterness, pain, vulnerability, and humbling.  This is not something that could be experienced in 3 days.  

You mention your car and your home.  When I became disabled, part of the stress and grief was that I had to break our lease and leave the home I loved, because it could not be adjusted.  We lost our car.  I lost my job.  I also lost feeling in half of my body.  My sex life changed.  My bed changed.  My bathroom habits changed.  Sounds like you would not experience these.

My parents had to get that 7am phone call telling them that their daughter was in a serious car accident and in critical condition and they had better get to the hospital NOW.  They held my hand as I went in for spinal surgery, as I babbled nonsense from the drugs.  My mom had anxiety attacks.  One of my friends almost fainted when she visited me in ICU.  My friends and family were there to watch and help me when I struggled, cried, and triumphed.  When you are disabled, it is not just you that is involved.  In your wheelchair experiment, it would be only you that would be involved.

Chronic pain is another huge experience that is hard to transfer to someone who's never dealt with it.  It really does shape your life, and is a part of many disabled people's lives.  

And finally, using a manual chair when you've never used one before is going to be very physically tough, because your muscles won't be built up to it.  For me, it's my normal now.  At the end of day one, your wrist joints may be on fire, while mine are fine, simply because my wrist muscles are built up enough that they take the brunt of the work, not my joints.  You may not be able to get through a doorway because you don't know how to do a pop-up with your front wheels, while I can enter that doorway easily -- which may give you the wrong impression that manual chair users can't enter that door.  You won't know how to lean forward while pushing up a hill, giving you the impression that that hill is too steep for you to climb, when in fact it's not.  In other words, using a wheelchair is more than pushing the wheels.  There are vital *skills* involved that rehab teaches you, that you won't know.

I just fear that a short stint in a wheelchair would give you a very wrong impression in many ways, and actually put you back in your understanding.",,,,xj371,,,1566498421,t5_2qhe8,t3_ctmz9d,t3_ctmz9d,8,1575295571,0,0,exq6928,disability,,,,"Hey there.

1577,"I’m 52 years old, paraplegic from Ohio, now living in CA. I use a manual wheelchair and have been driving with hand controls since I was 16. I took drivers ed in high school. The classroom portion was with everyone else in my class. The school and my parents arranged for me to take the driving portion at the local occupational therapy center at nearby Ohio State University simply because the company providing drivers ed didn’t have equipped cars. 

I got my learners permit just like everyone else, did the classroom and practical and took my test at the DMV. No special treatment or hurdles, except I had to borrow a car for the test from the University as I didn’t have my own yet. Soon thereafter I used money I had saved from a paper route and odd jobs and bought a beater car like most of the kids my age did at the time. I had a local installer (referred by the University) install my first hand controls.

My first license indicated that I had a waiver to use a spinner knob on the steering wheel. I never used one myself but the loaner car I used for the test had one. I believe that they were generally prohibited on passenger vehicles at the time and having this on my license allowed my vehicle to pass the state safety inspection. I never put a spinner knob on my own vehicles and never had one since. 

Since that time I’ve had 10 vehicles, ranging from typical teenager beaters, to a classic 1965 Pontiac convertible, a Saab, a Volvo coupe, a Mini Cooper S that I took to the track on a regular basis (and took competitive track driving lessons at Laguna Seca racetrack in), etc. in some cases I had an installer put in the controls, other times I purchased or fabricated the mounting hardware (over the years I’ve collected quite a supply of hand control parts and accessories, I always used the same types and most of the parts are interchangeable - just the vehicle-specific mounting parts are different). 

In my 36 years of driving I’ve had a few fender benders. Only one my fault years ago. In no case was my use of hand controls ever brought up or mentioned. 

Except for that initial spinner knob thing, DMV has never mentioned or seemed to care about my use of hand controls. I’ve been through several renewals, both by mail and in person, switched states, etc. it’s never been mentioned, except that I got to jump the line which I feel terribly guilty about, but the crowd-wranglers at my local DMV insisted. 

If I hadn’t met my current insurance agent personally my insurance company (currently Farmer’s) wouldn’t know. There’s nothing in the paperwork or application. If you get your insurance online I don’t know how anyone would know. No one seems to care. The only time it ever came up was when a valet drove my brand new Volvo C70 into a wall because he tried using the hand controls instead of his feet. He obviously tried to pull up on the brake as he bent the brake pedal up. Never caused an issue, just a curiosity. This was 20 years ago and I still point out to anyone getting in my car that they can use their feet. But I still hate valets.

In dealing with police it’s never been brought up or been an issue. I’ve been pulled over in my youth and treated no differently. I got a parking ticket once for putting my handicapped placard on the dash on the front window instead of hanging it on the mirror. I guess that’s a thing.

That’s about all I have to report. Hope it helps.

I’ve been through several renewals, both by mail and in person, switched states, etc. it’s never been mentioned, except that I got to jump the line which I feel terribly guilty about, but the crowd-wranglers at my local DMV insisted. 

If I hadn’t met my current insurance agent personally my insurance company (currently Farmer’s) wouldn’t know. There’s nothing in the paperwork or application. If you get your insurance online I don’t know how anyone would know. No one seems to care. The only time it ever came up was when a valet drove my brand new Volvo <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> into a wall because he tried using the hand controls instead of his feet. He obviously tried to pull up on the brake as he bent the brake pedal up. Never caused an issue, just a curiosity. This was 20 years ago and I still point out to anyone getting in my car that they can use their feet. But I still hate valets.

In dealing with police it’s never been brought up or been an issue. I’ve been pulled over in my youth and treated no differently. I got a parking ticket once for putting my handicapped placard on the dash on the front window instead of hanging it on the mirror. I guess that’s a thing.

That’s about all I have to report. Hope it helps. 

TL;DR: DMV doesn’t care. Insurance doesn’t care. Cops don’t care.","[{'start': 2780, 'end': 2799, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 433, 'end': 441, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 162, 'end': 170, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 34, 'end': 44, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
1578,"I think that, sometimes, it comes down to ""real"" labor vs. emotional labor. In our society, emotional labor just isn't *valued*, especially if you're AFAB like I am. So the work that disabled people can do is just not *seen* as work. Meanwhile, our friends feel put upon because they're driving us places or helping us with housework or accompanying us to doctor's appointments or whatever, while the ableist part of their minds sees us sitting on our ass. And  I think that even the most supportive people have *some* ableism. It's a life-long task of elimination, like racism or sexism. 

It's also compounded because we don't *want* people to see us suffering. So a lot of us try to be as stoic as possible, until we can't be anymore. 

It's just frustrating because it's a no-win situation for us. I have a couple disabled friends hopefully moving up here next year and I'm going to move in with them. And I can't *wait* because, while I love my current roommates (I've lived with them for almost 20 years!), they don't *get* disability on the same level. 

Really, I just want to fucking win the lottery because then I'd just build a commune for disabled people. We'd still have to deal with abled people, but at least we'd have a safe space full of people like us that aren't the elderly.

If you want to survive the airports, a couple of bungee straps could allow you to pull either a 4-wheel suitcase or drag one with a handlebar in a way similar to the Phoenix instinct luggage.

Even if they aren't powerful/resistant to completely push themself all the way, if they have enough stamina to do moderate pushes, you can use one hand to push the wheelchair by one handle (they direct it with the push wheels) and use the other hand to carry the luggage.

If your partner hasn't pushed often a wheelchair, I would advise getting bicycle gloves.

I'm sorry that you have such difficulties from your chair, however.  There needs to be serious governmental regulations for these e-scoots and e-bikes.  They've become an incredible nuisance.

My guess is, if a group of individuals covered under disability-based laws were to complain about access, they'd be forced to do something.  Having obstructions, such as these scooters in the middle of a sidewalk, creates all sorts of hazards for disabled individuals, as well as able-bodied individuals.

1641,"Why do you think it’s unfair to ask a service member to abide by the same systems everyone else does — the ones they fought to protect? Why do you think soldiers should be elevated above citizens, beyond things like lifetime medical?

I mean, I don’t *necessarily* have a problem with those who served getting higher disability payments, but tax breaks? Come on. There’s nothing wrong with asking them to pay taxes like everyone else.

The other benefits are outside of the scope of disability. GI, etc. are all benefits for enlisting, regardless of how disgusting the GI Bill program is. Enlistees “willingly” enter a situation knowing they may be killed or disabled, and many of them end up with a disability that they would have otherwise avoided because of that, and I think that could merit an increased payment. 

On the other hand, it’s really just a workplace injury. Almost all the sign-ups are doing so for the money, and it isn’t immediately clear why getting injured on one job should be worth more (your payment) than getting injured on another (or, putting aside work, why it should be worth more than becoming disabled while helping others escape during a terrorist event).

Either way, what serving shouldn’t get you is an exemption from the systems that everyone else has to abide by. If you need disability, it’s because you’re so disabled you can’t work. Under the current systems you shouldn’t be getting a monthly payment for an 8% hand impairment that doesn’t prevent you from working just because it happened on an army base. Serving your country should in no way exempt you from abiding by the rules everyone else has to, nor from continuing to pay money to keep the country running, and to support others in need.

Now, should all disabled people be tax exempt? Yes. The payments are often too low to live on your own, and the taxes end up going back into the systems you’re already relying on, which is a huge hit to efficiency.

1654,"&gt;Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer noted that Anderson [the lawmaker who has paralysis] voted for a set of Assembly rules in 2017 that eliminated a provision that allowed Assembly members in some cases to participate in committee meetings through web cameras.

&gt;Anderson voted on those rules a month after he joined the Legislature, at a time when he said he didn’t have a full sense of what his needs would be.

So, the disabled lawmaker who is not allowed to call into meetings is also the same one who voted to get rid of the rule that allowed members to attend meetings via webcam -- that's ironic.  And he says that he didn't know he would need that rule in the future.  What does that matter?  Another disabled lawmaker could have come in and needed that allowance, right?

You apply for social security benefits and not SSI/SSDI. The local SSA office determines which one you would get.  Then they send your information to a disability determination bureau (DDB). The DDB makes a determination whether you qualify or not based on your medical history, but if they see savings and work history that will work against you. Then if approved they will look at your savings to determine whether you are eligible for monthly payments. Usually SSI recipients receive large backpay too, but the SSA will give you 9 months to spend it.  

You could still be approved for SSI with over $2,000 in assets.  You just can't collect it monthly unless your savings are under $2,000.  If over $2,000 you can still get benefits like medicaid or food stamps.  If approved for SSI you can designate $1,500 as a burial fund, can transfer the money to somebody else's account or just cash it out and not tell social security. They are so strapped for cash and backlogged its not like they are going to investigate.

Everyone thinks they are a good candidate for disability. Most don't  qualify or give up. You are probably going to have a 3-5 year ""battle"" to collect SSI and/or SSDI.  In the end you still may not get approved.  Mental disorders/young age almost certainly means a denial at the initial/reconsideration levels. (1 year process).  If you decide to go to court that will be another 1.5-2 years until you see a judge. Just be prepared for a long battle.  Once denied at the reconsideration level make try to get an attorney for the hearing level.

1674,"This is my jam. I have requested most of this at jobs and a college. First off they will for some reason try to say that you have to prove that you need the items that you are requesting. This is not true, I am going to say this again, this is not true, If you put in a request under ADA they have to decide if the request would benefit you, if the answer is yes then it is very hard to say no to it. I will state this again you do not have the burden of proving that you need the accommodations they have to prove that you will not benefit from them. 

If they say that you need proof of your disability, this is worded poorly, and they need to reword it. Say are you formally requesting documentation of my disability. The reason is because as I said before, you do not have to prove to them that you have a disability. All you have to do is disclose it and say the accommodation that you need. And when/if they request documentation you are required to provide access to it. nothing more. 

I used to have a Dr. send the documentation, but it is way more fun to make an overly dermatitis show of it if they do not understand the ADA and they are difficult. I like to pull out the duffel bag of hell. This is every piece of paper every printed on medical History,disability, and academic history that I have been able to collect over the part 20 or so years. I say no problem and I go get it and then I pull out stacks and stacks of paper and set them out and say do you need to make copies and when can I expect to get that back. They can not take it under the law they can how ever make copies for there records. 

It feels like you are showing the world the pentagon papers as you reach for another pile of paper and then another and the look on the HR persons face is great. 

This almost always changes the conversation to a what accommodations do you need? 

No HR person wants to spend days looking through all of that paperwork when they know you are waiting for them to make the smallest error. I am convinced that all people with disabilities should have a duffel bag of hell that they can pull out when the time comes.

1693,"I have seen employees of the place coming out after using it for a dressing room, little girls coming out thinking it was great fun to use that stall, etc., lots of folks think nothing of using it and even in a crowd, I understand that some will use it as needed. But when it is a woman's bathroom with 3-4 stalls and all but the handicapped one is empty, I have to stand and wait until whoever is in the handicapped stall decides that they are done. I can't get up and out of the regular toilet/stalls. Too many in our society no longer think about others needs at all. Ever. Or they don't figure that any disabled person needs accommodation. Nor do I usually see anyone embarrassed about having used it and taken it up for 5 or more minutes. Frustrating. I held off using a cane and using handicapped bathrooms and handicapped parking as long as I could. Then I couldn't hold off anymore when I got stuck in a church bathroom that had no bathroom for handicapped people. And I mean stuck. With only a flimsy toilet paper holder, on the wall, I knew if I grabbed it to use as a 'grab bar' it would break right off the wall. Another church you had to walk down half of a flight of stairs to get to the closest BR and the other BR that had 'disabled' facilities had one of those stupid wrap around things that look like a walker and unless you are skinny they don't work well in helping you up and down.

To go along with this frustration is walking or wheeling into the big bathrooms like at the main library branch. I think there are about 10+ stalls. Where is the handicapped stall? For those of use that ambulate with a cane, so I guess they think we need exercise, it is the furthest from the door! My doctor's office that is associated with a hospital was just given a HUGE remodel. Now there is only ONE door into the facility, and then you turn left and walk down an exceptionally long haul until you get to the waiting room where from the hallway is yet another long walk to the desk of the girl at check-in. That is about twice the distance that I can comfortably walk, so by the time I get there, I am out of breath, sweating, exhausted and hurting. Interestingly enough the majority of the handicapped car spaces is by the end of the building. Since usually, they are near the door to go in, if you park there, the joke is on you! You then have to walk the huge distance to the door, turn left and walk back towards the far away office which is about 10 feet from where you parked your car! And this is a place that calls itself a Wellness center! I guess they figure all that walking will do us good.

1707,"Ive been looking for something simmilar...my motjer has ALS and can pretty much only use her hands...and if they're resting. Ive been trying to find some way to get a mic closer to her face for talking on the phone and using voice commands for most things....she doesnt do either of much because its too hard to project her voice. I ordered a bluetooth ""headset"" that sits on her shoulders off amazon that i have high hopes for. 

Reasons i hope it will work:
-It will hibernate when not in use, so battery should last a few days

-mic closer to her face so it will hear her better, so she will favor voice commands over struggling with her hands

-noise cancelling so her vent wont be as much of a problem

-she has an alexa, but she ofen doesnt hear her, so with this right up at her face, she should be able to use vooce commands for virtually anything. INDEPENDENCE!!

Ive been trying to find some way to get a mic closer to her face for talking on the phone and using voice commands for most <URL>e doesnt do either of much because its too hard to project her voice. I ordered a bluetooth ""headset"" that sits on her shoulders off amazon that i have high hopes for. 

Reasons i hope it will work:
-It will hibernate when not in use, so battery should last a few days

-mic closer to her face so it will hear her better, so she will favor voice commands over struggling with her hands

-noise cancelling so her vent wont be as much of a problem

-she has an alexa, but she ofen doesnt hear her, so with this right up at her face, she should be able to use vooce commands for virtually anything. INDEPENDENCE!!

I know this is just a saying but it's kind of frustrating. You can only walk a mile in someone's shoes if they fit. You can get a better understanding of someone's life by walking alongside them and asking questions.

&gt;I wanted to see some of the obstacles people face, how the everyday is different, and mostly see how different it is to be seen by and interact with strangers.

You are only seeing an incredibly narrow view. In a very small dose. No matter what you do your only experience will be that of an able-bodied person using a wheelchair for a short time. It can never compare in anyway to actually being disabled.

&gt;I want to know what hurts and what I can do better.

ASK US! What hurts or offends you in the immediate NOW in the short time you will have been in a wheelchair likely wouldn't be a big deal if you actually lived the life of a disabled person.

&gt;And I hoped immersing myself would make it feel normal and not something different.

If I woke up tomorrow and wasn't disabled and this was how it would be for a week I can promise you it would in no way feel normal and not different.

1754,"Can you define what you mean by deep hole? There are vocational rehab specialists that can help you look for work and set up jobs you might possibly do, depending on your disability/ability to do work. Working from home is an option if other, more traditional jobs are not available to you--again depending on the nature of your disability. If by hole you mean debt, that I am not sure about.

You can apply for housing that is meant for the poor and disabled, such as Section 8, but in most cases, the waiting list is very long as there aren't a lot of these places in each area and they are in high demand--part of your rent and possibly other things based on need would be paid by the gov't, freeing up more of your SSI money.

I know that moving to a completely different, cheaper area/state is not always an option even for able-bodied people, so I am hesitant to suggest that as it sounds like it would be very difficult for you. I don't personally think moving to a whole new area like that should be necessary anyway, but that's not always reality, unfortunately.

EDIT: Working does of course affect the amount of SSI for which you are eligible, although in some cases this doesn't happen instantaneously to help you get on your feet. But from experience, having to rely only on it is a complete nightmare that traps you, so if someone can help you find employment you're able to get that helps you surpass SSI earnings, it can help.",,,,DjinnOftheBeresaad,,,1566334497,t5_2qhe8,t3_ct5bre,t3_ct5bre,2,1575168235,0,0,exis64u,disability,,,,,

1764,"My purpose found me. When I first got so sick and we had no clue what was the problem. We had gotten married 6 weeks before I had to leave where I worked and never returned I was in such pain. My doc didn't seem too interested in finding out what was my problem. So all we could figure was I was dying. So as a crafter with a huge amount of books on sewing, etc. I decided I should get rid of them before I died so my new hubby wouldn't have to deal with them afterward. Selling online was just getting to the point that some people had heard of it and I listed my precious books for sale. Then one sold and that was exciting, and another and then on days I could get out, we would go to yard sales and find more books. Soon, no matter how I felt, I would drag myself out of bed to see if anything had sold that I had to get ready for the mailman. Before I knew it I was a used books seller online! I had a reason to get up every morning no matter how I hurt. Only once in 17+ years have I not shipped within 24 hours and that was due to over 24"" of new snow that is kind of difficult to walk through even without fake knees and a cane! My motto is 'begin how you plan to finish'. I give the best customer service that I know how to give. Even as I went in for three different knee surgeries, I pushed myself to be able to get up and deal with orders. I got to the point though that the books were just too heavy for me to hold and pack up and as a reader, I have to prop books on a pillow to read them. So I switch to selling sewing patterns online and have been doing it ever since. I sell on two venues and part of my purpose, more than bringing in money to help stretch the SSD check, is I am active on the seller's forums and try to help give back the advice and counsel that I got from a friend when starting out selling.

1782,"I agree with this, in person it's much easier to explain how, yes, you have a disability, but it's easily and possibly cheaply accommodated for, that you yourself manage it to the point where you are 100% capable of doing the job described, or that only 1 change really needs to be made to the role. Over the phone you can verbally explain this, but there's something about seeing the person behind the voice that makes employers realise ""oh, this is a totally normal human being""

My current job is something like that, the original description required a lot more physical engagement - I work in community services and my role technically involves being able to help clients who need one on one physical support with things like transfers, and since our centre is kind of small I needed to be able to move heavy tables to set up classrooms. When I interviewed I was upfront that I can definitely help clients to carry things, get in the right position to transfer, and I can carry chairs, but I have a disability and manual handling of people or tables is something I would need help with. My employer was impressed with how I approached the question with ""well I can't do that specifically, but here's what I can do, here's how I'd get around that other problem, and here's something I can do in addition to make up for not meeting the criteria exactly"" 

When it comes to disclosing disability in general, I'm very much in the camp of ""always disclose, you don't want to work for a company that will discriminate against people in your situation and you don't want to have them suddenly change your work duties to something that you struggle with"" if a company is going to reject me solely because I have a disability, fuck them, I don't want to work for a place like that. (it's obviously illegal for them to discriminate in that way, but proving it is near impossible)

But I'm saying that from a point of privilege, the unemployment dole in my country - while well below the poverty line, is something that I personally have access to when I'm between jobs or working low hours, and there's no time limit on it, as long as I can prove I'm trying to get a job by genuinely applying and attending interviews, I can remain on the dole until I land a safe job.

I am fully aware that for many people, getting a job asap can be life or death, it could be the difference between stable housing or homelessness, or being able to afford mediation/medical care or not. So for people in tough situations like that, my only advice is to be smart with the jobs you apply for, try and find something where you can make your own accommodations so you don't have to ask and so you can answer honestly ""I have no issues that could prevent me doing the job as described on the position description"", and perhaps think about ways you can explain your disability as if it's something temporary, this is super dodgy and obviously doesn't work for every type of disability, but say they see you wince in pain from your chronic pain condition, you can try to play it off like ""oh I slept funny last night, haha, it's all good"" so they don't suspect it being due to a disability. Again I wouldn't ever recommend lying like this, but if you are desperate for work then desperate times call for desperate measures so I understand. 

(being on the dole has actually helped me when it comes to discrimination, my welfare case manager will sometimes randomly call employers I interviewed with to just follow up and confirm I interviewed well, ie: was I sensible or did I purposefully throw the interview. Twice, my case manager called a company for feedback and they gave a glowing review of my interview skills, they actually said ""she would have been perfect for the role but unfortunately we need someone with a driver's licence""... My case manager advocated for me, why does someone in admin/data entry or a call centre operator need a driver's licence? They gave some bullshit answer about being able to do bank runs or get into work really quickly if I had to fill in for another staff member - as if getting a taxi wasn't an option in a rare situation like that. My case manager reported them for disability and class discrimination to our state fair work ombudsman.)",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1565256022,t5_2qhe8,t3_cmybox,t1_ew609ay,1,1573784941,0,0,ewb03v5,disability,,,,,

1784,"This is a bit niche, but I'd love a fitted, slightly stretch fabric shirt that's made to look like a button up collared shirt.

I've tried press stud shirts but I'm a bit busty so unless I size up and get it taken in at the waist and sleeves, I end up with it popping open at the worst times. If I'm using my crutches I can't quickly cover myself either.

I overheat easily so finding business shirts that are opaque enough to hide my bra but breathable enough to keep me cool is difficult.

I don't like being the only person in my office wearing polo shirts. My personal style is button ups so I want to make them work. I have a few press stud ones that I've sewn shut apart from the top two buttons where I've added velcro for extra security, but they're baggier than I'd like because they have to be slightly larger to pull over my head.


Unrelated, This is a hack that I discovered for flowy skirts - I love long circle skirts/skirts with a lot of fabric, but if it's windy the skirt flaps around and I catch it with my crutch when trying to walk and I either trip, rip the skirt, or almost slip. So I got some ribbon and  threaded it through the rolled hem on the bottom of my skirt, then tied the ribbon ends together in a little loop that I can grab, it's hidden on the underside of my skirt. The ribbon is light enough yo not effect the drape of the skirt when it's like this. 

When I'm walking around, I bend over and pull on the ribbon, then I tuck all the excess ribbon into my belt.

It kind of creates a rough ballon skirt silhouette, but more importantly it's practical because it means the hem of my skirt no longer has a 3+ meter circumstance to catch the wind and act like a sail, tripping up my crutches or cane.

When I'm inside I just untuck the ribbon and run my fingers (or loop a pen clip over the hem and drag it if my fingers are playing up) along the skirt hem to ungather it.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1565620536,t5_2qhe8,t3_cp7sej,t3_cp7sej,3,1574017486,0,0,ewoku15,disability,,,,,

To go along with this rant are those that use the handicapped stall when they show no evidence of a disability (just like parking in a handicapped spot with no hang tag although I tend to forget to put mine up!) Or they use it as a changing room and in the meantime, even if there are more stalls available I have to wait for these chicks to prance on out so I can go. I can not use a stall with no grab bars, with a lower seat, etc. so I have to wait. Of course, many places put the baby changing table in the handicapped stall so I am still waiting while the baby gets changed. I have nothing against babies or having moms do what they need to do, but having to wait for what seems like eons to use the toilet when all around me are empty ones is frustrating and then to walk in and find that someone was also hovering, is a pain. I try to remind myself to not take my diuretic before going out to save on bathroom needs while I am out.

1792,"First off, you don't ""upload your information into a file like a typical USB.""  Doing something like that could be considered an injection attack, if you're doing nothing more than plugging a USB drive into a host system, and some application or script on that drive causes it to inject data into a pre-existing file, application, or database on the host system.  A USB drive will typically either open to a file view, or it will allow the user to browse to the newly created directory structure that's been established due to this device having been input into the host system.

What you're suggesting is completely unsecure, b/c the physical installation of this USB device would necessitate an application to either be installed on the host system or opened in some sort of run-time environment like Java on the host system.  Either way you slice it, this wouldn't wash on many systems in a secure environment.  As u/GeneticPurebredJunk stated, unencrypted devices are often considered persona non grata in secure environments b/c of the dangers previously mentioned.

From having read your originating post and your replies, on one hand you seem to be pushing this device, as if you work for the company that sells it, and on the other hand, you don't seem to know much about it, either.  I would *strongly* suggest that you consider the ramifications of the misinformation you seem to be spreading.

I was borderline agoraphobic at the time, terrified of spending any time around people or using public transport. I started going about 9 hours a week, taking buses and tube to get there. It has been wonderful just feeling competent and like I could be doing something valuable. This summer I went to a pub with other volunteers after a trip. For the first time I actually managed to socialise!

I've moved to university last year and I currently volunteer in a special needs school and in a residential care home. It's been really wonderful and lets me actually go outside and speak to other people.  It has helped me build my self-esteem and consider myself as someone who could work. I am now trying to find a job as a support worker. 

I also think my presence there is quite valuable to others. I primarily work with people with learning disabilities and on the spectrum, so I can often relate to their experiences.

1825,"Social Security can deny benefits to an applicant who abuses illegal drugs or alcohol. That being said, in order to do so, it must be determined that the drug or alcohol is a “contributing factor marijuana plantmaterial to the determination of disability”. Basically, they want to know if the applicant would continue to be disabled if they stopped abusing a substance. Applications may also be denied if it can be proven that the abused substance makes the disabling condition worse.

While daily use of marijuana for healthy individuals is still illegal and may be considered an abuse of the drug, this isn’t necessary the case for those who suffer from a disability condition. When it comes to medical marijuana, the decision will likely be made on a case by case basis.

What complicates the matter even further is that applicants can have their benefits denied if they fail to follow their prescribed treatment.

1835,"I work in the disability office of a university and this is something that has been pretty hotly argued at my school. (I am also disabled and mentally ill just so you know)

The general rule is that if a student has been deemed likely to harm others that is almost always grounds to force involuntary leave.

Outside of that circumstance it is almost always a school policy and not a legally mandated or backed rule. Your school likely has a written policy for when it’s administration can force involuntary withdrawal. It is legal because you technically have access to these policies, and you “agree” to abide by them by enrolling.

These policies can be very loosely written, and sometimes target mentally ill students in a way that I would argue is discriminatory. Most universities try to argue these policies are only for extreme circumstances but I have seen them applied to cases that did not warrant this level of intervention. 

I’ll be honest, I’ve not worked with many doctoral students so it may be different for that level of schooling, but this is my understanding from my work and experience.

Edit: I would like to add that you likely have grounds for legal action. These kinds of policies are generally ONLY intended for extreme circumstances and if the policy is being used for circumstances that are not extreme then they are abusing university policy to discriminate against mentally ill students. 

I would suggest you try to find a copy of your schools bylaws in relation to your situation. If there are no actual written bylaws then they are on even less firm legal ground.",,,,Merrinberry,,,1565271719,t5_2qhe8,t3_cnjoqp,t3_cnjoqp,4,1573798608,0,0,ewbsnwa,disability,,,,,

1838,"Ah ok, sorry.

What's my point?

Try looking at something like CBT which examines how your thinking affects how you view situations in your life. For example you mention being rejected constantly because you're disabled. Well men generally get rejected way more than they succeed when approaching women, except for the guys at the top of the attractiveness pile. So do you absolutely know for a fact all these rejections are because of disability? Or are you assuming this is the case? There are certainly women out there in relationships with disabled men so this would suggest there's more to it.

Needing help at parties: what are you contributing to the parties that makes it worthwhile for someone to help you? Are you fun and engaging, or are you sad and bitter about your disability? I don't know the answer to this, I'm just suggesting you ask yourself the question are you making yourself someone that other people actually want to be around?

Again it's not a criticism or a suggestion that you're not someone anyone would want to be around. I'm suggesting that instead of blaming other people for your situation you try and look at how you can improve it for yourself.",,,,[deleted],,,1565623118,t5_2qhe8,t3_coyx9v,t1_ewoml3q,2,1574019277,0,0,ewoom8r,disability,,,,,

I would go for a kitten but go for a slightly older one (a few months old) as they are less clumsy and won’t have “ accidents” that need cleaning up. Do keep in mind cats can live to well in their 20-ies (mine are 15 and 14 years old) and you will need to take care of them for their entire live.
If you keep the kitten close to you it will bond with you more and it can be a great friend in times of need, also will the cat be able to go outside.?

My kids are 11 and 7 (in a couple of weeks). My kids know that they aren't allowed to eat in their rooms. They can't stay on the computer all day, and staying in bed when you've got things that need doing is lazy.

And they also know that none of those things apply to me, all the time.

I bet she's heard similar things from her mom *about her*. ""It's being lazy to stay on your phone all day."" ""When you grow up, you've got to move out and get a job.""

And all of those things are true..... in almost all cases.... but in some cases, *they're not*.

Kids are smart enough to say ""If it's true in most circumstances... then it's true in this circumstance."" Most are even smart enough to apply exceptions... but they have to learn about the possibility of these 'truism' being true *only most of the time*, and then make the difficult life journey of discovering which times count as exceptions, and which ones don't.

I don't know, I'm kind of rambling. What I'm saying is this, I guess: Kids can be cruel, and sometimes on purpose, because they are smart enough to learn how to apply things that are true in most cases to things which aren't them; and, for a lot of us who are disabled, those are all things that *we* recognize as generally true, too... so her applying the general rules to you was probably something you'd done, too - and it probably felt like a brutal bias confirmation of your darkest thoughts.

I guess I'm not done rambling. It's often difficult for us to know where the line is between our own character flaws, and our disabilities - especially for those of us who's disabilities are invisible - ""how much of me hiding in my room today is me, and how much is my anxiety?""

1878,"I hear ya, rainman was a bad movie to in that aspect even tho some things where spot on, a savant doesn’t work like that, and are very rare. All of a sudden people would think every autistic kid would be a savant... sigh. Although it did do a reasonably okayish job in portraying severe (or deep) autism, it did lead to a lot of misconceptions.
I thought Imitation game was pretty good, I know I laughed at some parts being so recognizable, I have a son with severe autism (MCDD although not used as a diagnoses anymore is very specific). It is very hard to tell him “no” for anything I would have said yes to before, but that just means I need to think very hard about what I will allow. 
The screaming and “flipping out” is mostly a sign he is over his limit and I as a parent should guard that for him as he can’t himself. Regardless what the world may think of one of those episodes they hurt him to, it must be an awful feeling to feel and be so out of control.

I think the problem with things like autism, schizophrenia, PTSD and other severe mental illness is that everybody will experience it in a different way no 2 people will have the same symptoms. But that is too broad and people just love their stereotypes, so they will lump all autistic, all schizopherns, all... just fill in whatever on a big heap and expect the same behaviors from them.

1879,"It more then likely is. Schools have to hit certain numbers to continue to receive government funding my guess is that if she comes off it will change a number that they need to adjust to not risk loss of funding. Or they are hoping that if they make it difficult for you that you will look into other options for her. This is a common tactic. I can not say that this is what they are doing but it sounds fishy to me. 

The solution is to contact a disability rights organization and tell them what is going on. They will schedule you for an appointment months in the future so do not expect help right away. However there is a way to see if they are up the something. Go back to the school and say you contacted the disability rights organization and they told you to get copies of all of her paperwork at the school. It is referred to as a academic file. They have to give it to you with in a reasonable amount of time. If they ask just say that the lawyers said they need it and nothing else. They seemed interested. 

They will call the layer they have on retainer and there will be an emergency meeting on how to handle this. Hold your ground and every time they ask to talk say I need to contact the disability rights organization. Call them and talk to them so you can say you called them and be telling the truth. Incase you ever have to explain this under oath. 

They will counter offer you wait till you are happy with the offer and take it or let the disability rights organization take over and work it out for you. I did something similar to this one time for a different reason and it was successful.

1880,"Where I live the limitation on adopting a cat from the animal shelter is that you must have enough income or savings to afford vet bills.  Veterinary care is considered basic around here, and can be expected to cost at least $5,000 a year during the life of your kitten and cat.  For that reason the local animal shelter will not permit adoption by anyone who has no savings or assets and whose only income is provincial disability benefits, which by public information are a maximum of about $1,300 per month including shelter allotment.  Separately from shelter the maximum is less than $700 per month with a little extra money possible from special diet allowances, money to cover cost of travel to medical appointments, and maybe a little bit of earnings from casual or part-time paid work.  None of us single and broke people on provincial disability would be permitted to adopt a kitten from the shelter because we can't afford vet bills.  And the only other ways to get a kitten are from kitten mills or breeders, which charge far more than we can afford, or by having someone we know give us a free kitten from a litter their cat had and they want to find homes for.

How that relates to you is that I personally strongly agree that only someone who can afford vet bills should ever own a cat or dog.  I don't know what your income, savings, or assets are, but really I see that as the only consideration with a kitten.  They're highly self-sufficient as indoor kittens in a properly kittenproofed home (i.e. properly secured wall sockets for electrical outlets, elevated wires they can't climb high enough to reach, no holes in canvas furniture that permit them to crawl inside the back of your couch, no way to get behind the fridge and get injured by the motor, secured floor-level cabinets so they don't end up getting under the sink and licking the can of Javex powder, etc.).  Food and water for them are easy enough even if you have mobility problems, they know to use the sand-style-litter box without needing to be trained, and aside from that all they want is the freedom to play and some lovin's when they ask for them--not when you want to give them some but when they ask.

I hope you see your way clear to getting a kitten.  Even if they're not trained as therapy animals they're wonderful therapy by nature.  But, please, make sure you can do right by your kitty when it comes to the vet, else let her find a home with someone who can.",,,,Sirisalo,,,1566450550,t5_2qhe8,t3_ctqvzp,t3_ctqvzp,2,1575245919,0,0,exnayak,disability,,,,,

1953,"If you don't mind my asking, where are you from? I know it can't be Canada, just before they made us from the UA get a passport to visit Niagara Falls even, we visited up there and wanted to go to the zoo. So we got my w/c manual, and not my size but we picked it up at a yard sale for $15 USD because we knew walking around the zoo would be too much for me. While I was trying to calculate how much the two of us had to pay the lady said some amount way below what my numbers were coming up and as I am an honest person I asked why and she said that the disabled get in for half price and their helper free. Not sure if they still do it, but talking to the guy that we went to see who is completely blind, said yeah it even works that way for airplane tickets, etc,! It is funny how some stores have electric w/c to use and then others other same companies don't have them. It does make me see red to see an electric w/c in use and the kids taking turns riding in it and playing with it as there are never enough to go around at a big store like Walmart!

I try to do what exercise as in walking in the house as much as I can, but 2-3 minutes and I need to sit. I had to give up going out to our mailbox - a distance away - two weeks ago and now have to drive the car to take my orders out. I feel silly doing it, but my last few manual trips on my feet with my can I could barely make it back to the house. Once had to sit in the car for a few minutes to get rested up for the last ten feet. 

I am very grateful that I live in a small town and for the most part very friendly and helpful. But I try very hard especially when a kid opens a door for me or whatever to give them a very sincere thank you. I have heard of disabled folks getting mad when they are offered help! I was at a restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had almost made it to the garbage can when my load tipped. What a mess. Instead of barging in and doing things for me, the lady I was right next to asked: ""how can I help?"" I was obvious that I needed help and I appreciate being able to give her the chore to do that was the hardest for me. I can't imagine getting offended about someone offering help. While my son and I are grocery shopping with me in the electric w/c and him at his tall height (and years of grocery store experience) if I see someone struggling and he hasn't yet, I ask if they need help and tell them he will get whatever for them. He can reach the high shelves and get down to the low ones. We are all in this world together and we should help each other.

Currently having real trouble as I had to have a 4th molar removed due to the side effects of dry mouth from the RA. I have weird teeth and took them over an hour and uncoatable trying to wiggly and then jerk and it just wasn't coming out. When it finally did, the assistant without thinking hit the button to straighten up the chair. The pain - my backside was a good 6-7"" off of the chair where it should have been as my body wasn't bending. She had to flatten it out in a hurry and then little by little move it up so my back could adjust. I am still having pain in my low back and today it is terrible, plus still having pain in my jaw. I think hubby thought I was being a baby until I told him just how many attempts they made to pull it before cutting it in half and pulling it out in sections. I could see the light dawning when he said, 'oh they wiggle the tooth back and forth 3 times and then jerk and it is out.' Up to that point, I had thought everyone went through what I did when getting teeth out! 

So those of us with one wrong thing tend to have other problems as well that we deal with. Back in 1970, my stepfather came down with RA, long before they had decent meds. 4 years later they had to amputate one of his legs (high hip) because of clotting from his medication. He lived 14 years from diagnosis to death. I was very pregnant when he died and had my baby on the day that would have been his birthday. So when I was told I had RA I was very devastated as all I could see was him. But at this point, I have outlasted him. After talking to my one doc, she thinks I had JRA, not severe and I was having problems that once again I assumed everyone got swollen stiff hands in the summer when I was a pre-teen. The pains I used to have in my legs that were incredible and mom telling me they were growing pains.....That I have never gotten over. Do you reckon at 63 my 'growing pains' should be over? We had no health insurance so unless you were dying or bleeding to death (my brother put his arm through a glass door and he got 63 stitches), no one went to the docs and I didn't appear to be dying with those growing pains. Probably very fortunate as I probably would be dead now from having those RA meds from way back. My great-niece via adoption so no actual relation died at less than two-years-old from JRA. Now that was sad. I had never realized until the mom had another baby that my sister had never seen her little one in person. RA in many ways has devastated our family. If not RA than OA or just simply 'arthritis'.

Who knows what that GC is actually for, but people have heard about and always heard about someone somewhere that took it and were fine. Somehow they think that I maybe didn't check out my disease very well and so want to be sure I don't miss a thing. I know they want to be helpful, but. They don't usually know a thing about me, but the minute RA pops out, the avalanche of cures pops out from the others. I even had a guy that was trying to sell air fresheners, offer the suggestion that it might do me good. Line your pockets as well too! Even though I am a nurse, I let hubby do all the research for me as I am busy doing other things and he loves to do it.

The crazy thing is, this is just one disease!  But think of all the many diseases that no one has a handle on yet, or are incurable or the person will never walk under their own power again kind of thing. And with advanced medicine, comes things like babies born with horrible problems and thousands if not millions of dollars are spent to keep this little one alive that could have helped other who but for the need of a w/c or crutches, or a helper would be able to live a mostly 'normal' life. I'm not saying that we should just let the little ones die, I love babies and I know their parents do as well, but it is hard to see when you can't get your insurance to pop for the medical equipment that you might need. I have been fortunate that most of mine I picked up cheap in like-new condition or were given to me brand new. Not everyone gets that kind of help.

1954,"As long as you follow your uni's procedures for getting your accommodation, not allowed. (Disabled Retired College Instructor here btw)

Most (U.S.) universities have  department called something like  disability, accommodations, or accessibility. That department will work with you find out accommodations are appropriate and reasonable (which can be a pain all to itself of course). Once they approve accommodations, professors are bound by them.  If the professor has an issue with an accommodation, they have to take it up that department. 

Sounds like you have that approval and the paperwork. Regardless of emails (or even written notices), you are best off having a physical copy to shove into any professor's face. 

If the professor can take it up with the disability department. Very importantly they can't take it up with you. This is how universities want to deal with accomodations. The disability department is in charge of figuring out what uni legally has to do (it's really their main reason for existing). This is so that individual professors and uni official don't make calls themselves, because such people, generally speaking, don't know ADA or at best will be inconsistent with it's application. The professor ignoring the disability department's approved accommodations, makes the uni at risk of a lawsuit. 

Bit of advice on dealing with this. Assuming I understand properly that you made your need for accommodations and the disability office's approval of them clear to the professor, you are best off not do anything further with trying to get the professor to change their stance. 

You should contact the disability office and the professor's department chair (ie head of the sociology department). Make it clear that the university, as represented by this professor, is violating the ADA based on the university own determine of what they must do. Best to stick with a single email, clearly CC both of those and the professor, at least. If there is a college/school (like a School of Humanities) that the sociology department is contained within, CC the head of that too.

If you want to be more aggressive you can CC the dean of students, the provost, hell, the editor of the college of newspaper even, maybe even the student legal aid office if there is one. 

Getting the disability office to approve accommodations is only fight you should really have about it. Once they approve them, it's in the best interest of the whole uni to see they are followed. 

That approval is the uni acknowledging that the ADA required accommodations are necessary and reasonable. Meaning if you want to sue them, the hardest part of the case (showing that the accommodations you aren't getting are needed   and reasonable). 

You might able to just call the disability office and tell them about the situation, and they might handle it from there.

1986,"You’re clearly thinking deeply about this which is awesome! Thanks for your attention and talent! 

Gloves serve many purposes. The main reason I wear gloves is because city streets are disgusting. Many times I’ve waved at/shook hands with someone only to discover that my palms were blackened by soot from the streets of town. It’s gross. Without my gloves I’d be washing my hands 15x per day or resigning myself to constant workmen’s hands.

They also keep blisters away and prevent the temperature of our push rims from transferring directly to our hands. In cold weather the metal of the push rim can become VERY cold. Also, when we slow ourselves down a lot (i.e wheeling down a large hill) the friction of our hands against the push rims can get way too hot.

Magnetic shirts are awesome! I can do regular buttons and almost exclusively wear regular button ups, but on bad days they can be a struggle and it always takes me more time than it would someone else. On days where I’m in pain fine motor tasks become harder.  When I’m already having a bad day trying to button a shirt three times can drive me up a wall. Magnetic button ups solve that problem easily, kind of like clip on ties, but imo mag button ups look more convincing than clip on ties.",,,,branposttower,,,1565713579,t5_2qhe8,t3_cp7sej,t1_ewqvw34,1,1574072922,0,0,ewrtrcy,disability,,,,,

Used to be when people would see me out at a store or whatever, they would be gushing ""oh you look so well as if this is something you get better from like having your appendix out.

I realized what many who have been disabled all their lives mean when they talk about people ignoring you. I don't let people ignore me! 

Back to RA, if I have heard it once I have heard 50 or more times whether written online or in person, someone telling me that all I need is to take that glucosamine chrondrotium, or some weird diet, etc. and I would be hunky-dory. And then the ones that insist that doctors are hiding cures because they want to line their own pockets! Yeah sure. Every 6 weeks I get a Remicade IV. Medicare pays around $6K and my supplement pays about $1K for me to get this every six weeks. Now, do you think that MC would be approving something that expensive is an over the counter pill would do the trick? And it isn't just me, thousands of patients are getting this. We have infusion days at the docs and we all sit around the waiting room with our IVs of various sorts of meds running and we get to chat with others who have the same problems as we do.  It does work too. I used to get a 2-3 day flare weekly. Rarely get them now and when one hit for a week solid in April, it dawned on me just how much I hadn't been missing them. LOL! A flare makes me want to curl up in a ball, suck my thumb and cry like a baby as I hurt so much and nothing helps! While the Remicade has helped so much, I can still feel myself going downhill and at this point, I suspect I will be mostly in a w/c even in the house within a year. I am stubborn about that so I will be pushing it as far as I can into the future.

I would love to see how you do what you do with your feet. Sounds absolutely amazing.

2014,"Hopefully that does change, but after doing this TV shoot, I did a radio interview (also with CBC).

Laziness: I hate this word. I’ve grown so tired of it. I feel it chases me around and around. Recently, I’ve decided to try to put it to bed. I know I am not lazy, and I suspect you aren’t either. When you are limited in ways others are not, from the outside they see themselves in our place. “If I acted like that, I would be lazy.” BUT THEY AREN’T US. They don’t know how much work it takes to just exist some days. I work hard to be able to go out. If I choose to use a mobility aid, it’s because I’m strong enough to give myself that gift. If someone refuses to understand...well, that’s none of their business! It’s for me. I’m doing it for ME. 

Another thing that’s helped me soooo much is the idea of assuming good intentions. It’s extremely natural to be defensive and cautious around other people. We are socialized to want to be “normal” so we can smoothly fit into society. So we are hyper aware of anything that might be perceived as “weird” or “uncomfortable” to others. I have decided to start assuming if someone stares at me it’s NOT because they’re thinking poorly of me. Maybe they’re curious! Maybe they’re zoning out and thinking about what to make for dinner. Maybe they’re feeling sympathy. Even if they are thinking bad thoughts, I don’t have to let it into my perception. I’m imagining myself a world where people are kind and supportive.

2065,"I was very much not a fan of online dating, but happened to meet my s/o online. She was a friend of a friend who was studying on an exchange program and I thought her hair was cool. I asked our mutual friend if it would be too weird to message her (saying I was a friend of our friend) and tell her how awesome her dreadlocks were. It wasn't really online dating in the traditional sense, but it was still a few months of messaging before we met. 

To your point, though: I also have a visible disability (cerebral palsy, walk with an odd gait and need to use a cane) and I would tell anyone in whom I was interested early on. It doesn't need to be the first conversation. But if you see things going a certain way, and you want them to go that way.... it's best to be honest. And it's best to be honest fairly early. 

Ableds can and do feel cheated or lied to in some cases if you don't tell them about an obvious physical disability. It can be a big deal to them. Right or wrong, they can feel like you misrepresented yourself online if you wait till you get deep into an online relationship. 

I'm not necessarily saying this is the only right thing to do, but you asked the question about exaggerating seeming to look for advice, and this is mine. I know that all of that is scary and from experience I know it leads to pain, just as much as it can in real life. Such is the lot of the disabled... I am not entirely sure I ever would have found someone were it not for the online world, because I was always pre-judged on appearances anyway. That is, of course, still a possibility when you start talking to someone online and mention it. 

But mentioning it early might spark their curiosity in a way that just seeing you wouldn't necessarily do. They might become interested, and after interested, invested, and ready to make it part of their lives and not a big deal, the way mine did. And it has sometimes been a struggle for her, but here we still are.

2106,"I feel you. I was unemployed for several years after college. Like you said, it's very hard to get anyone to take you seriously when you don't have the experience on your resume. But I finally did make it. Here's what I did:

My degree was in business. But I discovered I like to code. In college I started teaching myself web development.

I was able to do random freelance projects and make a portfolio online. Eventually, my portfolio became good enough that people couldn't ignore it. It did take me several years, though, to strengthen my skills and find employment. Right before I got hired for my first web development job, I wrote an entry in my journal that I was giving up hope on ever having a full time job. It kind of made me laugh reading that now.

I know it's not for everyone, but if you think there's a chance you might like coding, this can be a very rewarding career for a disabled person. There are many places online where you can learn web development for free or very low cost (as well as other types of programming). It's also something you can do from home, as I currently do.

If you can get good at something and find a way to show your work, that can be a path to employment. It kind of sucks that disabled people have to work extra hard to prove themselves. Hopefully that will change.

Other than that, my advice is to keep applying for jobs, don't be apologetic, and focus on your strengths. Fake it till you make it, as they say.",,,,sad_synth,,,1566518073,t5_2qhe8,t3_crqwuj,t3_crqwuj,1,1575319818,0,0,exrklzo,disability,,,,,

i used to volunteer at a museum, where i helped people handle animals safely (mainly the animal's safety) and answered questions. often i have to tell people i am volunteer with no scientific training, but i still answer more general questions. with my disabilities (autism, history of anxiety in social situation, major depression) it is challenging to do a very public facing role like that, but the museum is supportive so it's low risk. 

in 2-3 months when i am being injected less i am thinking about volunteering at a wildlife rescue center because the animals are honestly my favorite part of volunteering at the museum. i like learning about them and helping them, espicially the ones that aren't ""cute"" and easy for people to understand or relate with. though with the last part maybe i do relate a bit with how people react to autism compared to how people react to animals that are even more neurologically different than them.",,,,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,,,1565398706,t5_2qhe8,t3_co744r,t3_co744r,1,1573890407,0,0,ewh5w6p,disability,,,,,

Hearing aid tech kept me able to work for a long time (disabled due to other reasons now).

It took me a long time to accept it, then to own it. Once I did, it became more of a nuisance than an issue. It is much harder when I don't have a hearing person with me to help me understand interactions with strangers though as I struggle with new accents or of someone doesn't aninciate really well... Or look directly at me.

Ask about an ABLE account, which allows you to save money for disability-related expenses without affecting your benefits (if you were disabled before age 26); make sure to ask about SSDI and earning limits; and you can talk about jobs that you can go for that may provide the level of health insurance benefits you would need that could take place of your current benefits.  Let them know the importance of what's at stake.  I don't know for what reason you lost your disability before, but Social Security generally has safeguards in place where if you try to work but then soon discover you can't, you can go back on SSDI. 

One other thing that comes to mind is approaching the pharmaceutical manufacturer directly and appealing to them to try and see if they can help with your medications.  I don't know much about this, unfortunately.

At the moment you have a little over $2k in the bank. Does that mean $2750? Or $2100? You’ve got time to slowly take that extra out in reasonable increments and perhaps keep cash at home in a safe.

SSA does look at financial records, for those approved for SSI, at the time of approval. They can look at a claimant’s finances retroactively just to make sure money hasn’t suddenly disappeared.  And to determine when you were BOTH (1) disabled from working per SSA &amp; (2) financially eligible for SSI. 

SSA expects that some assets will be used, so having just over $2k and reasonably whittling that down to just at 2k is what they’re looking for. If you had $15k one month, then suddenly had $$2k the next, SSA would dig deeper. But, there’s still cases where that’s legit. For example, the claimant’s car dies.

It's something I see discussed occasionally in various disability forums because you rightfully bring up that the ""traditional icon"" of the blue wheelchair user isn't applicable to all the various types of disability, I know in my country of the 5 million people living with a disability only 4% are wheelchair users (and this number includes part time users)

But unfortunately the blue wheelchair icon (♿) is the standard for all signage and symbolism of disability and  accessibility options.

There are various specific icons, for example if an organisation wants to display their accessibility options for people who are deaf/hard or hearing/hearing impaired they might use a variation of the [deaf icon ](https://i.imgur.com/U7YJZQD.jpg). Similar icons exist for visual impairment, and there is also an icon that represents pshycological, cognitive, intellectual and learning disabilities - again, all very different in nature and each individually covering a huge variety of experiences.

When he was younger, my son could NOT identify that he was hungry, so when his blood sugar dropped below acceptable limits (to be clear, I didn't check his actual blood sugar, but it would happen near a mealtime or if the meal was late) I tried everything I could think of and none of it worked. Finally, I tried something new. gave him a brownie, cookie, any high sugar item and within 10-20 minutes he was my boy again. He turned 36 yesterday and he still generally doesn't ever say he is hungry. He just tells me that ""I'm feeling that way again"". Because he is older and can deal with things better, I know if I am out with him, that we have 10-20 minutes to get to a place selling food. He is my helper when running errands in exchange for a candy bar and lunch. It is one of those things that as a parent you learn to recognize the various symptoms that all happen at once. 

The author, Michael Palmer who is now deceased, wrote a book that had autistic characters in it and at one point he described a hug one of these folks gave someone else. I couldn't believe it as he was describing a 'Steve hug' where he can put his arms around a person and never touch them. I emailed the author and asked him about his contact with an autistic person and it was his 15-year-old son. That was the sort of thing that I liked seeing in a book. But people do tend to lump all these sorts of people into the same basket. I do product reviews and had to review a book where one of the characters had Down Syndrome. One of the other reviewers said he had autism. So either he hadn't read the book or he just lumped them all together.

I believe that a lot of those that are diagnosed with autism are also mentally retarded but that could be as one doctor pointed out, their other difficulties getting in the way of an IQ test. My son thankfully is not, but he always complains about being not being as smart as his brother who was in gifted programs while in school, yet one day we were driving into town and he noticed a street sign and said oh, that's Cook Ave. So and so lives on that street.

2252,"That's sad.  And I'm sorry you had to experience that.  

Way back when I was in middle school, there was a disabled kid in my school.  Don't know which disability he had, perhaps CP, it was pretty severe.  He used an electric wheelchair, had speech issues, and was affected mentally.  My friends and I made fun of him a lot, almost always behind his back.  I would have been 12-14 years old.

I became disabled at age 22 -- spinal cord injury.  Now *I* use a wheelchair.  I'm not saying that life got revenge on me, but I will say that my level of compassion and understanding now is a lot better than it was when I was 12.  (And I also now have a niece with CP.)

The kids who made fun of you on the street won't be kids forever.  Life will happen to them, in whatever form that takes.  Some good things may happen to them; some bad things may happen.  What I do know is that when you're 12, what your friends think of you, and making your friends laugh, is super important, and sometimes that little bubble is all that matters; and who gets hurt in the crossfire isn't really all that important to you.  I'm not trying to excuse what they did, I just know that when I know *why* someone hurts me it helps take some of the sting away.

As to how would I react in this situation... like u/prince-of-dweebs said, there's nothing you can say in a few seconds that will really affect them, most likely.  I think what would be most satisfying for me would be to let fly with a string of loud, colorful expletives such as ""Get the fuck out of my sight, you stupid little-dicked cocksucking pieces of shit!  The next time I see you around here I'm going to take your fucking pictures, find you on the internet and tell your goddamn parents!""

2258,"""parent"" parking spots are not legally enforceable. There's no need for them. Having children is natural and normal and an ""inconvenience"" everyone on the planet deals with. If a woman is so disabled by her pregnancy she needs an accessible parking spot- her doctor will get her a temporary accessible tag good for a year or less, not the longer term blue ones.

Also parking lots are suppose to have a ration of 1 accessible parking spot per X number of total spaces- so if they removed an accessible spot and turned it into 'parent parking' they're likely breaking federal law.

Edit: I've seen parking for ""Veterans"" as well.... not specifically ""disabled vets"" just ""veterans"". Even with 35+ veterans in my family I feel the same way about those.  If they're a disabled vet they need the accessible spots, if they're not a disabled vet, they can park in any one of the regular spaces and freely walk into the store like every other free American.

First off, it's good of you to look out after this woman. It's quite kind. It's nice that she has someone like you, who she can rely on. Thank you for doing this.

It's shameful that people discriminate against those that fall under the auspices of the ADA. I would tell you friend that she should reach out to the local Housing Rights Authority (or similar agency) in whatever jurisdiction you live in. Second, I would inform her to seek the services of a civil rights attorney. She can look for one that specializes in housing rights, but it might not be necessary, since much of this is generalized discrimination. If she's having difficulties accomplishing these tasks, you could possibly help her by doing some online searches and providing her w/ your results in an e-mail. This might make it less overwhelming for her.

I would definitely have her speak w/ an attorney, however, since HOA lawsuits are quite common, and there are a number of states that require these disputes to be adjudicated in mediation sessions. Therefore, tackling this from an ADA-claim angle may be the best way to go, rather than strictly trying to force the HOA to abide by your contract.

2294,"In the end, YOU are the only one who knows whether it's time for a chair. Most doctors and other experts don't really know what it's like to have mobility problems and when it's the right time to use support. Listen to others, but listen to your body first.

&amp;nbsp;

For me, the turning point came when I had a number of hospital appointments and found that just walking through the hospital grounds to get to the meeting building was beyond my pain threshold. I can still walk, and walk as much as I'm able, but I can't go out anywhere without bringing on a flare-up that leaves me in severe pain. So I bought a cheaper wheelchair that I thought would fit my needs. It cost £300, which is above the cheapest versions at £100 to £150. This cheaper chair proved that I really needed a chair to get out and about and that my life was markedly improved by using the chair. After 6 months I then bought a chair for £2500 which was a much better fit to my needs and it's made my life so much better than the alternative, being totally housebound.

&amp;nbsp;

It's best to buy new if you can afford it, but there's nothing wrong with getting a cheap chair to test whether a chair answers your needs, or finding a second-hand chair in good condition. What kind of chair you best need is up to you to decide. I use a light-weight manual chair as my upper body is OK and the exercise I get being out and about is good for me, but if an electric chair suits you more, then don't hesitate to get one. Think of a chair like a pair of shoes; wearing slippers to run a race would be inefficient but wearing trainers is a much better idea.

The standing up and walking issue is not as offensive as your friends would believe, many people who use wheelchairs, myself included are fully capable of using our legs but for whatever reason it is not safe to do so for long periods of time. Again using myself as an example suffer from presyncope and syncope episodes(basically fainting or near fainting), if I eat too much or stand too long. Most days and errands I do walk and use a walking stick, but for all day outings I do have my wheelchair that I often get out and push if I am feeling well enough but will sit in and have help if I start feeling unwell(the chair is too big for me so I can't push myself).

2303,"I think the only real way is to talk to someone by the sounds of it. And I'm glad you reached out here. Although I think it might be a smarter idea to find maybe local disabled or disability groups and volunteer to help. That way you're thrown in at the deep end and you learn just how to interact.
I can't say I even now the best way to do so as everyone is different. I'm newer to disability in terms of walking issues and my experience wasn't a whole lot in terms of wheelchair users prior (or walking aid users) bar one kid in primary school.
I went to a disabilities activism thing in December last year and it was rather eye opening, sure I'm part of the community but these are kids (16-30years) all with varying issues and I must admit I didn't know where to start or how to communicate well. But thrown in at the deep end others helped me (I struggled with reading the amount of paperwork and instructions and such they'd given us) and once I sat down with the first ""book"" a person with education nor working in something. And got into the swing of look at them as a well of information. The aid they used faded to see just them.


For me this was a big thing because I felt and still feel at times that people only see the aid and that definately sounds like the issue you have and what I had.

So it might be worth looking into local community based help for disabled people. And volunteering. Because while it'll be nerve wracking you should learn from doing and seeing, just what you need to find.

Living the life honestly. It doesn't open your mind to it, as much as you'd think it would. Trust me I'm living it and I still feel myself on occasion trying to be in my own bubble or reality and not knowing how to approach others with different issues. Knowing not to ask in certain situations (some just aren't open or are still affected yada yada, where as some might where it on their sleeve with pride).

Biggest thing. Try not to assume someone can't do something because they have an aid. But also you need to learn when to ask if they need help.
And trust me it ain't easy and even I get it wrong (I'm in a choir for folks with life long conditions.).

But that anxiety. It will go. But you need the interaction because lack of social interaction on general can actually make it even harder when you have to think of others abilities to communicate or whatever.

I'm glad you are looking into it. And I'm an open book if you need. I don't think you were wrong to think using a chair would help. Your heart is in the right place. But the solution you've found may cause more issues with others and society than an alternative.

Is your CFS really bad this week? Use the wheelchair. Having a good energy day and your balance is on point? Then you don’t have to use it. I think there is this ableist narrative that pressures us to put off using assistive devices as long as possible just to keep doing activities in the way able-bodies folks do, when there is absolutely nothing wrong with using a device that will make your day more comfortable, keep you from falling, and help you conserve energy! 

Do you have insurance? If so, your doctor can write you a prescription for different types of chairs fitted to your body, with or without battery power. If this is an option, it can be a great way to go because you get a chair fit to your body. The trouble with buying cheaper “hospital chairs” is that the way the wheels are set far back—they aren’t really meant for you to propel yourself in them. I actually messed up by neck really bad using a hospital chair on my own.

This is why I gave you temp agencies as a model. They often have single-day jobs where the employee earns their full wage, and they make their money by charging *the person who already has money*, the employer.  Often times temp agencies charge nearly double what the employee gets paid, which is a great profit for the agency, and the employee struggling to get by gets their whole paycheck.

Obviously, you can take this feedback with a grain of salt if you like, but as disabled people we pay “disabled tax” everywhere we go already.

2351,"Hi, I'm going to start by saying I'm so sorry you're dealing with that. 

If you can not walk, but you can transfer yourself, a chair commode might be a option, or if you can sit, you can have someone help you on to the toilet and then step outside. The more you are able to do for yourself, the more independent you're able to be.

Try to exercise doing things you will need to do often:
Transfers, pretend to dress, try to stand with help, arm raises, etc, unless your doctor says otherwise.

If they cannot figure out what you have, ask to be referred to a specialist.

As for hanging out with friends, I understand not wanting your parents around all the time. Do you have a close abled friend you could ask to learn to help you out once in a while? Or maybe a cousin or sibling?

Frame it to your parents that they need time off from caregiving and you need time to feel like a regular kid. Once they trust you're safe with another caregiver, they may let up a bit.

I wasn't disabled at the time so I could fight back, but now that I am, I'm twice as careful as I was before. Please always have at least two very trusted friends who will stay sober, keep an eye out for creeps and jerks who will take advantage, and most importantly, don't take drugs or drinks without an adult caregiver dedicated to keeping you safe. Sometimes 18 year olds don't know what to do if someone is tripping balls or passes out. You have to be extra careful now especially. 

If I can answer any more questions, feel free to ask. I'm a ”Mom age” but I don't have kids of my own so I often get to mediate on behalf of both sides, and if your parents have questions about planning for your future care, especially when they become too old, they are welcome to ask away.

If you can not walk, but you can transfer yourself, a chair commode might be a option, or if you can sit, you can have someone help you on to the toilet and then step outside. The more you are able to do for yourself, the more independent you're able to be.

Try to exercise doing things you will need to do often:
Transfers, pretend to dress, try to stand with help, arm raises, etc, unless your doctor says otherwise.

If they cannot figure out what you have, ask to be referred to a specialist.

As for hanging out with friends, I understand not wanting your parents around all the time. Do you have a close abled friend you could ask to learn to help you out once in a while? Or maybe a cousin or sibling?

Frame it to your parents that they need time off from caregiving and you need time to feel like a regular kid. Once they trust you're safe with another caregiver, they may let up a bit.

2353,"Indonesia! That is interesting. You are a long distance from here. I have been through Winnipeg multiple times as though I live in Pennsylvania, USA I am right near Lake Eire and not far from Buffalo and on up to Canada. I went to college a long time ago in Regina, Saskatchewan for 4 years and I loved it. I didn't want to leave, but my student visa meant I had to unless I could get one of those guys, one in particular - HA! to marry me. A very terrific experience let me tell you. My family moved a lot while I was growing up and then basically settled in one city for around ten years, but we moved around there as well. When my Step-father came down with RA he decided he needed to get my mom 'home' back to her relatives. My mom had grown up in this part of the country. But then a few years later I went to college. One summer at college I was very privileged to go to Colombia and visit and learn about missionary work there. Also lived near New York City for a year and Hated it. I had never run into such a bunch of rude people, especially clerks in stores. I was supposed to be getting a gift for someone and I went and stood at the jewelry counter for 10 solid minutes while the two clerks yakked to each other an not once was I asked if they could help me. My first trip to the grocery store When the cashier was done checking me out, she stood there and glared at me and didn't put anything in bags (which is what they did everywhere else I lived!) She stood there not saying a word until I caught on and packed my own groceries while she stood there with her arms folded scowling at me! Many other things that I have no idea why anyone would want to live in the area. But all that moving and traveling did help me to see that there are many ways of doing things, and none of them 'perfect'. I have met a girl (well woman now as I have known her for about 50 years, her family took lots of trips and vacations and even took the church youth group on trips. So she was used to seeing other places as well. Her husband has never left our county! One kind of major big city and several small towns. Our area is sandwiched between Cleveland Ohio and Buffalo NY, You can drive from OH to NY, passing through Erie, PA in around an hour, and this guy hasn't stepped a toe over the line.  I have found that for the most part that people that never move and constantly stay in their comfort zone, are also the ones who tend to be set in their ways so much and they can't see the reason or the need to do things any differently. 

We moved here between my 10th and 11th grades and suddenly I was in a high school with a bunch of kids, that were so very settled, they had no mercy or understanding of 'new kids'. My first couple days there, I would be stopped in the hall and asked if I was new and in one class for sure, the teacher said, ""I see we only have one new student this year."" I had grown up in CA where the population was very mobile and about 1/3 of the students each year were new. So rather than anyone trying to get to know me, They taunted me for well over a year, and this sounds really stupid, but it shows just how much they didn't know me or even tried to get to know me. They kept telling me that to pass and graduate all the girls had to participate in a turkey cooking contest! So two years they kept this up, never realizing I had been helping in the kitchen since I was around 9, had my favorite cookie recipe memorized and was able to make them unsupervised by 11, taught myself how to make bread and rolls before I was a teenager, and during my last few years in high school I cooked the entire dinner on my own every Thursday night. I had never made a turkey, but I knew I could. So when they started that up again in 13th grade, I told them bluntly that if I had to cook a turkey I could. Turns out that it was a real contest, but no cooking involved. It was a written exam on nutrition, etc. None of it having been taught at the school. So I am a very FAST reader and I zoomed through this test and on the way out when we were all done I heard the girls talking about this test and they were all groaning because none of them had even been able to finish it! Of course, no one asked me about it. About a month later I was called to the principles office and as I was mentally trying to figure out what I had done wrong. When I got there, they congratulated me. I had WON the CONTEST!!!! HaHA!!!! So I go back to class and sit down surrounded by these nutty girls and a few minutes later the loudspeaker came on (very rare to disturb class time) and the principal told everyone that I had won the 'turkey' contest. Of course, he didn't mention anything about turkeys, as he hadn't been in on the 'joke'. Boy was those girls faces red! Graduation day comes as I get my cap and gown on, I had some kids I didn't even know come up and congratulate me, for why I didn't know but I was polite and said thank you and then what for. While all these dumb girls especially, but most of the class never got to know me, I was graduating with highest honors! Since no one had ever even got involved in a conversation (but one guy in French class and he was 2 years behind me) they had no understanding that I was smart! When I had an interview to go to nursing school when I was 30, the one interviewing me mentioned how well I had done in school and I asked her where my standing was as no one had ever told me. 5th out of 177 students. And to think that those girls prefer teasing me and threatening me, then trying to cheat off of me or ask to study with me! Those two years that were so horrible for me, would have been so different if even one student had tried to be friendly. I had moved so often to new schools, but by the time I got to that last school, I just didn't have the 'oomph' to try making yet again a new set of friends.  I didn't fit in and when I first got there I was grieving for losing my friends and most of all leaving a perfectly good/ no make that great boyfriend behind. I wasn't into drinking or smoking (one girl in describing her weekend was boasting how she had thrown up in some kids parents closet! - yeah sure those girls I want to associate with!). But college made up for that and made friends easily.

That 'old' boyfriend of mine, with the internet we are in contact again. He mentored me via email on how to sell online, encourages me when needed and has proved to be one of the absolute greatest friends of my life! It has been almost exactly 49 years to the day that I last saw him. With his help, I was able to start selling online and after a few years of starting to sell, I was able to start using some of the money for regular expenses, and now it is money we depend on. I have been able to save some on a monthly basis, depending on sales and income, since of course, it is never static, sometimes I could only put $30-40 in my retirement accountant. But knowing how I feel these days and knowing I am getting close to not have the physical stamina to sell, I have really been pushing to get more into savings. Crazy to hear what the average American has saved for retirement and during the time I have been disabled, I have saved that much and more! I had been married before that wiped me out financially otherwise I would have a very nice 'nest egg'. I have for the most part supported myself since I was 17, now 63 so I am getting tired bit time. But my husband has health problems as well so we don't go out much other than to the doctors or grocery store. I was poor all my life so never got into fancy expensive habits. Same with him. So when I hear about couples needing $50-60K at the minimum to get by, I can't figure out what they spend it on. We get by and have to on a whole lot less than that.

I am thankful for the fact I can get Social Security Disability and when I turn 65 it will just be Social Security. I worked enough as a nurse to have upped my income so that I get the 'average' SS check. But I also get and pay for Medicare and a drug plan which pays for most of my health expenses except for drug co-pays. I am thankful for it as I have to have a lot of expensive drugs to give me any quality of life. I try to find something to be grateful for as much as possible. My brother and his wife and children lived in Indonesia as missionaries for years. Some problems came up and they don't do that anymore, but my nephew's daughter who had just turned 12 in March apparently committed suicide about a month ago due to depression. Yes, I can understand a child having depression, but bad enough to kill herself, before she was old enough to have a boyfriend, a job, a life. It is awful. I had never met her, but such a sad situation. But, I have found that it is hard to be down or depressed when you become grateful for what you do have. For me, the major things, are my husband that cares, as well as my sons, my DIL, I got my first granddaughter this past year who is the cutest little girl in the world, my old friend who has a piece of my heart forever, I found two old friends from earlier in life on Facebook as well. Lots to be grateful for AND I have enough money coming in that I can afford my addiction - chocolate! And plenty of crafting materials that I got almost free at thrift stores and yard sales, lots of books to read and learn from, and I could go on for a very long time.

It gave me hope and peace, but I understand the experience is very different for everyone. I guess to put it in a few sentences: Why would God allow me to suffer so much without any benefit? What’s the point of me seeking pain management and rehabilitation if after I die there is nothing?

I truly believe my SCI, EDS, and POTS diagnoses will allow me to be a much better doctor than I could ever imagine, especially since this happened between 16-18 years old. I want to be a surgical pediatric oncologist. 

I am always open to talking to others about faith, but I realize it’s a deeply personal subject, and I respect anyone regardless if they are atheist, religious, or anything between.","[{'start': 159, 'end': 178, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

2365,"I'd start by fleshing out who your character is.

In terms of their disability, do you want it to be something the character was born with, or developed/acquired later in life ?

If you choose to go with ""developed"" then I'd actually recommend fully drafting your character the exact same way you would any other character, plot out their personality, motivations, goals, quirks, everything, don't even think about their current disability until you're done.

Then briefly think of a backstory for their disability, is it an injury, an illness, etc did it develop gradually so they were learning to cope with their changing ability while learning to accept their situation, or was it sudden so they had a more abrupt period of realisation. This can sometimes change how people identify with their disability.

For example I was born with my joint issues, so I don't know any different and I've never thought of myself as ""disabled"" but rather I'm just me, I happen to have a disability.

I'd be careful with using the disability as motivation for a characters goal or the ""actions"" they can perform in game, there's a realistic way to do it and a way that's sort of cliche and inspiration porny. For example, the character used to love horse riding but got injured specifically from horse riding and now they can't horse ride but because they're disabled their other senses are heightened so now they can telepathically connect with horses, that's a really pandering idea, I've seen it done before, personally that's not relatable even if it's set in a fantasy genre where horse telepathy is real. Eg: Just because I'm physically disabled it didn't suddenly make me smarter so if that happened to a character I can't relate - just make it so they already had those powers before the injury but since they spent less time riding they were able to refine those powers. I personally don't like seeing disabilities represented in a way where it's like ""oh yeah, she's missing an arm but it's ok because she's amazing at everything else she can do""


Your character still needs flaws and vulnerabilities to be believable and realistic, don't make disability their only vulnerability. People with disabilities have all the same flaws and fears as able bodied people.

Also depending on the disability, and the type of wheelchair you choose, do a bit of research on people from that subset of the disability community who represent that character to know how to program movement. Some people are incredibly talented with how they manoeuvre their chairs and other chairs require very specific environments to safely operate. I'm sure many full time chair users can tell you about rain and now, personally I only used chair part time for a very short period when my condition worsened in my 20s, but through physical therapy I was able to return to using crutches.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1565945467,t5_2qhe8,t3_cr0qm8,t3_cr0qm8,2,1574238638,0,0,ex1hjq5,disability,,,,,

One of the people who came with us part of the way had a blue and gold macaw named Oscar. He hung out with us everywhere we went, and even got us free entrance into a Phish concert at Red Rocks amphitheater in Colorado. ��

Even though you trained your bird with reward based conditioning, I bet you still have lots of love and connection combined in with that. People have more capacity for development in that area than animals, because of our more developed pre-frontal brain region. 

I don’t have birds, but I have cats and they are quite chill from having me home all day. One is a super lap cat, but the other is naturally more skittish. Got her at 3 months, and she was already that way, but I have her sleeping under the blanket with me every morning, and letting me give her lots of rubs and cuddles. I did it by respecting her space and allowing her to come to me. The other one literally climbs in my arms and flips herself over on her back, like a baby doll, to take her nap every afternoon.
