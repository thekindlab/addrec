61,"I tend to agree with the labeling bit. However, it is my opinion and preference that none be used at all unless necessary. This is because they are all so vague, even the more accepted terms. Even my diagnosis is an umbrella term that really doesn’t mean much. I would rather just explain it briefly with words that actually mean something tangible. Weakness in the leg muscles, balance issues and pain takes up almost the same amount of time to say Mild Spastic Cerebral Palsy and a lot less to explain. 

With the “inspiration porn” discourse I find it pointless at best. The only time I have issues with it is if it is of a person who didn’t want their image shared around. That is to say it is no one’s job to go around policing our images and the like. I actually found a very funny and inspirational youtuber through it being shared to facebook. The issue with policing “inspirational porn” comes in as people try to, usually inadvertently, push a “right way” to be disabled.

70,"Okay, i hate to tell you this because you seem very upset but the chances of it being taken off you is pretty much 80%. They do this deliberately, in the hopes disabled people will give up and therefore, they save money. Except they don’t, they spend more in assessing everyone that they save that’s a rant for another day.

It’s easier said than done, but you have to remain calm now and plan out your appeals process for after. You Might be fine, you Might get the rates you deserve but this the dwp, I don’t want to lie to you just to make you feel better about it. Forewarned is forearmed. 

Just present the worst day to them. If you can’t do something on your worst day, don’t do it. If they needle and keep pushing you, changing the parameters of the question to get an answer, point that out to them. Be friendly, but firm. Wear your pyjamas. 

And then if you don’t get it, which it is against your favour, be ready to appeal. Are you on Facebook? There’s some wonderful support groups on there to help you appeal. And, what they sneakily do and did to me at first, was they awarded me a lower rate than what I really qualified for. They do this so people will go “oh well at least i got something, I don’t want to cause a fuss by appealing” and save them the payouts. Don’t fall for that trap. 

Yes it’s scary and it’s stressful, but do everything to show you Need the PIP and you’ll have a better starting point to appeal. I’m sorry that might not be what you want to here.

90,"My fiance, last year, almost lost the ability to walk. He had pins and needles down his leg, muscle weakness, exhaustion and a whole host of other problems. It looked like he had ms. Bear in mind this happened in just over a month and lasted 6 months. We were terrified.

He was eventually diagnosed with a B12 deficiency caused by crohns. After taking some vitamin pills he gained his strength back. Unfortunately his crohns flared up because of the meds he was on previously. Now he's dealing with abdominal pain and other issues every day.

This all seems pretty horrible. But the point is he is getting better. Slowly, but still moving in the right direction. It's taking time to find the right meds and diet but as someone said the worst part of it is always the struggle after diagnosis. We are a very adaptive species. It's our big advantage. It's been hell but I know things will get better. We've just had to adapt.

I'm sorry you are going through something like this. I've seen first hand how terrifying it is. But I've also seen how people recover, how even if we have really bad days there are still small improvements showing through even if it is just trying to taper life to your new situation.

If it also helps I consider myself disabled too. I finished university with a good degree then immediately had a breakdown. I realised that a lot of dreams I had would no longer be. But I found a new one. A much better one. To the point where I am actually glad I feel off the rails. Cause if I had kept going I would have rode right off a cliff.

He was eventually diagnosed with a <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> deficiency caused by crohns. After taking some vitamin pills he gained his strength back. Unfortunately his crohns flared up because of the meds he was on previously. Now he's dealing with abdominal pain and other issues every day.

This all seems pretty horrible. But the point is he is getting better. Slowly, but still moving in the right direction. It's taking time to find the right meds and diet but as someone said the worst part of it is always the struggle after diagnosis. We are a very adaptive species. It's our big advantage. It's been hell but I know things will get better. We've just had to adapt.

I'm sorry you are going through something like this. I've seen first hand how terrifying it is. But I've also seen how people recover, how even if we have really bad days there are still small improvements showing through even if it is just trying to taper life to your new situation.

If it also helps I consider myself disabled too. I finished university with a good degree then immediately had a breakdown. I realised that a lot of dreams I had would no longer be. But I found a new one. A much better one. To the point where I am actually glad I feel off the rails. Cause if I had kept going I would have rode right off a cliff.

I don't know what will happen in the future. But you are not alone. A lot of people have their lives turned upside down by health reasons. But most do recover. They may never be like they were once. But they are living their new life to the full.","[{'start': 307, 'end': 326, 'entity_type': 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE', 'text': '<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

It would have been so much easier throughout the years to say you had an accident either implying another car was involved or it was a wet stormy night and you didn't see the bridge. I am glad that you have had the past 30 years. I understand chronic unrelenting pain due to rheumatoid arthritis. I was already into the moderately/severe stage by the time I was diagnosed. Chronic pain is no fun to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

I did want to mention something. I have never had depression other than some situational depression due to things like flares of even worse pain where all I want to do is curl up in a ball, suck my thumb and hope it will eventually pass. So several years ago a wonderful young lady from our church was killed in an auto accident. She had graduated HS a few months before and was well loved, I cried that day, and the next, and the next, etc. After 30 days of crying every single day and not being able to shake it off and while she was a nice young lady, I didn't know her that well to be crying every day about it. I asked my husband to see if it had anything to do with my medication. It didn't take him long. I had just been started on a new med right before that girl was killed. Turns out the med already had a black-box warning that it could cause depression and suicidal ideations! No joke! I immediately quit taking it and within 2-3 days I was back to my usual self. So if out of the blue it seems some who have never been depressed, suddenly is, look at the most recent thing added into their medication list whether prescription medication, over the counter or various herbs like you would get from a homeopathic practitioner if they are known to have depressant effects, call your MD. Don't know for sure? Ask your pharmacist. In any case, some new symptom like depression needs to have a doctor involved as soon as possible. If you are scared to call your own doc.

139,"&gt; I have found that pain is way more disabling than my paralysis.

Exactly. 

I was 10. I’m 28 now. It’s difficult because I already had diminished motor skills/coordination before I had the accident, and I still do. It’s a daily aggravation also because my joints are hypermobile, so overusing my only functional hand takes its toll. 

It’s like I’m having both hardware and software problems. 

But I don’t consider my hand to be a disability in-and-of itself. What I do consider to be a physical disability is my orthostatic intolerance/dysautonomia, chronic fatigue/chronic pain, and joint hypermobility/connective tissue issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Wages affect federal and state benefits that are income sensitive, disability payments do not.  So if someone is receiving food stamps, WIC, etc., once they hit the eligibility threshold, they are no longer eligible for those programs. Disability maxes out at \~$2,000 for the individual and \~$800 for eligible dependents (I'm going from memory on the figures, don't crucify if I'm off a bit) - hardly enough to support a family with no other means of income.

Additionally, wages are reported to the IRS and therefore taxable; if you are paying into state, federal and SS, aren't you just subsidizing your disability payments and reducing your net ""income""?

I’m not trying to be harsh, but I am being frank. If all of the reasons you’re considering bailing are related to his disability, I don’t think you’re really seeing him. I think the only person who can really answer these questions is you. 

Dating someone with a disability is difficult-but so is living with a disability yourself. When you have one you can’t just break up with it. I don’t mean to try and pressure you into continuing things with him, but I think a lot of abled people forget that it’s not always about them in these situations.

When all else fails? Talk to him. Hell, he may make the decision for you. Whichever way you decide, I wish you both the best.",,,,throw_away_45672,,,1557334995,t5_2qhe8,t3_bm5yzu,t3_bm5yzu,4,1561750211,0,0,emug5xk,disability,,,,,

Do a little research and see how going to school affects your benefits so you’re prepared.  Remember, just because you are able to go to school or work now doesn’t mean you will always be able to, BUT and the system does accommodate that. There is a trial period for weaning off of benefits, and should you become to sick to work., you can go back on them. You’ll have to get approved again, but with such a long medical history it probably won’t be as difficult as it is for most people the first time.

243,"I definitely see you posted this more than 2 weeks ago but if you're still looking at fursuit options, I have my 2 cents to put in, as I've been recently looking at fursuits.

I would agree with the other commenter and say that a partial is definitely a good start (especially since you're in college and probably don't have big $$$ to spend)

I know that there are 2 kinds of somewhat unique head types that allow for greater vision while worn. A kemono type head (Japanese style with large eyes) or a realistic head with no eyes. Obviously the latter is very unique and not everyone is a fan of the realistic style, but the youtuber Shetani has a great suit that actually makes use of her glasses. Otherwise, I believe most toony fursuit heads have room for glasses, but if you found a certain maker you liked, I'd just check with them that glasses would fit. (Some makers who do more realistic heads use resin bases that would be otherwise impossible to use with glasses)
Another option would be changing the type of mesh used in the eyes. Most mesh used in the toony style heads is fairly densely woven, but when held up to the eye it kind of creates the effect of looking through a window screen. If you find a maker you like, I would possibly talk to them about using a less-dense mesh in order to increase visibility.

As for footpaws, I would definitely try to mock up something that's similar to footpaws if you can, and to test walking around in those? I know my cousin with CP needs all the traction she can get with her shoes in order to walk (with an aid) so I would definitely test some stuff out before committing to an idea. Maybe you could get shoe covers? Think of like those cheap halloween costumes where they just have the fabric you slip over your shoe with the little strap that goes underneath your foot so it looks like you're ""wearing"" boots. If done by a skilled fursuiter, that could be a good ""faux footpaw"" without hindering any of your normal mobility.

And of course, have a handler, especially for your first time fursuiting. I've done a couple intense cosplays myself where I've needed a friend to act as a handler. Not just to ""protect"" me/my cosplay from the people around me, but to make sure I'm doing ok.

266,"I would start looking into women's shelters nearby, and be sure to utilize private browsing tabs and clearing browser/call history. If you can talk to your family or friends and get a ride somewhere, that could at least get you out of the house to be picked up by someone else to go to a shelter. 

Coming from an abusive family, my best advice to make it through this is to keep your head down and maintain normalcy as much as possible at home. If you can, try to slowly stash away clothes, toiletries, etc, in a bag you can hide and easily get to. I call this a ""go-bag,"" where you at least have the bare essentials in the event of an emergency. Buy a burner phone (can find them at places like Dollar General and Walmart) if you can, and program all your important numbers, just in case he breaks your phone or has access to/control over your phone service account. Make sure all your important documents (social security card, birth certificate, medical records, etc) are secure and safe, maybe even leave them with a trusted friend or family member for you to collect later. When you feel safe enough to, then you can take the final step and gtfo. If it takes you a while because of financial or emotional setbacks, that's okay, and you're not wrong for feeling fearful or powerless. I would suggest hiding out with a friend, preferably one that he doesn't know where they live, until you can get set up with your own place or with an accessible women's shelter. 

I know right now you probably feel powerless and hopeless. I want you to know that your situation is not your fault, it's nothing you have precipitated, and you deserve so much better. In case anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they're full of shit. If you feel guilty or ashamed or like you're making a big deal of nothing, know that he is the one who has put those feelings in your head, and you aren't doing anything wrong. 

As for surviving right now, I'd suggest trying to spend as much time as you can with friends and family, but discretion is key. Going slow and gradually increasing your time away from home makes it less suspicious. Then, it might seem completely normal to spend the night there or ""go out of town"" for a couple days. That gives you a window to take a few days to figure things out before he'd get wise to the fact that you left. Again, try to be as boring and inconspicuous as possible at home, and cover all your tracks. That might include logging out of reddit every time you use it, to make sure he doesn't see posts like this. I don't know how much he hovers and snoops, but a bit of paranoia is understandable in this situation. 

A's much as it sucks to say it, don't count on an apology or ever getting to give him what-for and air your grievances. Unfortunately, that could just make the situation a lot worse for you, and you want to put as much distance between the two of you as you can. Block everywhere, never ever answer his calls, file a protection order or restraining order if you fear he might come and hurt you, and don't let your well-meaning family or friends let any info slip. 

And finally, once you are free of him and his influence, I highly recommend finding a trauma therapist. Those of us at r/CPTSD have all kinds of great discussions and resources in the meantime, and it might help you to find the right kind of therapist and therapy method to help you. I know it might seem silly or unnecessary, but you'd be surprised what crazy behaviors and thought patterns we pick up when trying to survive abuse. It can be really helpful to unlearn all the shit that comes from making yourself as small and unassuming as possible all the time.

Cell phone camera flashes have been able to blink for YEARS. Certainly not as long as vibrate but still this is not new.

This is a totally personal decision, and I'm not going to guilt anyone who makes the decision to not date someone who has a disability.  But I dated someone who took a year and a half to decide that it wasn't right for them, and in that time I grew quite close to that person, and it made it all the more devastating in the end.  They were quite frank, too; they told me point blank that it was because of my disability...""You're great, but...""

In all that time, they never talked to me about their concerns for fear of hurting my feelings.  They tried to think and decide all on their own, without any input from me, and let me believe that we were just fine and nothing was threatening our relationship.  I was pretty blindsided.

Don't let your concerns about hurting feelings, or about seeming ""less progressive"" keep you in a relationship with a disabled person if you don't want to be in it.  Don't do us any favors.

426,"Marking visually impaired doesn’t really mean anything in terms of extra assistance. The workers and drivers are generally rude to everyone, so I would limit any unnecessary interaction with them and be prepared for your bus arriving late, not having a driver, being oversold, or some other issue that puts you on the next schedule/bus and delays your final arrival. They have a mobile app and a website that you can can use to see how late the bus is running/the updated departure time.

If it’s a regular station, then I would show up at least 30 mins before departure just in case. If you are traveling with a large bag or suitcase you’ll have to “check it” for free. They will just weigh it and give you a tag to put on it in case it gets lost. Then you’ll sit down in the waiting area with your luggage until they yell your bus number and the door to line up at. Someone (the driver usually) will check your ticket at the door, and if the bus is almost full, they may organize people in line by their boarding number on the ticket. 

As you approach the bus, someone will be there to put your suitcase under it for you. Then you’ll step up 3 or 4 large steps. The unspoken rule is to sit as close to the front as possible, so I would try to get the first or second row. They may stop for a 5-15 minute break at a gas station or similar place, where people can walk, smoke, etc. before getting back on the bus and continuing on. When you exit the bus at your next stop/transfer or final destination, be sure to collect your luggage.

If you are getting on the same bus, the driver will have given you what’s called a “reboarding pass” with a number they call before other ticket holders that lets you get back on the bus first. If you are just transferring buses, repeat the entire process from sitting in the waiting room with your checked bag.",,,,JustCallMeSteven,,,1557692329,t5_2qhe8,t3_bnrhsc,t3_bnrhsc,2,1561996672,0,0,en8zl0c,disability,,,,,

448,"&gt; Should I bring these things up with him? 

I don't understand the benefit of doing this since these are things he can't control. It's not like he has annoying habits that you can ask him to work on. Even if he were able-bodied he might have very different interests, such as staying home and playing video games while you enjoy backpacking. That's a good enough reason not to continue the relationship.

But really, you don't need a ""reason"" to break up with someone other than you're not compatible. It's up to you whether or not to feel guilty and it's up to others whether or not to see you as a jerk. You can't control them and you really don't need to defend your decision. 

I'm sure he's not dense and that he knows his disability will affect his dating life and relationship prospects. Think about what you want your life to look like and if he is compatible with it. If not, let him find someone who will be happier with him. I think it would be kind of cruel to say ""I like you, but..."" or ""if you didn't have the SCI...""

Eating causes blood to pool in your abdomen to help digest food, but can make your symptoms temporarily worse, so I avoid eating immediately before I need to be upright. Wheelchair use can make it worse, so if it is your primary reason, then maybe try other means of treatment first or you may find yourself reliant upon wheelchair use and it will be much harder to cope with at that point.

Whether you use something like online grocery shopping out of necessity or because you are feeling ""lazy"" shouldn't make a difference. If that's what you want  or need to spend your money on, go ahead. Disabled? Not disabled? WHO CARES? It's YOUR MONEY.  


Personally, I don't do much online grocery shopping because I worked in that role and I wouldn't trust most of my coworkers to  actually get my order correct. Sure, I may order some pre-packaged food  off Amazon or get an occasional Misfits Market box, but I have the physical ability and time to shop for myself, so that's what I'm going to do.",,,,honeylissabee,,,1557285338,t5_2qhe8,t3_blw15e,t1_emsjqu1,14,1561721601,0,0,emsrek4,disability,,,,,

611,"Hi, thank you for sharing. It's heartbreaking to hear you've lost hope. I've also been there and I felt the only way to cope with the possibility of never being accepted / pursued wholeheartedly was to be content with myself. 

It took me a while to learn this. I've been in a few long term relationships in my early 20s while my symptoms were ""mild"" and learned that my parters didn't care about my physical disability but rather the state of my mental health. They couldn't stand that I wasn't happy, or was being negative. I was very anxious and likely not as fun to be around. Even in a relationship, I found I wasn't happy so something had to change within myself. So, I worked on my independence -  emotionally and physically. I was preparing to be single for the rest of my life. I figured if I was going to be alone, I should at least be happy while I'm at it.

Before meeting my current partner, I've always been emotionally reserved and the dates I did go on, I would keep them at a distance. I guess I feared rejection and knew not to get my hopes up due to my situation (as I always suspected they didn't want to invest in / commit to me).  Of course I assumed this and maybe didn't give them a chance but as I got older and my symptoms worsened, I discovered it did scare potential dates away. A big blow to my self esteem for sure. With time, it gets to you and you feel awful about yourself. I've been there.

Welp, you can't force or make people love you or see past your condition but you can love yourself, enjoy your solitude and find joy/gratitude through friendships and family. I'm a firm believer that you'll attract people/things/experiences that reflect your state of being. 

Best of luck! x

Society in general is about a million years behind in just properly accommodating disabled people. I feel bad for this kids who can’t get something as basic as a decent and equal education.

BTW I’m not trying to discount the part of parents who won’t send their kids to deaf school for some dumb reason involving stigma and ignorance.

629,"It might help to know what you are researching for when giving you information, but I will answer as best I can anyway.

Spinal cord injuries are classified in two ways. Firstly, the level of injury will tell you where the spine was damaged and as a result which nerves do not function. The spine is named in regions called the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral (top to bottom) and each vertebra has a number within that section with the lowest number being the highest vertebra. The cervical spine is where the nerves controlling the arms are, so an SCI in the cervical spine leads to quadriplegia. Paraplegia is a result of an injury below T1.

The next part of the classification is the ASIA (American spinal injury association) classification which goes from A-E. ASIA-A: a complete loss of feeling and movement. ASIA-B: feeling, but no movement. ASIA-C: feeling and movement, but more than half of key muscles can move, but not against gravity. ASIA-D: feeling and movement, more than half of key muscles can move against gravity. ASIA-E: feeling and movement normal.

With traumatic SCIs in particular, the injuries can resolve themselves over time. It might be helpful to think about the nerves being bruised, so until the bruising heals, the nerves dont work. When you sustain an SCI, physios will work hard to prevent muscle wasting so that if the nerves do start to function again, there are still muscles there for them to use. A complete paraplegic cannot walk, but their injury classification may change, so they would then be an incomplete para and be able to walk. It is important to note that this change in function happens soon after injury, not years later.

With a classification of ASIA-A/B/C the person will not be able to walk. With a classification of ASIA-D, depending on the muscle groups that can be used it is possible to walk, but it will most likely involve very intense physio and possibly orthotics and walking aids. It can be physically exhausting trying to compensate for the non-functioning muscle groups and as a result, they may still need to use a wheelchair outdoors or for longer journeys to avoid pain, fatigue and to reduce the risk of falls.

The chances of being reclassified from ASIA-A to D is an awful lot slimmer than C-D for example, so someone with an incomplete SCI is more likely to be able to walk again.

668,"Hi! Thank you for sharing your experiences with me. I can truly relate. Being ""different"" is a disadvantage and I find when you open up about your ""downfalls"", it robs the opportunity of others getting to know the real you. There is no chance of a build up in courtship. Some people can't seem to get past the physical differences as it really hinders their perception of us, (or anyone living with health issues). People forget we didn't choose to have a disability/get sick. The unknown really terrifies people and some choose to be ignorant.

And I agree, the word disability has a lot of negative associations with it. Sometimes I'll use ""differently abled"" or something along those lines but sometimes I'll consciously use the word Disability to get people used to hearing it in a different way. I'll try to empower the word and educate instead of fearing/avoiding it.

You're blessed to have a daughter and one you've raised to have compassion. I'm a woman who wants to have children some day but I fear of the inevitable hardship I'll endure due to my limited mobility + strength. Before I met my current partner, I was always hard on myself, thinking I couldn't ever have children or that no one would want me as their life partner. Eventually, I've made peace with both outcomes of motherhood.

I also manage my environment to manage my symptoms. Although, it gets quite exhausting sometimes but that's part of our plight.

Have faith! I find for me, meeting someone organically was always the best way to find love / companionship, even before I became disabled. This sounds cheesy but I worked on loving myself first and its attracted my current partner now. My advice is: be positive, love yourself and it'll attract the right things / things you deserve :) Best of luck!

Here is some general information about SSA rules and practices. In the absence of other significant evidence, evidence of successful participation in leisure or other activities without significant difficulties or assistance, can be construed by SSA as evidence of work related capacity. However by SSA rules, they should also consider any difficulties, limitations or assistance required in activities as affirmative evidence of disability.  The fact that someone has significant difficulties in engaging in activities such as hobbies, school or work can be taken as evidence that supports a finding of disability. If engaging or trying to engage in an activity triggers or exacerbates symptoms, that is generally taken as evidence of significant limitations. 

I strongly recommend discussing this concern with your attorney so that they may be able to better contextualize and frame this event in their arguments to the judge if necessary.  Your attorney will request and review records from your therapist and other health care providers, and additional contextual information from you may be helpful as your attorney works with you to prepare for hearing. A large part of your attorney’s job is to help present your best case to the judge. Having honest and accurate information from you will help your attorney do their job. Consulting and preparing with your attorney may also alleviate some of the stress you are feeling about how this may or may not impact your case.

The reason the spaces are separate is because there's a backrest and a support rail in the wheelchair space.

736,"I hear you for sure, except that no one's telling me this--I'm telling myself. I've been working all my adult life and have been on a downhill slide until I had a complete mental breakdown and became totally disabled. I've finally been diagnosed with ASD, but since I limped along in society for so long, it's hard for me to accept that I qualify as disabled--even though I would tell anyone else like me that of course they are and their struggles aren't trivial etc etc. Mental illness really stands between me and any kind of self-love or -acceptance. Both sides of my family are very ""by your bootstraps"" and didn't know much about, talk about, or really acknowledge mental illness until I broke that trail. Turns out both sides are rife with it, but no one ever talked about it. Like, I didn't even know there was a word for how I was until I was like 17 (persistent and treatment-resistant depression, generalized anxiety, and of course the autism). I didn't realize how much I'd been taught to look down on people who don't, or ""won't,"" work until it was me. Not that I was mean to anyone or family members were, it was just little things like how so many people get financial aid who don't ""deserve"" it because they're not disabled enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Well now that person is me. And I've been having a really hard time accepting the help I'm so fortunate to be given from the government. I can cover all my expenses, though if I had to drive I wouldn't be able to. I tell myself that the money goes right back into the economy and that I've tried my best to work and it led to me just disintegrating as a human being. Now I just don't know what to do with my life, and part of me hates myself for being a burden on society. Even though of course I would tell anyone else that that's ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think, OP, that your family is very much like mine. I'd also like to tell you, though, that my family has come around enough to support me--even if I can't support myself. My mom didn't ""believe in"" depression and I had to drag her into the psychiatrist's office to have a doctor tell her that this actually exists and is in my brain, I'm not just whining or ""sad sometimes."" They've been supportive of my recent ASD diagnosis, and when I get depressed and self-loathing they tell me that I'm not a burden, they're not disappointed in me, and what I've gone through is real and I shouldn't feel bad about accepting help.

Now it's part of *me* that feels like....what if I'm just lazy? When there's nothing to point to or prod or treat, it's hard to ""justify"" to myself not working. I feel like a lazy POS bum, even though I know what will happen if I push too hard. Like you, I just want to be normal and have a job and feel like a contributing member of society. It's really upsetting to me that I don't know if or how I can do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's possible that they'll come around if you keep trying? It took a very long time for my family to accept the way I am and that there are legitimate labels for it. I guess what I'm saying is, keep trying with them. It's worked pretty hard into society that you're supposed to work and be able to support yourself, and people who can't or won't are lesser. I think it kind of just comes along inevitably with a capitalist society. It's a perceived meritocracy, and I think that when people see someone getting something *they* don't think they ""deserve,"" it's upsetting to them and they blame the person and are resentful. Because of how it's *supposed* to work. You're *supposed* to work hard and get what you earn for yourself and deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I think there's a really big generational component. IMHO, Boomers were *able* to work hard at one job for their whole career and get benefits and pay and stability that they take for granted. They feel like it was so easy for them to do, it all just happened, so how can everyone nowadays not do it too? They must be lazy. It's just not like that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, support services for matching people with disabilities to work that works for them are just nonexistent. We're not a valued part of the work force to begin with, and we have to fight for accommodation and to make ""able"" people understand that we *do* very much want to work, but it has to not destroy us in the process. I think a lot of people just don't understand that sometimes we have to choose between doing ""normal"" things and continuing to exist. What for other people might be routine can cost us a lot, and mental illness is there lurking and just waiting for us to weaken.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope your family becomes more supportive in the future. Maybe you could speak with a psychologist about how to talk to them about it? Maybe bring them one at a time to some sessions to talk through all this? Having a medical authority speak with my mom, and having numerous medical assessments from my ASD specialist has really helped me and my family situation. Or even if there's like a book or something on how to talk to people about disability?

739,"very great advice! thank you very much for your help. 

in a normal situation or setting this would work.

in the past I have tried such thing but in response have only gotten negative problems from it in my situation. an example would be... I fold the laundry (i dont do this)... they would get used to me folding laundry and start expecting me to do it all every time.

also in my situation... a few months ago after being institutionalized... I have lost everything I owned and came home with only one set of clothing. everybody said they would help of course, but no one did. I bought tons of clothes, a tv, an xbox, a mattress, as well as several other thing id need (a fan, ect.). I even got smart and bought a t shirt press to make my own sublimation ink t shirts instead of buying premade t shirts at a higher price. 

i keep this in mind when im asked to do something for somebody and they get used to it. if I were to do a simple task... theyd give me nothing. if a stranger were to do a simple task... theyd instantly whip out money to give them. Im my shoes... I need plenty of money for medications that I am on (6 pills a day, 2 medications, soon to be a 3rd). Sometimes I just need $2 for a refill on a medication... and I am told many curse words, with family forgetting all the things Ive done for them.

I literally bought everything I have right now possession wise, I buy my own food, pay my own bills (not theirs), cook my own meals, and do what I want to do. 

It beats being cursed out over a box of pizza that I never asked for any day!

I just need to get away from my family but that wont be a reality untill Im in an ideal and stable sitauation",,,,murdanyc916,,,1556867505,t5_2qhe8,t3_bjrsha,t1_embdpdl,1,1561455311,0,0,eme285p,disability,,,,,

745,"I'm extremely sorry that you've had to deal with so many physical and mental health disabilities and have had family and friends treat you the way they have.

I have a number of mental health problems and a few chronic pain conditions that have disabled me since I was a teen and then later after a few years of improvement I was in a series of car accidents that created more issues in my early twenties.  I went from a person who worked 60 to 80 hours a week because I never wanted to be dependent and at the mercy of anyone again, I was set to be promoted to a position of area manager in my company and then expected in another year to be a district manager at 24 making what would be a more than comfortable salary roughly 20 years later; all this because I had more hustle than anyone else ready for promotion at the time.  And then I could barely manage 15 hrs a week or even less suddenly following the aforementioned car accidents.

Like you, family, friends and even some co workers all thought I was lazy and a malingerer and how nice it would be to take off so much work.  I have had so many people who have known me talk shit about me for going on two decades, including my older sister who now has been disabled with some of the very same or similar issues.  She acts like she is the only one who ever had problems in their life and it's a competition of who had it worse.  She acts like  my younger sister who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age thirteen is also lazy and mooching off my parents despite the fact that she's been on SSI disability benefits since forever and that the times my sister tried to get a job, my abusive parents did things to sabotage her.  I also have a great aunt who literally wrote shit in birthday cards every year scolding me for supposedly eating and sleeping my life away and that my problems weren't real.  And how disappointed and angry that I have wasted my life.  I really wish I could have written her back to ask who the fuck did she think was more disappointed about *my* damned life and who would willing choose to be in my position.  But I didn't want to give her a heart attack so.  Yeah, so you can see I am real salty about all this shit from ppl. 

 I have cut a lot of people out of my life but it's hard finding new people who are patient and understanding and don't get burned out from caring too much early on and then having it be too much later.

Anyhow, without me further rambling on, I just want to say that I totally get where you are coming from and can completely relate to the way people have treated you regarding you being disabled and unable to work.  Like you, I would give anything to not have a life that is a permanent sick day; to be able to work; have a career; have money and a car and a place to live that was my own again; to have something to show for the 41 years I have been alive; to have more of a social life; to see and do things that I have always wanted to do but haven't because of all the things holding me back; to not be forced to live from day to day because it is such a struggle to contend with physical and emotional pain every day of my life for over 20 years now; to not have fucking relatives who are so goddamned clueless and disappointed (boo fucking hoo for them, they already have an AF fighter pilot son, that's not enough) I didn't make the family look good asking me what my life goals are for the next year and what my five year plan looks like.  

So again, I get you and I too wish I could be able to instantly transmit data into the heads of everyone I come across who I truly need to understand what it is like for me and really for everyone who is disabled or chronically ill or in pain, including medical professionals.

Otherwise I wish there was something positive I could say to you here.  I try not to be too negative or angry about things I can't control and I especially want to be simply a positive entity here on reddit, but I suppose we and many others both have very legitimate reasons to be angry and frustrated.  Our very sense of self is basically denied by so many people in our lives, including the people who should love and support us the most.

So I guess ultimately all I can say (after blathering so much, haha) is that you're not alone.  And I should also thank you for giving me the opportunity to get a lot off my chest that I rarely ever talk about.  I also sincerely hope along the way you find people who will either understand what you go through with your disabilities or at least make a point of caring about you and trying to understand as well as accept you at face value.",,,,MissLimerence,,,1556784071,t5_2qhe8,t3_bjrsha,t3_bjrsha,9,1559464101,0,0,emarzo7,disability,,,,"I'm extremely sorry that you've had to deal with so many physical and mental health disabilities and have had family and friends treat you the way they have.

747,"wow, i am sorry to hear about your situation and I hope it all gets better. 

I knew two people very jealous of my many disabilities that have been trying their hardest to claim they are disabled but no doctors will sign off for them that they are. 

One is my uncle that has mild diabetes but never takes his medicine and complains for attention alot. 

Another is my step mom who thinks she doesnt have to go to work because of migraines LOL, her doctor wont even diagnose her with migraines and keeps telling her to suck up her headaches and grow up LOL!

My dad is starting to become a cry baby for attention now after my step mom became this way. He lays in bed all day (hasnt been to work in 7 months), doesnt even get the mail, answer the doorbell, does his dishes, or cook. He literally thinks his exhaustion from getting out of bed is a real disability and people like me dont deserve it, WTF? 

my main disabilities are cancer (25+ tumors removed from sinus's/brain in facial area), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, a bunch of organs that I had removed (one lung, 2 parts of intestines), osteoarthritis, rhuematoid arthritis, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and PTSD. I have several other disabilities that are minor or havent been a problem lately (asthma, non-cancerous tumors, ect.). 

For someone to judge me and my disabilities... then use migraines or exhaustion as an excuse for a ""real disability"" is just sickening!

Id rather be healthy, work hard, and do overtime for the things I want/need then be in the situation Im in.

750,"This is a difficult aspect because at the core you want to be part of the lives of family and have friends. I get that the ideal situation would be accepted for who you are but it seems your relationships have turned the corner from appropriate empathy for you to intolerance. I am being blunt here because I know that isolation will only compound your physical and mental decline. Think of ways you can be accommodating on your own terms to helping family and friends. Perhaps make it known that you are going to try to spend an hour every Monday after lunch doing errands and if they have anything they need done that you could help them with to just let you know. You might offer things like letting their dog out for a potty break, picking up their prescriptions, taking their ups package to get mailed, turning off their sprinkler if they want to start it when they are home for lunch, getting copies made for them. It will let you keep control of your time and hopefully stop the impression that your time is theirs and that you are always available. On a different note, I myself do not have a disability and yet I deal with the exact same prejudices because I do not have a M-F set hours job. I try to establish with the ‘jealous’ people in my life : hey I am not opposed to having an equal give and take relationship but I am not your on call errand boy. I also use the tactic of turning their words back on them when they say things like you are so lucky you don’t have to go to work or I wish I had your schedule.  I reply with you are so lucky you have the ability to keep a good job, you are so lucky you have kids, you are so lucky you can mow your own yard.

Yes, technically I could get disability benefits if I had 2 years,  a lawyer and wanted to have to constantly ""prove that I'm really disabled"" to people who don't actually know shit about being disabled.  Especially with the trump administration constantly trying to find any excuse to cut benefits from disabled people.  Plus you deal with the stigma of the general public and financial struggles. 

 That said, even if these things weren't issues,  I would still  HAVE to work because if I didn't I'd basically mentally rot away.  For me, the mental rot I suffered during my time as a NEET was far worse than the physical torture I go through to work.   

If you ask a lot of people that are visibly disabled, they too will talk about this mental rot thing. I was actually talking to a friend of mine who is also in a wheelchair about it the other day. He said the reason that he works is that  He sees  What being on social security does to the minds of his friends that are on it.  Based on my experience with being out of work before, living that way would make my mental issues a lot worse and I would probably end up killing myself.  

I'm not saying everyone that lives on social security ends/will end up like that, some people are better off on social security. What I am saying is that many people who end up on social security do not want to be there and not every more visibly disabled person has the choice to  go on disability,  not even the ones in the categories you mentioned.

most people in public... at least where I live are very judgemental to the fact that one can be disabled at all without being blind or in a wheelchair, which seems completely wrong! 

I was first disabled at the age of 18 due to tumors/cancer, I had over 25+ removed since. Next my face started having bells palsy untill going permanently paralyzed on one half, my legs started going paralyzed often. After that, i had one lung removed, part of my intestines removed, then my kidney started failing. Next came multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and many mental disorders.

Epilepsy is the most frustrating one to me... to family... they assume Im faking a tonic clonic seizure. to the public... they assume Im dying during a seizure. to the police/hospital... they assume its drugs. and during a seizure... im unconcious and unable to tell them what steps I need for survival.

773,"My disabilities are different, but I feel you. It took me so long to figure out that I had limitations and trying to ignore them was literally killing me.

It took me 11 years to get a BS degree (heh) and shortly after I did, I filed for and got SSDI. So I have six figures of student loans that I can't get discharged because I'm disabled but not THAT disabled (student loan discharge requires complete and total disability, unlike social security). And my degree contributes nothing to my past, current, or future income. Although education enriched my life in an intangible way, it was a very poor investment otherwise.

I work very part-time, which is actually helpful for my conditions (mental illness - a schedule and routine is really good for me) and so often people say thoughtless crap like, ""oh, it must be nice to work part-time"" or ""what do you do with all your extra free time?""

Like, no, it's not nice, I'd much rather be able to pursue my dreams and ambitions, and have a career, instead of being handicapped by my own brain. And in my free time I do my best to deal with crippling depression and anxiety. On a good day I can shower and do the dishes. So yeah, coping with disability isn't my ideal hobby.

They're usually just acquaintances trying to make small talk, but it still hurts.

777,"I'm not sure if this is helpful because I was on the opposite side of this situation, I went out with a guy who had a support worker while on a date.

I didn't know when I asked him out that he usually has his DSW with him, but he mentioned it in a text when we were discussing where to go for the date, he was very breif, just saying ""I hope you don't mind, my support worker is helping me get there, but they won't be there during the date"" I didn't mind at all.

During the date (we just went to a cafe in the city for coffee) his support worker introduced himself and was polite but then excused himself and sat at a different table reading a book paying no attention to us. He was within ear shot if my date needed to ask for something but otherwise it was no different to a regular first date.

But he didn't have any mobility or physical limitations that would require his DSW to be nearby. So I can see how it might feel very different if you needed your assistant to be close and help with personal tasks during the date. Though if that had been the case on my date that still would not have been a problem. It's just a matter of finding a partner who is understanding of the realities of disability. Some people need assistants, that doesn't make them less deserving of going on dates.

Have a chat with your PCA/DSW about how they would like to be treated on the date, and ask your date-partner what they would be comfortable with; for example, would everyone prefer for your assistant and what they're doing to be seen but not fully acknowledged, or is everyone comfortable with talking about what your needs are and making a few light hearted comments, or would they maybe even like to get to know your assistant as if it's like a date with a partner and meeting one of their friends.

Hopefully someone can answer from the other side of this situation. For me there was an added element of nervousness going on that date because I didn't want to misunderstand the relationship my date had with his DSW. I felt awkward having his support worker sit apart from us because I wasn't sure if that's how they normally interact or if my presence was making them change how they provided support. I eventually said to my date ""I don't mind if [your support worker] sits with us, I'm getting to know you, and he's important in your life, so if you want I should get to know him too"" but my date explained that they'd talked beforehand, and this is what they felt comfortable with.

778,"Hey boss, I've gone through the same thing and had the exact same concerns.  I too have muscular dystrophy but I've luckily been in a wonderful relationship for almost a decade, but before that I too had to maneuver around the assistant situation for several dates.  If you want to PM me and skype/vchat I'd gladly give you some pointers or suggestions for your date.  My hands suck for typing, but I'll try to help her as quick as I can because this thread is 14 hours old and you might already be on the date!  

Honestly what I'd suggest is that you plan ahead with your assistant and the coffee shop as much as possible so everything is automatic.  Pre-pay for everything, tip ahead of time, explain to the waiter before your guest arrives what would help you, maybe already have a drink going, etc.  That way it's just the two of you talking comfortably without interruptions for a bit.  I mean it's just coffee, right?  That way your assistant can sit in the corner and check his/her twitter, while casualty glancing over to you two hopefully hitting it off.  But, if you need them, have a signal, something timed, already planned out.  In the end this date is for you and her, and the truth is that you come with an assistant but you just want her to see you, and that's totally normal.  It's truly up to you how or when you convey that sensitive information, but I'd say wait until you want to or have to talk about it.  Whatever makes you most comfortable.

861,"Ugh, yes, I always despise this question. Obviously people are just making conversation and have no ill intent, but it's still a problem.

The question and its primary focus in casual conversation implies that worth is tied to occupation. This is definitely a thing, in America at least. Social status is entirely dependent on your occupation and income, i.e. how ""successful"" you are, and your social ties which usually have a lot to do with the first two things. As a disabled person, I don't have any status from profession, income, or social network, and therefore I'm not worth knowing to most people. They'd never say so out loud, but it's clear nonetheless.

I don't have any clever ideas about dealing with this question. The choices are either lie or be honest, or something in between, which is usually where I go. Being completely honest is super problematic - people either ask weird and intrusive questions, or the conversation dies from awkwardness. It's pretty much a social lose-lose for us disabled folk.

I'm fortunate enough to have a part-time job, so I usually just go with that as the easiest way out. I just say I work at so-and-so place doing blank. They don't need to know that it's only a few hours per week. Then I ask them a question to redirect the conversation.

That's usually the best thing: ask people questions. People like to talk about themselves, and will almost always cheerfully take the bit and run with it. If you're asking questions, you're not having to answer so many that lead into tricky topics. Also, compliments work too. Compliment someone on literally anything, then ask a related question.

If you're an avid book reader just respond ""I write book reviews under a psuedoname"". If pushed ""what is your pen name"" you can give a sarcastic ""then it wouldn't be a pseudo name, would it"" to ""after my last review I went into Secret Witness Program"".

If you're an avid book reader just respond ""I write book reviews under a psuedoname"". If pushed ""what is your pen name"" you can give a sarcastic ""then it wouldn't be a pseudo name, would it"" to ""after my last review I went into Secret Witness Program"".

1000,"Don't ever settle.  It sounds like you have a lot to offer and I'm sure you'll eventually meet someone great, but if you don't, don't settle.  I've never understood that attitude from disabled and non-disabled people.  Is a relationship really worth it if you're just settling?  Are you really that uncomfortable being alone?  I'm used to being alone, and in a relationship I require some alone time.  There's a thousand things I can do to entertain myself.  And I've got great friendships that don't require a romantic relationship.  I firmly believe that if you're not happy with yourself, you're never going to be truly happy being with someone else either.  I'm not saying you have to be perfectly happy with who you are, I'm not, but you have to be comfortable with being on your own before you can have a healthy relationship with someone else. 

That said, I can't relate from the female side.  I'm a male who was paralyzed from the chest down when I was 13.  I'm 34 now.  I know a few women in wheelchairs, we're not close, but acquaintances, and a number of them have found great relationships.  Mostly the ones who are comfortable with themselves.  From the male side, dating sites are hard whether you're disabled or not.  Every woman on a dating website gets flooded with messages from men.  It's obviously worse the more attractive you are.  You have to really stand out to get a girl's attention.  It's obviously not easy for women on dating sites either.  Men can be fickle and there's lots of creeps out there in the dating world.  

As far as my experience on dating apps/websites?  I'm no super model.  I'm not hideous either, but I think I would probably attract way more women if I lost at least 30 pounds.  That being said, I haven't dated a ton, but I've had my fair share of women.  It's more about personality than anything.  I find myself to be a bit on the socially awkward side, but have improved over the years.  Enough of my personality must shine through though as I've attracted a number of great women over the years who are never bothered by my disability.  I'm not trying to brag, but I'm also apparently a pretty decent lover.  My body is a train wreck and I'm less than generously endowed, but apparently I make up for it in other ways.  I had one long term relationship in my early 20s that ended for reasons beyond our control.  After that my life was pretty rocky for a few years.  When I got myself back together I had a few flings that lasted a number of months.   I eventually decided to try the dating apps.  Had a few good dates but nothing I felt comfortable with.  And then about 4.5 years ago I met a great and beautiful girl on OK Cupid.  We hit it off right away.  I've never been happier with anyone in my life.  After about 2 years of dating we decided we wanted to start a family.  We now have a 17-month-old daughter and we plan on getting married later this year.

This made me ignore some red flags and he turned out to be an abusive piece of shit towards the end of our relationship. My insecurity made his extreme jealousy feel like a blessing, but it was just a sign that the dude was psycho. So I guess you didn't miss anything.

I've had another two one-year long relationships that just didn't feel like something I could do for the rest of my life. I didn't see myself with any of them on the long term, but sadly my insecurities hit again and I just kinda... settled for whatever life threw at me.

Now for the first time I'm with someone I love madly and I know he has real feelings for me too and I'm just dreaming of our life and growing old together and for the first time it feels like what a healthy relationship should be life.

1008,"After my first really serious relationship I didn't think I'd ever have love again. I found someone and settled for a long time. I was lonely and desperately wanted to be loved, so I accepted being verbally abused daily, cheated on, constantly soothing her mood swings and outbursts.

 I figured that was the tax I had to pay for having health problems, not having much money, or a life outside of her. 

I didn't have friends, and had really low self esteem while I was begging for state assistance and my disability money. Weirdly, she was very jealous and paranoid about me fucking around or whatever. She got into every account I ever had with a password, and we just didn't have any boundaries between us by the end. 

Even though my world was very small and isolated, she was jealous. She didn't want anything to do with me once I got my disability, like she only wanted me when I could be tracked and managed, like I had been a kid with no pocket change to get in trouble with.

Don't just settle for whoever will spend time with you. I felt dread and resignation, wondering how I would have to try to patch up things enough for a whole day not to be ruined over her reaction to a text not being answered fast enough or something. Her issues with me and our relationship became so contemptuous that there was no working on it. She wanted to do stuff thst I can't physically do, and she resented me for it. She resented me for her power dynamic financially, for things she did for me that I wanted or didn't even care about like buying really expensive food I could do without. But when I got some financial independence, and was so happy to tell her how I wanted to do all this stuff with her, she actually resented me even more.

I still haven't figured it all out. I wanted to blow my brains out in December after the breakup, and a fall where I broke my shoulder, hand and neck. I got through that, and put myself out there again. My new girlfriend has emotional issues too, but she goes to therapy and all that jazz. And she's got a kid that comes every other weekend, and she's great. I was terrified of having kids when I was first disabled. Lately though having a little 7 year old bug around to take to WWE shows is really nice.

Anything is possible. Even non disabled people have heartaches and loneliness",,,,Jibblethead,,,1557329788,t5_2qhe8,t3_blx75f,t3_blx75f,2,1561745651,0,0,emu6hu9,disability,,,,,

It’s a little heartbreaking sometimes and yes, I feel like a burden to him because I can’t keep up, but the difference is that he keeps trying to understand and tries to adapt with me.  He wants to help and thankfully doesn’t totally ignore my difficulties (because, that’d almost be just as bad as constantly pointing it out).  It’s hard as hell finding someone that hits that balance AND is also just normally a good partner anyway.

1013,"I've never used dating apps but I feel like they're most of the time a recipe for disaster.

Ways I've met guys I've been involved with on a long term were online while I wasn't looking for relationships (started talking about whatever the common interest was and went from there), one at a concert, and one through a common friend.

I met my current and most meaningful partner in an online game, as trivial as it sounds. My point is, I never really *looked*  for a relationship, they just kinda happened naturally.

26 is not old. I don't want to be rude, but most young people (me included back when I was a teen/early 20s) tend to be shallow and only care about looks. It's with age when you realize that a relationship takes more than a hot person you get bored living with. A relationship is not just sex, it's sharing common interests, supporting each other, being able to have endless conversations and making each other laugh. Prioritizing personality over looks doesn't mean settling, it just means that you start overlooking some aspects. It also doesn't mean that you are not attracted to that person at all, there must be a certain level of attraction but that can also come with falling in love with the other person as they are.

1077,"I think more support workers need to know the difference between independence and assistance and that it's not mutually exclusive. Your job as a support worker is to assist with independence, it doesn't mean taking over but it also doesn't mean leaving your client to fight off a pack of wolves. And just because it would be quicker for a support worker to do something, doesn't mean that's helping the disabled person. One thing I am personally very sensitive to, is putting people out, but I have a right to take my own change in shops and to actually go around the shops myself. I've banned agency workers for suggesting it would be ""easier"" if I sat in the waiting area at the end whilst they do my shopping for me, and taking my change at the till instead of telling the staff to give me my own change after paying.

You can ask if you're not sure about something, but do it in a better tone than negative. Instead of saying ""Are you sure you want to do it that way?"", or ""Why can't you do it this way?"" ask ""Can I ask, why are you doing it that way?"" or words to that effect. You want the explanation to be on why they are doing it their way, instead of the emphasis of explaining why the way you want them to do it isn't feasable for them.

Also, if they're in an electric wheelchair, chances are they know how to drive it. Don't dictate where they should or shouldn't go or if they're not comfortable trying a certain space, your job is to accept that, not to force them and standing there saying ""I told you so"". I had someone do that to me in a shop with a narrow aisle. The end result wasn't that I got through the narrow aisle and everything was fine, the end result was that I hurt my neck checking the items my wheels were catching as I drove by weren't being dragged along.

1079,"&gt;  Ask before touching us.

Another poster already mentioned it but I want to emphasize that this includes staying out of our space and not touching ANY part of our medical equipment or supplies without explicit permission for that instance. Just because I'm sitting in a wheelchair, doesn't mean that I don't have the same ""bubble"" as everyone else. In fact, I need MORE room to be able to see my surroundings and safely maneuver my chair, which will sometimes kick to the side due to the movement of the caster wheels if I have to do something like switch from going forward to reverse. My service dog is included in this and is polite about being squashed but would like his own personal space, too.

This is something I had to teach my own parents, even, so I'm sure it's not instinctual to an able bodied person, but I need the wheelchair, the ventilator, the IV fluid lines, the dog, etc., to live as comfortably and independently as possible. They replace the function of some of my body parts, and my brain has learned to have awareness of where they are in space, so in a sense, they ARE part of my body. If you start messing with, say, my IV fluid lines, and accidentally pull too hard on the wrong end or make them sag so that they get caught in the wheelchair, you could dislodge the catheter that goes to my heart so that I can eat and drink, since my gut no longer functions. It's literally my lifeline, and there are a limited number of times that it can be replaced before they run out of veins that are big enough to use, at which point I will die from being unable to sustain my fluid and mineral balance (which will kill me faster than starvation). Similarly, I'm not FULLY dependent on the ventilator and oxygen yet, but I'm getting there. I've had years to figure out the best arrangement for all of my stuff on this wheelchair, so while I'm open to suggestions, don't assume that what you're about to do will work - there's a decent chance I've already tried it and it will result in tubing of some sort getting wrapped around the wheels. At home and in the car, I look like I'm not the most organized person, because there's mess, but I KNOW where things are, and things are located where they FOR A REASON. If you start rearranging and ""tidying up"" my stuff, not only might I have trouble finding something in a hurry, but I might not be close enough to something that I need in an emergency.

As far as pushing the wheelchair, hahahhahahahaha, the wheelchair alone weighs over 300 lbs. The only time that actually has an effect is if it gets a bit stuck, sometimes I can use the dog to stand to the side while someone else pushes with one hand while driving with the joystick at the same time. If you're not telling the motor/brain part of the chair to go, it's not going anywhere without several burly firefighters LIFTING it, which might or might not have happened when I might or might not have gotten too adventurous and gotten it stuck in the woodchips at a children's playground. Again, though, it's my personal space, and it is RUDE to lean on it, just as it is rude to lean on a stranger's shoulder without asking first. I can feel your breath on my head and neck, and can only imagine what germs you might be exposing me to, since my immune system is only mediocre. If I need to adjust the tilt or recline on my chair, or simply move a little to get a better view, it puts me in the awkward spot of disturbing you, which might mean that you spill your coffee down the back of my shirt, vs having to talk to you about every little change of body position.

Back to the dog, he's actually worth a greater monetary value than any of my other medical equipment, and also greater emotional value as a family member. It's also much easier to depreciate him by degrading up his training or scaring him, let alone hurting him physically. The former is a more incremental thing that is easier to fix, but if you scare a dog badly enough, they can create bad associations from a single event that make them permanently unable to work in public around objects or situations that remind them of the trauma, which means that they get retired early and the handler has to go without a service dog and have less independence while they wait 1-5 years for another dog to be trained. Imagine waiting multiple YEARS of your life to get your independence back after one asshat messed with your dog. A few of the large programs which train for common disabilities, such as guide dogs, will place dogs for free or virtually no cost, but for most people, you're also looking at thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. The full, unsubsidized cost of a professional trainer doing the job is in the low to mid 5 figures. Many people try to train their own and they may be successful but it takes TIME, energy, and some degree of skill. Even starting with decent basic training skills, the cost for me to spend hundreds of hours of my own time raising and training my dog, when you count up all of the expenses during the dog's training period, was close to $10K. Some people spend more because they need more help from a trainer or the first dog doesn't work out and they have to start over with a second one while also caring for the first one and dealing with any issues. There have been reported cases of people distracting service dogs to the point that the dog missed an alert for a seizure, diabetic low, or other event, which can have grave consequences for the handler. For example, with the seizure dog, if the handler is used to having 20 minutes to prepare after the dog alerts, but people are making kissy noises at the dog, petting it, etc., at the 20 minute mark, and the dog doesn't alert until the 10 minute mark, then the handler may still be standing/walking 10 minutes later, trying to get to a better safe spot, and may ultimately get a concussion or brain bleed from falling while walking. The consequences aren't as grave for me but you don't know from looking at someone. 

I am usually OK with letting people pet the dog because he's gregarious and it makes for good PR for service dogs, but only if they ask and only if I'm in the mood. There are times when it's just kind of creepy or obnoxious to ask to pet someone's dog, such as coming up to someone in the parking garage while they're trying to get things loaded up. My dog does not exist for you or the general public. He was bred, born, raised, and trained to mitigate my disability, and when he is with me, he is always being trained, because every interaction teaches the dog something, whether it's good or bad. Similarly, every interaction with another person or dog teaches him something, good or bad. I work hard to maintain his training and it's not always obvious from the outside what's going on. Even if I gave you permission to pet him last time, we could be working on something different this week, or he might be ""peopled out"" and in need of some quiet time without being disturbed.",,,,punstersquared,"mitochondriac - tubie, TPN, chronic pain, wheels, medical cPTSD ",,1557446748,t5_2qhe8,t3_bmgfcl,t1_emwxlvi,3,1561826592,0,0,emyyn1a,disability,,,,,
1080,"Abuse and neglect backgrounds--medical, physical, emotional, financial, sexual--are very common in disabled people, higher than for ablebodied people by a lot. For men as well. It is not uncommon to be abused just for being disabled, which on top of the societal attitude about disabled people being burdens and any accommodations or support we get being a gift for which we should be thankful, can make people feel very bad about themselves and guilty whenever they need help.

it reminds me of the circus debates. when disabled people were told to not showcase themselves because it was ""debasing""... but if you talk to most circus performers, they would tell you they loved the work and it was empowering for them to show off their bodies proudly.  
  
the disconnect comes when you stop seeing the performers as people who can make their own minds and decisions. even if your intentions are good, to protect, by overlooking them as individuals you are doing the same damage, if not more, than the people who might ""gawk and laugh"". you're basically telling them that nothing good could come of what they are doing and it's better they stay hidden. i know that sounds exaggerated, but that is the bottom line of these assumptions.

I have cerebral palsy, chronic pain and a few other issues. I am more mobile than your significant other and less mobile than you from your description.

People rarely automatically see my cerebral palsy for the disability that it is. When I was a teen young adult and could walk without help sometimes people wouldn't see any disability or guessed my CP affected speech was deafness or intellectual disability. 

Now people see me with my cane and speech issues and more prominent eye issues and think ID with some physical problems. 

They can talk to me inappropriately and assume I am incapable of taking care of myself or that I know what's best for me.  

I have to shut that down and stop it from happening if the context of the situation is important. If it's just some meddling person I ignore it.

This is something I would ignore if I was having great day or thought responding would slow down/screw up my day. I might respond if I felt snappy and didn't care about being kicked out.

1245,"I use a manual wheelchair and travel with my husband who is able bodied. We had an issue where he did not want to schlep the luggage and would prefer to push me because its like holding hands, but the airport helpers always want the reverse. They don't really listen to him, so its my job to advocate for what works for us. ""Can you help me carry this bag?"", ""I feel more comfortable with my husband pushing me."", ""Please let my husband push me."" etc.

Now, if its a big airport and its a connection we usually let them push me because we need to hurry and don't know the way. If it's not possible for you to hurry, maybe you should request a wheelchair as well. Airports are exhausting even for people without disabilities.

People are always hoping I can walk just a few steps or trying to grab me during transfers. It's important that the person with the disability be clear with them, if they are able to communicate, which it sounds like your bf can. ""I can't stand or walk at all"", ""No, I cannot remove my shoes."" I find the best strategy to avoid unwanted help is to give them other tasks. ""I'm fine in the bathroom on my own, but can you watch this bag?"", ""I can transfer on my own. It may not look pretty, but I'll get there. Can you hold this wheelchair steady?"" ""I don't need help getting into the car, but can you open the trunk and clear a space for my crutches?""

Sometimes I have to raise my voice. ""Please stop."", ""Don't grab me."" but if that's what it takes to be heard and treated the way that works for me, then so be it.

As for the strangers offering advice/commentary, like about the purse or walking with crutches. Ignore them, or just say ""Why would you say that?"" or ""Wow, that was a rude thing to say."" and move on.  You don't have to laugh along with or agree with stupid comments.

1248,"Sorry you had such a crappy experience last time. Here’s my suggestions but I want to say on your behalf it’s ridiculous that you are forced to alter who you are. 1. Don’t carry a purse, use a backpack or something that looks unisex and hang it across the two handlebars on the back of the chair, I have carabiners too in case that’s the easiest quickest way to attach bags, 2. Use a child wrist strap between you and the wheelchair if you have to turn your back, keeping the strap on prevents someone else pushing the chair at a rate you can’t keep up with too. 3. Consider how you are dressed, I have no idea if you were dressed in beach attire or business last time and not saying which look you should go for but just keep in mind it affects first impressions. If you and DH have matching baseball caps or both look business formal or have on the same hoodie it visually suggest you are a couple, eliminating most of the caregiver questioning.  You could wear huge screen printed Matching t shirts that state WE GOT THIS. Back the Fuck Off. 4. Do take time to get everything you are traveling with cleaned up and shiny. The general public doesn’t understand that crutch’s an wheelchairs get dirty like the bottom of shoes. Personally my child’s disability is messy and we are used to living with it, the public not so much.

1249,"All of the things that happened during your trip were not, imo, done out of concern or by people who were just trying to do the right thing. They were all insanely disrespectful to you and to your husband.

I know it is hard to balance the acceptance you have to show on people's ignorance because they were just trying to do the right thing and the healthy boundaries you must have for the sake of self respect, but those interactions are far past this line. Those people were mistreating you and your husband, I can't see it in any other way.

I can only imagine how hard it is for your husband and how much of this shit he's already taken that he just got used to it. I'm frankly not worried about confronting other people so my mindset is probably very different from yours, but my advice is to speak up for yourself.

Plant your feet on the ground. Raise your voice, if need be. Explain loud and clear what the other person is doing wrong and why it's wrong.

It would be a different story if people were committing mistakes while being kind and receptive and really willing to help, but those things that happened were ridiculous. People were already making a scene, so go into it and make yourself clear. They'll probably not change their minds ( some people are just rude and stupid), but they'll change their behaviour towards you or at least leave you alone.

It would be better if your husband spoke out for himself and for both of you sometimes, but if he can't do that, you can. I think the printed cards may help to a point, but you need to be prepared to deal with stupid people that won't respect those either.",,,,cookieinaloop,,,1557927987,t5_2qhe8,t3_bouzf4,t3_bouzf4,10,1562349107,0,0,enm6yfu,disability,,,,,

1259,"Do the cards, because that's a lot less confrontational than I've been in occasions. I've had people try and pull me out of my wheelchair 'because I'm obviously faking, and there's nothing wrong with me'. I have chronic pain, polymyalgia, hEDS, osteoarthritis and thanks to a brain injury nearly 5 years ago, anterograde amnesia, traumatic epileptic seizures and migraines. Like you, physically I look fine. Absolutely tip-top. On good days I can walk a little bit while wearing knee supports, usual days I'm either in my mobility scooter or have someone pushing me in my wheelchair, and on bad days I can't even get out if bed. So on my usual days (wheelchair or mobility scooter days), I might be in more pain than usual, but I've still got a strong right hook, and have punched people that have tried to pull me out my chair.

So yeah, cards are a lot less confrontational. Being disabled, you have to advocate for yourself, with EVERYONE, and it's gets boring, tiring, and humiliating, but it has to be done, you can't let people take the piss. If someone is trying to lift your husband up, don't say anything, he needs to be the one to tell them to fuck off. If someone doesn't believe you're his girlfriend and helper, he needs to tell them to piss off and mind their own business. Politeness obviously hasn't worked for you, so time to change tactics.

I realise this post sounds really aggressive, but I'm so pissed off today, I'm stuck in bed having a massive pain flare because someone tried to pull me out my chair tomorrow, and while I smacked them, the force they were using to try and yank me out, to 'prove I was faking' has really hurt me, so I currently have no sympathy for people who don't listen to what we say, or assume we're lying because we don't look obviously disabled, so fuck the lot of them.

My testicles are part of my disability. 

It took me 8 years, and my testicles are disabled. 8 years of going to appointments with people who have authority over my my ability to live as a member of society instead of living on the fringe in purgatory

I am still waiting for my own documented housing (8 years) because I am still technically homeless. 

I get 14 dollars in food stamps. 7 hundred something dollars to live on now, at least before I had my job. Cool, how far does that go in Connecticut? 

Now, I finally got a job, with a disability program to employ us through federal aid, the only institution that has a process to hire someone as unemployable as a 31 year old dude with tired eyes and nerve damage in his nuts, and no family or roots in the community. 

I fought for this job, and now I see why, because I do not belong here. I literally am a crazy bum with clearly physical disabilities waltzing in doing work, in a program designed for nice white married ladies with depression who want to copy edit or write some stuff in a feminine environment. Every one of my disabled coworkers is not a peer, they are older and have homes and they and their families have lived in the area for generations. And I don't belong there, I just need this job because I need money, because I am homeless and I am desperate to have a bed to sleep and its all mine. And I make these ladies feel uncomfortable and sad, and have this passive unspoken resentment that I'm even there changing their mood in the room even though I'm polite and smile and am doing the nice diplomatic office worker bee routine, we all know I don't belong.

I either have to eat my lunch alone, or eat with my coworkers, these ladies from around the Greenwich CT area, and mingle with these ladies - - in my government program that uses tax money for disabled people who need a job on top of their disability benefits while not losing SSDI; this program I waited and fought to be apart of-- knowing I'm the reason everyone stops talking about their gardener fucking up or their husband only booking a domestic holiday and getting awkwardly quiet while I sit down. 

At times, spite is the only thing that keeps me going. Knowing that the state of Connecticut definitely wants me to kill myself. That they have pretty much challenged me to do so. 

The fact that I often DO want to just give up and kill myself is sometimes the only thing that keeps me from doing it. Like fuck you everybody, I'm sticking around. I fantasize that if I do it, I would find a Governor's mansion or something and slit my wrists on the stoop and write ""MY BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS"" on one of the pillars. Then I think that's a bit melodramatic and I should just die in a hole alone in the forest where no will ever find me. But no! That's what they want me to do! So I fall asleep thinking about revolving this thought process most nights, and wake up and just do the insane unstable unrealistic thing and just keep going.

Here is a link to information and instructions from SSA about filing an appeal and waiver request. [https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-632.html](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-632.html).

Under law SSA applies annual averaging to net income from self employment for SSI purposes, including deeming spouse’s income. See 20 CFR §416.1111(b) [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/416/416-1111.htm](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/416/416-1111.htm).  When you initially reported the income, the representative should have, ideally, explained the annual averaging of net earnings from self employment rules to you.  Also, when you initially reported the income SSA should have applied an estimate of net earnings in determining the amount of ongoing payments. See [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500820230](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500820230).

In filing an appeal and request for waiver, you can detail efforts to report the income and to reschedule your appointment.  It may be helpful to have specific dates and any documentation or verification of contacts with SSA. If you have receipts for documents submitted that is usually very helpful, and anytime we submit documents to SSA in person I recommend requesting a receipt.

It sounds like you may have set aside some SSI payments after you started receiving additional income. By SSA’s rules, they will want you to send that money back to them. Often when you do have money set aside to return that is helpful in getting any remaining overpayment waived or in negotiating a lower rate of recovery.  If SSA alleges that your overpayment exceeds the funds you set aside to return to them, you can specifically request a waiver for the remaining alleged overpayment. If SSA declines to waive the remaining overpayment, you can request a reduced rate of recovery, and you might be able to negotiate a low or very low monthly repayment amount.

There are also disability rights advocate programs in each state, and here is a tool to find your state’s disability rights advocate program.

1337,"I had many, many advantages and even so it took me 11 years to complete a 4-year degree and I barely managed. I was able-bodied as a student, but I have several psychological disabilities (Asperger's, C-PTSD, chronic recurrent major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety are the main diagnoses).

I was always good at school. I got excellent grades without trying and teachers loved me. On the other hand I was a complete social failure. I loved the ""school"" part of school - if I could have avoided lunch and recess, it would have been heaven on earth for me.

When I went to college, the only institutional barrier I ever experienced was being required to live on campus with a roommate the first year. I knew it wouldn't work but at that age didn't know why, couldn't explain it to the dean of housing, and didn't yet have much in the way of diagnoses and medical history to back me up. After six weeks of living in a tiny room with a stranger, I was very close to a complete mental breakdown, and somehow I managed to convince them to let me move into a single room. Living in the dorm was still challenging but I could manage that way.

Aside from that, I was extremely fortunate - at the two schools I ultimately attended, I had amazing, supportive advisers who were understanding, compassionate, and helpful far beyond the call of duty. The disabilities support staff and my professors were always lovely and helpful. I never had an accommodation request refused, although I didn't really have many requests. The biggest problem for me was depression that just wouldn't quit, and the cognitive effects associated with depression and anxiety, and there wasn't much they could do to help there.

My point is, even though I was lucky enough to have a natural aptitude for school AND amazing help from the colleges I attended, I barely graduated. Disability can be such a huge barrier in and of itself. If a student doesn't have support from every corner, education can be damn near impossible.

And now in my 30s, I have a very expensive but useless piece of paper. Even though I value my education for the way it developed me as a person, I'm on Social Security Disability because I simply cannot maintain a full-time job. I work a limited part-time schedule because the routine and getting out of my house each day are very beneficial. I have six figures of educational debt that I have zero prospect of paying off, and a degree that contributes nothing to my earnings potential. (Before anyone suggests it, I can't get my student loans discharged because I'm not disabled enough. There's a very strict standard for that in the US. And even if I could get them forgiven, it would be considered income and I'd have to pay taxes on it which I can't even begin to afford to do.

I'm not really sure if my adhd/ocd falls under this category, but at work, I needed one day at my job(amazon delivery driver) to basically sort out their absolutely broken system as it comes onto my truck, in regards to apartment deliveries(which can be substantial depending on the route).

I needed 1 day.  I told my manager I was going to be behind.  I didn't bring in my issues, because they, in my opinion, just going to hold you back, and if your issues, like I said, are not easily considered, you better fuck right off.  

I needed 1, fucking day.  Amazon calls my manager, and tells me I am behind and that I need to fuck off ASAP.  I try and tell him I just need 1 day on being behind.  1.  He tells me to fuck off, and quick.  He literally tells me I can't do it my way.  and that I have to do it their way, even though it is clearly fucked at present.

Now, sure, I could say, hey I need this accommodation.  I will literally resolve the issue myself, just give me a day.  No, they say.  presumably because fuck me I'm a slave and fuck you.  I actually know why but why bother explaining, this is a extremely reasonable request, and i'm not even going to explain further.

I could take them to court(I'm sure that would work.)I might win, I might not, but if your thinking of taking your rich corp to court, might be time to fuck off.  Esp if your poor.  I live in a right to work state, and amazon would prob hire Columbine guerrillas to kill me and my family, or turn me into a battery or something for the rich.

I ended up having a panic attack later that day, over the state of it all, my first!  Firstys!, and almost got arrested by the police who showed up, before I got seen by the EMT.  I had to do a drunk driving assessment test, essentially, to prove I wasn't on drugs.  It was like I was an elephant at the circus.  I guess with how many people they murder every year, I should consider myself lucky.  Me and the young officer got into a bit of a spat over the issue, and honestly all the issues stated above, I know it's not really his fault, but the individual has to answer for the shortcomings of the collective from time to time, unfortunately.

1360,"For me, I was basically undiagnosed at the time, my GP had written letters to my highschool who were happy to accommodate me, but in a big state uni they turned around and said ""this is a list of symptoms, what's actually wrong? What is your disability, what is your doctor even doing to help?"" I didn't have answers, I was still trying to figure things out myself.

But the biggest issue was transport. My uni didn't have housing. I couldn't work *and* study so a private/share house rental wasn't an option. I had to stay with my foster family in the suburbs. Which meant catching the train into uni every day, and home again every night.

That would have been fine except the workshop started at 7am, we had a long break from 4:30-7pm, then ran from 7-11pm.

The first accessible train got me into campus at 7:15 last train home for me was 10:55, I was constantly being written up for my attendance and lack of worth ethic. The solution the uni offered me? ""find a bed in a backpackers hostel on weeknights. Don't go home during the week""

I was told I was not allowed to nap on campus during my long break.

My main workshop teacher was the main reason I managed to stay 2.5 years. He let me nap in his truck which was parked opposite the road so it technically wasn't on campus, and he'd drive me home some nights when I was missed my train. He'd push the numbers on my attendance as much as he could because he could see that I was doing the work, I wasn't lazy, I just wasn't there.

But when it came time for the uni to insure the students to begin an industry work placement, they told me that until I had a diagnosis I couldn't be insured, because anything could happen.

I deferred for 6 months.... Knowing full well I couldn't return because my course was being grandfathered out, my year was going to be the last ever year.


It worked out in the end though. My diagnosis turned out to be incompatible with that course and job prospects.

This only works if you have a professor that is cool with either you using a personal recorder and leaving it at the front or you sit close enough so a laptop mic can kinda pick up what they're saying (in case you didn't know, laptop mics are garbage) and you happen to have a subscription to a program like naturally dragon speaking plus lots of free time LMAO like you have free time when you're under constant pressure between studying and trying to work to get money to pay for things even though you're too disabled to be working. Again obstacles and hurdles. And what if you need accommodations for absences or being late? Trouble getting to your class? Security guards and the library harassing you about your service dog? How about extensions on the time to take exams? Modifications to no laptop rules? Modifications so typed work is accepted instead of requiring only hand written work? Being banned from using your service dog in the computer lab because animals aren't allowed period? Only 2 handicap parking spaces on the entire campus? Stairs everywhere with limited elevators and no escalators? Ebooks not being available? Being physically tired and exhausted from walking short distances? Migraines from studying? Anxiety attacks during exams? Being hospitalized during the school year for any number of reasons like just one example: you trying to kill yourself and now you're under lock down in the psych ward indefinitely with no way to communicate to your professors?

1373,"My experience is one that I will never forget and I am still fighting against. Trying to get an appointment with disability services is problematic and the office isn't even in a readily accessible location. While the disability officers will put a plan together for your reasonable adjustments, getting them to actually implement them is a fucking nightmare. If you need a notetaker or accessible course materials, be prepared to wait the whole semester for them to actually be provided to you. You end up falling so far behind the ablebodied students it is ridiculous. Academic staff openly discriminate against and bully students with disabilities and nothing is done about it. They refuse to implement your reasonable adjustments and you have to fight tooth and nail to get them to do it. Once they are finally forced to implement them, they punish you for having reasonable adjustments via your assessments. I have been told ""disabled students get too much special consideration"". 

Then you move into physical access, so many classes missed because the buildings and walkways aren't disability accessible (I have paraplegia among other health conditions) while they block off disability parking bays for their own uses so half the time you can't even get out of the fucking car. Any complaints fall on deaf ears, nothing is ever done and you are constantly told ""maybe university isn't for you"".

In my experience university's do not want disabled people there, the university I am referring to even go out of their way to acknowledge every aspect of diversity and inclusion except disability.

My point is that the decision is complex and differs with each individual situation. You are drawing a line in the sand somewhere. That is why you cannot legislate abortion. 

Society does nothing but look down on those of us who are in chronic pain and illness from birth to death. Many find that society tries to take away pain relief upon adulthood and label them as lazy drug addicts. I do think that one of the things that sorts the disability community on this topic is the subject of chronic pain. Being disabled without pain and illness is a very different experience. I've lived in fear of pregnancy - it would be life threatening to me and a fetus *and* the fetus would have a 50/50 of inheriting my condition. Under abortion if a mother's life is in danger - you can only do so when the mother's death is imminent - not when you know the pregnancy will endanger her life at a time when it is medically easier to do an abortion. They want us to wait until she is already weak to undergo what will be by then a medical procedure. This is how women died in Ireland. This is how an Indian national died in Ireland and one of the things that prompted the lifting of the abortion ban there.

What do you do for the family facing the birth a child that has such severe disabilities that they will not be able to make decisions for themselves later in life? Who will be completely dependent upon the adults in their family for life? We, in the US, simply do not provide enough support to families of children with disabilities in general - much less ones where the child will never grow to be an independent adult. Republicans continue to want to cut Medicaid- which provides support to some of these families. Frankly, we need disability supports to be separated from medical insurance (which is what Medicaid is). Families go bankrupt, people with severe disabilities end up abused and assaulted and unable to communicate that fact, parents end up unable to parent children they already have and other issues galore that we provide little to nothing more than pity and ""thoughts and prayers.""

1403,"I'm not seeing where admitting the issue is too complex for flat declarations (and thus laws) can be used to support anti abortion positions. Until our society does a better job supporting families caring for members with disabilities, it remains a complex philosophical issue. It remains a complex issue as long as there are disorders that can prevent fetuses from making it children survive to birth. (there are dangers leaving a dead body inside the pregnant woman to hold til a natural birth). As long as there are disorders that will cause children to be born who will live a few days/months/years in excruciating pain and/or severe illness (bankrupting their families), abortion and disabilities will be complex. Do we force a woman to bear a child that we know can have no conscious awareness? Know ability to actually experience life via even emotion? (look up anencephaly, they are born with just a brain stem and maybe a bit of primitive brain, they have forebrain - no cortex, no thalumus, etc. They are also missing half of their skull.). I was anti abortion once upon a time until I learned more about these sorts of things, realized the lack of safety net and support for families and real dangers wo women.

&gt;I also remember reading somewhere that physically disabled priests can’t give communion.

Well **I** believe you.

&gt; I and bothered when people who wanted a baby choose to abort when it was a baby they wanted. ...  It’s not the abortion itself that bothers me but the reason why. 

Why? I mean it's either a clump of cells, wanted or not, or it's a baby either way... isn't it?

&gt; Either it’s the woman’s body so it’s her choice. 

Is the mother disabled, or is it a disabled fetus? Could've sworn we were talking about the latter in which case.... that's the baby's body, isn't it?","[{'start': 1199, 'end': 1204, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Why aren't we flooded with videos of people who helped someone who dropped their shopping, tripped over in the street, let someone in a hurry jump the queue, lent their lighter etc. 

The difference is that without the help this person would be unable to eat, a basic human function. This shouldn't be an aww moment.

Granted, our government by law is required to provide all the things I mentioned to refugees, and this is done to avoid adding to the homeless population, but also as a reward for helping our government, which is why most refugees are refugees in the first place.

The refugees at my former job, which is in a totally different state, they understood this. We had a few refugees from <LOCATION> who were disrespectful to some customers with service dogs, and their social workers told them quite firmly that they had to accept these dogs or they could lose their jobs.

1471,"No worries, I appreciate your input. Choosing the right dog isn't an easy process, after all!
Dobermans were bred as protectors, it's in their genes to protect their owners. And I personally don't like the German shepherd breed; I like to look at them, but I don't want to live with one. I'm an active person, but also like to have my days where I stay home and have my quiet time. Dobermans are good for people who are both athletic and quiet, like me.

I'd hazard a guess that most people who would be dumb enough to harass me with a full grown male doberman standing beside me, aren't smart enough to know that kicking a doberman's rib cage can do some serious damage.
Emma, the doberman/rottweiler I had as a kid, she was more doberman than rottweiler. She was an absolute sweetheart until someone messed with her family, then she'd get really aggressive. I'll never forget when this group of drunk guys followed us home, I was around 5 years old at the time. When Emma saw them she tore her leash away from the tree in the backyard, ran to the front yard barking and growling, and my dad had to grab her leash and hold her back cause she would have jumped on any of those guys and tore apart their faces. Dobermans bite like a pair of scissors, they don't hold and shake like German shepherds.

Reasons the video wouldn’t increase the good in the world:
1. People with disabilities may be offended by the video 
2. It doesn’t help the stigma and prejudice against those with disabilities, since this is a large form of exposure able-bodied people have of those with disabilities. The representation of those with disabilities is so narrow, and this type of video doesn’t help. 

By your reasoning, seeing this kind of content can result in more stigma/prejudice, as well as internalized issues that come from only seeing “your group” in videos like this. 

I agree the people who posted this didn’t have bad intentions, and I haven’t seen anyone comment on this as being numerous.

I've technically been disabled since I was five, so I don't really remember life before that. I've seen some home movies that make me kind of sad, though.

I did have to be tutored at home the first half of freshman year of high school, so that was hard. I was the new girl in January when all of the cliques had already been formed.

I started my own company out of my home 20 years ago since it wasn't possible to be full-time employed somewhere else, and I only had to stop working and go on disability about five years ago, so depending on how much your disability has affected that part of your life, maybe that's why we have different perspectives. Since I knew from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to work until retirement age, I worked really hard to make the company kind of self-sustaining. It's still running, just on a smaller scale, and only keeping the clients that employees can work independently and directly with. Basically passive income.

So many things like that, and of course severity of disability and how much it limits us to begin with, could explain all kinds of difference in perspectives.",,,,IckyBelly,,,1558342333,t5_2qhe8,t3_bqjyhv,t1_eo7k1hg,2,1562934079,0,0,eo7lnnp,disability,,,,,

It feels like we just think the people posting have different intentions. They aren't posting so that everyone is entertained by and has a laugh about people with challenges. The person doing a nice thing is the focus.

Also like I said before... being ungrateful and criticizing people only diminishes the impulse to help. Immediately, someone might not be able to have a drink or get some where they need to be.

While going through really bad pain cycles (as opposed to my regular, background pain), I set an alarm on my phone, reminding me to monitor my thoughts every (for example) 15 minutes. If I'm wallowing, I visualize a large stop sign, in as much detail as I can muster, and concentrate on it for a bit.

I eventually moved on to a different phase of existence where I was able to experience friendships still and acclimate to many aspects of my life, but it took a long time and it’s never easy. 

In a way, I had to build an entirely new world. My closest friends, the ones who weren’t shitty stuck around.

You seem to fit within this category, with or without any ""confirmation"" from a neurologist.

In order to get workplace accommodations, you aren't required to provide ""proof"" via medical documentation; some might ask for some, but many will listen to you, especially if you mention that you've been visiting neurologists for years and describe the symptoms you experience monthly. Certain states may require it in order to use vocational rehabilitation services. For an employer, you can talk with them about your needs and what a ""reasonable"" accommodation would be (that doesn't change the fundamental nature or duties of the job).

1569,"Sometimes I feel this way. I have an MS like disease. It is called Transverse Myelitis. I never truly felt like I could call myself disabled despite not being able to walk. Then waking with a walker. Then walking with a cane. I felt like I was faking since I saw people who had it much worse than me. Who was *I* to complain? 

It didn’t hit me until I realized, even without my cane, I am still so very limited in what I can and can’t do. I can work, yes. But the nerve damage that wreaks havoc on my legs makes it miserable. The numbness I experience that sends me into a panic attack. The “electric chair” sensation i feel like disorients me so horribly I can’t decipher where I am/makes it so I almost fall. The debilitating headaches that last for hours and sleep doesn’t help. The dragging of my feet. The way that I can’t bounce back up, I have to brace myself and push myself or pull myself up. 

Most of that is invisible so other people can’t see it. My manager told me that since I was able to get around *better* than before, I must be fine. I looked at him and said that no, I wasn’t fine. I still have a lot of damage from it that will *never* go away. He looked so surprised. It’s just ... I suppose ignorance on his part as he saw me with a cane and he knows I still have issues where I see a team of neurologists.

&gt;An employee with disability can be paid a percentage of the [national minimum wage](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2030), depending on their assessed work capacity. For example, someone with a work capacity of 70% will get 70% of the national minimum wage. Work capacity assessments need to be carried out by a qualified independent assessor.

An additional issue here is that it's a percentage of the *minimum* wage, so the starting point is already much lower, then cut again depending on their work capacity.

1588,"I'm sure you know and are just making a point, but for the sake of anybody sincerely wondering, a sheltered workshop is a workplace supposedly designed for people with disabilities that usually keeps its employees separate from the outside world. They perform menial jobs like packaging candy or constructing holiday cards. It is not uncommon for employees to be mistreated or condescended to in these environments.

As for why they're paid subminimum wage, the pervasive ideology is that they only have partial able bodied function and are therefore only entitled to partial able bodied wage. There are, at least in Aus, actual tests performed in workplaces where a disabled employees performance is compared directly to an able bodied employee.

1590,"I worked at a nonprofit as a job coach in the sheltered workshop. Some years they turned a profit off the piece work jobs, but certainly not enough to pay more than minimum wage. (Like a $75000 profit with 100 clients working.)

Mostly, though , the workshop was a loss leader. Funding came from the state through Medicare waivers, and we would accept losses to support a mission of giving everybody the dignity of a work experience. When possible, we would find Enclave work or individual work for people that would pay minimum wage or better.

I'm not going to lie, getting paid  $14 for a 30 Hour Work Week sucks balls , but when I think back to the people that earned that little , it was a lot of people who needed full physical assistance to do simple piece-work jobs... sometimes needed to be spoon-fed their lunches, and needed personal care assistance

Keep in mind that the alternative for a significant portion of the population isn't a minimum wage job , but rather it's a day program where they do arts and crafts, functional academics , or fine motor development all day.

1593,"While I understand that this is well meaning, sometimes places that help get disabled workers into full time and fully paid  jobs are getting shut down because of this. My son with autism was working with a program that taught him how to apply for a job, how to present himself in an interview, and how to actually do the work needed to get that job. They had a workshop where he was able to make a small amount of money via piece work while he was training. He learned to work with power equipment in a milling shop and manufactured things like wooden crates and stakes used in construction. He didn't make much but it taught him what it was like to earn a small wage and it was a huge incentive for him. Within a few months they got him a job close to home where he did end up making minimum wage. What it did for his self esteem however was amazing. This was not a place of employment, it was a way to teach him about employment and it has recently been cut so they are no longer allowed to train disabled people this way. They still teach but they can no longer let them work in the workshop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Making people work for a few dollars an hour just because they are disabled is not right and I wouldn't want my son to be exploited, but I do appreciate that while he was training to get a job he learned some skills and was able to make a few dollars at it.

Working with people using wheelchairs, on ambulance gurneys, etc. was routine for them.

The prep was no problem. I did not feel bloated or sick, so there was no need to walk around. Actually, the instructions for the prep didn't mention that.

I had colonoscopies twice before I was in a wheelchair. Except for the transfer from the wheelchair to the bed or table, there was no difference.

As for anesthesia, the first time I had only light anesthesia. There was some discomfort but not too much. (not as bad as a teeth cleaning or dental work).

Midazolam and fentanyl is one combination used for light sedation. Midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine that will make you not remember, mostly, the procedure. It lasts between 1 and 6 hours.

I can still present courses, but my speech and movements are slow. My notes are my prompt if I loose track during a lecture. It happens. When I get a zinger question I just reply ""great question, could you write that down for me and I'll research and answer later"" (I do follow up on every question).

On Reddit I can relax and be very honest. Yet in real life just the fact I peed my pants (brain issue, bladder released without warning) is horrifying. People don't what to expect, yet life goes on. Needless to say only a few close friends and immediate family know that story (I was at a technical conference, thankfully my presentation was in the same hotel, and I had time for a quick shower and change of clothes).

1632,"I would love to go back to how I was prediagnosis of Transverse Myelitis. I would love to be able to work without feeling like I’m dying. Have energy. Be able to walk and my legs not hurt. My spine not hurt. My neck and head not hurt. To not have debilitating headaches that bring tears to my eyes. To have my balance back. More than anything, I would love to be able to run and play with my son. I never got to experience that before I got sick. All these things I want “fixed”. I want to feel good again. Now, before my diagnosis I wasn’t the ideal picture of health. But at least I felt somewhat healthy and could be active. 

Now, all that being said, this idea that disabled people are broken and need to be “fixed” in order to be considered helpful to society is gross and harmful. The narrative that disabled people can’t work as well as able bodied people has led disabled people to not be able to get jobs easily. It took me 8 months to get a job and I only got it after I stopped using my cane. I was told point blank if I still had it, I wouldn’t have been hired. I get told constantly I am sickly. I am told to schedule my appts around my work schedule despite being part time and my schedule is only made for three weeks in advanced and I see specialists that are months out usually. I am a *person*. I can do my job better than most of my coworkers *despite* any disability I have but I still am told I am not good enough.

Poverty is no joke.  What I advise you to do is find some way to occupy your time.  That has been my main problem without steady work and transportation, is just that I lie awake at home all day doing nothing but play video games and listen to music, imagining what I could really be doing if I had money and a car.

Learn to divide your money and live frugally.  If you work on SSI, you should realize that they take away .50 per dollar you make from your SSI check.  That information helps because it informs you on how much you should work and how much you can earn.  You should also realize that you rent will go up while working and receiving section 8.  So these are kind of like benefits, but not much really, because they have to account for every dollar that you make and they will make you pay it back no matter what.  If you need to stockpile some cash money, I say you should do so, because the government can't keep track of that.  Buy a safe or lock box and never claim it on your taxes or in any social security statement.  Honestly this might be your best option. 

Being on disability leaves us with very little options.  The government lies when they say a person can live off of $800 a month in social security.  I understand I don't want to be a burden on others, but that should not leave me at their whims.  This society is crap.  A society that requires large amounts of cash to really survive should at least have some socialist spending.  It's not just you or me who are broke these days.  The problem is pretty systemic.

Why something that should be so much fun, be such a cause of angst for this child is awful. I had no deficits to contend with either.

Does he do any kind of art work at home that could transfer to class? How often are we talking about is the art class? If it is just part of the day a couple of hours a week and is taught right in your classroom? I know many times for art the class can do a large project, such as making a quilt (and yes I realize it is too late in the year to start that) but something to think about where perhaps the kids work in different 'committees' according to their abilities. Some deciding on the colors, design &amp; patterns, and they all work to make one block each for the quilt. Then one of the 'committees' decides on block placement and then they haul in a sewing mom that is willing to help the kids sew it together, or just does it on her own to finish it up. He could be on both a committee and can have an extended length of time as they all will to make up his quilt block. His helper, if needed, could do the actual hands-on work under his instruction.

It’s not choice to me.  Death isn’t even in my vocabulary.  Everyone seems to think this is courageous or heroic or ____ insert whatever word necessary.

The bad days are just trials... and it’s because I know the joy of good days.  I don’t get envious or jealous of others... I get jealous or envious of what I might be able to accomplish if I was back to normal... which then puts me in a mindset of “how do I use what I have at my disposal to even my playing field”.  And whom knows, maybe during my research to even the playing field, I’ll come across my path of complete fulfillment.  

All I know is that life isn’t supposed to be easy for anyone.  One set of problems are just traded for a different set.  I think so many people over burden themselves into this mindset of what they believe to be perfect.

He tracked the system and helped follow up on my medical records. During the initial phase, SS conveniently never received the most important paperwork. They have access to info we don't, and likely have a good working rapport with anyone else who might be there. He'll bring up important points about things a judge might not ask about. 

As for the therapist, I think it's important to establish that you have been seeking help regularly. If you have a medical history to look at, that goes a long way. If not, it might raise a red flag. I had years of doctor visits, surgeries, medications for my physical and mental ailments when I filed my appeal.

1906,"I’m always on the lookout for a product like this, VERY interested. Here are some practical concerns I think of when I’m looking at products like this:

— braking system. I can’t tell from your description whether brake from ‘handles’ means you can brake from the levers or have to use the wheels. Obviously there wouldn’t be enough time to let go and grab wheels.

— reverse. You would think this would be obvious, but actually it comes from first hand experience. The best feeling (from a shoulder/exercise perspective) row wheelchair I ever tried was actually an unusable device because it didn’t go in reverse! It was made by a well-intentioned non-wheelchair user who didn’t fathom why that was a dealbreaker. I guess he never tried rolling his own invention up to a table 

— lever release position. Speaking of tables, the release position you have in the diagram—the position you can move the levers to to get the out of the way—is so so. Personally I wouldn’t be able to use that because it blocks side transfers in and out of chair. And it looks like it would get in the way of rolling under tables. You might want to study some similar products, like wijits (they are levers, but they don’t row). Their release position is to swing back. It’s less compact looking since it’s not folded down, but it’s actually more out of the way.

— lever position in general. Those levers seem awfully far forward. I’m a little skeptical. Remember to try your product out on smaller people, not just 6ft tall men!

— installation/portability. A lot of these issues don’t have perfect solutions and this is certainly one of them. A lot of trade offs. But a major consideration of mine is whether this is an add on to my chair that I could somewhat easily remove, or whether I’m stuck with it after installation. And if I’m stuck with it, how many parts of my chair does that impact and can it travel well? Wijits again provide a good example, though this time not in their favor. Wijits have an extremely annoying installation feature. Manual chairs in general have a standardized quick release for their main wheels. But wijits wheels, at least my 5 year old pair, have a different connector. This has to be installed on the axle and makes the chair incompatible with normal wheels. There’s no easy switching between wijits and normal wheels once you install them. This feature is made more problematic by their poor travel robustness. Airline travel with wijits is dysfunctional, because there’s no way to secure them. A point in favor of your release position is that it looks secured, which is helpful. My ideal (imaginary) product would either be a set of wheels with attached levers that pops off quick release style so I could pop in normal wheels, or modified wheels with easily detachable levers with the wheels working like normal when I detach levers.

— gears. Not a dealbreaker for me, since it seems like there is a built in tradeoff between gears and weight and I like lightweight too. But gears are awesome.

— price. Actually, you have a great price range.

— Demo availability. This is obviously a hard one for a small new product. But I mention it because it’s the number 1 reason I haven’t obtained some similar products. It’s just very hard to determine whether I can use a product until I try it. There is this national ‘Abilities Expo’ (if you’re in US) that is one way to get product out there.

1912,"I'm a manual chair user, so here's my perspective:

1) Disc brakes: Yes, please, especially in wet conditions. Not having the brakes linked during two-hand operation allows some steering as well. Thumbs up. However, what happens if I'm pulling and I need to brake, which happens all the time in real life. I'd need the pulling handles to operate the brakes as there isn't time to drop the handles, grasp the arms and apply brakes.

2) Pulling: It's not clear if there is any gearing involved. There better be as pulling near the hub is going to take so much more effort. Perhaps make the hubs bigger so that there's more mechanical advantage. Also, the positioning of the arms needs to be adjustable so that they can be placed at your natural arm extension, so you get the maximum pulling distance/range. I like the idea of the arms folding over the big wheels when not in use.

3) Width: A wider chair is going to be a problem. In the UK, there is an assumed standard width of chair and everything is geared to that. It means that those who use current bariatric chairs have problems navigating the world, so a wider ""standard-size"" chair may not fit into the gaps any more. So how much more width are we talking about? If it stops me using public transport or using accessible toilets, then it's a no-go.

4) Weight: If you're going to attach arms to the chair then the basic chair structure needs to be able to cope with the new stresses. Does this mean that the weight of the chair needs to increase? And would the material of the chair need to be stronger, titanium instead of aluminium? Would that increase the cost of the chair, even before your device is fitted?

I'm not trying to be negative, just practical from my point of view. I'd love to have something that meant that I could look where I was going when going uphill, instead of leaning forward and looking at the ground.

1) Disc brakes: Yes, please, especially in wet conditions. Not having the brakes linked during two-hand operation allows some steering as well. Thumbs up. However, what happens if I'm pulling and I need to brake, which happens all the time in real life. I'd need the pulling handles to operate the brakes as there isn't time to drop the handles, grasp the arms and apply brakes.

2) Pulling: It's not clear if there is any gearing involved. There better be as pulling near the hub is going to take so much more effort. Perhaps make the hubs bigger so that there's more mechanical advantage. Also, the positioning of the arms needs to be adjustable so that they can be placed at your natural arm extension, so you get the maximum pulling distance/range. I like the idea of the arms folding over the big wheels when not in use.

3) Width: A wider chair is going to be a problem. In the <LOCATION>, there is an assumed standard width of chair and everything is geared to that. It means that those who use current <PERSON> chairs have problems navigating the world, so a wider ""standard-size"" chair may not fit into the gaps any more. So how much more width are we talking about? If it stops me using public transport or using accessible toilets, then it's a no-go.
