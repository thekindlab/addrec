10,"So a few years ago I was having problems with my best friend, I loved this girl. However she was clearly struggling with mental health issues but refusing to see a doctor about it, she was paranoid, possessive, got upset if any of the friends group met up with out her, lied about odd things (and even once potentially very dangerous things) regularly threatened to commit suicide. you couldn't confront her about anything or she would have a major very public panic attack and you would very clearly be the Asshole. Clearly had lots of issues, I tried working with her, we all did (her partner and our friends) but in the end I got so stressed out my hair started falling out! At that point I decided i just couldn't do this any more, I sat her down and told her the truth, I explained that she needed help, help I could not give her and that I needed space away from her because her behavior had become toxic. That evening her partner called me up asking how I could just quit on her and I kindly explained that I am not a trained mental health professional, and that I was becoming sick dealing with her issues so I had to put myself first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well my talk with her was the kick in the butt she needed to get help and was soon diagnosed with BPD, and given therapy to help, however all that really did was give her even more of an excuse for her behavior and I'm sad to say she hasn't changed much in the last few years.

32,"I can agree with this info. I’ve been using crutches for four years now and have been intermittently using a motorized wheelchair at school for the part year and a half. Now that I’m about to be off to college, I’m also going to get a manual chair. 

I won’t lie—I’ve only been in a manual chair twice in public, and it made me so embarrassed that I didn’t want to leave my bedroom ever again. I’ve never used the power chair in public purely because it’s just so damn heavy. The last time I used a chair in public nearly a year ago, I stood up to put the chair into the back trunk. The valet who was standing by the door threw his hands up and said, “Praise Jesus! It’s a miracle!” He meant it as a joke, and it’s a very stale one at that. I’ve heard teachers and others say something to the same effect when I walk a short distance without any mobility aids. 

By this point, I’m used to the stares that I receive when I use my crutches. I also have to use joint braces, such as a hard hip brace, when I’m walking. On the seldom occasion that I use a cane—it’s really not all that helpful for me, but I use one whenever I need to be “fancy”—I rarely get comments. When I do, people are usually very kind. With crutches, people are usually kind but are more prone to asking invasive questions. People have been more cruel to me on average when I’m in a chair, but I’m not going to make a hard conclusion based on my two outings. 

The first two years I used crutches, my peers were often cruel. One boy would kick my crutches out from under me whenever he saw me; he’s lucky I never fell, but there were several close calls. The same boy once stole my crutches and ran down the hallway with them. I had to hobble and wobble my way down the hallway until a teacher yelled at him. My peers would never, ever hold open a door for me or offer to carry anything, but they’d swarm the popular kids who had minor athletic injuries and help them in every way possible. It’s likely all the better for me; there’s not much that I can’t do on my crutches now. I can even “run.” 

During my second year of using crutches, I was sexually harassed a lot, and much of it was centered around my disability. I was sexually harassed mostly by a few boys who were my age or slightly older, but girls my age and men old enough to be my father or grandfather were also guilty. I remember vividly how a group of boys my age would harass me in between classes. They’d call me a cripple while the “alpha” would tell me exactly what he wanted to do to me. Another boy two years older than me would use similar tactics; he once told me he would fuck me until my hips broke. He’d corner me in classes, in the more isolated hallways, and whenever I was walking between buildings. I couldn’t do a thing about it, unfortunately. He was the person who motivated me to learn how to “run” again. Even to this day, I can go pretty fast on my crutches. Man, do I have stories to tell.... someday. 

Anyway, this probably isn’t all too encouraging for you. I’d just like to say that I’ve felt shame over using mobility aids and still do many days. But it does get better. I promise. The shame I feel comes from my family’s prejudices more than from strangers’ reactions.",,,,genetically__odd,,,1563837927,t5_2qhe8,t3_cggxfi,t1_euhrtym,1,1572605857,0,0,eui0la1,disability,,,,,

I also struggle with feeling guilt and shame about the things I can't do because of my conditions. I think everyone does who endures a debilitating chronic illness.

It's really hard to ask for and accept help. Even though your emotions are telling you otherwise, please keep reminding yourself that you've done a difficult thing because it's best for your little one and your family. Of course it feels terrible to not be able to care for him yourself, the way you want to. But you've put his needs ahead of your feelings, and that's incredibly brave.

Remember that you haven't abandoned your son. You're still there near him, and if I can feel your love for him so strongly in this post, I have no doubt your boy does too. Children are very adaptable, and he'll quickly adjust to the situation and be just fine. His loving mom is still right there if he wants to tell you a joke or draw pictures together or watch a movie or give you a hug. You've made sure he is well-cared for, and that's the most loving thing any parent can do. I'm sure you can work with your nanny and in-home carer to involve you in your son's daily life as much as possible.

Another thing you can do for your son is take care of yourself the best you can. That includes seeing to your emotional health as well as physical. Chronic illness very often causes depression, and if you're not already, I hope you'll talk to your doctor about how you're feeling. It may be that you're experiencing some depression, and treatment can make a big difference, whether that's medication or therapy or both. Even an online group like this one is a good source of support, as you know; it's helped me a lot. If you can take care of your emotional well-being, you can be more present with your family.

You've really been dealt a rough hand, and none of it is your fault. You are doing the best you can do. It's okay to feel sad, angry, sorry for yourself, and anything else that you feel! But remember that you're making good choices for your son and your family by getting help. That's not something to feel bad about - it's selfless and courageous.

138,"&gt; I think most of the pavements and drop curbs can be fixed I doubt their listed

No but it costs money to plan and fit a kerb drop. How many would you want in your area just for you? Then multiply that by every other wheelchair user, because if it's being done for one user in a non-central area without existing works just because they asked for it, it should be done for all. 

&gt;  I feel as though buying a ramp to get up the step in most shops that are in listed building is a reasonable adjustment

It is, which is why I suggested you phone and ask if they have one, and contact the council if not. Have you done this? 

&gt; the point of this campaign was to get weight behind the letter I was gonna send to my councillors like you suggested write to the council

Fantastic! But the council will take your complaints and MPs will still support you if you go on your own. You don't need to wait for people to sign your petition. They represent you as an individual and you can always ask them for help. The key with it all is to be persistent, no matter how frustrating that may be. I got the pavement just along from me fixed by complaining to the council. It took time, but it does work. 

&gt; if you visit the central library you’ll see all the bottom floors have recently been renovated so why can’t the do the reference library too

Because it costs money. I'd bet my chair someone at the library has already asked for it but these things take time, planning and funding. 

They just can't make everything accessible overnight. It's not possible. Yes it's frustrating and yes I'd love to wake up tomorrow in a magically accessible world but you have to work with what you've got to make it happen. And what we've got is contacting the council and if that doesn't work, your MP about the issues. And finding our best ways around them in the meantime. By all means use the petition to get a little extra weight behind your requests, I'm just saying not to expect everything to change in a hurry because of it.

Additionally, I think every civil rights movement goes through this dilemma: How much do we change the world to fit us, and how much do we change ourselves to fit the world as it already is?  Do we demand more ramps and elevators, or do we build more stair-climbing wheelchairs?  Seeing myself as a disability advocate, my allegiance tends to be toward the former.

I do find your questions interesting and am curious whether any “relevantly” disabled people will respond. I’ve chatted with many disabled people individually about my BIID. I have found that people with physical disabilities similar to what I need tend to be more supportive and understanding than people without any physical disabilities. Of course the level of awareness, openness, and curiosity about BIID varies amongst disabled people just as it does amongst people in general. 

BIID is a real condition, be it neurological or psychological, which those of us who have it did not choose to have. It’s now officially recognized under the moniker “body integrity dysphoria” in the latest iteration of the International Classification of Diseases from the World Health Organization, the ICD-11. I think some people, regardless of disability status, finding our condition and even our existence offensive has much to do with ableism, including internalized ableism.

You are teaching him that it is a good thing to get help when its most needed.  You are teaching him that loving and being a family does not always ""look"" the same as all the other families because being a family is about accepting and taking care of ALL the people in it.

It may take a long while though as other people will also be going to the toilet during sets too and will have no issue using the disabled one. 

If it's an outdoor concert or festival then it gets harder. Some have no disabled facilities at all which sucks. Usually you would then have to go all the way to some other facility with an accsessable toilet like a local supermarket

286,"The issue you're going to run into here is that Edinburgh is an old city on a bunch of hills. Because of that, a lot of its buildings are protected by historical acts and you'll never get them retrofitted. It's the same in a lot of Scotland, Glasgow is particularly bad as much of the city is at basement level and the subway is nearly all inaccessible. Their pavements are truly horrendous and it's on a huge hill. Dundee and Perth are better but still rocky in some parts pavement wise. Aberdeen is pretty good other than parts of King Street. I've been told Stirling and Inverness are not bad but I've not been there enough to comment. It's difficult and expensive to do works in a city, particularly when they are old, need a lot done and rely on tourism for a chunk of their income. 

Edinburgh actually has some great stuff in the works, have a look at the City Transformation Plan and see what you think. There's an improvement project going from the Meadows to George St which would improve the access for a good chunk of your way into the city. 

Regarding the petition it's never a bad thing to keep it fresh in their minds but realistically I wouldn't expect much to come of it in a short time frame. The council has already consulted on and planned several improvements. I'd suggest rewording it in third person, as it's written it comes across as if it's about you on a personal level. I realise that's not what you mean and you're sharing your experience as an example, but that's how it may read to others, especially those without a disability. Ask wheelchair users in other parts of Edinburgh for the issues they have and add them, so they realise it's impacting a larger number of people.

---------------------

Regarding the issues you're currently having, I've taken them one by one with some suggestions on how to get round them until you can get something more permanent in place. 

I see you have an active user chair in your photo with anti tip bars. Have you ever done any wheelchair skills training? Did SMART go through it with you when they prescribed your chair? It takes time but if you learned to balance on your back wheels without the tippers you could get up and down a lot more of the curb drops. A Freewheel is great for going over cobbles. `

&gt; very difficult for me to go to my local shop or get to the pharmacy or to my local bus stop

Bus stop you can't do much about but have you ever looked into home delivery? All the major supermarkets do it now, it's £1 delivery for a cheap night. I guarantee you they deliver to Newington and you don't need to carry shopping home either. The same goes for your prescriptions, you can have them sent directly to the pharmacy from your doctor and they'll deliver it to your front door for free. Saves a lot of hassle.   

&gt; this is all because many of the pavements are uneven and have broken paving stones. 

Take a note of where they are and send it to the council. Repeat every few weeks when nothing is done. They respond much better to 'this specific thing is broken in this specific place' vs 'pavements are generally shite'. If you get no response, go to your MP directly with the same list. If they run a surgery, go to that. 

&gt; because people tie bicycles to the street lamps and take up all the pavement

&gt; people park right on the pavement also blocking my access...the police seem indifferent to the matter.

People can be cunts. People can also just be oblivious. Try and make friends with your neighbours and mention what a hassle it is in a nice manner, word gets around. Leave a polite note tucked into the spokes or on the windshield explaining you're a wheelchair user and would they please leave the pavement free. Take a note of the reg so you know which cars you've done. Some people just don't realise and respond brilliantly to a nice message pointing out their mistake. I know you've reported it to the police, if messages are ignored keep doing it. They're not indifferent, they're just stretched thin from a million budget cuts.  

You don't mention big bins, these are my biggest issue, especially outside flats. That's another 'phone the council' job. 

&gt; there are no dropped curbs which makes it very hard to go around these obsticles

&gt; the drop curbs along the royal mile and surrounding areas are often too steep

&gt; Along the Edinburgh bypass and the areas where I go to college pavements often just stop without a drop curb 

You can apply to the council for permission to build a kerb drop outside your home, but have to pay for it yourself. I have the same issue, so I worked out the routes that lead to existing drops and take me the least out of the way. The same goes for the sudden ending pavements. Google Street View can be good to plan out a route you haven't been on before.   

I know the ones you mean on the Mile, the second half down towards Holyrood has some horribly steep drops and not enough of them. But it's also on a great big hill, so any drop would have to take a chunk out of the pavement to make a gradual slope towards it. Basically it's a big job for them in an area with heavy traffic.   

&gt; I cannot visit my local cafes or even my local post office as they do not make a reasonable adjustment to those with disabilities by providing a ramp, this is against the law but the council doesn’t seem to be enforcing these rules.

Have you written to the council about this? They don't regularly go around and check every business but can if you report it. Have you checked that the businesses don't have a hidden ramp? Many places I've been to have a foldable ramp, if you phone and ask they'll set it up for you. If you've done the above and nothing happens, take it to your MP.  

&gt; I cannot even visit my local library as the lift an corridors are too narrow to even fit a small manual wheelchair

I was in Newington library about a month ago and my manual chair fit okay, have you tried there? If you can't get to parts of it staff will help you out, you'd presumably need to ask them to reach high up books anyway. You can also look at going to a library with better access (maybe one around college as you're there anyway) and asking them to order in books for you. This is free. 

Really if you want to live somewhere accessible in Scotland you're better at moving out into a smaller, newer town with good transport links where the council has more to spend on adaptations, repairs etc. Should it be that way? No. But a large city isn't going to spend millions adapting everywhere for a small number of wheelchair users, it's slowly being upgraded when there are other works planned in the area.

291,"Have you tried applying for Medicaid? They might call it something different in Georgia. I’m in Ohio. I went to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to apply for Medicaid and SNAP (food assistance). The application process is a pain in the ass, but don’t let it wear you down. It took me six months for them to approve my request for Medicaid, and then years before I was awarded food assistance benefits. When you’re approved, they will cover all of your retroactive medical bills from the date you applied to the date you were approved, as long as you keep them and do the legwork to make it happen.

In the meantime, call the billing offices for the doctors you see and explain to them your situation. See if there’s anyway you can get on a payment plan, even if it’s like $15 a month. If you’re paying something, no matter how little, it shows good intentions.

Any hospital bill I’ve ever received has had an application for HCAP on the back of it. I’m blanking on what that stands for at the moment, but if you fill out the application and send it in, they will write off a large portion of the bill, and then you can arrange a small monthly payment plan on it like the rest of your bills. When Medicaid denied me and I was appealing, I had an unexpected ER visit that was in the thousands. I filled out HCAP and they wrote off all of it, every penny. I was uninsured with no income (disabled and unable to work).

You said you’re reapplying for disability. Are you appealing your denial, or applying all over again? I’d strongly suggest you appeal your denial. If you reapply, they’ll just deny and deny and deny you. If you appeal and eventually win your case, they will pay you your benefits from the date you applied all the way up to the date you are approved, no matter how long it takes.

Not gonna sugarcoat it though, this is also a pain in the ass and a very stressful situation. I applied on my own and then when I got denied the first time, I went straight to a lawyer. My lawyer doesn’t get paid unless I win my case, so no worries about that right now. She’s taken care of everything so far, and my chances of winning my appeal are higher with legal counsel by my side. Look into the best disability lawyers around you. It’s worth it.

*Edit: Unfortunately, disability cases take years to win. I was devastated when they denied my application, and then even more devastated when they denied my appeal. It’s been more than a year now and I’m still waiting for a hearing date. My lawyer said it usually takes around two more years before I get my day in court. And even then, nothing is guaranteed. It’s extremely anxiety provoking, trust me, I know.

309,"YouTube is your friend, if you already have a sewing machine and a desire to learn then you're most of the way there already. You will find plenty of tutorials on every aspect of sewing you could think of.

Fabric glue and iron on tape will tend to come undone in the washer or dryer, so if you do use those then be prepared to cool hand wash so you can enjoy them for a long time.

There may be patterns out there for reversible shirts, but just bear in mind that if you have a large chest, then it may not be a practical solution. The neck will tend to ride high at the front and low at the back, but as long as you are okay with that, then there is no reason not to go for it.

Have a look at tutorials for patch pockets for thigh pockets. Essentially, draw the shape of the pocket that you would like, cut roughly 1/2"" away from that line and then press the top edge under and machine sew it a couple of times (for strength), then press the rest of the edges under and stitch onto your trousers where you want them. Those edges might be easier to do by hand, because trying to manoeuvre the trousers can make things more hassle than it needs to be. You could do some lovely decorative stitches on them that way too.

For trousers, you want them to be lower at the front and higher at the back. I haven't tried to alter any personally, and I wouldn't suggest getting into pattern cutting that is too complex early on, but if you fancy giving it a go then do let me know and I'll recommend some resources. For skirts, they tend to sit fine on the waistband, but I personally prefer more room in the seat to provide extra length in the back. I also don't like having all the extra fabric in the back, so the back piece of skirts tend to be much less full. Think back half pencil skirt with extra room in the seat and darts running horizontally to take the fullness out of the side seam and then the front is whatever style of skirt you want to wear.",,,,luna-the-lunatic,,,1563060183,t5_2qhe8,t3_ccohyj,t3_ccohyj,2,1571964232,0,0,etpnpu3,disability,,,,,

314,"(Limited respiratory) Wegners patiant checking in late to put my two cents in. I was diagnosed at 13 and ive been living with the disease to today, where Im about to turn 21. I went through up to 60mg of prednisone, cytoxin, cellcept, and ritoxin. Cellcept finally put me im remission thankfully a couple years back.

I was always scared, and still am, by the fact that wegners was typically an old person disease and that there was no certain way of knowing how long I was going to last as a kid with his life ahead of him. Even with a very limited case, Im being put into situations where my disease, or at least the post-remission residual symptoms, act as an obsticle to me overcommiting myself to extracuriculars at my university. But its by no means a wall. Dont let any doctor tell you to settle for less. My goals and aspirations were the only thing that gave my the strength to keep on going, so dont ever give that up.

Some other medical advice that my doctors never told me but helped ease my day to day pain, your diet matters a lot with this disease, at least from a respiratory stand point. I found that dairy products, red meat, excessive fats, and artificial foods all cause me to cough up hella blood. And by eating anti-inflammatory foods you can mitigate your heightened inflamatory resposes from the disease.

Yes. Take a good look at how you defined it:

A LOT of disabled people would be offended by the assumption that simply because they are disabled they suffer and need sympathy.

332,"Imagine instead this friend of yours had a physical disability that caused her to violently move her arms around. You, standing close to help her often get hit by these flailing arm busts. 

At first it's fine you can understand and it's only something that happens from time to time. It may sting a little but it's not like you have a black eye she can't control it and you know she needs help walking around so you keep taking it. 

Eventually you start getting black eyes, burst lips once even fracturing a bone. Are you really going to keep on standing that close and getting hit? 

No. You aren't. Your going to find the number of a phsycial therapist that can determine if she needs a wheelchair to get around or something else to help her so you don't have to carry her abour getting slapped in the face as a a thanks. 

What then would you do if she said to you ""oh I don't want to use the wheelchair or cane. It's just easier to have you carry me around. Sure you get hit but you know I can't help it so you can't complain"" what would you do? 

Because in that situation if we assume she really cannot help it (which I highly doubt is the case for her outside of this hypothetical) you would be more than justified in dumping her ass. 

Your situation is worse though becuase a bruised eye hurts but heals predictably on its own. Mental health is far more complex. Plus. It seems like she isn't your friend anymore she's a burdon.

336,"With your sons father, unfortunately hindsight is 20/20. In the thick of it, it can be difficult to see things that are in front of us and, it is only when we look back later, we can pick up on things. Starting interventions early really does make a hell of a difference in helping kids achieve all that they are capable of and I commend you for making the effort to find any way in with your son to be there for him, support him, and encourage him to be the person he is today. As you have talked about with your sons father, not every one does that. And you’re right, there really is no such thing as ‘normal’ we are all unique! I always say life would be pretty boring if we were all the same. He sounds like a really hard worker and it’s brilliant that he has worked to achieve what he has. It is such a rewarding feeling when hard work pays off and to know that people see *you* and what you are capable of rather than making assumptions based on your disability.

Congrats on your first grandbaby, such a special time and more so when conceiving has been so difficult. It’s sad that your sons father says things like that because it is so unnecessary and can really affect relationships. It leaves a lingering feeling that he doesn’t or won’t love/care about the bub just because it’s not the gender he wanted (especially if they have another child and it’s a boy).

344,"Read your responses to DarkestJediofAllTime for context. If you can't see how out of place they are, then you might be too blinded by your own views.

1. I repeat, your assertion that people who do inconsiderate things shouldn't be judged because they may have an invisible disability is a bit fucked up. Why would you start with the assumption that people who misbehave are disabled? Sure, when the evidence presents itself people will adjust the interraction but most will hold everyone to the same standards of decency as others, regardless of ability or age until made aware differently.

On invalidation.. the posts you replied to(and what I think inspired this post) were sharing their frustration about cutomers who were being inconsiderate or made them feel really uncomfortable with their behavior. They were not about disabilities in any way. You put disabilities on the table as an explanation(could be valid). But when people corrected you, you doubled down, called one person an abelist and ingnorant(read your comments to TheDarkestJediofAllTime for context) for not validating your view on invisible disabilities, and went a bit into advocate mode(because you suffer from them). How is this invalidating? because rather than offering sympathy for a shitty interaction, you kind of  dismissed their experiences, their corrections, and got on a soap box about an issue that was never there.

349,"I made an account to comment on your post as I see it has been a few days without responses of the kind you are looking for, yet. I will attempt to give the full scope of my thoughts on this as a person who has been disabled from birth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, thank you for differentiating between those with BIID and those wh,o in your own words, are ""actually disabled people."" That is important. Some of the effects of the disorder may potentially be disabling, but it is nowhere near the same thing, or even close really. A distinction is vital. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for ""being able"" to amputate a healthy limb... I don't think anyone should be able to forcibly stop you from doing that, but it is a decision that is fraught with issues and it is, unfortunately, not just a personal decision really. Well, I mean to say it is almost impossible for the decision not to affect more than just yourself. Given that ""disorder"" is in the name, it is at least recognized as a problematic thing. But the scope of its issues may be unknown to at least some who believe they have it. I will attempt to lay out some of the major issues that I think surround following this through to its logical conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Optics. In many countries, the disabled are often already not looked upon favorably by their abled overlords. Part of this is due to problems with ableds not wanting to see this and be aware that it could be them easily. Another is that many disabled people are very poor and in some cases cannot easily support themselves, and people tend not to like poor people so much. Being both disabled and poor is difficult. It is also very much a thing for ableds to wonder if various people are ""faking,"" because they do not know much about disability and make snap judgments all the time. Imagine how much worse it could be for actual disabled people if public perception decided that ""maybe they just did this to themselves."" It's bad enough that we don't and still get seen with suspicion or scorn. Granted, the numbers for those with BIID are extremely small in comparison to the global population, but any muddying of those already troubled waters can make even more issues for those of us in this marginalized community. 
2. Funds. This goes back a bit to the fact that often, disabled people can be disproportionately poor. Of course, ""disability"" is broad in scope. Many disabled people, myself included, can work and support themselves. Many cannot. They rely on funds from social programs just to survive. Surviving as a disabled person is more expensive than surviving as one who is not. Which compounds further the whole poor thing. Optics are at play again here. Many people are already critical of even the meager offerings of these programs because the instances of waste or fraud are highlighted to such a degree that they want to further cut the whole program to get rid of that, even if it is small compared to the number of people who actually need it. Imagine how much more public opinion towards the disabled might sour if you were on some of those programs due to a disability you chose. Even if public optics weren't a part of it, you'd still be taking funds that might go to needy disabled people that have lived this way their whole lives. Personally, I don't think anyone who actually inflicts this can be on such a program and remain ethical, but I am open to other interpretations in this regard as well. In my country, they look for any excuse to shrink these programs and push people in actual need off of them. BIID, even though it is so rare, would hardly help this. I don't think anyone who goes through with the physical part of it should ever, ever, get on social programs designed to help the disabled in need. It would be extremely unethical, even given the small numbers worldwide. 
3. Respect. I can only speak for myself here, but there seems to be an inherent air of disregard for the feelings and struggles of the disabled in people who wish that they were. I've read stories about how it is so ""unfortunate"" that a BIID sufferer's legs still work well and that they get around well. I walk with a cane and my legs do not work well. Life is hard, and I still try to live it to the fullest. But I read these stories, with these words and their intent, and feel incredibly let down that they view that gift in such a way. A gift I can never have no matter how much I want it. I've also read stories that go into detail about the severity of the disability a person wants to have. I didn't get to choose the severity of mine like some curated thing. But they speak about how a certain level would be good, but beyond that it would be too much. People born disabled don't get to choose it off a menu like that. While I do understand and accept that it is a disorder, that disorder adds an incredible layer of hurtful disrespect and dismissal of a big part of my existence, in my opinion--again, I am open to other interpretations. Some disabled people see it as a big part of their identity, some would change it if only they could. To throw away the gift of being able to go through this world as one of those for whom it was made, it is something I have trouble fathoming. 

Your question asks how one feels about BIID. I feel it is a disorder for which psychological help is needed and should be sought in an attempt to rectify the disorder. I want people that suffer from it to not suffer. However, those that truly go through with it as the means of rectifying it, I think it would be difficult to earn my respect or indeed for me to not be openly hostile about it. It's a decision that, depending on your situation, can put a strain on the state and on family and friends, even if you have talked to them about it. It's not something that is just in isolation. It can negatively affect the perceptions of a community that frankly has it hard enough as it is. 

Before I end, I'd like to add that I've also read stories from the community that were highly critical of how certain people in said community go about disabling themselves. It appears that there are some standards and that some in the community take these kinds of feelings into account, which I appreciate. It cannot be easy living with this disorder and I wish you the best and hope you get help that reconciles this for you--if that is your wish.  Also, I have disabled friends who are much more understanding of BIID and the actual decision to go through with it, so my own rather lukewarm view is not the only one out there.",,,,DjinnOftheBeresaad,,,1564342686,t5_2qhe8,t3_cfwfnt,t3_cfwfnt,1,1573144240,0,0,evaa76z,disability,,,,,

TV just like tonic clonic because that's what they know, however recently I did see a medical show with a epileptic boy who ended up having problems with his VNS short circuiting his heart and it wasn't the epilepsy.  It was a good way twist to it. 

Also with medical shows, it irks the ever living fuck out of me that every third patient seems to have a fucking brain tumor this, brain cancer that.  It is honestly rare.

364,"Thanks for your response. It was nice to hear some kind of ping back in this mental state where I feel completely alone/unacceptable. 

In response to your query, that ""unable to work"" determination was made in 2017. I've struggled through almost 10 jobs and several months of being unemployed from then until now.  I tried to ask if that meant I was disabled and if I should file for disability, but was told that my doctor does not do/handle disability forms and so it was not an option with that doctor.

Fast forward to now. Tried to live off of meager savings. Tried to work. Tried so damn hard. I got in with a free clinic in the county I live in (more help than I had back in the other state I used to be in) and I only had my first appointment with them. I'm waiting for an actual ""engagement"" appointment (next step after intake/assessment I guess) starting next month. They couldn't get me in sooner. They're the ones who gave me the PTSD diagnosis. 

I have tried to get RA for jobs before but again, the last doctor I went to wouldn't help me with that request either and the company I worked for refused to go off of me bringing in my medical record to show my diagnosis.

Thanks for hearing me out. I hurt so much on the inside and the outside that I can barely stand it. I know some kind of money every month would really help me out- and I wouldn't have to feel like a huge burden on everyone around me. I would also be able to feel safer if I was able to prove disability/have small income because I would likely qualify from some lower income housing or something like that instead of staying with friends or fiance's family.

Perhaps, maybe even a drone with a camera on it will give him a chance to see things from an entirely new perspective! And to piggyback on that, a camera to take his own photos with.

As far as outdoors goes, it may be a good idea to put in some pathways for his chair, 2x4's of pre-treated lumber or even full out concrete paths. He's only going to get bigger, as all kids do, and if he at least has some paths to lead down through the forests, it'll give him a chance to still get out in the Great Outdoors.

Don't let that stop you from applying. They will send you to their own psychiatrist. My personal psychiatrist does not fill out SSA forms either.

381,"I didn’t have any free hands. I use a cane, and I had to carry a bag with all my meds and the (empty) water bottle. I couldn’t do too much planning ahead because I didn’t know if I was going until like 2 days ahead. I can’t talk to strangers, I very rarely talk to people I don’t know at all, ever, unless I’m pretty much forced to. I’m very sorry my anxiety issues make you so angry. 

 It doesn’t matter if you respect my rant or not. And, like I’ve said about 5 times in this thread I DID WHAT I COULD TO ACCOMODATE MYSELF. I’m not blaming anyone for my injuries exactly, again, as I have said about 7 times. I am not. It’s not for you, it’s for me.

I tried to accommodate myself reasonably. I can’t fucking do everything myself. It’s all over and done with, but they can still make something better for people next year. This rant, again, as I’ve said, is not a well thought out paper, it’s not a petition, it’s a RANT. It’s my pure thoughts and frustrations. 

And I am doing SOMETHING. I tried to do something, obviously it didn’t work. So I am taking it higher, but that takes motivation, a clear head, and enough god dammed energy to actually sit down, type my thoughts, read over, correct, proofread, etc and then contact the right people, wait, be riddled with anxiety over the potential response, try to prepare for the large possibility of just getting ignored like the hordes of people before me but also trying not to lose hope while also trying to not depress myself too much....

So yeah, I tried my best to accommodate myself with the limitations I have, and then those failed, and i tried to find something to help when they did. There was nothing. 

I got frustrated and pushed myself too hard because god damn it I just wanted to be a part of SOMETHING for once in my life, i wanted to be free and have fun like all my friends do, and maybe I can’t anymore and that sucks and I hate it and I’m tired of it. At that point I couldn’t get out even if I wanted to, which I did consider. When I finally got home, I couldn’t take the sadness, anger and frustration I felt, wrote my thoughts out on a space I thought would be supportive, then just fucking went to sleep. I didn’t want to deal with any heavy duty thinking.

But in terms of just generally waiting for an answer elevator, I don't understand why this person wants to be treated like a special snowflake for having any disability. Unless I am dealing with fatigue, severe pain, dizziness, etc then I'm happy to wait my turn to exit a building.

Understandably it's different for a 3 year old, they fatigue much faster and are prone to stress. But I think this is common for all parents with 2-3 year olds at sporting events, do they also get exit priority?

448,"--Possible trigger warning--

When we talk about abuse, people get outraged and angry at the abuser, and rightfully so, but I feel like they gloss over the reasons it happens in the first place. It looks like a willful and intentionally evil act, but on the most basic level, abuse is just one person's damage being passed on to another. This sounds like I'm enabling abusers but hold on.

I was raised by an extremely unstable stepparent (SP) who would lash out, physically and verbally, if challenged in the slightest. When things got overwhelming, I was threatened with abandonment, suicide and institutionalization. When *I* threatened to leave and/or kill myself, I was encouraged. But... SP always said ""I love you."" I was praised for my accomplishments, given comfort when I sought it out, showered with individual attention in the midst of my siblings. It was so strange to me that somebody could embody love and hate so strongly and simultaneously.

I spent years confused because of this dissonance, and only recently after talking to some other family did I come to understand SP's mental state and just how out of control they were when those outbursts hit. I don't think they could have held back for anybody. However, while I could find sympathy for SP, I could not justify keeping the connection knowing that they were not going to change and that the hurt would continue to come, regardless of whatever love they might actually feel.

Bringing it back to you, this is all to say:

**Whether or not this friend of yours can control their behaviors changes nothing about the way those behaviors affect you.**

You are NOT responsible for this person's mental/physical/social/emotional well-being, and definitely not if that responsibility is going to drag you down, which looks to be the case. On top of that, it seems yours is the only effort being made towards change, and they won't even acknowledge the toxicity you're witnessing.

Your friend, no question, needs help. But you can't be that help if there can't be a conversation. I guess you can make a solid effort to intervene. Ask their friends or family for support, if that'll help. If you don't want to come across as too harsh, talk about how hurt you've felt. If you think THAT won't fly, focus on how worried you are for them. Drive home that you want to be there for them through it all.

I have to say, some things may still remain difficult for you.  At 39 I have had to come to terms with the fact that going up and down stairs is going to be a no-no sooner rather than later... (amongst other things) by all means try, but don't make yourself feel bad because you ""just can't"".  

At 19 I could walk unaided, using a stick for distance. Now I struggle to walk AT ALL without crutches. I can barely stand....

So for example: someone could have very low verbal communication skills, but very high socialization abilities. They can read facial cues and pick up on social situations, but have difficulty communicating themselves. 

Someone may have hypersensitivity to sound and touch, and have difficulty with social situations, but be extremely verbose. 

Another person may have great socialization AND communication, but their executive functioning is in the tank. They can talk their way out of a paper bag, but couldn’t follow a recipe or remember where they put their keys if their life depended on it.

465,"OK, so I've been thinking a lot about this and I'm just going to tell you what worked for me that made me let go of a lot of the anger I felt towards people who are condescending to me.  Sorry it's so long.  I've been using a chair for 19 years, but I remember the early years and how I was so shocked and angry about how differently I was treated.  Eventually I realized that something had to change before I literally raged myself into an early grave.

Are you a white male?  The reason I ask is because for many white dudes, acquiring a visible disability is the first time in their lives that they deal with real discrimination, and unlike women or people of color, they don't really have a mental tool box to draw from to deal with it.  For example, when my mom goes to the hardware store male employees will often be patronizing to her (but well-meaning!).  This has been happening to her for years; we women are used to dealing with this type of stuff.  So when I landed in a wheelchair, being condescended to because of it wasn't my first rodeo.  If you're a white male it might be a bit more shocking to you.

Anyway.  For me, the way I learned to deal with the anger is something that may be a hard pill to swallow: You have to learn to be compassionate towards those who are being condescending and patronizing towards you.  You might think, ""Why should **I** be the one who has to be compassionate towards these fuckers?""  It's because these fuckers are ignorant of disability.  Like, *literally* ignorant.  Ninety percent of the able-bodied community has NO IDEA about disability -- NONE.  They don't know about wheelchairs, they don't know about TBI, they don't know about blindness, they don't know about living with Autism, they don't know about MS flare-ups...they don't know SHIT.

When it comes to disability, the vast majority of the able-bodied community is at the level of a first-grader.  But they think they are at least at the level of a high-schooler.  They are condescending to you because they THINK they know as much or more than you do about what's best for you.  But the reality, which you and I know very well, is that *we* are the experts (duh).  And you can't expect a first-grader to do algebra -- you can't expect able-bodied people to ""get it"".  They won't.  But they'll act like they do, and you have to accept this.

We are the parents and they are the condescending children who roll their eyes and think they know everything, and they act accordingly towards you.  And as the parent, you have two choices: You can sink to their level and let them get under your skin, or you can be an adult and rise above and know that when it comes to disability awareness, the world is still at the first-grade level.  It's unfortunate, but that's how it is.  You have to, paradoxically, treat them like children: guide them gently, but don't let them get away with shit that's not OK.  Set boundaries; be firm if needed.  Use a clear voice, and if they don't respond, use your loud voice.  Let them know who's in charge, but don't be mean.  Be confident and factual.

You have to build maturity and compassion.  It's hard, it sucks, and it shouldn't be this way, but it is.  The hardest part for me is knowing that on top of all the other disability shit I have to deal with -- pain, limitations, poverty, discrimination -- I also have to be the mature one, I have to be the one who *understands* the very people who hurt me.

483,"&gt;TL;DR: I am on disability. I have a learning disability (which is not specifically what I am on disability for... I think) and I need ongoing help with basic paperwork.

You say once here that you're on disability.

&gt; a roomie who SHOULD be on disability but isn't 

Your roommate sounds like they need help getting on disability.

&gt;I've lost my medical insurance for a long period of time and also haven't been able to handle pet appointments, eyecare stuff, hospital checkups, or basic paperwork such as SSI/disability. 

You said you were on disability in your TLDR, but here you say you need help getting a handle on paperwork such as SSI/disability. If you're on SSI, then you're probably on Medicaid. If you've been on SSDI for a while, you may be on Medicare.

&gt;We've been suffering financially and have been spending almost all our money on food. 

The Department of Workforce Services can help you get on food stamps.

&gt;When something else important comes up (recently blinds broke, landlord says I HAVE to have them.

If you are only receiving SSDI going forward, then there are no resources limits. If you are receiving SSI, then you should be automatically eligible for your state's version of Medicaid, so you may not have much to pay for the surgery.

Chances are that you had an interview with an SSI claims representative after you got your approval where they ask questions about if your living arrangements have changed or if you have any changes in income between the initial application and today. Hopefully, that person wrote down his or her phone number on the application.

515,"Pre-text: I recently had my leg amputated, after 3 years of dealing with limb salvage following an accident.   


I genuinely like the Dreamwork's ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series. Sure, they're for kids, but it legitimately has a good message of overcoming disability, especially in the first movie.  


Spoilers for those who haven't seen it: the main character loses his left leg below the knee (same amputation I have) early on in the first movie. He comes from a family of Vikings, where everyone is ""tough"", but instead he's weak but smart. He develops his own prosthetic. He eventually finds a rare dragon, that's supposedly ""untamable"" -- but the dragon is missing one of its tail fins, meaning it can't fly. The main character designs a prosthetic tail fin for the dragon as well, and is able to tame it.  


The main character's prosthetic leg, and his dragon's prosthetic tail fin, continue to be major plot points in the movie -- not simply forgotten, like disabilities in other shows (like the Marvel reference above -- War Hammer gets paralyzed, gets special robotic legs, and then everyone forgets he's disabled and it's never mentioned again). Instead, there's scenes where the prosthesis breaks, which causes conflict. Advances are made to the prosthesis in later scenes / movies.   


Not gonna lie, I've only been missing a leg for a little over a week, but I'm already planning a How to Train Your Dragon cosplay.

You should be proud of that GED.  I never once got the chance to use any of the three degrees I obtained, but I am proud of myself for making it that far.  One thing I've learned about pain in life, you can control it, but to do so can often mean an exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you still have a good support system?  A family that will listen?  Does your boyfriend understand everything?  So often doctor deal out diagnosis and treatment, but seldom does that treatment include support for loved ones.  As the disabled, we know what we are dealing with; and I'm sure we all know how difficult it can be to talk about.  Well, our loved ones deal with many of the same things.  It's one thing to endure the pain and know there is little you can do about it.  It is a whole other to watch someone be in pain and know there's nothing you can do about.

My sleeping isn't the best so no wonder I get to feeling run down.

Sorry to hear what all you are dealing with. That PTSD would be probably the worst of the bunch, and as you know mental health issues are the pits compared to peoples comprehension of them. 

My son's father and sisters were up for the 4th, and after being at my autistic son's house and eating food that while he didn't make it, he did pay for it. Wrote him and his brother emails telling them that they weren't being good sons and that they had been having to pay for some kind of daily home health aide to come to were he lives in FL. Apparently he has some sort of kidney problem (never mentioned by actual name so that my autistic boy who graduated from Medical Coding and billing with an A would understand. The other son says he has some kind of early dementia apparently. Well if that doc had been treating him for the last 60 years, I doubt that they would have come to that conclusion at all, as he acted like that the entire time we were married. Ask him a question and he would wring his hands (you would think those fingers would have fallen off by now), no eye contact, hemming and hawing and finally come out with an answer or kind of an answer. In 1-2 hours I could give any doc more insight into the ex (and not in a mean vendictive way either - I know he is mentally ill) that would help him with the problems he has. But any doc he has been to only has what the ex tells them and with his total lack of insight as to what problems he has, how does a psych doc even know where to start. But all these privacy laws has taken away the ability to have the second person's context. His sister see him one way, but they have never had to live with him as a husband or a father. My sons do their best, but beyond that, I don't think calling him everyday to check on him will be much help as all they will discuss is baseball scores or trades and that is all. Nor do either have money to chip in for this aid. Not my sons fault or his sisters fault that he didn't save for retirement.

I suspect this is part of why so many children are being diagnosised mistakenly for having autism as the doc for the most part is listening to mom and observing the child for what, 45 minutes? I can generally pick them out of the crowd and then I see other ones that aren't showing any signs or symptoms being called autistic. Eventually the pendulum will swing to some other disorder that everyone has.

I am sorry for what you are going through. If you just need a listening ears or small suggestions feel free to write. I started selling off many of my books so my husband wouldn't have to do that when I died. I didn't die, but it did become a job I could do parttime, and when the books got too heavy I started selling sewing patterns instead. I sew out of necessity or hobby although lately feel too tired to do much. So I have a little online business that takes up most of my 'good' hours in the day. My step-father suffered and died due to the 14 years of the effects of RA and I suspect he was going out of his head with boredom and frustration over not being able to provide for his family. I am never bored and I do help to provide for us along with the SSD check.

Yeah, I ended up with a free pair of leggings/jeans with the pocket stitching, but no pockets. Where am I supposed to keep my hankie at least? Okay, I am an old fashioned old lady and use hankies with crocheted lace on most of the edges. I started using them to get out of paying for facial tissue boxes and discovered they are actually softer and help keep me from getting sores around my nose in the winter. Just a little plug for them if you haven't tried them. I get mine at thrift stores, etc. and most look brand new, but I do wash them first anyhow. :)  Years ago we switched to using fabric instead of paper. Cloth napkins, rags to clean, hankies, etc. It saves some money which is good as I think most of us on disability are on limited incomes. I go through maybe one roll of paper towels a year if that.

615,"Well, it’s obvious why you’re struggling to find representation. I have never seen a sub as full of kind/helpful/empathetic people as the disability sub.  You come in acting like an asshole to people taking time out of their day to give you genuine, *helpful* advice that you asked for.

If you’re gonna do it on your own than go ahead.

If you were going to call a lawyer they don’t need to understand your whole case before they request your postponement because they don’t have enough time to adequately go over your file and represent you. That is a request more likely to be granted simply because it comes from a lawyer vouching for the fact that they need more time.

Also, a lot of these approvals come down to key words/phrases in explaining how the criteria for disability is met. Lawyers help with that as well.  The answer for why lawyers are helpful? Because legal situations require legalese and they are trained in that and you are not.  We just have experience to know how it goes with them, and how it goes without them. And gave advice knowing how much more likely it will go better for you if you pick up a lawyer.

You never had to like the advice or take it, but you’re just generally being a dick.  You’re telling me to go fuck myself for giving you good advice you asked for and then sayin “do whatever TF you want” when you rudely pushed on advice from every last person.

I get that your stressed but this is a community of people who don’t even know you but wanted to help you, and you’re spitting in the fact of that because you’re looking for a magical solution that doesn’t involve a lawyer even thought it’s cost free with the rest of their representation of your case.

You asked for advice based on the reality we’ve experienced. I tried to get approved without an attorney but with 30 doctors, extensive records, and even not walking or sitting up anymore AND being considered disabled by their own medical examiner, I was denied. A lawyer fixed that right up. So sorry you don’t like the advice you’re being given but we’re giving the best response we have, not just whatever advice you wanna hear.

&amp;#x200B;

It may be worth looking into getting a lawyer at this point to assist you with the state hearing in front of the judge.  However, if you've done all the leg work and are confident in your case, with the amount of medical records and diagnostics that you've presented, and know you've shown beyond a reasonable doubt that you are disabled, I would recommend not hiring one, as the amount they'll be taking for submitting your work is not worth it.  Having said that, I hired a lawyer for the final leg of my appeal, as I did not want to be rejected once again at the state level and have only myself to blame.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also recommend starting to keep all your medical records.  Keep everything from here on out.  Most hospitals only back up their records for 10-years and having hard copies of it all going forward can be so very important.  That's something I'm finding out now applying for DAC (Disabled Adult Child) benefits.  If you were disabled before age 22 and your parents are of retirement age, look into it.  But without those records, I'd have been up an unsanitary tributary without sufficient means of locomotion with regards to my case.

672,"Ok, so I see you went to the ER. I hope they actually can help you a little while you're in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a chronic pain patient myself, so I understand the daily non-stop nearly unbearable pain that comes with that, it's insanely difficult and sometimes hard to express, which is why I'm always glad when my wife comes with me, it's not just a bring the man thing, always. Granted, I will not for a second deny or brush off generations of sexism that's everywhere in the slightest. Just saying that sometimes, they ask others what they have seen because our spouses and s/o will notice things we think we're hiding, too. I do know that a lot of times doctors will talk through women, rather  than to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have a pain management center you go to and if not, getting a referral to one from the hospital or your primary care physician should be a priority. And if you do have one, it sounds like you need to schedule an appointment urgently, because obviously this course of treatment you're currently on isn't effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chronic, long-term pain is a difficult field, and many hospitals will see people coming in, especially at certain times of the day, complaining of pain, just to get narcotics. So any visit to the ER where the chief complaint is an invisible pain, they view it with skepticism. Which is unfortunate for those that actually do need treatment. But an ER visit for a CP patient should start with a call to their CP Doctor first, that way, they know you're going in, and if the hospital calls, they can verify everything and send over any needed information. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope they are able to give you some relief, a comforting hand, and listen to you. It's hard asking for help and then getting that as a response, it only aggravates and inflames the pain. I suggest taking along someone that knows your situation whenever possible, between the anxiety and autism, it's just a good idea to have someone with you to help calm and comfort you, keep your stress down. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: When you get home from the ER, contact your primary (or pain management specialist) for follow-up and re-evaluate your pain management plan. Bring a friend when you can!

The cats came with no training at all, but with encouragement, they've gradually decided that if it's daytime and anyone is not in the living room, the missing person needs to be escorted and meowed at until they return to the living room.

715,"Your post is incredible. I'd give it gold multiple times if I could.

Thank you, dearly, for your kind words. They really helped. You have no idea how much.

Lots of stuff to think over from what you wrote. (In a good way!) 

That's very good - yes to have a running chat with her. Right now I'm super anxious (I also have autism) and don't quite know what to say to her. I gave her his schedule (which I said she can modify however she wants like if she wants to take him to a new place etc.). I also packed a brand-new diaper bag full of everything he needs. And he has tons of toys and soooo many books - I even ordered more good ones. He loves books and I just want him to be happy. I made a bag of fun activities for him and her to do together. I picked out his clothes. (I love dressing him up)

So far the time I have with him today (it's the Nanny's first day so everything will be changing around!) is I get to snuggle up with him in my bed for nap time. &lt;3

I'm unfortunately unable to change him in bed anymore. I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis which has made it too painful to use my arms and hands. Plus my hips .... I just can't do the proper leaning movements. 

I hadn't really thought of a ""nanny cam"" as they call it lol, since I'm here while she is. But the alternative purpose of using a security cam that you suggested is actually a great idea. I have two smartphones and a tablet. It seems like that might be all I need plus an app?

The pictures thing is a great idea!!!! That would make my heart so happy!!! And maybe I *can* set up a play place in my room, although I'm not sure. 

It seems the nanny wants it to be just her and my son, because when I hear him asking to see me she tells him that no momma is in her room. Maybe I need to communicate with her that sometimes I'll leave the door open so I can read books to him in bed and spend special time with him.

Good idea. I'm trying to have a little area next to my bed getting started that I can easily grab activities from. It's a bit of a clutter though....hope I can figure it out.

Oh man yes the boredom....I gained over 100 pounds in a year on Prednisone. Sounds like you've had experience with it too. It's .... A good med for a while, but it turns evil lol.

I miss going outside with him for hikes and adventures the most, I think. Taking him to places where the kids can play in water. Making him delicious meals. Having our routines. Not having our routines has made me fall apart emotionally.....I just miss him. I miss him being the center of my world. (He still is in my heart)

I have no clue what personality of in-home carer I'm looking for. I guess I'll see who I match with. I do feel the exact loss you mentioned about loss of physical independence and the simultaneous loss of caring for my little boy. :( :(

My husband takes me to my therapist (who I've seen for over a year) once every two weeks. She helps a lot and is a rock in my life.

747,"I don't think I'm following what you're trying to communicate. You seem to go off on different train of thoughts in your reply which is hard to follow because it's one big block of text 

First
I read the thread this post was inspired by and it seems like the person was legitimately upset about a customer leaving a mess for whatever reason. You threw out disability as a possible reason for it(there were no indicating information from his post about disabilities but it's an acceptable possible explanation to hold). When the person reseponded that they did not think the mess left behind was due to a disability (based on his observation of said customer), you called them an abelist for using the wrong word and (seemingly) ignorant for not validating your viewpoint about invisible disabilities(because you have some) when the subject matter had nothing to do with it. They even explained that if there was an indication that the customer was having problems, they would have helped right away and without question.

To be frank, you're responses there comes off- putting. Like you're more interested in hijacking his point, turning it into your own issue, and playing the role of an advocate rather than listening and accepting a valid viewpoint of someone else's frustration. Talk about dismissal and invalidation of another's experience.


Second.
Yes, I agree with you that people have physical limitations due to age and other medical conditions that can make their behavior appear lazy to those not in the know and may require more patience. This does take more time time. That wasn't the point. As OP(from that comment) mentioned, if they noticed that a disability was involved, he would have been understanding and accomodatng.  I think you twisted their point completely from being upset at customer who left a mess behind to somehow them needing to have a lot more patience toward the situation because the customer could potentially be disabled?...  What?

To clarify my point.
I am not disagreeing with you on convenience.  I'm saying that it is perfectly acceptable to assume that  people can be inconsiderate out of ""character"" rather than disability.  This happens a lot!(probably a whole lot more than mishaps due to disabilities across the general population). The frustration that comes from that is also  completely understandable. I don't care if the person is a five year old, in a wheel chair, or an elderly person. People are expected to have a level of decency about them when out in public. Sure, some behaviors could be understood and dealt with at approriate level(like having a chron's attack in public), but people still need to have some level of social etiquete in a general sense. You work at a job you seem to really like and don't mind picking up books after others. It's not a big deal to you or your co-workers and that's totally fine. Not everyone is in the same boat. People have bad days and sometimes don't have the patience for people who come off disrespectful. I'm sure you've had those days as well. They may still deliver good customer service, but that doesn't mean they can't express their negative feelings about an experience they had at work. Venting is part of processing (as you're doing now) and it is needed for good mental health on occasion. Don't shut that down for people just because you're experience doesn't match theirs.

Final note
Going back to disabilities. When I said communicate about your disability, I by no means meant disclose details about your conditions(not sure how you came to that conclusion). I meant let people know that it may be difficult for you to do something so they can make things for you if necessary. If you expect people to just know that you have an invisible disability with silence, you're setting yourself up for a hard time because people will hold you to the same standards as everyone else in capacities that may not be realistic.  For example, I ask my tall co-workers for help when reaching for things high up(they help). If a ride share car parks far away, I give them a call to let them know that it may take me a longer to walk to their car because I have trouble walking(they wait). i  let bosses know my poor balance or muscle soreness from something as simple as working out can make it hard for me to lift heavy catering equipment(they have me carry lighter things). Giving people that information is absolutely necessary to be safe and give a pleasant experience to everyone involved.",,,,Present-Hour,,,1561949166,t5_2qhe8,t3_c7hfyp,t1_esg0r02,2,1571177955,0,0,esgcl6a,disability,,,,,

I hope you can imagine and get it, and i'm sorry to explain it badly. I just never ever even once having trouble navigating it.

Are you serious? Way to assume things. Lots of wheelchairs don't fold. Parents might have bad backs. Spastic kids can be hard to carry. Also, kids in diapers have diaper bags with diapers and wipes and often extra clothes and who knows what else.

My body reacts BADLY if I push myself too hard or try to accelerate the plan too fast. The biggest thing for me was learning that I have to take baby baby baby steps and always stop while I'm still feeling like I can do more.

In my case, it always hurts, so I've had to learn what hurt is okay hurt and what hurt is stop right now hurt. A lot of it is just being very sensitive to what your body is telling you and continuing to test things out.",,,,Yoyodomino,,,1564003197,t5_2qhe8,t3_ch2j4j,t3_ch2j4j,1,1572797693,0,0,eus4nvy,disability,,,,,

2. You're the only one in here defending a woman with obvious issues with regards to things like racism. If that is okay with you, and you think I should just take it, just say so. I disagree, and that's okay.

3. Yes, I was harsh. Personally, I think anyone who is intelligent enough to recognize her own issues should be trying to solve them. That is all. 

4. If you think someone who is clearly eating themselves to death should not be encouraged to get help for that is okay, then I guess I cannot help you, and I also cannot help you if, after I simply said I clearly am not a person who needs to be around someone who is promoting and being enabled to live a life of morbid obesity being okay, then well...good luck on My 600 lb life with the rest.

I am part of the oldest millennials (so much so I don't always relate) and I have to say it's here for me and has been for quite a few years.

Also, I guess I'm damn lucky my mom always told me, ""Life's a bitch then you die."" Like seriously since 4 or 5 years old.

&gt;Ever try to go grocery shopping and refrain from buying anything with white flour in it?

I do this all the time and I don't say this to be sassy.

I buy whole foods, fruits and vegetables, whole grains like oats and rice, proteins like quinoa, eggs, yogurt, chicken, fish, lentils and beans. I get fats from nuts and seeds and avocados. I shop at Aldi to keep prices as low as possible and I buy from local farmers, too.

I batch cook and freeze. I cook in the morning when I have the most energy. I prep sitting. I keep a supply of instant oatmeal and bars for  when I can't do much more than get out of bed. Smoothies and nutritional drinks and supplements.

I love to cook, I just can't always. Like I said, I'm not trying to be sassy I genuinely want to be helpful.

Brainstorming:

You have lots of documentation, and those police visits prove you are being harassed.  Get copies and put together a list of all the things you can remember - dates and witnesses like police, front office person, etc. Ask the nice neighbors to give you a short statement of support (I've lived by this person for X years without issue) Also keep notes about the stuff that keeps happening (assuming he's still there).  Then you've got to get it to someone who can help. 

You said it's a complex for elderly and disabled. The person in the front office can't be the top of the food chain. Figure out who's above the desk person and just keep going until you find someone helpful.

Have you filed a police report? Wouldn't hurt to flip the script, and they're already aware of what he's doing to you.

  Ask yourself if its truly the communication barrier, or if you simply dont gel as friends.  Dont force yourself to be friends just because she has the same disability you do.   Forcing a friendship that isnt there would be more ableist than accepting that shes a different person with different interests, etc.

915,"Hi, i am an ex mobility dealership service manager - meaning my job was to oversee all repairs done to mobility vehicles as well as costs, upgrades, customization's, repairs, etc.... 

So there are a few things you need to know before actually going into looking for a vehicle. you need the dimensions and weight of the actual chair itself this will limit your options on what vehicles you will be available to use.

the reason for this is the different ways that each of these vehicles are modified for example Toyota's typically have the highest roof. where as dodges in general are smaller do to costs, less materials less cost.

Also just stay away from any mv-1 or mobility ventures...i wouldn't touch them with a 10 ft pole.

There's literally so much more to finding a good fit for them, i would recommend sticking with a van with a sliding door, the reason for this is parts and repair costs  in relation to other vehicles which will inevitably be a issue later on. 

dodge chrysler toyota those are the three main vans, due o repair costs, parts availability, and overall reliability. chevy's are ok but they are bulky and aren't always necessary because of there size. not sure where you are but if you don't buy new but used verify chassis because vehicles in snow areas may not have undercoating put on and will have severe rust due to salting on roads.  

There's so much to say on this but to start you need the chair dimensions and weight. once you have that go to a dealership and measure out what vehicles fit those dimensions and then go from there. feel free to ask if you have more questions.",,,,jfprobiz,,,1563991592,t5_2qhe8,t3_ch2lml,t3_ch2lml,3,1572781833,0,0,euraeu2,disability,,,,,

919,"I was thinking about this heavily last night. How easy would it be to say hey amazon if you want to keep that 0$ in taxes thing hire 10,000 people on SSDI to do sedentary work no more than 20 hours a week at a salary w benefits rate comparable to the median salary in that city.

Not saying this would solve everyone's issues, but I have a marketing degree and I'm never going to work a 40 hour work week again.

Doing a little prep and thinking about (or writing down) ways in which your disorder affects you on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis can be helpful.
It's easy to brush off difficulties we've been dealing with our entire lives but you have to remember to respond to the questions in the context of normal behavior. For example, if asked how severely a symptom effects your life it may be tempting to answer ""not very"" if you've been dealing with it a while and are sort of ""used"" to if but if it really keeps you from doing the things you would want to do then make sure to answer accordingly.

974,"I’m 29 and never been paid besides my current job as overnight carer to my own husband. I’ve tried disability job seek services at least 3 times and all that got me was volunteering  volunteering volunteering. That’s 4 hour shifts standing for free. My time limit on standing while medicated is still half an hour.
And now I’m just recently married, own a car, house with mortgage and two cats to feed. I can’t afford to waste my joints for free anymore. Volunteering is now insulting. But it’s what everyone screams at a disabled person when they are looking for a job in my town. And all of it is on your feet for hours unpaid slave crap that disabled people can’t do anyway. The free sit down jobs that disabled people are screaming for still require years of experience, no training because they expect you to already know everything. For a free job. That most if not ALL applicants would just be using for experience. And you can’t gain more experience elsewhere for this job because you will get doors slammed in your face and be sent to do retail and resthomes because ‘my cousins dogs sons friend has same disability and loved it’. Been there, tried that unpaid and needed DAYS to recover, so fail. 
And none of the jobs chucked at you are anywhere near the dream jobs you actually want, to get them you have to move cities. With what money???
Do they honestly think ALL disabled people want to sit in brain dead slog jobs for decades with barely any pay if pay at all? I see them cleaning maccas since I was a kid. Never had a promotion, never tried anything new, never seen them do anything else. Breaking News: not all disabled people want that.

977,"I became a wheelchair user when my son was a toddler and had another pregnancy 10 years later.   With my son, I had a lot of anxiety about going out with him by myself,  but around the house it really wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.   He was old enough to use a toddler bed and often slept with us so I didn't have to deal with a crib.  The changing table was too difficult to use so we switched it out with a table that I could roll under.  He was old enough to walk which was very helpful too.

My second pregnancy was unexpected.  We decided not to try for more because I was worried about passing on my disease and I worried about how it would affect my health.   When I fell pregnant,  we decided to have her anyway.  It took a toll on my body and I had hyperemesis gravidarum,  which was unrelated to my disability,  but it was pretty hard on me.  It is hard to say how it would have turned out if I didn't have hg, since throwing up constantly would have sucked even if I was ab.   It was also a lot harder to transfer and peeing twice as much is more difficult with a catheter.   

Since I was new to parenting a newborn from a wheelchair,  I tried to do some research .  I was surprised by the lack of accessible baby gear and the lack of access in the hospital.   After some trial and error,  I decided that I would mount a bouncer to my wheelchair to carry her in and use a wrap when we were out.  I have seen strollers for wheelchair users,  but I have never used one.    I also found an adjustable height high chair that I could lower to the height I would need.

We planned on my husband taking 12 weeks of paternity leave to help me out after she was born.   I also interviewed a nanny in case I needed some help after that.   Under normal circumstances,  I try to be independent,  but I had to swallow my pride and accept help.   Unfortunately,  I suffered a uterine rupture at 33w, but it was a result of my genetic condition,  not being a wheelchair user. 

If do choose to get pregnant,  my advice would be to plan as much as possible before you get pregnant.   Not every Obgyn and birthing center is wheelchair friendly.   It really is something you will have to check out yourself.     I would also plan on being less mobile and needing the wheelchair more.

1068,"Disclaimer: This is based on my experiences with chronic pain and fatigue (which hasn't been narrowed down to a specific diagnosis at this stage) which leaves me mostly (but not entirely) in bed all day, and as of right now my only medications is a hormone supplement I take via a gel I rub into my back daily. My other disabilities don't really impact my medicine taking, so there's no point going into that stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

personally, I keep my medicines in the bathroom since no matter how bad my pain is, Im always able to go to the bathroom at some point during the day, be it first thing in the morning or before bed, or any time in between. If I get to the point where I can't manage that, well its time for me to go to hospital. My routine is head to the bathroom, deal with my medication, do whatever else I was gonna do in the bathroom, and then get back into bed.

&amp;#x200B;

For me I find it hard to remember but I always check with the missus before I go to bed. Though if my medication had to be done at an exact time, I would set an alarm on my laptop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't find it excessively physically difficult in terms of administering my dose (as its in a bottle with a hand sanitizer like pump on it and doesn't require any complex motions) though the pain of reaching around to my back sucks. And the amount of energy it takes to get to the bathroom is difficult for me, and I can't exactly do it in the bedroom since I have to wash my hands after so that can't really be fixed. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my exact case as of right now, your drone idea wouldn't work for me. Though in the years to come I'll likely be on various other medications to deal with my unmanaged issues, in which case, if it were affordable, I would look into it. But considering my financial troubles it wouldn't be necessary when alarms and keeping medications close by is sufficient. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats all not to say its a bad product, I just wanted to give my 2c on how it would work for me. I imagine it would be awesome for some people, as its a brilliant idea and could be very helpful if done right.

1089,"I commented because I have a different perspective to share and because I saw something others might not; your apparent contempt for your friend and her disability. You're entitled to judge her, of course, that's your right as a free-willed human. I'm just saying that your post reads as though you're talking about someone you fucking hate. And now you seem completely unwilling to read over your own words and consider that you might not be capable of being a good friend to her, given how you look down on her. I'm not making any assessment of whether or not she deserves to be looked down on. Maybe she does, I don't know. I'm just saying that you sound like you detest her and think she's a lazy, worthless human being. Even more reason to walk away from that relationship; you're not capable of supporting her, and you perceive her as a racist. So...leave. You're offended by her personal prejudices, so it's not going to be a healthy relationship. You feel like she's a toxic influence on you. Seems like a pretty clear answer to me. I never implied that she should be excused for treating you badly, and I advised you to walk away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't defending her, I was just calling your attention to your tone when you speak about her, and how it sounds like neither of you are suitable for this friendship. You look down on her for not helping herself. She might or might not be capable of doing that. I'm just saying that, as someone looking at the situation from an unemotional perspective, I couldn't have YOU in MY life--just like it sounds like you can't have her in yours. You speak like she's a bad person because she doesn't do anything to help herself, and doesn't do the chores or daily activities you think she should be able to.

&amp;#x200B;

Is she capable of doing them? I don't know. And neither do you. All I'm doing is pointing out that you're making moral judgements about her, and that if you look down on her, regardless of the reason, then yes, you should leave the relationship. Your attitude will hurt her just like she's hurting you. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Thoughts? What would you all do? What do you think of the situation I just described? "" 

&amp;#x200B;

You didn't ask for ""tell me I'm right and that I'm a better person than she is and I should cut her out of my life."" You asked for thoughts. You asked for strangers to tell you what they think of the situation. I answered the questions you asked. If you don't want to hear it because you don't like it, you should have asked a different question. You should been honest and said that you're not looking for any thoughts at all, you're looking for people to tell you you're right. Well, obviously everyone is going to tell you you're right, of course they are. Because you obviously SHOULD cut ties. I'm just answering from an alternative angle. If it offends you, next time don't ask an open-ended question, because not everyone thinks the same way.",,,,CDN_Bookmouse,,,1562558379,t5_2qhe8,t3_c8lo15,t1_et8ij1q,1,1571668631,0,0,et8jiko,disability,,,,,

Do they just keep their pills box close to the bed and/or wheelchair and use existing smartphone apps that send a push notification when it’s time to take meds?

This is going to vary a LOT depending on how mobile the person is, their visual impairments, and memory. I have no household mobility issues or visual impairments but I do use phone reminders.

1099,"So, when I was first diagnosed with my ultimately disabling chronic condition five years ago, the guy I'd been dating for about a year at the time dumped me. The DAY I got the diagnosis. And I came to Reddit asking for people to tell me about their amazing partners who were there for them despite adversity.  So I feel for you.

Fast forward to today and I'm six months away from marrying an amazing man who got it from the start. Did I meet other assholes on the way to meeting my SO? I'd be lying if I said I didn't. There were guys that it scared away from the start (good riddance, why waste my time?) and even one guy who waited nine months before dumping me for it.

But on my third date with my now fiancé, we stayed up all night just talking. At 2:00a, an alarm went off on my phone. My overnight medication alarm. Understandably, he asked why I had an alarm set for 2:00 in the morning and I figured that was probably an organic opportunity to explain my unique situation. He didn't bat an eye. We continued to talk for hours more. About my health, about the ""baggage"" he shared with me, about what we wanted to do on our next date...

In the time we've been together, he has never made me feel badly for having limitations. He has never blamed me for them. He has never held them against me. We had to leave an awesome concert just last month because I wasn't feeling well. And he didn't even seem disappointed to miss the finale, because all he was concerned about was me.

There are assholes out there. I'm sorry that your ex is one of them. But a guy who would abandon you that easily sure as hell wouldn't stick around when life throws shit your way (as it does to us all from time to time). And don't you think you deserve someone who will give you the same ""through thick and thin"" commitment you've promised them?

There are also amazing people out there. People who will drop everything to support you. People who will value everything you have to offer. People who will accept you, faults and all (and for the record, your CP ain't a fault). Take your time, keep your heart open but use your head to weed out those who shouldn't gain access.

1106,"So true. I'm in exactly this situation. I had the unfortunate experience of living with a roommate who grew up rich and was shocked to learn that most people live that way day today everyday. She was shocked that not everyone had the same opportunities that she did. She is not rich anymore, she just grew up in a rich household and she told me that learning to live like a normal person was culture shock to her. She would constantly complain about how hard it was when it was pretty much a normal daily existence to the average person.

 Needless to say I no longer live with her because we could not understand each other and honestly she drove me insane with her constant complaining. She did not seem to understand that because I am on disability and food stamps that I cannot afford name brand food. I learned the hard way to stop giving her my food stamp card because she would go spend pretty much the entire thing in one day on stuff we couldn't afford like name brand everything and the expensive deli cheese that's like $6 a pound. 

She would ask for and then demand my food stamp card and when I told her no she called me a terrible person.

1161,"Try many different activities like swimming, biking or gym work and see which is the least painful. Almost every sport is adaptable, so you just need to find one that fits with your current condition. There are chair exercises if standing is painful. I avoid walking for exercise due to pain afterward. Working with a physiotherapist or at a specialized facility may help you identify possible activities you can enjoy and support you with them. The intensity may need to be less than an athlete but you will be healthier. Don't be afraid to use adaptive exercise equipment or mobility aids to facilitate your goals.

For fatigue, try and exercise when you have the most energy. Mid morning is generally best physically for me, but I will be wiped for the rest of the day. For that, I do it after work to ensure my performance will not be disadvantaged. Also, breaking up activities may improve fatigue. For example, find an activity, do a session in the morning for 30 minutes and than repeat it when possible. 

Also, most weight gain is caused diet problems, so work that out with a doctor. Those online calorie counters are not accurate for disabled people because if you must stay immobile, you obviously need to consume a lot less or if there are muscle tone differences. Also, obesity assessment is different because less muscle from immobility means you might have too much body fat despite having a normal weight. It is really best to talk to your doctor for weight concerns. You might even notice small improvements in symptoms, not that you would be cured or that the disease is your fault.",,,,WATERFRIES101,,,1563941087,t5_2qhe8,t3_ch2j4j,t3_ch2j4j,2,1572728295,0,0,euofkdr,disability,,,,,

1198,"Hold up a minute. Based solely on your title and original comment nothing illegal is happening. 

A **security deposit** is standard with rental housing for any person regardless of disability or animals living in the home. It is a one time fee paid when a tennant signs a rental agreement or lease with a landlord. It is returned to the tennant at the end of the rental agreement assuming there is no damage beyond reasonable wear and tear. 

**Pet deposits** and **pet rent** are standard with apartments that are pet friendly.

Assistance animals can be either service animals or emotional support animals.

Landlords cannot charge pet fees (pet rent or pet deposits) but still can ask for security deposits and charge for damages caused by the assistance animal.

The bottom line is if you are reasonable with your request, it does not cause undue hardship on the landlord or another tennant, you live in a rental unit covered under the Fair Housing Act* your landlord cannot deny your assistance animal and cannot charge you more than any other tennant that doesn't live with animals. 

--

1208,"It's a so so for me. I don't use aids yet but I will need to soon enough. Many members of my family also use them. 

Interactions with people who have aids can become needlessly complicated due to a few assholes. 

For example my local supermarket has a blacklist of patrons not permitted to use the avalable mobility scooters becuase they ram people with them and run over people's feet out of sheer spite. I have had a fairly annoying elderly man ram into me with the store scooter, twice. If that happened to me now it could do some serious damage so I get nervous around heavy mobility aids. An electric wheelchair wouldn't concern me but I don't want to be ran over by some asshole so passing by a mobility aid in tight quarters is kinda worrying. 

I have also had an elderly woman with a walking stick misplonk her stick and fall on top of me, again if this happend now that would be a serious issue. There is also countless times I have been hit in the shin with a waking stick or had someone push it into my foot. 

Like I don't want to be hurt. A few bad apples can ruin the bunch sometimes and there is no way to tell by looking at you if your an absolute nutter who will use your disability equipment like some forcible right of way generator. 

A mobility scooter could seriously wound someone, same for a walking stick.

I got an electric wheelchair about 6 years ago and i use it when i need it.  It's an ezlite chair.  It's heavy, but folds up the size of a suitcase and can be packed away for when i don't need it (which can be for months). Or it fits into the trunk of a car and can be taken anywhere with me.  I have to have my boyfriend lift it though.  But it's saved me from being stuck and left out multiple times.  

I used to have alot more issues about using it but honestly.

1223,"Start with DADs, the Texas Department on Aging.  They can help with home care if he's bedbound and Medicaid eligible.  Call them and get the paperwork started--it's slow (months).  If he's nursing-home eligible Medicaid can pay for that.  For in-home care there's a waiting list of around six months.  They need to come to your home and make an assessment.

To be Medicaid eligible, he has to have an income below a certain maximum (around $19k, but check that number, it may be off) and less than $2000 in assets, not including a car and house.  Most people living on social security can qualify, and they only count his income, not yours.

I assume he's already getting social security benefits?

It's a frustrating and very slow process.  If you can afford it, you can get an agency (or hire an individual) to come in and help with home care--bathing, cooking and feeding, toileting, and home cleanup.  That's running around $22/hr, with a general minimum of 3-4/hrs a day, 3 days a week.  If you hire an individual you can probably do it cheaper, but they can be less dependable (car trouble, sick kids, etc.)

DADs can also get you benefits for adult day care, I think, and respite care (they will take him for a few days so you get a break.)

Try calling some local caretaking companies and elderly charities and see if they have any suggestions for you.  Sheltering Arms is a Houston charity that might be able to help.

You can also try Meals on Wheels to deliver daily meals.  

The hospital where he was treated has social workers who can help with advice, so call them and ask.  You can get food at the local food banks, but I know you really just need help with caretaking, and there isn't much of that around.  You might try calling some local churches and see if they can either help or direct you to help.  

For that matter, call the Alzheimer's society local office.  He may not have dementia, but those folks are intimately familiar with available services and could advise you.  Try one of their support group meetings too--it's help for caregivers, and you need all the support you can get.

There are also geriatric care managers out there (google) who know the ins and outs of benefits.  It costs money, but it might be worth it for a consultation.

You are in a bleak situation, and you and your dad have my deepest sympathy.

Or you need to have your doctor fill out a section on a form to be enrolled.","[{'start': 21, 'end': 31, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

1248,"I can't really help with this because I am not employed myself.  I am on ODSP.  However, since my disability involves chronic pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia it is a hidden or invisible disability so I can make a few points that might be of interest.

Getting help with my chronic pain has been a real nightmare because doctors - understandably - don't want to prescribe anything that might be addictive.  The problem is that because my illness is hidden, they can't actually know how often I am in pain and how much it prevents me from doing.  It is in my nature to try to hide my weakness and appear well when in public but this seems to backfire when seeking treatment.  My last doctor actually had the nerve to inform me that I am usually alright when in fact for a very long time I had been in severe pain for a long time leading up to that appointment.  I even asked if it would help if I video taped myself when I am feeling bad so that he can see the difference and he laughed it off.

I know this wasn't really what you were looking for, but I thought I would add my 2 cents about how hard it can be to be believed even by your own doctors when an illness is invisible or hidden.  The worst part is when they try to attribute the problem to depression.  I could go on about the lack of logic behind this but I know it's not really what you're looking for.  I just wanted to share that if it will make any difference at all.

1251,"I definitely feel you, OP. I don't have children but I've gone from a working university student to being essentially housebound and barely able to keep myself fed with basic chores done. It's been four years and I still haven't finished unpacking from when I moved in. I feel like a burden on society (on financial assistance now) and like a garbage person in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's something you'd be able to do and I don't want to pry too much, but if you're able, I highly recommend my favourite pastime: video games. You can get out of the house without leaving it, in some games you can join groups or guilds where you can feel like you're contributing to something, and generally get some entertainment to keep you from losing your mind. As a huge bonus, you can discover games that are great to play with/in front of children, and age-appropriate educational games to teach your kid to play. If he's too young, they can still entertain him while sneaking a bit of learning in as well. Being familiar with the hobby will definitely be helpful when your kid is older and will inevitably start playing them alone. You'll be teaching your child digital literacy, and familiarizing yourself with a different use for the computer. Basically you can have like an interactive Sesame Street to enjoy together, and as your kid grows up you can get them playing on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a whole world of games out there--thousands of worlds, in fact. You can find ANY kind of game based on your ability and interests. So I recommend you sign up for Steam and get shopping! I'd be more than happy to help you find something to get started, and my roommate works with children so I could get some recommendations. He does exactly what I'm talking about--playing ""with"" them even if they're too young to understand more than colours and noises. It's very stimulating and, like I said, some ninja education. Not to mention taking a child off your husband's hands for a while ;)

&amp;#x200B;

What's more, as you improve at games you'll get a sense of growth and achievement. There are loads of games that can be educational for YOU as well, and improve your computer skills. If you need to look at working from home at some point, being comfortable on the computer will be a huge boost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another option you could look at is taking some free courses online in programs like MS Office suite, Photoshop, Sony Vegas, all kinds of computer skills that you can practice right where you are. And you'll be building skills that you could at least hope to use one day to work from home. Even if that might not be realistic or possible, it's a great goal. You would also have the knowledge you help or teach your husband a thing or two. My local library provides access to online courses, and there are a ton of free sites with modules for all kinds of programs. I think it would give you something to work towards that would definitely help ease those uselessness feelings. Again, even if you don't feel like working from home would be a possibility in the future, you can still work towards the goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, being familiar with common programs means you'll be able to continue teaching your child to use them. Reading and math and such are great, but these days being technologically literate is just as important.

&amp;#x200B;

If nothing else, games for kids of X age, games you might like based on your interests, and online courses will provide you with a few hours of Googling.

1253,"The thing is I wouldn’t have to have been pushed past my boundaries if they had set up reasonable accommodations. Also, just because I personally pushed past my boundaries doesn’t mean they shouldn’t have had these accommodations? 

And with the chairs things,hopefully that wouldn’t happen, but they’d be labeled (like the priority seats on a bus), but if you needed it you’d just ask “excuse me, can I please have that seat” and like 85% percent if the time, they say yes. No need to investigate if they’re disabled or not. 

Your comparison to poor members and members with sound/crowd issues is a little irrelevant as this issue could reasonably be fixed, unlike the sounds and amount of people.

Right, I get what you're saying. I live in a smaller town with a pretty low cost of living so it's not as common but most people my age do at least have a roommate or two


My disability manifests as depression, a metric ton of anxiety and, in extreme cases, panic attacks. Social anxiety and needing a routine to keep myself calm are the big ones. Like I can socialize but the toll it takes on me mentally and physically can be debilitating if I'm not careful. Then there's the hypothyroidism which honestly should be considered a disability in and of itself. It's wreaked havoc on my concentration and physical stamina. I can go out do things just like most able bodied people but I have to be careful how I use my spoons or I will literally collapse. I do a pretty good job managing it all though and I've had two relationships in my life and neither of them were seriously affected by my disability or illness. I've learned a lot about how to adapt and am always trying my best to minimize the impact my disability has on others and, while I can't do a lot physically or financially, I'm always my partners biggest supporter emotionally. One of my partners actually had pretty severe cerebral palsy and I was her caretaker when we were together (this was before my hypothyroidism came into play) so I've definitely got that part down. I have no worries at all about supporting and understanding a partner, it's finding someone to look past my stuff that seems insurmountable at times.


I'm the same way about talking about my disability. I'm completely open to tell anybody anything they want or might need to know but there is so much more to me than my disability.


Exactly. In my head I may feel like the jobless, disabled loser sometimes but I never come across that way to others. I've worked hard for many years to get where I am through counseling and various other treatments and medication and I've accomplished a lot. It may not seem like a lot to some people but it's a lot to me. Ten years ago I would never have even thought I'd be in a place to even be having this conversation with someone. Honestly I didn't even think I'd be alive. But not only have I made a ton of progress on my disability, I'm a very accomplished guitar player and for the short amount of time I've been able to do any work I've been a damn good teacher as well. Currently my goals are to save enough money to buy a car so I don't have to rely on others for transportation and hopefully from there I can go to school. At the same time I'm working hard on getting my disability to the point where it's manageable enough that I can work and afford to live independently and also working on that ever elusive confidence, which I am making some strides in.",,,,anotherthrowaway625,,,1562349834,t5_2qhe8,t3_c94p7u,t1_esyexz2,1,1571501656,0,0,esyuh5y,disability,,,,,

Calling your doctor's office is definitely a great idea, &amp; you should explain what is going on to either the receptionist or nurse (I often end up explaining things to both) and ask if you should come in sooner your next scheduled appointment (that is, if you already have one).

If this is similar to what you experienced with your other foot, it might give you peace of mind to go to the ER or urgent care. Otherwise, based on my own experiences, the ER &amp; urgent care are unequipped to handle anything chronic.

I was 347 lbs and am working on losing the weight myself so I've put in a significant amount of research into trying to turn my weight around and its difficult. There are no easy ways out of not feeling pain, but 80% of this is diet. Considering your current health issues you would need to take the time to find out what the amount of calories you need to maintain your weight are first you do this by counting calories and taking your weight, considering your metabolism may have slowed down. this would take time to do and effort, after you have figure out  what your maintenance calories are, which may take some time. you can then start to analyse your diet needs and exercise. as far as exercise is concerned i would try to find a yoga regiment for yourself considering you would be able to slowly move your body around and adjust yourself with the pain. moving in general, when you are sedentary even if its just moving your arms with or without weight it burns calories. you start at 5-10 min a day and add a minute everyday or every other day or every week. what ever your body is telling you what you can or can't do.",,,,jfprobiz,,,1564011147,t5_2qhe8,t3_ch2j4j,t3_ch2j4j,2,1572808029,0,0,eusnzt4,disability,,,,,

1361,"Hey there, fellow member of the My Body Hates Me Club. I’ve been using a cane and a walker for quite a few years now, and I’ve been contemplating getting a wheelchair for at least a year.

I’ve struggled a lot with feeling guilty and ashamed of needing to rely on any kind of assistive device or aid. Fear and embarrassment are the biggest things holding me back from using a wheelchair. Inside, I feel like I don’t deserve to use one, because I “look fine” by society’s standards.

You know what I say? Fuck it. If I have things to do or get invited somewhere, and my cane/walker/wheelchair helps me attend said function safely, then I should be able to use it without fear of harassment. That’s my business, no one else’s.

If someone wants to show their ass, let them show it. I’ll cane bash their shins, or flip ‘em the bird and roll over their foot. What kind of person thinks they’re entitled to explanation or “proof” of disability from a complete stranger?!

If you’re looking for a less aggressive way to handle things... I have heard of making business cards with basic info on them and silently handing them to people if they begin to bother you. Ex: “This parking permit is legal. I have a neurological condition called POTS. I am at risk of syncope if upright for too long. Yes, that’s a real condition. My wheelchair is necessary for my safety. Please kindly refrain from harassing me further.” Something along those lines.",,,,sprinkl3kitt3n,"hEDS, MDD, hyperPOTS, SAD",,1563610881,t5_2qhe8,t3_cffo8q,t3_cffo8q,3,1572460060,0,0,euac9ue,disability,,,,,

I cannot, however, bring him into a store that isn't pet friendly or something like that, that's only for trained service animals. I know less about getting service animals because it's a much more complex process (and expensive) and at this time I don't think I require one. 

But from what you described, I believe you would qualify for an ESA as long as you can afford to adopt and care for an animal, but of course that's for your doctor to decide. I got my pupper from a shelter so he wasn't expensive, but food, very bills, and grooming add up (I cut his hair and bathe him myself but it's such a long and painful process idk why I put myself through it lol) and sometimes it's difficult for me to get outside to let him do his business. Keep in mind ESAs don't have any special training, so if you want a dog to help you with daily tasks you'll probably want a service dog.

I originally disagreed with the meat of your post, tried to explain why and also tried point out that your assumptions about people's anger may have been misplaced and was an overraction(the way you responded to the user I mentioned was just wrong and so hypocritical).

As for you responses, you indicated that you didn't understand where my conclusions were coming from. I gave you an example from those comments to help draw a connection while also expanding my points or refuting yours.  There is no stalking or fake accounts( I don't care enough about strangers on the net for that shit). You said that you wanted a discussion and asked me to back up my points(that's how discussions work). However you seem to miss points, read way too much into things emotionally,  draw the wrong conclusions, and get very defensive when disagreements <URL>en kind of play the victim.  

I'm not going to continue this. You said you wanted a discussion but based on how you've been responding it's clear that you can't handle discussions with opposing view points without blowing a vein.  I think what you actually wanted was validation and blank agreements about those people being wrong(They weren't. Their points and experiences were actually very valid... Although, sending you threats is way out of line). This has become way too broken down to be useful and you're becoming too unhinged for me to even bother.","[{'start': 1399, 'end': 1404, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

1451,"&gt; unless I can pull my wheelchair up to the exact right angle

Yes, this. If the bathroom is big enough to manouver around the side of the toilet, sure you could flick the lid back down. If you can stand or have long arms that's another option. But the way some bathrooms are laid out, reaching over the bowl to flick a lid down from a seated position is just not happening. Sometimes it's hard enough to reach the flush! And I have great hand function, someone with less would definitely struggle.

Yes, this. If the bathroom is big enough to manouver around the side of the toilet, sure you could flick the lid back down. If you can stand or have long arms that's another option. But the way some bathrooms are laid out, reaching over the bowl to flick a lid down from a seated position is just not happening. Sometimes it's hard enough to reach the flush! And I have great hand function, someone with less would definitely struggle.

1452,"Hey man, I just want to throw in my two cents because I have a disability that's very similar to yours. In fact my doctor would commonly get CP and my form of muscular dystrophy confused. We share some similar challenges in that our body simply can't do certain things and although that does seem unfortunate on the outside it is an invitation to do things differently, and to learn about things differently. I see that you're kind of hamstrung on the idea of masculinity and showing off that side of yourself, whether to be more comfortable with yourself or to maybe to attract other people. I would argue that masculinity is a superficial term and that to be hung up on something like that will only hold you back. Try not to think of things like masculinity or femininity as if they are two sides of a coin.  If you want to be completely serious about this, everybody is on a spectrum from one side to the other. I think what you should focus on is primarily things that interest you and following that path as far as you can go.  What are those things? Well that's up to you to find and to figure out.  What really attracts people and what really reflects confidence it's somebody who is dedicated to what their interests are and who they want to be.  That takes time and honesty..  What are you if not a combination of your interests and ideas? Sure you're looking at things right now in terms of black and white, things you can do and what you can't do, but those are huge areas of grey as over time you will find ways to do whatever it is you're interested in. For instance just because I can't lift bug huge weights doesn't mean I don't exercise. Resistance bands and other things that work any part of your body is valuable. Whenever you see UFC fighters or athletes training, resistance training is a big part of their regiment. If that's masculinity, and matters to you, then boom problem solved. Go crazy. But I would argue again to leave masculinity behind, and consider that because of your condition you're going to have to leap over that and become a more cerebral person. I would argue that there's a lot more waiting for you in a cerebral lifestyle. Considering you said that you used to grow up believing in prayers. Well what brought you to that? Was it thinking about the situation? I bet it was.  I would argue also that you're already on your way. Asking for help or asking for advice is sometimes regarded as something that's not very masculine. So to put that aside, and to reach out to other people in a similar situation is an example of you already looking inward. Being more cerebral. To hit back on topic of being dedicated to your interests/hobbies, I'm going to quote my wife and say that even though I'm not a very physically capable person my wife finds it fascinating, attractive, and a whole bunch of other eyebrow-raising words that I'm engrossed in my interests. She thinks it's fascinating when I work on artwork or show off some of the projects I have at work.  Those are the things that keep me busy. Tha me.  And it can be you. I'm not going to say that relationships aren't physical and what not, but it is not the entirety of a relationship. I mean is it just a rocking body that gets you laid? I don't think so, it's a lot more than that. Even to really really really really ridiculously good looking people. Is 3D animation masculine, or sexy? I guess I've never asked that question until now. But I would argue it's not, but to the right person anything can be attractive. So I would say to you to not worry about those little things, like what is sexy is or what is cool, or even the definition of masculinity. I would say work on yourself. Follow your hobbies, follow your interests, and if you work on them long enough it will attract other people. And I bet the people that it attracts are the people that you're going to want to spend time with.

I married my husband before I became physically disabled. We have been in a relationship for 4 years now, married for 3. 

About a year into our marriage I started becoming disabled. Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Then I had Adrenal Crisis which almost killed me.

Then I had Adrenal Crisis a second time.

And now, I have been diagnosed with the disease called Avascular Necrosis of both hips. (it's probably in my knees, too) I am seeing a surgeon and we have to drive hours away for my hip replacement (s).

My husband has taken off so much work to take care of me. Like....he is with me almost all the time for now. (Until my hip surgery (s) and physical therapy allow for me to do things on my own again) Every second that he's home, he cares for me. He bathes me and now that I can't get into the bath - sponge bathes me, helps me to the bathroom, cooks me food, helps me take my medications, does the laundry and other chores, gives me emotional support and snuggles, and cares for our toddler. (Thankfully toddler does go to daycare). 

He LOVES me. He didn't sign up for this when he married me, and heck, I'm only 26 so this was *really* unexpected. But he takes seriously ""in sickness and in health."" 

He's amazing. He is living proof that there is true love. And he reminds me of that every single day - how much he loves me.

1518,"I'm glad I could help even a little. 

&gt; Right now I'm super anxious (I also have autism) and don't quite know what to say to her.

The anxiousness is understandable, I think anyone in your position would find it difficult so having autism on top is just extra stress. If you decide to have another chat with her, make youself a little bullet point list so if you get stressed you can remember what you want to talk about. If it's easier, ask if you can have that conversation through text or a messaging app. 

It sounds like you've done a *lot* to make nanny's life as easy as possible and not thought about yourself. Why isn't there a special bag of fun activities for him and *you* to do together? Because there should be. I'd also keep some of the new books or old favourites to be mom-only, nanny can't read those ones to him. Have a favourite plush that stays on mom's bed in the day and can go to bed with him at night. Things that are just about you and your boy.

&gt; I hadn't really thought of a ""nanny cam"" as they call it lol, since I'm here while she is. But the alternative purpose of using a security cam that you suggested is actually a great idea. I have two smartphones and a tablet. It seems like that might be all I need plus an app?

Yep! If you're constantly running a video call you'll want to keep it plugged in because they eat a lot of battery, so think about the cable and grabby toddler hands with placement. One-way security/nanny cams use a lot less power but then you're restricted to watching vs having him able to see you and talk back. It's up to you what you'd prefer.

&gt; It seems the nanny wants it to be just her and my son

I'd definitely chat to her about the 'momma is in her room'. I'm guessing here that she thinks because you've hired her due to ill health, you want your son away so you can rest. I didn't have a nanny but people helping assumed if I was ill in bed I didn't want a toddler around. I didn't want them jumping on me but I still wanted to see them! Remember that you hired her and you're the boss, if you want to see your son more often all you need to do is say so. This is where the running chat comes in, there will be days where you're just too sick and it's good to be able to send a quick message saying you're not up for it that day.  

&gt; The pictures thing is a great idea!!!! That would make my heart so happy!!! 

Get actual printed photographs as well as his own drawings. Scrolling through pics on your phone is nice but it's just not the same as having them where they catch your eye and make you smile unexpectedly. Get your nanny involved and make it a project; what nice thing are we going to add to mommy's wall this week?

&gt; And maybe I can set up a play place in my room, although I'm not sure.

A lot depends on the space you have and the kind of care you need, so I totally understand. The thing to remember is that there's always a way to adapt what you'd like to do to your disability, even if it's not the way you planned. 

&gt; Good idea. I'm trying to have a little area next to my bed getting started that I can easily grab activities from. It's a bit of a clutter though....hope I can figure it out.

Brilliant. You need to look after yourself and that includes mental stimulation. Mom matters too. It's hard to be sat around all day feeling like you're doing nothing, I've found that progressing in a hobby or finishing a little project can help a lot with that. The lack of routine will absolutely do your head in so try and make one of your own around bed.  

&gt; Prednisone

Pure evil in tablet form.

&gt; I miss going outside with him for hikes and adventures the most, I think. Taking him to places where the kids can play in water. Making him delicious meals. Having our routines. Not having our routines has made me fall apart emotionally.....I just miss him. I miss him being the center of my world. 

Ah I would hug you so much right here. Not being outside hurt a lot for me. Can you have the outside brought to you? Have someone collect a bunch of flowers and leaves, name them and do crafts. Make a weather stone, hang it up and do a chart. Open the windows on a heavily rainy day, have some pine scented incense, cuddle up and have warm milk in a sippy cup like camping. It's the hardest part to adapt to the indoors. You can't go new places but you can do new things and to a toddler, that's adventure. I mean how excited do they get over a cardboard box? 

Like I said above, the lack of routine is a killer. Create a routine for your new situation, your son can still be in a starring role. Look up recipes and plan dinners. If he's using a high chair, see if you can have dinner together sometimes. Find ways to adapt his routine into your new one. 

I am so sorry that it hurts so much, I really hope having more input and plans for time to spend together will help. I'd also like to say not to feel bad about your husband losing his job, or having to care for you, or going back to work. He loves you and your son and that's that.

He and I both went blind around the same time, both have brain damage from how it happened, have several mental illnesses, and grew up in the same state.

We bonded a lot at a school for the blind, and we spent a ridiculous amount of time together, including texting and phone calls all the time. Things changed a lot when we went back home from the school, though.

- He refused to learn anything new, so the only things he could do with his phone were use siri and the youtube app. He couldn't text, couldn't use social media, safari, etc. None of these took more than a few days of trial and error for me, and I am significantly less technically inclined than him.

- He would complain about his faults, and literally yell down the phone if I suggested small changes to help him do better

- He refused to clean his own room, and relied on a housekeeper that his family hired twice a week. He would then spend an hour complaining about her moving his things slightly, when spider walking his hand an inch or two would have helped him find the item.

- He cooked at the school, and excelled at it. After he left, he would microwave popcorn or make a bagged salad. That was it. He wouldn't even reheat leftovers, because he'd have to put in effort to replate it and microwave it.

- He expected his teenage trans brother to come home from a very intense private school, dealing with transphobia and depression and other shit, and cook my ex-friend a whole lunch meal.

- He would scream at his cats for getting in the way and him kicking them. One of the cats was elderly and he yelled at it *a lot*.

- He would spend 1-2 hours talking about the latest talk show joke clip or whatever but then rush me off the phone if I tried to say anything

And some more, tbh. Those are just the top things that bothered me, and some of the shit he did as a teen that he wasn't repentant for.

But ignoring that, the main issue was that I didn't like talking to him anymore. I was filled with dread at his ringtone, and I was building up from disliking him towards hating him, and feeling just full of rage every time I thought of him. I didn't want to be that person, so I ended up ignoring his calls for like 2 months, then I accidentally picked up a call.

1545,"Thank you for your kind and thoughtful words. I had grown up pretty trusting and my first boyfriend was the kind of guy all teen girls need to hook up with (but we moved 3000 miles away and I haven't seen him since although we do email-frequently!). I didn't understand or realize that my ex's folks were coaching him on everything he should do so he would appear 'normal'. At one point he sent me half a dozen roses. When I thanked him over the phone, he said his folks said to do it so my head wouldn't get turned by any other guy! That was the least of it. When we got married the coaching stopped and he was on his own and I was the bad wife for not singing his praises, etc. Once I had the two boys (to supposedly carry on the family name), I had done my duty and the nonsense came on full force until one day he said he wanted a divorce, wanted the house, wanted the boys, etc. At one point in a child custody hearing, he was stupid enough to say he didn't care where the boys lived he just wanted custody - translated to mean they can live with her all they want, but I want the child support money from her!!! So yep, if he had been getting help from the beginning maybe he would have gotten to the point his son is. But it is very hard to live with some that are in denial about their disability (the father) and one who is doing everything that he can to shake those chains off of himself.

Autism seems to be the diagnosis of the day anymore. When my 36 years old was born and getting help, autism was something most people including many doctors had ever heard about. I see many moms out and about with kids that are totally out of control and the parents' shrug and say they can't help it, they are autistic. I do understand that an autistic child has some really different ways of behaving, but I think many that are diagnosed are because of the picture the parents paint about their kid. And no I am not an expert, but many don't really seem to behave as an autistic child would whether low or high functioning. But it is nice to have a diagnosis on your child that allows you to not have to correct bad behavior!

Any kind of mental health disability is tough to have as you do look as if you have no problems and of course, the idea is still out there that if you just pulled up your big boy pants you wouldn't have mental health problems. That is for weak people! Hardly. At my job at a jail for 3 years as an RN, some of the guys had heavy duty mental health problems. I had one guy come in line talking about how Satan was in his brain back here and you could see him in distress, so I asked if he had a headache, but he didn't know so I gave him some Tylenol just in case. Other days he would get in the med line (courtesy of the guards at times) and didn't want to take any meds because Jesus was telling him not to. So I would quote scripture back to him to show that even Jesus at times used things as a 'medication' and I could convince this poor young man to take meds. This was not something he had that he could just stand up and be a man and it would be gone any more than those permanently in w/c can get up and walked if they put their mind to it.

Currently I have two vehicles. A large van (love this on road trips, I can get up and stretch out without having the exit the vehicle when my legs cramp up).  I also have a small sedan (to fit into parking garage at the hospital).  Need to sell both and look for a Toyota or Honda minivan; hence I've been looking the under vehicle lifts.

1632,"My heart hurts for you, it really does. 

This doesn't make you any less of a mom. It makes you more of a mom, because you realised you couldn't physically give your son everything he needed. And even though it meant admitting that everything was getting worse and you couldn't cope and that tears everything up inside, you sucked it the fuck up and got him what he needed. 

**That's what a good mom does.** 

I'd have a good think about how you can have your son involved from up there in bed. There is no need for you to stop doing all the momma things, you can find a different way to be involved. Speak to your nanny and see what she suggests, a qualified nanny is an imaginative, helpful person. You've hired her to help you, that can include helping you spend more time with your son. Have a running chat going with her to keep you updated and so you can let her know what days you'd like more and when to leave you to rest. 

What momma things do you currently miss the most? I missed the basic stuff like changing diapers, doing baths, looking over and watching them when I was really meant to be working. If you have the function, could you change him in bed? There are tables that can go over your lap without resting on your body, though it depends on how big he is! If that's not an option, can you have his changing table in your room, or roll it in? Nanny can do the business end while mom distracts and gets the giggles. 

Do you have a security cam? If not, get one, and aim it at his play area. Ask nanny to play with him where you can see him and if you fancy a peek in at what he's doing, there it is. Look at using two tablets/phones so you can have him on one long video call and talk while he's playing. If there's space in your bedroom, set up a play area in there. If you want to be involved with bathtime, get a big tub, a plastic tarp and set it up beside the bed. Like the changing you don't need to be physically doing the cleaning, make up a great big long adventure about what Rubber Ducky and Plastic Jug got up to on the high seas. What does he like to play with? Can you draw pictures for him to colour in? Do half a puzzle and have him finish the rest? Give him a task for nanny to supervise (Take a picture of what you did/made/went/ate today! Go on something new at the park and tell mom!) to bring back to you. Stick them up on the wall right where you can see them. If he can be on your bed, there are endless options. 

If nanny is there for naps or wakeup/bedtime, get involved with that too. Choose what clothes he's going to wear that day. Reading is a wonderful way to bond with your child and can again be done over phones. Say a quick good morning. Sing to him. Record a few in advance for days you're not up to it. You're still here. You're still his mom. He will not think you have abandoned him. 

--------------

Regarding in home care. Losing your physical independence is always difficult. It's happened over a short period and you've also lost the physical care of another human which makes it more of an emotional blow. But it's getting you where you need to be. It doesn't matter how you get there as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. In home care is not hurting anyone else, it's supporting you, that's what's important.

When you interview carers, think about what kind of relationship you'd like with them. Some people prefer a very detached level of support, carer comes in, does their bit in a logical fashion, leaves. Some prefer a more familial relationship with lots of chat and jokes. Whatever on that spectrum you are comfortable with is fine. It's fine if you need to change it in the future too. Their whole reason for being with you is to make you supported and comfortable, don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you're getting the type of care that works for you.

Regarding your weight, if it's something you want to work on you can do that from bed. *So* many people gain weight when they develop a disability. You're moving less, miserable, bored and food is an easy comfort. Personally the boredom was the biggest issue for me and I'd eat just to have something to do. Find yourself a hobby that you can do while in bed. Have a box of options to keep your hands busy, even while watching TV. Have water and sugar free ice poles on-demand if you start feeling the urge to nibble. It's hard to lose weight while laid up especially on certain meds but it's possible. Steroids can fuck off though, man avoiding binging on them took 99% of my willpower and blew it into space.

If you can swing it I'd also see a therapist. If you haven't, find a support group for others with AV who will understand your pain. You don't have to be Supermom and manage it all on your own. 

You've got this. It's all about learning a new way to live your life and I know you're capable of that because parents have already done it. You can manage it again.",,,,Raargh,Wheelie,,1564333964,t5_2qhe8,t3_cixptg,t3_cixptg,6,1573136185,0,0,ev9xvhy,disability,,,,"My heart hurts for you, it really does. 

This doesn't make you any less of a mom. It makes you more of a mom, because you realised you couldn't physically give your son everything he needed. And even though it meant admitting that everything was getting worse and you couldn't cope and that tears everything up inside, you sucked it the fuck up and got him what he needed. 

**That's what a good mom does.** 

I'd have a good think about how you can have your son involved from up there in bed. There is no need for you to stop doing all the momma things, you can find a different way to be involved. Speak to your nanny and see what she suggests, a qualified nanny is an imaginative, helpful person. You've hired her to help you, that can include helping you spend more time with your son. Have a running chat going with her to keep you updated and so you can let her know what days you'd like more and when to leave you to rest. 

What momma things do you currently miss the most? I missed the basic stuff like changing diapers, doing baths, looking over and watching them when I was really meant to be working. If you have the function, could you change him in bed? There are tables that can go over your lap without resting on your body, though it depends on how big he is! If that's not an option, can you have his changing table in your room, or roll it in? Nanny can do the business end while mom distracts and gets the giggles. 

Do you have a security cam? If not, get one, and aim it at his play area. Ask nanny to play with him where you can see him and if you fancy a peek in at what he's doing, there it is. Look at using two tablets/phones so you can have him on one long video call and talk while he's playing. If there's space in your bedroom, set up a play area in there. If you want to be involved with bathtime, get a big tub, a plastic tarp and set it up beside the bed. Like the changing you don't need to be physically doing the cleaning, make up a great big long adventure about what Rubber Ducky and Plastic Jug got up to on the high seas. What does he like to play with? Can you draw pictures for him to colour in? Do half a puzzle and have him finish the rest? Give him a task for nanny to supervise (Take a picture of what you did/made/went/ate today! Go on something new at the park and tell mom!) to bring back to you. Stick them up on the wall right where you can see them. If he can be on your bed, there are endless options. 

If nanny is there for naps or wakeup/bedtime, get involved with that too. Choose what clothes he's going to wear that day. Reading is a wonderful way to bond with your child and can again be done over phones. Say a quick good morning. <PERSON> to him. Record a few in advance for days you're not up to it. You're still here. You're still his mom. He will not think you have abandoned him. 

--------------

Regarding in home care. Losing your physical independence is always difficult. It's happened over a short period and you've also lost the physical care of another human which makes it more of an emotional blow. But it's getting you where you need to be. It doesn't matter how you get there as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. In home care is not hurting anyone else, it's supporting you, that's what's important.

When you interview carers, think about what kind of relationship you'd like with them. Some people prefer a very detached level of support, carer comes in, does their bit in a logical fashion, leaves. Some prefer a more familial relationship with lots of chat and jokes. Whatever on that spectrum you are comfortable with is fine. It's fine if you need to change it in the future too. Their whole reason for being with you is to make you supported and comfortable, don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you're getting the type of care that works for you.

&gt; I simply don't know if there's any point in pursuing my studies anymore, even though I wanted to study what I study ever since I was 12 or so.

Is this because it's a physically demanding job?  A good amount of jobs can be done without having to be completely hands on.  Unless you're majoring in something like agricultural studies or whatever.  What I'm getting at though is unless you've run through all the possibilities of your interests or studies are you sure you're unable to go further with it?  Disabled people are everywhere doing all sorts of things.  Sometimes you have to pioneer it.

&gt; And my experience shows that being jacked (or conventionally hot etc) boosts up confidence, and yeah, in people of my generation, sometimes, the physical side can get you laid, which could start a relationship or not, depends. 

Definitely just your generation right?  It may seem like that now but I gotta say that it's not everything.  And your being a sad sack isn't going to fix that unless you're after some goth chick...and if you are good, because they aren't hung up on looks! 
 Although there's probably nothing I can do to convince you, just keep yourself open to the tiny, insignificant possibility that relationships, especially the good ones, aren't all based on aesthetics.  If they were all fat guys would be single...they sit a lot too.  I mean if you got together with a supermodel when you were less disabled or whatever then then congratulations.  But that's not the same game plan you're going to need.  And if you're hanging on that you're going to have to get over it.  There's an upside though, disabled people form lasting relationships just like everyone else.  Whether you believe it or not.  Sure casual sex with total strangers might be a bit less frequent but again, it's up to you to to work on it.  Not only that, but just like all the other optimistic self help bullshit the only thing stopping you from getting your dick wet is you, pal.  That's what they'll tell you.  I just saved you a ton of cash, dude.

&gt; But I feel like putting my all for someone (be it a friend or a girl I like) is simply never enough. It hasn't lead to anything but rejection in my experience and I'm getting tired of living for the sake of my brains this long.

Again, negative bullshit mixed with possibly shallow people.  Plenty of disabled people have relationships.  But why is that?  Because it's more psychological than physical.  Most women say they just want a guy that makes them laugh.  Biceps don't do that.  Unless you can make it talk or fart or something.  But you won't make them laugh either unless you work on yourself, duder.  So consider the possibility that being optimistic might be something you need to consider.  And that might get you where you want to be.

&gt; Even if I were to be a respected professor or something, I'd still be seen as the ‘cripple’ when I'm going about my daily life.

Yep.  Forever.  Suck it up you crippled pansy.  I'm a cripple too.  I have a job, go out in the world, and exist.  If you're too intimidated to go be human that's too bad.  Because sure, we all look different but you know at the end of the day we're fucking human.  And I had a similar point when things were rough, but you've got to keep going.  This negative Nancy shit isn't fun to be around.  I mean I'll listen but how many people - disabled or not - are attracted to completely shitting on yourself?  Especially women?  How exhausting.  The only reason I say that is I'm trying to be honest about how everyone responds.  Being crippled, fat, ugly, Chinese, bald...  Doesn't matter.  Go about your daily life, focus on what you care about, and go after what's important to you.  If you're getting shit on for that - you know, being you - the people doing that are human garbage.  Get the fuck away from them.  

If you want something you can have it.  The difference for some is that without putting in the work it looks damn near impossible.  Are your friends shit?  Look for new ones.  Are the women you're after not taking you serious?  Find new ones.  Is the room full of people treating you like you're inferior?  FIND A FUCKING NEW ONE.  When I was a kid I didn't see myself having a job, house, or a wife.  You go on dates, you throw out resumes, and you meet new people.  Keep reaching out and other people will too.

I am constantly plagued with the fear that people don’t see me as “sick enough” to be disabled, and that therefore, I must be faking it. I’m too young, I’m too well-spoken, I’ve even been told that I’m too pretty to be disabled.

People in general have this preconceived notion of what sick looks like, and if you don’t fit exactly into that mold, then there’s no way you’re really sick. Which obviously, many of us in the disabled/chronic illness/invisible illness community know very well to be a metric fuck ton of downright bullshit.

My personal healthcare has been an evolutionary journey for me, with what seems like way more downs than ups. Sometimes I can park my car and walk into the pharmacy to pick up my medication. Sometimes I can go to the park and sit on a swing and sway a little while my nephews play on the slides. But there are also days where I can’t even stand up out of bed in the morning without severe pain, nausea, pre-syncope, etc. Days where I sit on my walker and use my cane to push and roll myself around the house because my knees hurt so badly that I can’t bear weight on them. Days where I cry and bawl and sob into my hands, begging and pleading for the pain to go away.

You know the the pretentious fuckface eyeing me down when I get out of my car with a cane? The know-it-all that shakes their head as they pass me, sitting on the floor in the grocery store so that I don’t faint? The pharmacy tech that’s giving me “the look” as they’re handing me my sixteen different prescription medications for the month? They don’t have any idea. Those people don’t see the breakdowns. They aren’t in the room when your doctor says that there’s no cure for your condition. They aren’t installing grab bars in your bathroom and chaperoning your showers as a safety precaution.

It is so easy for someone to look at another person and make a snap judgement about them based on absolutely zero information about that person. If there is one decent thing that being sick has taught me, it’s empathy. You have no idea what other people are going through. Everyone is living a life and fighting a battle that you know nothing about.

Great that they put buses on from the major areas but if you can't get to the bloomin things it's pretty useless.. a shame cause the event otherwise was amazing for disabled access, could have done with a few more accessible toilets but first time event I get it.


On a happier note I did make a staff member very confused and apologetic. My mum asked if he could walk us to the bus to show us but also to help as I was struggling to stay standing and my mum underestimated how wobbly I'd be.
I said yeah my legs are wobbly from walking all day. And he lent in close and says ""I think that's more likely the booze darlin"" I dead pan stared him in his face ""I highly doubt that given I can't drink cause my liver tries to kill me if I do"". Yeah he had to scrape his jaw off the floor and got us sorted as quickly and silently as he could. Also he was ages with me if not younger. I'll darlin ye pal.

Anyways fingers crossed they listen to you OP.","[{'start': 204, 'end': 209, 'entity_type': 'URL', 'text': '<URL>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

There is also a newer harness that puts him in front of you with his feet next to yours (all harnessed up) so that he gets the feeling of walking.  There are chairs that have wheels like tanks so they move more easily through rough terrain, but I don’t know much about them.  If you’re going to a beach, they have special chairs for that too.

1703,"Okay, so here's my take as a fellow chronic pain patient:

&amp;#x200B;

You should apply for disability. You will get rejected the first time, it's a given. After you do, you'll need to get a lawyer, one that will take payment \*after\* you're awarded. And, you can work while applying, you just can't make over a certain amount. Check the disability website for more information on that, I think $800 is the top you can make. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, you have a primary care physician that you go to, if not, you need to find one. You'll need to keep records of every appointment, the date and just a little note on what you went in for. Also, ask for a reference to a pain management specialist. And, I would also recommend a psychiatrist as well. Chronic pain can play hell with your mental health. You are not going to feel better without taking steps to \*be\* better. 

&amp;#x200B;

After you get approved for disability, in a few years, you'll be able to return to work through either Ticket-to-work program or the JOBS program that was recently started. You will have access to Vocational Rehabilitation programs and other organizations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chronic pain is a part of your life now, it's going to be, it'll never go totally away, but there are steps you can take to make it manageable. And by doing so, you can get back going in the direction you want, but it's a marathon, not a sprint. You can do this. If you ever need to talk to someone, feel free to message me.

1723,"I've struggled with that question for many years now.  When my ex-gf broke up with me, I was lost.  We had been together for 5-years.  One year into dating one another, I fell ill with a rare kidney disease.  She became my rock.  However, when she broke up with me, she told me that because of my disability I'd never be able to give her the life she wanted to live, that I'd never be able to travel and see all the places she wanted to see, and that she did not want to have my children.  Needless to say, those words tore me apart.  I would have rather dealt with the full pain from my kidney the rest of my life than to have those words in my head.  And I wish that I hadn't taken them to heart as much as I did.  But her being my best friend and lover, it may have well been two people that I trusted with all my heart telling me the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

It is now years later, and while I so want to find someone to share my life with, I still hear those words.  I can't even watch romance in a movie or on television anymore and will change the channel to avoid the negative feelings that would soon follow upon watching it.

1724,"Most places have a walking/rambling/hiking club. Your mum could take up a sport and join a club or an informal group. She doesn't need to be good at it to join in with some other beginners/low-skill players. Volunteer gardening is a great way to meet other outdoorsy types.

If I'm on the wrong track with the outdoorsy things (just realised I'm making an assumption) - art galleries, museums, etc. often need volunteers or run events where you can meet people. Hell, even volunteering at the local food bank or old people's home would get her out of the house and meeting people.

The issue is really persuading her to get out there on her own rather than a lack of options. Maybe you could go with her to something when you visit, so it's less daunting for her to go alone next time when you're not there? You could gather a list of activities local to her and sit down with her and look through. Even include some that don't seem like her taste, you never know what she might decide looks interesting.

And if it turns out the issue is that she really wants to \*do things\* with your dad then put together a list of ""sitting down"" activities - craft/painting classes, cheese &amp; wine evenings, book clubs, local theatre/indie cinema, etc.

Edit: Most (if not all) volunteering things do not expect their volunteers to do everything or be good at everything. Most of these things serve an important function as community centres, with lots of volunteers with disabilities, mental health problems etc. Your parents could volunteer together at something, on the understanding that your dad sits (maybe he takes money on the door or sells raffle tickets or puts leaflets together) whilst your mum does more of the running around jobs.

The mother was just wide eyed staring. I had just came into the mall.  That stung as a first lesson.

 It's coming up on five years since then, and I'm basically numb to it now.  Children stare and loudly ask their parents questions about me.

The third one is a bit odd, because she knew I did not want to have biological children of my own for fear of passing my kidney disease on to them, which I could not live with.  But still, her words hit me so hard.  And I fully admit that I'm not past them some 20-years later.  She came into my life a year after I fell ill.  She witnessed me go from a very active, hard working individual, to someone that hardly ever left the house because of pain and nausea.  She was my rock and I took her for granted.  Life is hard enough living as a disabled individual.  And one thing doctors seldom talk about is just how hard it can be on your loved ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I'm most often given is that I need to learn to live with myself first.  To me that's just plain doublespeak.  At this point in my life, I find it easier to just assume that I will live the rest of my life alone and have simply quit looking. There was a time that I tried very hard, but no matter the situation, the moment my health came into the picture the relationship ends.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have always had a very scientific mind and wanted to do a simple test.  So I joined a popular internet dating site.  Over the course of a year, I messaged 10 different women each week, paying particular attention to never message the same one twice.  Each month I changed my profile, including and excluding my medical situation.  Over that next year, not a single woman messaged me when my profile included my situation.  And during the months that I excluded the information, I occasionally received a response.  Only a couple ever reached the point of meeting, and those women tended to only be after one thing.  One in particular, I think she thought that she would be doing me a favor by going home with me.  I once even had a woman cringe in my presence when she realized I slept in a medical bed.

1772,"Yep Iv'e had this issue for years unfortunately as my disabilities are mostly not too obvious unless Im tired and limpy or my back is really bad. I do my best to present myself as able bodied and 'normal'. I pace a lot in order to have energy for important things. Then I put a lot of energy into being as normal as possible so I don't stick out like a sore thumb. 

This has meant that people can't see my illness because I don't let them. They just have to trust that I have problems and that If im telling them then it is because they need to know. 

This hasn't stopped doctors, teachers, university tutors, train conductors, my peers and delightfully a museum guard from all accusing me at various points of 'trying it on'.

This is incredibly depressing, hurtful and hateful. People make a snap judgment based on the surface and the fact that I like to be a fun and engaged person. This combined with me mostly not looking to ill is too much of a cognitive dissonance for them and most people (unless they have experience of family with invisible illnesses) just can't comprehend that you can be in huge amounts of pain and fatigued - but still able to dip into energy reserves in order to present one's self as 'normal'. There seems to be a attitude that you must conform to a disabled 'identity' of being submissive and weak, and that if your slightly loud and have a big personality - you can't be ill, it must be some kind of malicious act. 

This bullshit needs to stop. Im seriously tempted to take legal action against the next case of ableism which occurs against me. In particular the university tutor who obviously didn't believe I was ill and made my time at university particularly miserable and stressful thanks to this.

There are a lot of inventions like this that get shared with this sub (and myself personally) on a regular basis. They're cool to look at and are ostensibly useful, but they are complicated pieces of machinery built for a niche market within another niche market, which means a hefty invoice that insurance almost certainly will not touch. Another common topic here is people struggling with SSDI applications and covering BASIC medical expenses; disability drains the wallet well enough already. To be fair, I have no idea how much a drone like this would cost, but there's no way it's cheaper than the plastic tray next to my toothbrush.

Don't misunderstand me - I'm not trying to shit on your idea, just having trouble seeing what exactly it fixes. It could very well solve somebody else's problem.

1804,"One of the most common things for me is when I see a new doctor and the office staff is surprised that I'm on Medicare because I'm in my 30s and my disability is invisible. Half the time I'll get asked, ""are you on Medicare because of disability?"" Like, I just handed you my card, I have Medicare, that's all you're entitled to know. Even when they don't actually ask, I still pick up on that sense of surprise and momentary hesitation when I hand them my card, probably 90% of the time. It's a subtle thing but it has an impact.

I'm dealing with a situation at work too where I'm having trouble making people understand why I need certain things in order to function. Last week my computer was replaced by a virtual terminal that's supposed to function the same but isn't. All the basic settings are locked - for example, I can't change my screen magnification/resolution. Everything on my screen is tiny and I can't read anything unless I lean in to about ten inches away. I also can't set anything up the way I'm accustomed to. I have autism among other things and changing my work setup is extraordinarily stressful and difficult for me. I can't adjust to a totally different setup all at once the way most people seem to be able to. The IT people don't understand why it's such a problem that I can't customize my system, and when I tell them that I NEED to be able to change these things, I'm being told it's just the way it is, they can't change it, and I just have to deal with it. Thankfully my boss gets it and is trying to get me an actual computer again that functions normally.

I even have to deal with an internal sense that I'm faking or that I'm just being a wimp, like I just need to buck up and get over it. I've worked hard in therapy for years to accept my abilities and limitations for what they are, and to not feel guilt/shame as often when I can't do something. A big one is saying no to social invitations; sometimes I'm just not up to it, and it's really hard for me to decline. Sometimes I feel like other people have it way worse than me, and I shouldn't complain or advocate for my needs, like my problems are invalidated. It's hard to push past that internal ""should"", as in ""I should be able to do X"" or ""I shouldn't feel so upset about Y.""

1812,"I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you, OP, but I wanted to offer at least my commiseration and support. I have ASD and have recently become basically completely disabled by it. I also happen to have hypothyroidism too! Twinsies. These feelings are super hard to deal with, but you're one step ahead of me believing that you're a great person. Your disability definitely doesn't preclude you from that! I think that having goals and working towards being more independent will help, if you focus on that. It's great that you have a path and a goal. I feel exactly the same way about my romantic prospects--who would want someone who doesn't work and might not be able to? Why would anyone put up with me? Like I said, I'm still mired in these feelings myself. The only advice I can think of is not to lead with your disability in your profile. Focus on who you are as a person and what you're looking for. What you have to offer might be a great personality, and that's worth a lot!

&amp;#x200B;

As for routine and social anxiety, there are definitely people--disabled and not--who like routine and are introverts. People who would rather stay in are a lot more common than you'd think; after all, they're not out there speaking up! It's totally not a forgone conclusion that there's no one out there who would be down with that. And, in fact, you might be a perfect match for someone with their own disability. After all, sometimes with ASD it can feel like neurotypical people are fucking aliens and you can never understand their irrational thinking. Well, someone else with ASD is probably feeling exactly the same way! I, for one, would be so relieved to be with someone who totally understands how I feel. And someone who doesn't look at me like I've grown a second head when I say ""that person is looking at me and I cannot handle it."" Trying to convey to my family what I experience can be really difficult. Like, how can you not be able to make dinner? How can you not be able to brush your teeth or have a shower? Trying to explain things like that--times when you just have no goddamn spoons left for anything--is exhausting. And I always worry that someone will look down on you for it. Well, there might be someone just like me in your area who would be like ASD? OMG, someone who will understand, yay! Someone who will speak the same language as me.

&amp;#x200B;

So while I'm still in the ""I am human garbage and no one will ever love me"" phase of dealing with my new level of disability, it sounds like you have some real legs-up on me. And I think that there are a lot of non-disabled people who don't have plans or goals. That you're trying to work towards something isn't nothing! I would love to be with someone who'll just chill on the couch with me. And there must be more mes out there for you.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone below mentioned, I think therapy is obviously helpful. I had to drop out as I was no longer able to handle going, but there are some online therapy sites that will offer it while you're in your PJs at home. I'm not currently in counselling, but when I decide to resume, that will be my immediate port of call. You can specify that you're dealing with disability and ASD, and I'm sure they'll have someone whose specialty that is. They would be able to provide advice and support for navigating the dating world. I hope I can catch up to you in goals and self-esteem!

&amp;#x200B;

Hang in there, OP. Maybe instead of someone who isn't disabled who doesn't care, you'll find someone who is and who can understand exactly how you feel. And having someone who understands THEM might be way more important than a career or whatever. It's massively important to me, so they're for sure out there.

It's not fair and I know that. I wrote the above to help you understand *why* these changes don't exist right now and why they can't happen super quickly. I keep writing suggestions to help you avoid being stuck in your home while you're waiting for those changes to happen, because life goes on in the meantime. 

&gt; I know I could send a complaint now but that’s just me and the don’t listen

It's not going to hurt though, is it? You email a complaint, they ignore you, no change. I had to send a *lot* of complaints as 'just me' before I got the pavement fixed but if you keep complaining to them it gets somewhere. It's the same for anyone, able-bodied people have the exact same issues with getting problems fixed. As I said above you can apply for a drop kerb on your street, but it costs money. I have no drop kerb on my street either. If you have PIP, have you considered putting some of that towards it? Can you or someone you know create a temporary drop with some wood, some drivers do this for their cars. 

Have you spoken to your MP? What did they say? Did you turn up at their surgery so you can speak to them in person? Contact them on the phone? It makes a difference to be a voice or a face they can't ignore.

Yay!/s)than it was a decade or so ago. I don't know where you live but here in the Bay Area it is so expected for people to live with others, that the subject matter doesn't feel to hold too much importance. People are more interested in what you're doing with yourself, and what goals you're working toward in life. That said, your attitude about it does matter.

How does your disability manifest itself? Do you have a good management system in place for yourself that gives you the ability to be pretty functional day to day and the capicity to be in relationship? Own you're disabilities, but don't make you all about  them. Be honest with questions but keep it simple. Let people know if you need them to be accomodations on a kind of need to know basis(for example, giving notice about a gluten sensitivity if they want to go to an Italian restaurant for the fist date, but leaving the subject of depression off the table until later when the relationship potential gets more serious...Unless it gets brought up in casual conversation). Let people know that you take responsibility for yourself and your health seriously (they should do the same).  A partnership is a two way street. It is unfair(and pretty shitty) to expect one partner to adapt to someone's needs and provide care while the other does very little to take care of themselves or be there for their partner. No one wants that kind of imbalance. Now understand, that even with personal responsibility and good self care in place,there will people who may feel it's too much for what they can handle and disengage(which is fine). I found most however, will have their curiosity satisfied and focus on other things to make a relationship work if we're good. The disability is constant presence that kind of runs in the background but isn't the focus of my relationship with someone.

Owning your situation is important. Telling people, ""I'm currently living at home to save some money while looking for a job and also helping my folks out in whatever way in the mean time sounds a lot better than wearing a stigmatized ""I'm almost 30, jobless, going nowhere and disabled"" stereotype as your identity.

1878,"I did a  ***Neuropsychological*** test. This covered a bunch of things, only thing I was told was to bring a sack lunch. Testing started at 9:00 AM and went to almost 5:00 PM (much later than I expected).  

There is no right/wrong answer. Since my testing covered a bunch of areas it was to help have a baseline prior to brain surgery. If there were issues, complications, etc having that baseline helps. In my case it was to see I was dealing with cognitive issues or dementia.  

The examiner did have me come back a week later for another four hours of testing to dive deeper into my memory. Somethings I couldn't recall. Other things, like a picture of a Pelican were confusing. I knew ""its a bird, it likes fish, it sits on the pier by the ocean"" but Pelican escaped me.

What did come out of it was my language processing isn't that good. My visual-spatial processing was excellent. I still work as an Engineer, so it helped explain why I have a harder time with group conference calls but when reading and responding to technical questions find it easy to visualize the problem and respond.    

Bell curve just says ""half the people are here"". So with audio processing I was 30th percentile (lower than average); yet visual-spatial was 99th percentile (""quite brilliant""). Funny part is customers meeting me in person commented to someone else they thought I was a bit slow (said in a derogatory way) - yet when it comes to digging down into customers issues and understanding I'm rated quite high.  Hence best if I do NOT call and speak to customers, but my job allows other Engineers to be at the customers and me to remain in the back ground. They get experience, and I love my job. 

So it was well worth it and great feedback on how to remain the most productive.

1888,"Are they asking this on the application itself or on a seperate HR form that is \*supposed\* to be just used to make sure they \*are\* interviewing a diverse group of people (it would also ask about race/gender). The HR form is not \*supposed\* to be even seen by a hiring manager in a  larger setting. It is not supposed to influence hiring at all.   
In their application for employment and interview they can \*only\* ask can you do all of the tasks with or without accommodation? If you would need to modify the job and you have a visible disability that would be the point to mention how you would modify things to still be effective in the position (changing only tasks that are not the main job like if you would be expected to man the phones while someone is at lunch and you are too hard of hearing for that or you need to sit when presenting rather than stand.)    
However yours is not a visible disability. I'd leave that question blank. You only need declare your disability for ADA purposes (you don't get the protections if you don't tell your employer you need them) after you get the job.  


The situation sucks though because they will often just use the ""not a good fit"" excuse to get around discrimination.

1889,"As a man with cerebral palsy, I know this concern all too well, and the way I see it is this:

&amp;#x200B;

I always check the box. There is no hiding my disability. In the event that I get a face-to-face interview (in person or over Skype), my wheelchair can be seen from the start. With that said, I would prefer to be honest with my employer than feel like I was trying to hide the obvious, especially in cases where you're going to need to talk to them about any accommodations you might need. While they are not allowed to initiate conversations about the nature of your disability during interview, I think it can be helpful for them to know that such conversations may need to take place, either during the interview or during the hiring process. At the end of the day, though, it is up to you how much you disclose.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the application itself… Anytime you are applying for a job it is impossible to know that it is your disability that disqualifies you from even getting a phone interview. I'm sure there are cases where it does for anyone with a disability, me included, but we can't prove it so it's best not to ""decide"" that that's what it is without first considering other factors (qualifications, better candidates, etc.) frankly, in any of the cases where disability may have kept me from getting a job I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not the type of environment that I would want to work in long-term anyway. If they are already going to determine someone's ability based on what they think they know, I feel like my chances of changing their outlook in the long run is going to involve an uphill battle that probably won't go my way.",,,,AJSea87,,,1563902735,t5_2qhe8,t3_cglqvj,t3_cglqvj,3,1572674650,0,0,eull2vr,disability,,,,,
1890,"I'm a female wheelchair user with basic sewing skills.  Pockets on the thighs wouldn't be too hard to make, you could even do it with hand sewing if you didn't want to bother with the machine (but if you learned the machine it would save you a lot of time!).  What you could do is sew two pocket-sized squares of fabric together, with the ""wrong"" sides facing each other, turn them right-side out, then sew it to the tops of the pant thighs -- basically sewing pouches onto the pants to create pockets.  Before you begin you might want to sew/hem/glue down one side of each square about 1/2 inch (where the opening of the pocket would be) so it won't fray, if you know what I mean.

For pants, I know that one problem can be with the back of the pants riding too low when you're in the chair, giving you plumber's crack.  A fix for this is creating some sort of fabric panel in the back that covers this area, but this might require some skills you don't have yet (secure attaching to existing waistband, and sewing elastic into a new hem).  But know that this may make the pants look odd when you're standing!

Another thing that you might be able to do it to shorten some shirts for wheelchair sitting.  This way you won't have a bunch of fabric bunched up at the waist.  I guess you could practice on an old shirt, just by cutting off a measured amount from the bottom and them gluing the bottom hem back into place.",,,,xj371,,,1563049228,t5_2qhe8,t3_ccohyj,t3_ccohyj,3,1571957089,0,0,etp9azd,disability,,,,,

For me, it’s a combination of things. I’m on birth control which smooths out some hormonal related mood changes. I’m in a stable relationship with a partner who is committed to calling me out on my bullshit and putting firm boundaries in place so I have the will to function and the will to keep going, because I care enough about my partner to force myself through the worst of it. I have jobs that make sense with my schedule and needs, and that understand I sometimes need to take mental health days - but also I like my jobs enough that they are also a motivation to keep going and push through the worst of my episodes. I’ve learned to identify my triggers and try to head them off (for example caffeine while manic is a world of hurt for me, but I love my tea so I have to have the will power to drink decaf while I’m manic even if it sucks). 

That said, my bipolar is not that “severe” and I don’t mean to diminish the fact that it can really fuck you up in ways you can’t always control. And I don’t want to say that just having the right job and the right partner will “cure” it. Bipolar life is hard. It can be so unpredictable and so destructive especially if you dissociate.

1929,"I'm not affiliated with the industry, but I've got a disability nonetheless.

Disability is intended for long term situations. That's why it takes so danged long to set up and wait for. By the time you're eligible, you'll fit nicely in the system to deal with an entirely different level of crap.

I don't think it's going to be possible for you to get your doctor to recommend you get on disability on the off-chance something may happen. Insurance companies only offer ""preventative"" assistance if they've worked out a shit deal with your employer (hey, just look at the effectiveness of a typical EAP smoking cessation program).

I would however recommend you document every issue as possible. Always keep a local (in your home) record. When shit hits the fan for you (which it will), at least you'll be able to prove in court some kind of malfeasance.

I actually have been working on my interests for quite some time and still, even at the best university of the country I'm in, among others of similar interests (it's probably even a passion tbh), I started feeling that in the end, nothing changes. Yes, I learn a lot. My professors claim I'd make a fine researcher and yet... That's that. I'm still alone, even in a room full of people... I simply don't know if there's any point in pursuing my studies anymore, even though I wanted to study what I study ever since I was 12 or so. And my experience shows that being jacked (or conventionally hot etc) boosts up confidence, and yeah, in people of my generation, sometimes, the physical side can get you laid, which could start a relationship or not, depends. But I feel like putting my all for someone (be it a friend or a girl I like) is simply never enough. It hasn't lead to anything but rejection in my experience and I'm getting tired of living for the sake of my brains this long. I feel like I'm never actually valued. And the prospect of this never changing, especially given what I've seen in other countries too, the attitude people have... this hurts the most. Taxi drivers helping me not out of kindness but out of fear I may break or otherwise damage something in their car (that statement I hear often)... I have no idea what, if anything, can be done. Even if I were to be a respected professor or something, I'd still be seen as the ‘cripple’ when I'm going about my daily life. 
Somehow, being masculine in the conventional sense gives one a social role they can use to defend themselves (not physically) from such situations – they can play along the stereotype and use it to their advantage.

They come in brown and black and I’ve seen various handle colors.   I got my first one in a high end cane store about 60 miles from home so was glad I found them on Amazon.   This handle style is made to be kind to your hand and wrist.   To use it correctly it needs to be sized on the taller side so that your hand rests comfortably without a lot of wrist bending.   The added height makes it look more like a walking stick.  I’ve had lots of people comment on how nice this cane looks and used them in business settings for years.  

The one downside is that it is either only left or right handed which hasn’t been a problem for me as I always use the same hand anyway.",,,,bugmom,,,1564173078,t5_2qhe8,t3_ci73ab,t3_ci73ab,1,1572990248,0,0,ev29yae,disability,,,,"I’ve been using this style for years and love them

1995,"&gt;1. At least three times, someone kicked my cane. All of those three times resulted in me nearly falling.

This is shitty. This is assholes being assholes, it isn't right but it's to be expected when such large groups of people gather.  The best and worst of humanity.
 
&gt;2. People stared. I mean, I had dramatic bi flag colored eyeshadow and a huge bi flag cape, so I’d love to imagine they were staring at THAT and not my cane, but, no.

People stare at me all the time and have for the last 3 decades. Yesterday there was a boy with a disability and he couldn't stop staring. Maybe because it's probably not every day he sees a grown up with a disability? He was rendered speechless when he saw me the first time and his head was on swivel. I am pretty sure he did a triple-take stopping and turning around absolutely bewildered. I kept smiling at him every time we passed because he would stare with this absolute look of awe and I hope I made his day. 

Sometimes people stare at things they're not accustomed to seeing, myself included. Is it rude? Sometimes. You're at this HUGE event. A higher number of people are going to stare. Maybe it's not all rude. Maybe some are wishing they brought their disabled sister or they're lost in a memory of their disabled friend that died. 

I once had a woman chew me out for staring at her disabled child. Sorry, but she only thought I was staring. The reality of it was they happened to be between me and where I was looking. I didn't even see them. They had no idea I was looking past them. 

You can't assume you know anything about the intent of another person in a crowd, it makes you look super foolish when your wrong. 

&gt;3. Cane.People LOUDLY pointing it out. Stop.

As for your cane, is it awesome? Are you awesome? Take pride in yourself. You're out celebrating PRIDE. Don't let this stupid shit bother you.

&gt;4. There’s almost no where to sit. Not great when you need to sit every 5 seconds.

This is where you need to be proactive and depend on yourself to take care of your needs. Bring a wheelchair. Bring a cane with a seat. Bring a rollator with a seat. Expect reasonable accommodations, you said yourself you need to sit every 5 seconds.

&gt;5. The parade organizers didn’t announce at all when we’d all be moving. It “started” at 10:30 but we didn’t move until almost 1.

This is typical of these kind of events. Things happen. Have you googled to see if something beyond the parade organizer's control happened?

&gt;6. The parade route is hilly and is full of shittily paved roads, bumps, cracks, loose rocks, etc. I struggled with my cane, i can’t imagine how someone in a chair would manage.

This is San Fransisco, California, USA. You should expect hills and shitty roads. I know I would probably not be able to do the whole parade. I would consider finding out if it were possible to do part.  Maybe this is why you didn't see more disabled people? Maybe they know something you don't and only do part of the parade. Reach out to the disabled community in SF, ask what you should know prior to participating!

&gt;7. For a decent stretch of the route, every other block or so is filled in with these grate things (to let air in I guess?) the holes in the grates are big enough to fit my cane through it. These grates cover most of the area for that stretch besides a small patch. I’m short and the crowd was thick, so I couldn’t see when a grate area was coming up. So when I got to one, i had to frantically hobble across the swarm to get my strip of freedom.

Well, now you know and you can prepare better for the future. Bring a larger cane tip next time. [Something like this?](https://www.amazon.com/SANDPADTM-STABILIZER-SandPadTM-American-Ventures/dp/B00VIJR6GI/)

&gt;8. NAKED ASS MEN. Literally naked men walking around, penis out, in front ofKIDS. Children. I get dressing skimpy for a thing, that’s cool, but your gentitals shouldn’t be out in public in the first place and DEFINITELY shouldn’t be out in front of kids. It can and WAS a trigger for sex repulsed people and rape victims.

The parade provides a family friendly area...but this is San Fransisco isn't public nudity a thing there?

I've actually paused a moment and done some googling because I was super curious about this and turns out it is perfectly legal for this to happen. Know your local laws.


I don't know what to say but your entire post is seriously showing your inexperience. You are a kid and have a lot of living and learning to do. (The same as I did and a lot of other young people.)

Yes, it's super fucking shitty that people kicked your cane but like everything else? Let it go. Some things you are just plain ignorant about. 

Also, be the change. Educate yourself in the real issues where you truly see short comings. Organize.

This is their problem, not yours.  It's not your fault they are stupid and don't understand.  
If confronted ask them what they know about wobbly knee syndrome, probably nothing since I just made it up.  Well I'm not aware of any condition called wobbly knee syndrome (I apologise if it does exist and there are sufferers).  Facing up to their lack of knowledge will put them on the back foot and will give you the upper hand.","[{'start': 21, 'end': 31, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

2032,"OK, here's my experience:
I live in a hilly city in the UK. Every surface is sloped: up, down, left to right, right to left. So I need good grip to get enough force into the wheels to get up the hills, and even better grip to slow me down going down hills.
Initially I used nothing, but within a week I was trying out various leather gloves until I found the style that I now wear all the time. But gloves weren't enough, particularly when going downhill in the wet, the rims became too slick to get any braking effect.
So I looked to get better grip on the rims. My chosen solution are the Surge LT rims. They have a rubber strip embedded into the rims and that gives me enough grip when using my gloves to brake.
However, I have a pair of wheels of a size where there are no suitable Surge LT rims. For these wheels I bought RehaDesign ""rubber"" rims. Whilst these work, I find that they are a bit ""all or nothing"", either I get no braking or, suddenly, my gloves grip the rubber and my arms are nearly pulled out of their sockets from the force of stopping the chair.
I'd recommend leather gloves to everyone - mine are half-fingered with padded palms and adjustable strips on the back to ensure a tight fit.

2038,"It’s not that shocking or weird at all.  People don’t understand disabilities and think of them as all or nothing.  As in, you can always walk or you can never walk. Not, you can walk sometimes because your muscular dystrophy has only progressed so much. Or, you need a chair sometimes because you have Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and overexertion could literally kill you.

Any time a non-disabled person sees a disabled person get out of a wheelchair the flip TF out and assume faking.

I have CRPS from really serious never damage. I can’t put any weight on the leg, or even put clothes on it. A fan can hurt it. A current in water can hurt. But because I can’t even use a wheelchair (can’t stand, sit, walk, or lie on my back or right side) the least of all the evils is to use crutches for short distances. It really hurts, and I only use it to go the doctor and back home. I’m in bed lying on my “good” side otherwise.  But to non-disabled people I look like a young healthy person with a sprained ankle or something.  

Before I was as disabled as I am now, I would avoid people a lot. I’m very social but the constant fear of what people might do (and if it would force me to go back to court to deal with proving my disability all over again, or take away my income and healthcare in the meantime making me without my meds, homeless, &amp; destitute) was a real fear.  I’m so bad now there’s really nothing they could misconstrue, but it’s awful to live with that kind of fear.

The worst part is that they think they’re “protecting” us in their heads. They think they’re looking out for “real” disabled people but they don’t understand who we are or what we look like. They don’t understand illnesses that limit you a lot but don’t take away something like walking entirely, they just don’t get it.

I hate the guilt when you compare yourself to people who don't want help.

But, instead of pushing his parents, or any of the people that helped him with his physical recovery, to help him, he chose to wallow.

My ex friend was of a very wealthy family, like they could buy him a house in <LOCATION>, hire a live-in aid, hire maids and chefs, and only be affected by not taking any vacations for a few years. But, instead of pushing his parents, or any of the people that helped him with his physical recovery, to help him, he chose to wallow. It's been 5 years and nothing has changed for him, except he's almost doubled his weight because he still doesn't cook, go outside, or really do anything other than lay in bed, or on the couch, and watch videos on his phone.

It's not fair to compare my life where I was forced to adapt or die to his where his parents let him stagnate, but also life isn't fair. I can't let myself feel bad because he is still choosing not to get help offered to him, it's not healthy for me. Instead, I'm better off dropping the rope completely and letting him do him.

I know I've used a ton of cliches probably, but it's straight up that you can lead a horse to water, hold a bucket up to their face, open their mouth and put it in there, tie them to a pool, etc, but you can't force them to keep drinking.","[{'start': 525, 'end': 535, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

2164,"I don't have my own placard because I don't drive, but my partner has a ""pick-up"" placard that allows him to temporarily park in a disabled parking spot for 10 minutes so that he can pick me up from close to the entrance and so I can get into the card with my crutches without scratching any nearby cars.

The number of times i've been carpooling with my co-worker who has a standard placard for his father in the glove-box and says ""Oh, i'll put the sticker up and we'll park here for the day, You have your Disability blue card in your wallet so we're eligible to park here"" It pisses me off. It's one thing when I'm having a bad day and I can tell he's offering because he can see i'm struggling, but half the time he's doing it because *he* wants to park close/get the extended hours.

The name on the placard doesn't match the name on my wallet card. Yes, I'm entitled to a disability placard because I have a Blue Card (government issued ID recognising I have a disability), But I'm only eligible for ""pick up/drop off"" placards because I don't drive and I don't need assistance after I get out of the car.

I'm not in the states so placards are different here, there's ones for proximity-space parking, extended time permits, pick-up/drop offs etc.

someone with a mobility aide or condition that limits how far they can walk is eligible for proximety-space because they need to be close to the entrance and/or need a wider car space. Someone with a condition that can cause disorientation, slow mobility etc can get ""extended time"" so a 1hr parking time limit becomes 2 hours before they get ticketed. For people like myself who don't drive but need a bit of extra space to get out of the car get a drop off placard that we give to our primary driver. If I needed one on one support after getting out of the car, I'd get a standard placard so my driver wouldn't have to leave me alone at the entrance while they park elsewhere if we're going somewhere together.

It sucks when I take an uber or drive with a friend while the placard is in my partners car, But most of the time they just stop in front of the entrance and let me out in the road, sometimes people honk at them but when they see me getting out with crutches they understand and are more patient. The pick-up placards are issued to stop this from having to happen because it's less safe and holds up traffic, but when all the disabled spaces are full my partner, even with my placard has to do this anyway.

At the end of the day, I know how difficult living with a disability is, So I'm not going to take more than I need and abuse the system because that makes someone else live needlessly more difficult. I can manage without, so I manage without. For people with ramps, no parking space means no entry to the facility at all. For me it just means getting out in the middle of the road then my partner parks elsewhere. So why would I abuse that system knowing I am hurting others?",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1562815468,t5_2qhe8,t3_cbjts3,t1_etg63kb,2,1571821743,0,0,ethh9iz,disability,,,,,

I don't understand this, it makes no sense. Are you just supposed to rot? Can you find another doctor? Are they the one going to be responsible for your treatment soon? Are they waiting to see the outcome? I just don't get it. I would seriously be looking to them to be explaining the reasoning. How are you supposed to just not work? (Sorry, I am angry for you!)

I don't have experience with SSA/SSI/SSDI so I can't help with that but I can tell you just from your short post here I would consider you disabled. You also have diagnosis of your issues and at minimum you should be looking for reasonable accommodations as far as employment goes, use the ADA to your advantage.

Wow, I am sorry that you had to go through all that with your ex, I can only imagine how frustrating and difficult that would have been. I think we live in a bubble when dating people that you can overlook signs that would otherwise have warned you to what was happening. And once you’re married and have kids, it makes things much more difficult because you want to try and keep things stable for them. 

His parents really did him a disservice, because he likely could have been completely different had they worked with him and encouraged him as you have done with your son.

There is definitely a lot more awareness of autism both with medical professionals and us every day people. I don’t have a child with autism so can’t really speak to it, but I would like to hope that more parents were like you rather than those you describe, unfortunately in reality, that isn’t always the case (similar to your ex’s parents I guess).

Agree 100% that mental health disabilities are so misjudged by people. How often you hear ‘well if they just picked themselves up and got over it, they’d be fine’? I have PTSD on top of paraplegia and my physical chronic illnesses and there is a big difference between people’s response when I say I can’t do something because I’m struggling with PTSD stuff compared to when I have problems related to my paraplegia or chronic illnesses; it is huge. It’s like people know you can’t just ‘get over’ paraplegia but you should just be able to ‘get over’ your PTSD symptoms. And if you don’t, then it’s like you are not a worthwhile person anymore. I imagine you were in a minority within your job as an RN at the jail, I can’t image everyone would have been as understanding and willing to engage with people struggling with their mental health like you did.

2204,"Sorry for the late reply, it was a bad night so I slept most of the day. I'm sure you've already seen the doctor today, so I hope that went well. 

Just in case they rescheduled, I would expect it to take a few hours between waiting and all of the questions. It's a good idea to bring someone who knows what you are going through symptom-wise (I brought my mom, who I live with). It is important to be brutally honest about the impact on your life, but don't exaggerate. When they ask about limits describe how you are limited on your bad days. If your hands hurt so much you can't easily drive, tell them; if you have trouble making your own food, tell them - this is not the time to get embarrassed or to put on a brave front. 

SSDI is about not being able to work, so put things in those terms. For example, I told the examiner that I had trouble using a computer mouse longer than 20 minutes. I explained how I kept ziplock bags and a dish towel in my purse to make ice packs, usually three or more per shift. If you take a lot of pain meds that leave you too groggy to work, or you take meds that cause you fatigue (like biologics), tell them. 

Also, don't hesitate to describe how other conditions affect you as well. For example, many people with chronic pain have depression, so remember to talk about how it affects you.

When i help at my kids' school, and the other parents talk about ""mom's meeting... and Jared...."" I'm not offended, because I am an anomaly. I'm the only dad in our mom's group - of all of the families in our school (it's a cooperative, not really a school... per se....), Ours is the only family with a stay-at-home dad who's the one primarily responsible for educating, while my wife is the primary bread-winner. So.... is ""mom's meeting,"" or ""mom's night"" inclusive? Not really, at least not by name - but have I ever felt excluded at mom's meeting? Not a lick. I don't usually do mom's night, because my wife works nights, and someone's got to watch my kids... and I think that my analogy wouldn't be so effective if I really included the event, because they do manicures and... makeup... and.... dresses, I'm sure... other things that women folks like.... so I might feel a bit out of place there....

But when I got to an activity which attempts to, or purports to, be accommodating for everyone, and I can't participate for one reason or another because of lack of accommodation? That's pretty disappointing, and sometimes frustrating.

I guess I don't have a problem with apple doing this... but I also don't feel like they're doing it for any other reason than to avoid looking like they're discriminatory toward one minority group or another (like us, the disabled).

'Gh', 'th', - dots representing combinations of common themes in spelling and grammar to shorten the spaces so more words fit, basically. (I'm trying to say every combo means something; unlike an upsidown 'a', which couldn't be read in a similar manner)

There is no 'right side up' in braille, exactly; all dot combinations (to my understanding) would eventually be used. Or so my teacher said.

These bricks are only the basic letters. If I were looking for an 'o' but found a brick with one dot in the upper left corner, that's an 'a'. But it could also be the capital symbol if I turned the brick upsidown. What I can't do is mistake it for an 'o', because it has a radically different setup by feel. The spaces surrounding the 'a' (or the capital depending on which way the block would be put) would tell me what symbol it is as well.

\-edited to add - ya can tell by where the dots are positioned when touching it what symbols it could be. That said, it's extremely difficult to misread \*basic\* braille, so long as bits aren't recessed - I had a much more difficult time learning print as a child and my vision was better then.

Attorney’s are only allowed to charge you a limited amount in your case, no matter how much work is involved. I believe it’s something like 25% of your earnings or 6,000, whichever is less, but don’t quote me on that, it’s best to look it up.

What I’m trying to say is that you’ll likely be charged the full 6k and any assistance you get in moving the date will likely fall under those same fees, so no extra charge.

2271,"i have a long-term indwelling/foley cath due to my disability! (i have a connective tissue disorder) here's some stuff:


: when you sleep, you use a night bag, which has MUCH longer tubing, long enough that your cath bag will be off the bed, so less likely to be pulled


: taping the tubing to your leg is really helpful in addition to the leg bag, it's extra safeguarding against pulling and i find it to be very secure (i'm a restless sleeper lol)


: getting it inserted isn't super painful honestly - they squirt some lidocaine gel into your urethra which lessens the worst of it. you'll likely have a sensation of needing to pee which should subside once you're used to the feel of the cath, you may also feel some pain when sitting which i fix by adjusting the tubing itself


: make sure to stay hydrated! drink a bit more than you normally would, both because you'll likely be draining 24/7 and also to help reduce the risk of a UTI


: you may get bladder spasms, which are awful and are basically feeling like you REALLY need to pee and your bladder spasms a lot, which can also make leakage happen past the catheter tubing. if you're feeling spasm-y i'd advise going and plopping down on the toilet til they pass

If they are private or don't know who to send you to, go to your GP, explain what's going on and ask to be referred to mental health. 

As /u/KatieDonnolly says if you are over 16 you now apply for PIP, not DLA. You can apply for any health condition but you must have had problems for at least three months and expect them to continue for at least another nine months. They are very strict and you **must** get help filling out the forms, it gives you the best chance of qualifying. Did you ask your therapist about DLA/PIP? If you see them through the NHS they sometimes have someone in the mental health service who helps with benefits issues. Otherwise CAB are an excellent place to start, they may help you directly or send you to another service experienced with PIP. If there is no CAB near you, ask at your nearest social work office. 

Please also give yourself some time. It's hard when starting any kind of health treatment to be patient, remind yourself you're doing something positive and it doesn't have to all happen at once. Therapy can make a big difference as can antidepressants, though sometimes you have to try a few to find the right drug and dose. It's much better that they start you on a low dose and add more if you need it, the smaller dose you need to feel better the less stress it is on your body. 

It can take several weeks for an antidepressant to start working so don't worry if you don't feel it helping right away.

Would you be okay moving forward in life with her if her situation remains the same or if it gets worse, depending on her other disabilities? I hope you truly consider the full weight of everything. 

If you're okay to move forward in that scenario, tell your parents. Tell them you've considered their words and warnings and love her enough to proceed. Tell them you don't care to hear anymore about it, you've already heard them, so they need to respect your decision.",,,,JoggingGod,,,1562469377,t5_2qhe8,t3_c9oawi,t3_c9oawi,2,1571613617,0,0,et5bvlb,disability,,,,,
2334,"Thanks for the comment. We do use a wheel chair rather Juliet sits and I push. The downside to that is she can't in anyway move herself unless she is having a good day and uses her feet.

She likes forearm crutches but she needs something else but she was both rejected for electric scooter / wheelchair.

I consider it discriminate of her particular disability. 

Also assuming your USA you be amazed how badly off we are in Canada for Disabilities. From what I hear counting exchange rate, etc we are about the same when it comes to the ever day income but our living costs are much higher unless of your your in LA or NY and such.",,,,DisabledCouple,,,1563723299,t5_2qhe8,t3_cfug2t,t1_eud48cf,1,1572522364,0,0,eudoh1f,disability,,,,"Thanks for the comment.
