36,"First you need to apply. The reality check is even if you’ve saved up all your good luck for this, it’s close to six months minimum to your first check. Reality is probably over a year. 

There’s two programs, SSDI and SSI. SSI is if you have not paid in enough through working, and the most that you can collect a month from SSI is $770. That will not get you far. Depending on your state you may also be eligible for food stamps and you should be eligible for Medicaid.

SSDI on the other hand pays more typically then SSI. Since you are young even if you have been working the amount that you would get paid would not be a great deal more, but you can check that out online by setting up an account for yourself so you can see how much you might expect to get on disability. On SSDI you have to wait two years in order to be eligible for Medicare. If your finances are low enough you may be eligible through your state for Medicaid in the meantime. Also SSI limits you on the amount of non-earned income and the amount of assets you have, so you cannot collect a lot of savings. On SSDI they’re only concerned with earned income, you can collect lottery winnings, inheritance, gifts from people, without any negative impact to your benefit.

64,"I applied for SSDI in Kentucky and was approved. My disability is much different (bipolar disorder) but in my experience, there are two things that will drastically help your application. 

The first is a long and documented medical history, with doctor's notes and hospital visits, proving the medical extent of your disability. A definitive diagnosis from a doctor's records will also help. I know fibromyalgia is a difficult diagnosis to ""prove"" but if you have seen doctors on a regular basis, their findings will help prove the medical side of your disability claim.

The second is a history of unsuccessful attempts to work, with your disability being the reason that you can no longer work. They would like to see you have tried different jobs, switching careers, doing easier work, etc. and have attempted to work in any capacity, but unsuccessfully kept a job due to your disability. An ""unsuccessful work attempt"" is defined as six months or less at a particular job. [More info about UWAs](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0411010145)

[This page about SSDI and fibromyalgia might help you too.](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability-ssdi-ssi-fibromyalgia.htm)

Even with a rock solid case, you might have to wait months or years to get approved unfortunately. You may also be denied the first time, as 60% of cases are. 

It may help to get a disability lawyer to navigate the process and ensure everything is buttoned up before submission. Be aware though, if you have been disabled for a long time, you may receive a large back payment (maybe $20k or more). Disability lawyers work on a percentage of that payment, so the more you are entitled to, the more money they take as a fee.

Honesty is the best policy when telling a child about his or her disability. Understanding helps with acceptance. 
There are sports and other activities geared towards disabled children. Try getting the child to focus on what they can do instead of what they can’t. Getting your child involved in adaptive sports is a great way for him/her to make friends that have their own challenges to overcome. They will motivate each other and provide inclusion..which is so important. There are adaptive sports for people of all abilities. Check your area for any programs.

137,"I can’t speak from a disability perspective but I have a chronic illness and I often refer to myself as sick or ill. It’s an intrinsic part of who I am - I was born with it and inherited from other members of my family who were also born with it, so it feels like being sick, to me, is just as much who I am as my gender, race, sexuality, etc. I don’t see it as being a victim, but just a state of being, and I don’t feel that I’m a survivor because statistically, my chronic illness will in fact eventually kill me, either directly or indirectly, so I really haven’t survived anything except not dying yet. 

That said, I think this is a different situation than someone who has had a profound but acute illness or medical trauma such as a stroke - strokes are not chronic or congenital illnesses so it makes less sense for someone who has had a stroke to identify as ill. At the same time, the after-effects of something like stroke can be a long term, chronic problem so I also see the opposite argument. 

Anyway, basically I would say personally I don’t really think there is anything wrong with identifying as ill or sick, and sometimes I think it is worthwhile to focus on those concepts as an identity, but as with most things in life, you can’t really make a blanket statement that will be true for all people and situations so it ultimately depends.",,,,keakealani,polycystic kidney disease; bipolar II; atopic allergic rhinitis,,1560587700,t5_2qhe8,t3_c0pg8g,t1_er7l5ru,5,1569940592,0,0,er7u5rj,disability,,,,,

154,"Sometimes honesty is just the best policy.  I have physical disabilities that started becoming obvious when I was eight.  My mom didn’t lie to me about it.  She explained the particulars of what was wrong as she understood it. Having knowledge was powerful for me. It helped me when things were bad. I was definitely ostracized by classmates because my teacher was the biggest bully I’d ever had.  Had she handled it differently, my experience would’ve been totally different.  I also had the added experience of my sister being born severely disabled.  By eight I knew most people sucked about disabilities.  Everyone develops differently and sometimes a person’s body works differently than other people.

You can empower the child to advocate for themselves.  Maybe the other kids have never seen a kid in a wheelchair, or with braces, or crutches, and don’t know how to handle it.  Teach the child games and activities they can participate in.  If it’s a class situation the adults can offer to educate the rest of the kids.

162,"I volunteer at a lot of conventions so I'll answer from that perspective. First off, San Diego Comic Con is usually very accessible, although I've had some issues with attendees being ignorant and annoying.

Anime Expo was a nightmare. I got shifted to a regular attendee on the first day because they didn't have any arrangement for disabled volunteers to get the pizza they'd offered (after a long day without much time to eat) without standing in a long line. I wasn't able to sit and wait because people were allowed to get back in line for seconds as soon as they got their first piece and there wasn't any left at the end. I think there was another issue but that's what I remember. I caused a fuss and they kicked me off the volunteer team.

Sac Anime was even worse. I was a higher level volunteer and I forget exactly what we were called. I have pretty bad PTSD from being raped at a convention several years ago so when they told us that we'd not only have to share a room but also a bed with other volunteers I explained that I wouldn't be able to do that and even explained why and the coordinator responded with ""but were you raped by a woman?""

I see “wheelchair user” a lot more now, and “full-time” or “part-time” to describe whether it is used for more or less all mobility (outside sleeping, bathing, etc) or just some.

Basically, language can influence attitudes and this newer language shifts the focus from thinking of wheelchairs as something you’re stuck in to thinking of them as tools that can be used to do more and make things easier. Language isn’t the root of all ableism, but it can still contribute to and perpetuate it. But also, like others have said, you get to decide what language you use to describe yourself.

267,"SEF's mom  --  About a month ago my son sef mentioned that he was scared about what would happen if something happened to my husband, his step-dad, because I can't live alone. Interesting insight as I'm not used to them coming from my autistic son. The older one knows that I need help just to be sure I haven't fallen, but he won't bring it up until a time it might be needed. So yep, I also can't live alone. I have severe RA and every joint pretty much has RA or OA, both knees replaced and then redone already and I'm only 63! My back is a total mess as well. Needless to say that when walking, I use a cane even in the house as I am rather wobbly. My last fall ended up with an ambulance ride to the ER and the most excruciating pain in my life and I have had a baby over 10# and I have had kidney stones and the pain was far worse than that. The point being if hubby hadn't heard me go down or if I lived alone I would definitely need one of those, ""help I've fallen and I can't get up"" gadgets. More and more things are impossible for me to do. I have always been very independent, something my mom made sure hubby knew before marrying me. 6 weeks later, I never went back to work and it took most of a year to figure out what was wrong with me. So Miss Independent, suddenly needed help showering, dressing, walking, cooking, doing household tasks. You guys know the list.

&amp;#x200B;

17 years in with this battle, I am used to my life even though every year I am losing more and more ability. I have made a choice that I am not going to Miss Gloom and doom. Every day I try to find something to be thankful for. I try to share gratitude to anyone who helps me. I am no longer embarrassed to ask for help. A little startling for a teenage boy to have an older woman ask for help opening her water bottle since I can no longer to that on my own. Years ago I had to give up on my favorite apple juice since I couldn't open it at all! But the thing I like the best is if an elementary sized boy on his own opens and holds a door for me. WOW, do you realize how many kids never think about doing that?!? So with something like that I try to look him in the eye and say not only thank you but that I appreciate it. Especially one day when the kid doing it, dad had walked through the door and never noticed me and he didn't notice what his son was doing and yelled at him to hurry up. Obviously not learning manners from dad, but hopefully, a little incidence where someone disabled needs help and they give it and get real appreciation back might stick with him so that he grows up to be a sensitive helpful man.

 I have learned to take any help offered. Think about it this way, if you weren't in a chair or hobbling along with a cane/crutch, wouldn't you be reaching out to help others? I'm assuming that the answer is yes. So maybe you can't help currently, but you can allow someone to practice their little acts of random kindness on you. Be thankful that people will still help whether you have to ask for help or not. I have also found that when a child of any age asks questions about why I use a cane or why I have such (ugly) scars on my knees. They don't say ugly, but I know they are. It gives me a chance to educate them about a disease or difficulty that they may not be aware of. For me to say that I have arthritis, isn't too impressive as they may know something with a sore finger that they call arthritis. and then they want to tell me what will 'cure' me. I hate it when I hear about a product that my doc 'doesn't want me to know about because they would lose money!"" But many haven't knowingly run into people with what you have very much and if there were magic potions my doc would have tried them.

275,"When you say misplaced, are you meaning people leaving items behind in places they don't belong? If so then I disagree with you. Regardless of people's abilities they should be considerate and show proper etiquette when interacting in public places. Sure, there are people whose medical problems may prevent them from doing things to the full extent one would expect from an abled body person, but that is not the reality for majority of the population.  It would be super unfair to have the store lower their standards of general cleanliness or let customer accountability  slide for all on the account that's it may be difficult for a small portion of the population to do things or that it may come off as offensive to some. Why do people get mad at misplaced things? Because there are a lot of people who(for lack of a better phrase) ""abuse the system"" and don't think or care about the messes they leave behind. The retail workers are then left to pick up after them like mothers after toddlers. It's a small expectation of decency that everyone should be taught and have in adulthood (like not leaving a dirty toilet seat basic).

People are not mind readers and it is impossible for them to mentally account/accommodate for every possible thing under the sun that may impact a stranger they know nothing about(that's exhausting and an impossibly unrealistic expectation to ask them to carry).  You want people to be treated with equal respect? Then there needs to be a general baseline on how you interact with everyone in the population... and adjust accordingly to other information(whether verbal or other). 

 If you have trouble with something, ask for assistance. If you see someone may need help, ask. If no one is there to help(like reaching or picking things up), leave it in an area that is as close to the original site as possible and out of the way. Do things within your limit and be considerate. Disabilities should not give people an a pass to forgo their sense of etiquette. If something is difficult communicate it. Most people are generally decent human beings and will offer some accomodations when they are made aware of limiting situations.

By the way, this sense of respect goes both ways. If you ask for accommodations for your disability then turn around and leave an unnecessary, inconsiderate mess behind, then you're just being an asshole(disabled or not).",,,,Present-Hour,,,1561934200,t5_2qhe8,t3_c7hfyp,t3_c7hfyp,4,1571168622,0,0,esfsw3a,disability,,,,,

I made an accommodation request and was given access to a private room in an accessible dorm room. Freshman year I had to share a communal bathroom, but from sophomore through senior year I even had a private bathroom. They legally have to provide you accessible housing that meets your needs from what they offer (so if none of their rooms have private bathrooms then they can’t really provide that). They don’t legally have to pay for off campus apartments, unless they literally had no accessible dorm rooms which I can’t imagine. I was allowed to take 5 years to graduate instead of the traditional 4, and I was allowed to take a semester off without any consequences for health reasons. The accommodations I had were extended testing time, taking tests by computer, no loss of points for absences, note takers in my classes or the ability to tape record, having a TA tape record class sessions when I was absent, access to the professors notes or power point printouts, ability to reschedule tests if sick, access to restricted elevators, and transportation between campuses (main campus and education campus).

285,"Reliance on medication alone does not qualify you for disability, but inability to work does.  To be legally disabled it must be determined that he is no longer capable of *any* work, including sedentary work. They consider age, work history, diagnosis, and severity in considering what work he may be able to do.

If he can no longer work, the best thing to do is consult an attorney. They take their fees out of the disability back pay when you are awarded, and they are legally limited in how much they are allowed to charge. This will ensure you receive representation regardless of ability to pay up front.

Take getting a lawyer very seriously if your father needs to be on disability. I was seeing 7 specialists, had had multiple surgeries, and was losing my ability to walk when I was denied disability. Their own doctor assigned to examine me from the government stated I was disabled and they still denied me. You will almost certainly get denied without a lawyer.  

I won on appeal after I got a lawyer. The judge told me she had never seen so much evidence in a single case, apologized to me personally and threw the old judgement out, but took me THREE YEARS to get in front of her after the initial denial.

292,"Unfortunately, this happens a lot. DDS uses a specific process to adjudicate claims.  While all medical records are considered, those from the past year are weighted more heavily because it is a recent picture of how you are doing.  So they will get you into a CE with one of their doctors so they can add recent medical info to your case so it can be decided and closed.  You might want to reach out to your DDS examiner and inform them of your upcoming cardiology consultation, even if it is weeks or months out.  It might be better for your case to be paused now waiting for your cardiology results than denied before you see the specialist.  It would take longer to appeal or file a new claim than waiting until you’ve seen the cardiologist and had those tests.  Don’t be afraid of expressing that you’d like all the evidence available before they decide your case

If your heart is one of your disabling conditions and you’ve not seen a specialist for it recently, you need to do so ASAP.  My brother in law was having palpitations that were taking his breath at times.  His family doctor tried to get him into a cardiologist, but it was weeks out.  He finally went to the ER and the doctor there got him a priority appointment with that hospital system’s cardiology team.  If you are having problems, it might be worth a try to see if you could get in with a hospital system’s team of specialists.

The walkways are tighter and most of the older rides (especially in Fantasyland) will issue you a return time equal to the current standby wait time to come back through the exit. California Adventure is much newer and basically every single ride can accommodate your chair or ECV.

Disney World is very spread out with it's 4 parks and dozens of resorts. All buses, boats and Monorail can transport your wheelchair or ECV. You can also rent a Minnie Van for transport through the Lyft App but it's pretty pricey.

The Disability Access Service (known as the DAS Pass) is meant for any disabilities that prevent you from waiting in a standard line and works the same at both Disneyland and WDW. This means if a wheelchair solves your issues, you do not need to apply, as the lines can automatically accommodate you either by being wide enough for your chair to go through as normal or issuing a return time for the exit entrance, the Cast Members will let you know what to do at each attraction. If you do qualify for a DAS Pass, you will walk to the ride you wish to go on and the Cast Member will issue you a return time that is equal to the current standby wait time. You will then come back at your time (or any point after your time comes up, it does not expire until the end of the day) and you will go through the Fast Pass line. 

You can only hold one return time at a time. Disney no longer offers any kind of front of the line instant access like in the old days unless you go through the Make A Wish program.

Most parades and fireworks have wheelchair seating but it is first come first serve. Disneyland is busy basically all the time thanks to the locals, so get to events that are important to you early.

There are no discounts for disabled folks or their caretakers. 

For Disneyland we stayed at the Holiday Inn and Express on Manchester and it was an easy 8 minute walk to the park.

I highly recommend paying for the Max Pass system at Disneyland, it's $15 per person per day. This function lets you book your Fast Passes from your phone with the official App instead of having to physically travel to each individual ride and pulling a paper Fast Pass. You can also book a Fast Pass every 90 minutes instead of 2 hours, and it also includes ALL of your photos from the day for free. It's an absolute steal and a life saver when you have limited physical endurance.

WDW offers 3 free Fast Passes per day per person. You book these in advance: 60 days for onsite guests, 30 days for offsite guests. They must all be in the same park. Once you use all 3 for the day, you can book an additional Fast Pass depending on availability. You can use both DAS and Fast Passes at the same time together.

Feel free to ask me any questions, as I went to both WDW, Disneyland and Universal within the last year and am very current with their Disability policies.","[{'start': 2238, 'end': 2248, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 2214, 'end': 2222, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 1927, 'end': 1937, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 150, 'end': 160, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

328,"So to meet the definition  of disability for the std claim it’s different than what the doctor is thinking. For std you need to be disabled from your specific occupation. For example a fireman needs to lift 100 pounds, a retail clerk needs to be on their feet all day, etc. 

Your doctor tells std what restrictions you have. So for example “ needs ability to sit or stand for comfort as needed”.  Std (assuming they agree) then compares what you can’t do to what your occupation requires you do. Any overlap and you’re approved. 

You have what’s called a sedentary occupation with ability to wah. Very unlikely from a physical standpoint you have restrictions that preclude you from working. You could actually be in a wheelchair and still not precluded from your occupation as honestly it is not at all physically demanding. 

However it is mentally intensive. You have to maintain focus and problem solve. Likely express your thoughts to others fairly frequently. Painkillers will often help physical pain but at the price of dulling you mentally. Someone on opiate painkillers for example shouldn’t drive, work at heights or around machinery as part of their job due to safety risks. 

If you feel your pain and/or medication is making you unable to mentally perform your job I would have that discussion with your care provider. Explain you aren’t wanting to file for social security disability but you can’t meet demands of your specific job right now (as opposed to permanently).

339,"Here in the US people with disabilities sometimes have a choice depending on their abilities, ""cognitive levels"" and needs. Off the top of my head: living on your own with no support, living with family, living on your own with someone to help you get up and dressed and back into bed, care-homes, varying nursing facilities, supportive living and independent living.

I have worked in both an adult day program and an supportive/independent living agency. I have over 20 years of experience. Here is my perspective and opinion.

At the adult day program  the adults were not eligible to be in any work program because their disabilities were too profound. These adults were mostly non-verbal and needed support in most of their daily needs like toileting, eating and socializing. 

Of 50 clients, ages 18-75, only 15 had any family contact. Of those 15, only 5 lived at home. The remaining 10 lived in care homes or skilled nursing facilities because the family simply did not have the emotional, financial or physical ability to care for them properly anymore.

The rest were in care homes or a skilled nursing facility, and all were wards of the State. In other words, most were abandoned at a young age by the family. No contact at all. Their ages ranged from 25-75.

The clients I worked with at the agency fell into many areas. Most want to be away from family because, well they are adults. Or parents wanted their children to grow. Most had contact with family, visited at holidays and did the normal adult thing we all do: date, work, school, recreation.

1. My state shut down the state hospitals because of the rampant abuse and neglect (and cost). Those who did not return home or go into care-homes etc, were placed in agencies like ours. They were placed in apartments equipped with staff (me) who taught them decision making skills, and independence to the best of their ability. 

2. Adults still needing help who wanted to leave their family to gain more independence. Some are \*Conserved\*, others are not. Again, staff is there to assist them in their independence to the best of their ability. HOW MUCH help they need is assessed and the State deems how many staff hours they get. Most of these clients can and will find a work program of some sort.

3. Adults who are capable of living on their own, and capable of doing everything themselves with the exception of a few things go to Independent Living. Here a staff may pop in 1x a week to be sure all is well in the hygiene, cleanliness and bill paying department. They too are likely working in some capacity.

Off the top of my head: living on your own with no support, living with family, living on your own with someone to help you get up and dressed and back into bed, care-homes, varying nursing facilities, supportive living and independent living.

I have worked in both an adult day program and an supportive/independent living agency. I have over 20 years of experience. Here is my perspective and opinion.

At the adult day program  the adults were not eligible to be in any work program because their disabilities were too profound. These adults were mostly non-verbal and needed support in most of their daily needs like toileting, eating and socializing. 

Of 50 clients, ages 18-75, only 15 had any family contact. Of those 15, only 5 lived at home. The remaining 10 lived in care homes or skilled nursing facilities because the family simply did not have the emotional, financial or physical ability to care for them properly anymore.

The rest were in care homes or a skilled nursing facility, and all were wards of the State. In other words, most were abandoned at a young age by the family. No contact at all. Their ages ranged from 25-75.

The clients I worked with at the agency fell into many areas. Most want to be away from family because, well they are adults. Or parents wanted their children to grow. Most had contact with family, visited at holidays and did the normal adult thing we all do: date, work, school, recreation.

Yeah I think I definitely need to plan something to figure out how they are with this, I’m not sure how though, I believe they do tours for teen-ish ages every year, so I think I’ll go next year in my chair (they let us talk with the student board) and I can ask more about disability services and on potentially planning a meeting for discussing accommodations 

I found a studio apartment right next door, so I think as far as dorms go I’m gonna say “private accessible dorm all four years or being allowed to live off campus” I’d rather live on campus, but if they won’t give that then this would be alternative. 

Sorry about your college! That sounds like an awful situation. I guess the best mindset for me would be to achieve the highest I can. So going to the best college I can, but not if that college would result in me getting lower grades than another college purely due to their lack of accommodations. 

Yeah and I feel like an initial meeting would really set the tone for how I should expect to be treated there, that and their students. So if they’re putting up a fight and making every little accommodation seem like they’re being generous... I’m not gonna want that headache for their next four years on top of already existing stress of school and medical life. The current college students were great with making sure I wouldn’t have to go up stairs, and I always had at least one or two people ‘escorting’ me and getting me lined back up with the rest of the group, so that definitely gave me some positives about it. 

This one college my mom wants me to go to, I purely don’t want to go to because the students there aren’t who I wanna be or hang out with.

370,"TL;DR Assert yourself with staff members, don’t let the crowd roll over you, bring friends, have an out.

I am living with CP and have gone to a few festivals and had some fun nights of clubbing Hopefully what I have to say will be helpful.

I almost exclusively go to these events in my wheelchair. That said, I will commonly stand for the first and last five minutes or so to be eye level with my companions. I cannot stand for much longer than that and it sounds like we might have stamina issues in common.

I am not sure what your “many health issues” are so I don’t know that my experiences will be a helpful guide to you, but if you permit a long post here it is.

Being Treated Well

I’ve been treated badly a few times mostly out of ignorance and concern on the part of event staff.

Roughly half the time I go to festivals the security tell me that my wheelchair dance moves are dangerous and I need to stop. I explain that wheelies are my version of jumping up and down to the beat. If they don’t listen I wait for them to go away and than start the party again.

Several of my fellow ravers have treated me amazingly though. Many times someone has pushed me to the front with their crew when they saw I was struggling to move through the crowd. One time w bodybuilder lifted me up so I could see the lights and the stage (after making sure that was all good medically) 

I can’t speak for all music scenes, but EDM listeners are typically very accepting, kind, people with a few a-holes mixed in.


Access

It is very hard for me to get around festivals in my 
wheelchair. The events are crowded, grassy, and muddy. For the grass and mud I recommend bringing strong friends if you can. 

For the crowd I have another peace of advice CLAIM YOUR SPACE. Even nice people won’t see you in a crowd. If you need to go forward and people are in your way don’t be afraid to tap their ankles with your footplate. This will actually get them to recognize your presence. If you can’t weave through a crowd like and able person physical advertisements of your existence are a must.

Once you find a dance spot you like, stick with it for a while. Have your friends spread out and eventually the crowd will recognize that the space is not to be infringed upon.


Special Areas

I totally agree with you that paying more for a more accessible experience is a good thing if you have the option. Most of the outdoor festivals I’ve been to either don’t have specific areas for disabled people to dance, or they do, but those areas make you feel removed from the experience. 

Festivals do have VIP tickets. I’ve never been able to get those, but depending on the show they might give you more room to spread out.


Safety 

In my experience the crowd protects wheelchair users if they notice something wrong. One time a drunk guy knocked me out of my chair and a near by military guy  picked him up by his neck and threw him out of the club. 

That said, it’s always good to have an escape plan. I usually dance toward the back. In the wheelchair I can’t see anything anyway and there is roughly 10x more room per person in the back. 

I will also pick a specific exit route (if I’m in a club it’ll be a particular door, if I’m at a festival it’ll be making my way to a landmark outside of the action). All my friends know where I might go beforehand and I go there if it gets too crazy or my legs start cramping up.

Hope that helps! I’d absolutely love to go to events with any of you redditors should the opportunity arise.",,,,branposttower,,,1561420419,t5_2qhe8,t3_c3z92j,t3_c3z92j,2,1570875704,0,0,eryxw9k,disability,,,,,

404,"This article mentioned being asked about specifics of a disability, and how that’s not a legal question to ask. Yet I’ve been asked many times because my resume says “medical leave of absence” or “disability leave of absence.” It especially confuses people in person because my disability is a mental illness, and doesn’t have any outward physical signs, so they feel compelled to know more. 

Usually I just say that it was a personal medical issue that required several hospital stays, but that I’m looking to go back to work now that it seems the worst of it is over. Some have pried into it even more than that. Recruiters seem especially nosy.

I think I’ll probably decline to answer in the future, because it only seems to hurt my chances of being hired, and never has it helped.

I’ve been passed over on many jobs solely because I’m currently not working. Many employers seem to think I’m “tainted” because I have a break in employment, even when I list the reason why.

Since the establishments began eliminating plastic straws we have tried the alternatives but each have insurmountable issues. Steel reusable straws are hard to keep clean and rust free. Paper/pulp straws (probably hemp type ones too) are no good for hot coffee and fall apart and/or drop particles into the coffee which is a much inferior coffee experience compared to an able person’s.

I agree it would be great to eliminate plastic straws but the replacement should fulfill the utility of plastic straws. Just like places have handicap parking they can provide straws for people who need it, or disabled people can continue to have the extra step of buying them and bringing them, but an eco-friendly replacement of maybe firm hemp that mimics plastic would indeed be ideal if it were cheap enough",,,,kpjformat,,,1560064249,t5_2qhe8,t3_byd7z4,t1_eqhi0jr,10,1569251861,0,0,eqhmfxe,disability,,,,,

426,"I have CRPS. It’s a really long and difficult journey.  I have actual nerve damage now (worsened by a surgery) but when it first started there was no obvious trigger for the neuralgia and it left doctors confounded.  Six years later we’re quite sure that’s what it is, but it’s a rough diagnosis and not all doctors take it serious, because like you said, it doesn’t show up on any test.  Sometimes the affects of it show up on an MRI, but not in most cases. In my case, you can’t see the nerve damage, but you can see all the swelling that seems to have no source.

The thing about CRPS is that sort of by definition “nothing is wrong” with your tissues, but something is very wrong with your nervous system.

427,"I'm out of the dating game as I've been with a great girl for almost 5 years now.  We have a 1.5 year old daughter and are getting married later this year.  Back when I was dating though, I never specifically ruled out dating a physically disabled girl, because you never know what's going to happen, but I thought it wouldn't be ideal.  You could make it work, but transportation with two wheelchairs, living in an apartment with two chairs, sharing a bed, having sex, none of it would be ideal with two wheelchair-bound people, but if you really loved each other you could make it work.  So it's never something to rule out.  With that said, I have only ever dated able-bodied women.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, everyone gets frustrated with the online dating game whether you're disabled or not.  I have a coworker who is doing the online dating thing right now.  He's not a bad looking dude, pretty average, and he strikes out 9 times out of 10 when trying to initiate a conversation with a girl online.  Just put yourself out there and try to find a girl with similar interests.  Focus on your interests and not you disability.  I'm not a troll, but I'm also not the most attractive guy, and I've been with many beautiful women.  If I'm being honest, all of the women I've been with have been better looking than me, with the exception of maybe one.  We were pretty equal.  She was intense in bed, in an interesting way.  My fiancee though?  I thought she was way out of my league.  We hit it off though and like I said, we've been together for almost 5 years now and are really happy.  She's beautiful, smart, has many similar interests, gave me an amazing daughter, and is the best lover I've ever had.

437,"SEF-mom  Years ago when I was around 40 in ONE week I saw two doctors. One looked at me and shook his head and said I was too young for this (knee replacements). The next doctor looked at me and said I was too old for this (wisdom teeth extraction)! We put off the knee replacement until just walking into the grocery store for milk, I would be in so much pain I would be in tears. In the waiting to be able to do the knees, I was put on a NSAID which gave me several bleeding ulcers at once and meant that when diagnosed with RA I couldn't take the first line of medications offered - NSAIDS. So for that, I was in a pickle to start with. Then we got the teeth out as the one he as most concerned with had an abscess starting under it. That left me with nerve damage and not able to feel half my tongue, half my lower jaw. I aspirated as well as pocketed food. Eventually had to have micro-surgery that I had to fly out to the doctor. It was partially successful as I got about 80% sensation back. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm not going to wait around until I am too old or use stop-gap measures if something can be done now.

480,"Sorry to hear this, it sounds pretty stressful and overwhelming!

I would encourage you to talk to your parents about this. Be open and honest about how much it bothers you, and ask them to help you.

And bring specific ideas on how things can be improved. Maybe things like if you're in your room with the door shut then your siblings are not allowed to knock or bother you. Or if you have your headphones on outside your room then your siblings cannot bother you.

In addition, you could consider talking to your siblings about this. Sometimes younger siblings bother older siblings because they look up to them and just want to be around them. Maybe you could schedule specific one-on-one time with them, where they get your attention to just talk or play. That may help satisfy their desire to spend time with you and be more willing to give you alone-time.

I never asked about this because I could never articulate that something about me was different, it's not something you can't ignore like a physical disability, or a quantifiable difference

But I would see the quantifiable differences between myself and other kids and I would point them out to my mom. ""Mom, why do other kids have dads and I don't?"" And apparently it broke her heart so much she sent me to go visit my dad. This ended very badly for me.

If we could do it over I wish she could have explained diversity to me. That sometimes we are surrounded by diversity and sometimes we just ARE the diversity. Sometimes other people that aren't as diverse don't understand diversity, because there isn't enough around them. Sometimes they haven't learned about it yet, and because no one has taught them, they don't understand it. Kids tend to avoid things they don't understand, like idk broccoli.

Idk how to convey any of that to a child, though. But as you've noticed, kids do see the differences. They do take it in.

524,"Hey, I have CRPS. It sucks but there is definitely hope for learning to manage it. Some things to know, if you don't already:

1) With CRPS your sympathetic (flight or fight) nervous system is stuck ""on."" That means stress, anxiety, etc all increase the pain you feel. At the beginning, I had to work really hard at relaxing my sympathetic nervous system, but I've seen really good results, personally. I meditate twice a day and at the beginning I did restorative yoga or yoga nidra every day. Insight Timer, a meditation app, has a $5 course called ""methods for dealing with pain and illness"" that I got a LOT out of. I know that sounds like not enough, but trust me. 

2) A lot of doctors don't really understand CRPS. Plus, early on it can present differently.  Not everyone has every symptom. There is a document under the RSD organization website that has a list of doctors by area. I found my doctor there and he has been fantastic. Try a new doctor who will listen to you and work together *with* you.

3) There really is hope. My life looks different than it did, but I have learned how to pace myself and my abilities are increasing in time. I suggest talking to a pain psychologist who can help you cope, it was (and is) a life saver for me.

&gt; I believe depression is legitimate. But I also believe if you don't exercise, eat nutritious foods, get sunlight, get enough sleep, consume positive material, and surround yourself with support, you aren't giving yourself a fighting chance.

Someone's reply was this, and I couldn't agree more:

&gt; Pushing these kinds of insipid platitudes isn't ""helping"", it's just engaging in a popular redundancy others can agree to, so people appear to have done something... without actually doing anything significant. You're not saying anything special, you just want to hear yourself sound ""wise"" at the expense of easy prey.

Believing depression is ""legitimate"" doesn't come with throwing down a gauntlet for depressed people, especially when they are not motivated to do the things on the list. That's why it's depression and not just being sad.

As magpiegoo said, it's OK to acknowledge a struggle, and to lift people up who are having a hard time.

* **Accessible spots that are too far from the door**, I get that the ramp is way the fuck down there but I have my placard because I can't walk way the fuck down there - move the ramp and the spot!
* **Abuse**. This ranges from people not having proper plates or placards to people using their child's or partner's placard--or worst of al--in states where placards don't expire people use or sell placards from their dead grandparents.

* People that think it's okay to use any part of an accessible spot as a loading zone.

574,"Adults often hesitate to bring up the subject of a terminal diagnosis with children, for fear that such a discussion will frighten or even traumatize them. The truth be known, children are aware of both death and serious illness whether or not they have experienced it in their immediate family. They know about it from Fairy Tails, television shows including nature shows oh, the death of a pet, and so on. And while their parents may not realize it, children are aware of many things, including terminal illness, through their classrooms.
The ways in which children respond to a terminal diagnosis is shaped in large part by their social environment. Most prominent in this regard our parents, teachers, and family. Children are very sensitive to the emotional moods and nonverbal Communications of adults around them, and they sense when a parent or other relative is upset even if these adults think that they are unaware of what may be happening. Given that reality, it makes sense to us to open communication rather than avoiding it.
Obviously the level and type of discussion you have with a child about a terminal diagnosis will depend in part on the child's developmental stage and the nature of the specific diagnosis. Of course some terminal patients die quickly. Increasingly, however, we can expect children to be confronted with a parent, friend, or other loved one who battles cancer for years, who may experience a prolonged remission, and who may or may not experience a recurrence.
All records and research shows that it is helpful for families to talk about death and dying as a normal part of the life process, beginning when children are young, in order to help them clarify their concepts of the life death process. Tell them what they need to know. Explanations of a terminal diagnosis and what it means do you need to change depending on the child's developmental stage. Regardless of age, however, allowing for a child's questions, and encouraging the child to express feelings, can go a long way toward providing reassurance and establishing a supportive relationship. It's also okay to answer a question with I don't know if that is the truth. For younger children in particular it's important to explain how treatment may affect the patient, along with how their own routines may change. For example it's important to explain that chemotherapy may cause temporary fatigue or nausea as well as loss of hair. When mother told her young son and daughter the following: ""daddy will be taking me for treatment once a week and afterwards I will be sleepy and need to rest but the next day I will feel better. And Susan will come over to help out on those nights, and daddy will be getting your favorite takeout food on his way home from work. Also, I will lose my hair, but that will grow back after I am better, and in the meantime I will have to wear a wig.""
When a child is dying, the hardest talk is worth having. In fact, the failure to discuss death with children who are old enough to understand the concept and who wish to have the conversation can make it harder for all involved. Conversation could help children who are brooding silently suffer less as they approach death. It would also ensure parents know more about the children's final wishes.

644,"Hi, I also have POTS and EDS, as well as some other issues. On a day-to-day basis, I use crutches and various joint braces. Whenever I have to be ~fancy~ or I know that I’m only going to be out for a very short time and walking minimal distances, I may use a cane. I was prescribed a power wheelchair at the age of 16 because of the sheer severity of my joint issues. I’m now 17, nearly 18. Here are my thoughts:

I really would’ve rather had a manual chair, but my doctors insisted on a power chair because of the fact that my shoulders simply do not stay in socket—gravity alone can and will dislocate them, so pushing myself in a wheelchair was unlikely. 

I got the power chair off of Facebook for $300, great condition. Check Facebook first, if you’re comfortable...   thrift stores may not be bad for finding a manual chair either, but I’d definitely recommend getting fitted for one. 

Second of all, my power chair is easily 200 pounds. In other words, it can’t be transported. My battery completely failed this April, so now I’m stuck without a wheelchair. I’m definitely getting a new battery and I’m going to try and get a manual chair at a thrift store before college.

I know you didn’t say you were considering a power chair. I wasn’t either until I was prescribed one.

645,"I just want to give a heartfelt THANK YOU to this community for this open discussion about identity. I am not disabled, but I work with folks who have a language disability called aphasia. Aphasia means the person experienced a brain injury (usually a stroke) and now has difficulty communicating: talking, understanding, reading, writing.

The people I work with are intelligent, funny, kind- they run the gamut of wonderful qualities - and also some unpleasant ones! - They are such normal people, except that they share the amazing fact that have a hard time communicating. 
Because of their disabilities, it can be very challenging for many of them to fully and explicitly express their opinions on abstract subjects like ""identity"".  I would love to know what my clients feel about their disability status; how it makes them feel in the world. I'd love to be able to provide support for them, wherever they are in the process of identifying with their disability. But because of the very nature of their impairment, I'm often unable to know the nuances of what they feel.

So I really appreciate hearing from people who can express themselves. It gives me more perspectives on what some of the people I work with may be going through.

I grew up in a strict Christian household. I’ve definitely done my fair share of wrestling with those beliefs. But I don’t believe God will strike you down for not believing.

But the God I believe in is no longer implementing the Old Testament “strike you down and poof you’re dead” because Jesus came to change that. Jesus came to put an end to the old law and makes it easy to be freed from all that. 

I know I’m not saying it perfectly but that’s what I understand to be true. God is not going to punish you for not believing in him. Give yourself freedom to explore what you want to believe.

677,"exactly correct. I don't know all of the answers, but I'd say that the entire safety net needs to be redesigned to encourage people to get off of it (perhaps, but not necessarily, including SSDI); maybe a person gets greater benefits for working, than for not? but maybe not. Certainly, having an hard 'cut off' line is absurd. ""get a small pay increase, but lose hundreds of dollars worth of benefits,"" is a dangerous incentive to work less, work less hard, and not seek out progression in any work environment. 

It should absolutely be a gradual cutoff. Maybe it's still an hard line for being accepted, but once a person's on the social program, gradual decline in benefits for increased earnings is the only intelligent way to go, at least which I've heard of.

I had heard from one social worker, but I've never seen nor heard anything else about it, that a person can be on ""partial SSDI"" - where their medical is covered, but their wages are not. That was back when I could still work, but my medical expenses were ramping up, and beginning to be a real strain on the family (we've kind of just accepted major debt as a way of life, for now.... which isn't any good, but it's that or... you know.... die.) 

Anyway, I like that kind of idea: and SSDI program which actually can be modified for each person's needs, maybe ""up to"" a certain point... but.... we should never have to worry about fully losing benefit because we accidentally worked more than we're allowed to. at worst, it should be like... ""you earned 60$ more than you're supposed to, so we're going to send you 60$ less this month"".

688,"I fell ill at the end of my first year of college.  Because of the rarity of my disease, it took 3-years to finally reach a diagnosis.  I understand wholeheartedly just how hard a process applying for Social Security can be.  Here are my recommendations.....

&amp;#x200B;

Right off the bat, expect to be denied.  When that happens, appeal the decision.  Do not reapply.  If you reapply, your application date changes, which will directly affect your backpay once awarded.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not get a lawyer to assist you with the process, unless it comes down to a State Hearing, at which point it can be useful.  If you can do it by yourself, do it by yourself.  Any lawyer will take a large percentage of your backpay.  When I received my backpay, it all went to bills that had been piling up for years due to my inability to maintain gainful employment.

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot submit too much information.  The more, the better.  Diagnostics are the key.  X-rays, bloodwork, urinalysis.  Any test that has been done that lends useful information, no matter how small, is what you need.  You can also ask people who have seen your health deteriorate to write testimonials.  Just be sure that you're submitting honest and truthful testimonials from people that know you and your health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't know how old your parents are, but if they are both of retirement age, it may be worth looking into the Disabled Adult Child (DAC) program.  Basically, if you were disabled before age 22 and have been unable to reach the necessary credits for full Social Security benefits, you can use a parent's work history as your own.  Doing so will not affect your parents' benefits whatsoever.  The fact you're married may keep you from being eligible for this program though, though it's still worth looking into if it means a higher monthly check.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her once why I didn't have legs. She was not a religious person by any means, so she never gave me the ""God works in mysterious ways""  crap. She was totally honest and upfront: Disease. She told me ""you know how sometimes I get the flu? That is a disease. Remember when you're throat was in pain and you couldn't talk? Disease. Some diseases are easy to get by. Some others are not. Cancer is one of those. Sometimes you can take a pill and that'll do. Sometimes you have to do something harder."" Something on those lines, it's not an exact word by word quote. I asked her what would've happened if they didn't cut my legs. ""You would've die, and I would be very sad"".  But she also made sure that I understand that just because I don't have legs that means I'm useless. There is a park near home, and we would walk through it to get home. She used to tell me ""see that tree?, they're cutting some branches because it's getting too big. Buy even without all of its branches, it still produces oxygen, a shadow, and shelter for some animals"". Again, something on those lines.  It took me a while to understand those concepts, but it made me feel better.",,,,AlwaysSunnyDragRace,,,1560969204,t5_2qhe8,t3_c26b8j,t3_c26b8j,2,1570293800,0,0,erkqjuw,disability,,,,,

739,"Keep in mind as well there's casual dating and then there's the serious shit. And in a lot of places, disability supports make the serious shit a bitch and a half. where I'm living, for example.

My only problem is I can't see my own hand in front of my face. But, if I quit this job and don't have something else lined up (I'm not, but play hypothetical for a second), that means all I'll have is disability income. If I meet an able-bodied person, we hit it off, decide hey let's give it a shot, and say we get to the point where we start talking about moving in. That conversation will go cold quick, fast and in a hurry, for one major reason. The second I start living with a partner who's working, disability supports take a walk. Now, in my case I have no medication or anything, but if I had, I'd have still kept as much of the coverage for that as I'd be used to having, but I'd have 0 income of my own. I would be entirely dependent, not physically but financially, on my partner. Because I'm working I'm not completely reliant on disability payments, so if the little I got took a walk I'd be fine--particularly considering moving in with someone would mean I'd keep more of my paycheck. But someone else who's not in my position would be screwed.

Now, let's look at that from the other side. I make $16/hour. In some places that's a nice chunk of change. This is not one of those places. I can afford to support me on $16/hour (I have no savings, but I make ends meet), but no way in hell could I afford to support two. No matter how much I loved someone, I couldn't afford that someone to live with me on what I make right now. If that someone isn't capable of working, it would suck, but moving them in anyway would be probably the most impractical thing I could do--for both of us.

My current GF and I have actually had that conversation--she's not in a wheelchair all the time, but there are days when she is. I'd have moved her in already, but at the moment she's not working and on disability. so on the one hand, moving her in would make her more independent--she'd have me there to lend an extra hand on days she needs it, but on the other hand, it would cost her the independence she already has. I don't want my partner to have to ask me for permission to go for coffee with a friend. And if you have to ask me to throw you $10 so you can go for coffee, you're basically asking me for permission. That's not cool, and way too freaking easy to abuse like mad.

Now, to more directly address your question, only about 6 years later, I don't know what kind of challenges you face on the daily basis. I can't--I'm not you. Presumedly (you can correct me if I'm wrong, of course) you've got some kind of home care service that comes in to help, or you're still living with parents, or somesuch. If you go the dating someone else in a wheelchair route, she'll probably be in exactly the same situation--either she's got some kind of home care service, or she's living with someone that helps with stuff like that. If it became more serious than casual dating, you'd have to work around those questions. The trick, like dating an able-bodied person, is to find the workaround that actually works for both of you and doesn't leave either one of you getting the short stick. Maybe, like my GF and I, moving in doesn't become an option until much further down the road, when you've figured out how to answer the sticky questions--like ""Can we find a service or something that will get us both out of bed?"". Maybe moving in doesn't happen at all. If that's what you're comfortable with, and if you can manage the risks, then I'd say maybe don't explicitly rule out dating someone in a wheelchair. You may not know if you can until you've met the right person, if you meet the right person. But also keep in mind, that woman in a wheelchair you swiped left on? 10 gets you 20 the same thought went through her head at least once. So at the very least, you know that if it gets to a point where you need to have that conversation it won't necessarily be as awkward a conversation as it would be if you were having it with someone else. Sure, it might not work out. But if you never try, you guarantee it won't work out. It's up to you if you're okay with that.

767,"one of the things which bugs me is the 'either on or off' attitude to ssdi.

What I mean is that the setup, as it stands, is designed to ensure that those who are disabled (if they can get onto the insurance program to begin with, which I'm still working on.... it's *only* been... 5 years since I could work? Something like that....), it's designed to ensure that the disabled can never *leave* the program.

Many people could work, being disabled, but not sufficiently to earn a living. There is a token allowance for this in the system, but it's a hard line: make more than *x*, and you're off.

Many people could work, maybe even enough to earn a living, but couldn't afford medical bills without being a part of the system. So it's better to stay entirely impoverished with medical coverage (which is financially crippling, even with medicare...), then to be destitute because of it.

The entirety of our social welfare system works in the same manner. 

Did you get a pay raise of 200$ as month? Great! Good for you! Even though your take home is only 150 (after taxes), you're now going to get cut off from your $300/month worth of food stamps. That's what you get for working hard for that promotion. 

You're working now? Good for you! No more medicaid, even if your job is just a part-time, minimum wage job. Clearly you're doing well enough to cover your medical expenses.

It just ticks me off. One of the most important long-term care things for a person with disabilities is to give up as little autonomy as possible. Our system is designed in a way to incentivize people on the social safety net to *stay* on it - long term. It's not just that there's no incentive to move on from it, the system *discourages* people from doing just a little better, from growing and developing their skills. 

And worse, the more people there are living on the system, the more bogged down and short-funded it is for those who *must* rely on the system, long term. And for those of us who are disabled, but want to work the couple of hours a week that we can (in my case, there's no rhyme or reason to those hours, if I get them at all.... so.... that sucks), it's better for us to *not*, because we risk being screwed at our next ssdi evaluation. 

The poverty among the disabled is part and partial to our system, no doubt. If we have to spend a great portion of our funds on medical care and living adjustments (a wheelchair accessable car, for example, is a bloody fortune), then there's not a lot left over for living. The further we are from public access to all the things, the harder that's going to be... though.... living away from the city has advantages too (like lower housing costs, more sociable neighbors, etc.... 

Still, the more we incentivize the system to discourage working, even if it's only a little, the more isolated and impoverished we remain. 

But there's no political will to alter the system... and insofar as the will exists, there's hardly a consensus on *what* to do about it (I've got almost no expectation that I would agree with most here, for example).",,,,jaredlanny,Myriad ,,1560383731,t5_2qhe8,t3_bzvtts,t3_bzvtts,7,1569757948,0,0,eqyi8n8,disability,,,,,

776,"**tl:dr:** I work 6-8 hours on minimum wage. I travel either 3 hours a day by bus to work *or* I pay 60% of my wages on uber fare. I feel trapped, The energy I spend on cheap bus travel takes away from energy I could use to work more hours, the energy I save by ubering means I could work more, but the wages I make don't cover the cost of ubering to work all the time. I don't qualify for travel reimbursement from welfare/disability because I'm ""not working hard enough"". But reimbursing my travel would allow me to work harder!

------------------------

I'm not on a true disability pension, I'm in Australia and for those who understand our system i'm on Newstart with a 15 hour benchmark, meaning after being medically assessed by the welfare office they have determined that my disability limits me to 15 hours per week of work, a decision that I agree with, I can ""work"" 15 hours a week and this is a good balance of challenging myself without pushing myself into flare ups or utter exhaustion.

I had a job that was 15-18 hours per week, It was consultant work so my travel was 100% covered by the company, they'd order me a taxi for door-door service. So I know I can work 15 hours a week. That role only ran for a year, and afterwards I was between jobs for about 1 month, during that time the welfare agency gave me taxi-vouchers for ""Job interviews"", ""Job readiness"" and ""health maintenance"" meaning if I needed to go to the doctors, or go to the shops to buy interview clothes or go to the library to print off resumes, or go to an interview, the transport was direct (door to door via taxi) and 100% paid for by welfare. This is not ""special treatment"" many people without disabilities who are on Newstart qualify for petrol vouchers or bus fare, it's means based.

I now work as a community support officer/adult education teachers aide, my employer is very understanding and accommodating and does what they can to help, but it's a non-profit and there's only so much they can do. I work 3 days a week, just over 2 hours per day, helping to run various social programs for the community.

The problem I'm having is travel. I live only ~6km from the community centre so It's very local work. But there is no bus that goes directly there, I have to walk 1km to the bus stop closest to my house, then take a 20 minute bus, then transfer to a 15 minute train, then another 40 minute bus (this bus stop is fortunately right out front of my work). With the way the transit timetable works, when i'm including wait times at the station/stop for my connecting service this is a 90 minute commute one way - Assuming everything is running on time, last month it took me 4 hours to get home due to trains not stopping at the station and buses not stopping when I flagged them (It's a common issue in Melbourne) So I'm spending 3 hours commuting to my 2 hour job. that's 15 hours a week of doing something related to either getting to work or being at work.... 15 hours is what the welfare office agrees I can do in regards to work.

It's exhausting. I do not have the energy to spend 3 hours sitting on uncomfortable buses, waiting on uncomfortable metal chairs at bus stops, or walking 2km each day.

I am at my limit with my 6-8 hours work because the commute takes up the energy I could otherwise dedicate to working longer shifts.  Because as I am not hitting my paid work benchmark, I do not qualify for any mobility assistance, taxi-vouchers etc.

I am finding myself forced to take an uber at least one way, so I can arrive at work fresh and full of energy, then I will take the bus home to save money, and crash when I get home, with little energy and pain tolerance available to prepare food, clean my house or shower, I am managing at the moment, but barely.

Some days I over-do it at work, I don't have the ability to get home via bus, I have to order an uber home. I'm paid minimum wage for my award group. This means that if I uber both ways 50-60% of my daily income from paid work goes directly to my travel expenses (regular daily commute is not tax-deductible).

My income from work is basically pocket money, while my rent is paid entirely by my Newstart allowance (and it's over 50% of my allowance too!) When my welfare case manager asks why I'm not pushing for my 15 hour benchmark and I'm finding myself at my limits at 6-8, I have to remind them that I am doing up to 9 hours of travel on top of my 6-8 hours work, and for someone with a disability, commuting is just as exhausting as working, in fact, my commute is *harder* on my body than my paid work.

If I could uber to and from work all the time I think I would be able to increase my hours to 15, But right now I'm stuck, I don't have the energy on hand to increase my hours to increase my income to be able to afford to uber both ways, and right now I don't have the income to uber both ways to better allocate my energy so I can increase my hours.

When my case manager says ""well just work 4 hours a day instead of 2, You're getting 2x the income and you're still only having to pay uber 6 times a week the same fare you currently do"" .... I understand the maths, But am I just supposed to pull the energy needed for those 2 additional hours of work out of my ass? I don't have that right now.

Also, There isn't 4 hours of work *to do* at my current job, the programs I help run go for 90 minutes, we run 1 program a day, Set up and pack up time only takes 30-45 minutes, an hour tops. After that everyone goes home. I could sign up to run programs on the 2 days I am currently not working (so doing 5 programs a week instead of 3) but that means travelling to/from work an additional 4 times a week, which does not solve my ""I'm  doing too much travel"" problem. Getting a second job could work, but again, i'd be travelling to a whole new jobsite, and the mental exhaustion that would come from working for two different employers, managing my time between the two, learning a whole new system, etc, I don't have the energy for that in my current situation.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1560061218,t5_2qhe8,t3_bycstc,t3_bycstc,7,1569250270,0,0,eqhjjd8,disability,,,,"**tl:dr:** I work 6-8 hours on minimum wage.

779,"Yeah, as far as we're aware she's got no actual nerve damage, and while there's swelling when it decides to act up we've yet to time it well enough that it'll show up when they get her into the machine. She's had more MRIs, ultrasounds and all that junk than you can shake a stick at.

You're right, though, in that there's nothing actually physically/medically wrong with you. On good days, like what she's having right now, you wouldn't know she has the condition--she's up and walking and doing all the things anyone else does on the daily. The rest of the time, that's what the wheelchair's for.

As if that's not confusing enough, lately it's developed a new thing--we're not sure if it's actually better or worse. It used to be that when she's having an episode, that's it--she's down for a few days, or a few weeks, and if she's got anywhere to be it's into the chair with her. Now, if something happens to set it off (we have no idea what will set it off, but that's another story entirely), within a few hours she's relatively back to normal. Literally she's gone from being up and walking to being in her chair to being up and walking again in a 24-hour period.

819,"Cast of characters, Me (Rach), my sister in law (sil), Sister in law's Mom (Abbie), Karen-(lipsense, hairspray, chunky highlights that scream ” my hairdresser is 50+”, and a humility problem). 

So, every year four of the kids in our family participate in a Bible knowledge competition, and the national championship is this huge event where thousands of dollars worth of prizes and scholarships are given out, and there is this amazing community vibe. My brother and his wife run a small business, and they have four kids, don't use sitters or nannies, and this event is enormous. Since I don't work and I have no kids, I go to help out, keep the kids entertained, and I get to travel ”on my own” without my husband but also not be completely helpless if something happens. 

The event is amazing, and the people who attend the event are helpful, wholesome, nobody swears, nobody hits on married women, nobody jumps on the elevator before the disabled person waiting (like carnival cruisers do all the damn time), nothing gets stolen, and it's just a really great vibe. I've never had to ask for help, it's offered in droves, and I really love going. 

It's normally held in an event center/resort. Last year, that changed. They changed the location to a megachurch, and for whatever reason the city fire Marshall had checked the night before and had been concerned about strollers. That's fine, that's normal. 

What wasn't normal, and what is really, really soul-crushing, is that in the design of most church buildings, disabled people are an afterthought. I could look the other way if this was ”ye olde clapboard church of legalism,” or a place that was built in a metal barn and then converted, but, it wasn't. It was a multi-floor, multi acre building, with new finishes, elevators, and you could easily fit 10,000 people in the building at any given time. What wheelchair seats were available were at the back of the room, and not elevated so as to be able to see when the people in front of you stand, which is like half of a church service. 

And in those back spaces, was camera equipment, lighting, rigging, and producer booths. I would have had to sit in the back row of the second floor. So, like I have at every one of these before, I sat in the aisle next to my family and the kids. 

Karen worked for the organization, and approaches . She squats next to me, grabs the arm of my chair to balance (which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine), and said, ”We can't have anything in the aisle, it's a fire hazard.” I said, ”Oh ok, I won't set anything down.” 

K-”No, you need to move. We can't have strollers or anything blocking the aisle.” 

”I am not something, I'm someone, if there's a fire I'm obviously going to head to the fire exit like  a normal human person.”

K-""No, no, we can't have anyone in the aisle.”

” You're in the aisle right now.” 

K- “But I- ”(at this point she stopped herself from saying something that would get her decked if I weren't a lady.) ” It's not my decision, it's up to the Fire Marshall.”

” Great, can you please inform him a wheelchair is not a stroller? I'd love to have grounds for a discrimination suit. Where is he?”

K ""No he was here last night. If he comes back he'll write a ticket.”

” Sounds great, send him straight to me, I'm happy to take this to court.” 

Now, if this were a small space, I might have seen the point, but you could have fit two more wheelchairs chairs across the aisle. I wasn't in the way at all. I asked behind me if I was blocking line of sight, I had intentionally sat in a wider, exterior aisle.

K- ” We can help you into a seat and put your wheelchair back with the strollers.”

” well what if there's a fire? What then?”

K-” We just really need to move you,”

” I can be anywhere a person with legs can be, legally.  For the last time, I'm good here. Thanks.”

”Ok well I'll have to let the director know!” 

To which I gave the southern woman reply of ”Well I look forward to hearing from him.” which is as close to ""Get Bent” as I will say in a house of God in front of children. 

Nobody staff wise said a word to me after that for the rest of the night, but not only had she made me mad, she'd made my SIL mad, which set off a hilarious chain reaction of her Mom (Abbie) getting mad, and between the three of us, it was over for Karen.

 My sister in law and I are two peas in a pod. We get asked if we're sisters, same height, same eye color, and some of her kids favor me looks wise, but no, no incest here. But we both have these personalities that are light and relaxed and easygoing, until we're really, really not, and our extended family has been through the wringer, so we are very, very protective of one another. 

Now, unbeknownst to me, Karen had pulled similar antics the year before. Because of their field of work and the horror stories they've seen, my Bro &amp; Sil have very, very specific and inflexible rules. Their kids are never, ever behind closed doors with adults not on ”the list,” of blood related and extremely trusted people, and the kids are not allowed in rooms with closed doors unless they're the only one in the room. (No more than one kid in the bathroom at a time, etc.) I guess you deal with enough CPS court cases, and you realize not everyone can be trusted. So, there's a part in competition where the kids answer a judge's questions, one kid, multiple adults, no spectators allowed. So my SIL says she needs to be able to see in a window, but she's not allowed to hear. So she had obtained permission, etc. Well, Karen tried to stop her, SIL is unwavering. Karen turns and loudly starts badmouthing these ”Overprotective” blah blah blah, background checks.... And then after my niece left and came to sit with her dad, SIL ripped Karen a new one. Told her about what they do for work, how background checks don't mean s*, etc. 

So SIL remembers Karen pulled that the year before, and now she's picking on me, and SIL is so beyond angry it's nuts. So she tells her mom about the year before, and what she said to me, and so Abbie pulls Karen aside at the end of the night, and specifically asks to talk to her and the director. Abbie is the nicest lady you'll ever meet, sometimes to a fault. 

I'm paraphrasing, but basically Abbie says with the director listening, ”Ya know, Karen, you've just really upset Rach, she is a cancer survivor, she spends all of her time either helping her community or fighting her illnesses. She makes a huge effort to be here and you were really unkind. She has a right to be where she is comfortable. Now last year, Karen, you were really ugly to my daughter. I have known Rach for 20 years and I have never heard her do or say anything hurtful or spiteful. So now last year we had a problem and this year, we have a problem, and we come here for fellowship and to encourage these kids to know their Bible, so let's bear that in mind.”

Karen objects, ”I don't remember being rude to your daughter,” 

And Abbie says, ” I'm sure you don't, because you do this all of the time, so it's not a memorable thing to you.”

Mic. Dropped. 

So, the next day was a day that's usually really long, and being that I tire easily, I didn't attend the full day so I would be well enough to travel, go to the wrap event, etc on the last couple of day. 

My Brother is a Lawyer, his Stepfather in law is a lawyer, and his brother in law is a lawyer. So they all look at case law, Abbie is pulling up information, and I find an interesting article about fire history, and never in the history of the world has a person in a wheelchair been a factor in a fire related death or injury of another person.

An email about the incident is sent, and what do you know, I get an apology, and a call that there's an area that is *already blocked with a boom camera* and they've reserved the seats there to accommodate us.

I don't know if I'll go back this year, I know the kids are doing more school and one had a minor health issue, and is leveling into a harder age division, so who knows what will happen this year, but the thing that really, really bugs me about it is that in a place that has felt like a home among strangers, there's a Karen trying to pull a power move on a disabled woman because she lacked the empathy and rational thought to differentiate between a stroller and a person. .",,,,Rach5585,,,1561190091,t5_2qhe8,t3_c3gvmh,t1_errrwct,3,1570578806,0,0,erryryn,disability,,,,"Cast of characters, Me (<PERSON>), my sister in law (sil), <PERSON> in law's Mom (<PERSON>), Karen-(lipsense, hairspray, chunky highlights that scream ” my hairdresser is 50+”, and a humility problem).

851,"I have not done an ALJ hearing, but here's my advice.

[You have a right to representation.](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10075.pdf) I would recommend a disability lawyer if you're going to face a judge. A disability lawyer works on contingency based on your potential back-pay, and doesn't require any cash up-front. It is highly in your interest to hire one. Defending yourself in any situation is not advised, because the balance of power is strongly in the judge's favor.

My disability is also psychological, bipolar disorder. I got approved in a relatively short time in the second application. The things that helped me were a long medical history and a spotty work history after a steady career.

Therapist visits, psychiatrist visits, and hospital stays can help establish the medical part of your disability. Every medical provider has to make a diagnosis and treatment plan, and the more providers that concur on your diagnosis and disability, the better. If you haven't been getting psychological help due to financial hardship, your lawyer can help you prove that.

Unsuccessful Work Attempts (UWAs) help establish your disability's impact on your inability to work. UWAs are jobs that are six months or less, and your disability is the reason you left the job. It helps to have multiple UWAs, and also to have tried multiple levels of work, such as easier or lighter-duty jobs. If you don't have many UWAs, or haven't worked in a long time, a lawyer can help explain your situation to the judge.

888,"I was diagnosed with RA at 18, just a week after HS graduation. I've tried most of the biologics out there, some of them multiple times. In that time I've been through 5 rheumatologist and 3 pcp, so make sure you accurately list all the drs you've been to. Don't hesitate to list any dr, even if you don't think they have anything to do with your primary condition. 

It took 3 months - and luckily no appeal, for me to get approved. Because I was so young (32) I started working with a lawyer from the beginning. It shocked everyone that it came through so quickly. They did have me examined by their doctor and I had about 15 years of tests, medications tried and failed, and job histories of excessive FMLA use. At the time I applied my SED rate was in the 90s, and my dr was seriously freaking out. 

I'm coming up on 2 years in September, so I'm sure I will be called in for a review sooner rather than later. 

Advice would be to not hold back with legitimate complaints. Don't put on a brave face with the doctor by trying to minimize the pain and other symptoms. There are also some apps out there to document symptoms so you can share them, but if they aren't in your medical records, they aren't documented. Contact some local disability lawyers, they are capped on what they can charge, and operate on contingency so they can tell you if you are likely to win.

From what you have said about your interactions though, the guy you are dating doesn't sound like he is a fetishist. It is completely normal for someone you are dating to ask some questions about your disability when you are both in the getting to know you stage so don't let that scare you off. As myself and others have said, you should only be concerned if the questioning is of an extremely intrusive nature i.e., how do you toilet and can I watch.

Honestly, I don't think it is rude to ask if you are the first disabled person he has dated. Just try and do it in a way so that it doesn't sound like an interrogation. Asking some serious questions up front can save some heartache later. E.g. I dated a guy once who I never asked any serious questions of early on and lets just say it would have saved a lot of time. When I finally did ask after some serious red flags, it turned out I was an 'experiment' where he just wanted to see if ""he had it in him"" to date a disabled person and see past it.

Yes, it's possible they are wrong and you can get an second opinion.

More importantly, these diagnoses are just that, diagnoses. They do not define you and are only one way of measuring potential for academic success, not your actual success.

If you are planning to attend college, do it. Make sure to connect with the Disability Services office at the college you choose to attend and ask for accommodations. (Source: this is what I do for a living). 

I have accommodated students with any mixture of those disabilities, and with much lower IQ scores and they have graduated. Make sure to ask about accommodations when visiting colleges to find out what support is available.

966,"Have you heard this quote  ""You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take."" ?  The sad part is that many people realize this when they get old and re-evaluate their lives, so they start having regrets off all the things they could have done , but didn't because of fear, insecurity etc.  So the question is are you gonna sit in the corner going "" Just fuck my life.. "" or take the opportunities that pop-up everyday and you never know where those would lead you.  You are not a fool, you just have insecurities. If anything most of the people i know get rejected 95% of the time , so thats like a general rule and most of the time they don't know why and ask themselves - am I  stupid, ugly, smelly etc.  Actually being a fool  might be a enormous bonus, because when smart people get rejected they start to  over analyze everything and search for all the reasons they are undatable or failed  etc. and get really discouraged to try it again. While stupid people are usually not so deep to ask themselves  "" why"" and just continues until they find somebody and they usually do.  My point is that idk if you would find someone and idk if the reason for that would have anything to do with your disability, but please don't settle for "" well this is how my life has to be, because im dissabled"" , don't give up on your dreams, don't be ok with settling down with what you got.

974,"SEF-MOM  I take it you want to sell your artistic work as a business? Or make money via the internet which is certainly possible. Any legitimate business can hire a business manager to run the business. That person could also be asked, I suppose to pay the business owner's own personal bills after all expenses, including the managers' salary, from the business has been deducted. You can not, with either the IRS which you seem to be forgetting, and SSD have your personal expenses of any kind hidden as business expenses so that your income is measly looking. But to only pay the medical costs you have, I don't know. You are allowed to have on your tax returns your health insurance costs deducted on your 1040 deducted from your business income as well as a portion of your medical bills. Are you wanting to do this because you honestly have trouble keeping up with your bills and the medical ones slip by the wayside? I only ask because unless you are making oodles of $$$$ at whatever it is you are doing, paying someone to do this book work, etc. is going to take a chunk out of the business and you want to hire someone that knows what they are doing, not a friend/relative who is volunteering. Those kinds of situations can end up with the 'friend' embezzling more than their share. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you actually been declared disabled and started to receive benefits? If you haven't you need to understand that it takes two years after SSD begins that MC kicks in (I wasn't eligible for Medicaid so I don't know if you can get that in the meantime), however, once MC kicks in, you need to get a supplement policy to cover what MC doesn't and the  prescription plan D. With those three, other than co-pays on meds (and no dental, vision other than medical vision problems, dentures are covered by MC) all of my medical bills are completely covered. I get a Remicade IV every 6 weeks that run thousands of dollars per IV (total charged $11,000/each!), MC pays its part my AARP supplemental policy pays the rest - I never pay a nickel of the cost. So while some think they don't need the policies, I can't afford to not pay that $200/month to AARP, they pay out every 6 weeks $1127! Yes, my biggest expense is my insurances because I am married and my husband has been working up to recently when his health just won't let him anymore. My in-laws get their insurance paid for through Medicaid and they don't pay nearly what I do. I guess what I am saying is once on MC your medical bills, assuming you pick the right insurance providers and supplement, can most likely trickle down to nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

As to being too poor to buy coverage, you will have part of the cost of MC taken directly from your SSD check monthly. SSD is set up to understand the needs of someone that is disabled and should be able to answer your questions. Trying to hire a manager to be sure that your medical expenses are covered, I think is a very expensive way to deal with finances unless you are making so much that even declared disabled, you are making more than SSD will allow for benefits. Many people are completely disabled and make more money than many of us, and still, work regular 40/hour week jobs, etc. and do not get SS checks because they make too much. I still think it sounds whether you think so or not that you are trying to make an end-run around the SSD and Medicaid and Medicare rules as well as IRS. Especially since on top of this person paying your medical expenses, their cost will also be taken out of the business for what they do and would make your business look as if you are making far less than you really are. Someone making say,  $1000 off the internet should not have to pay someone to handle the money for them. Earn much more than that and SS will really be taking a close look at what you are doing.

And if you don’t, having a psychologist vouch for that is very important, because you don’t want symptoms written off as psychological when it’s turns out they’re not.  Even stress and anxiety can provoke real symptoms as changes in adrenaline &amp; cortisol have affects on your body.

Regardless, please go see a mental health professional qualified to give a diagnosis, so that if you *do* have conversion disorder they can treat you, and if you *don’t* have conversion disorder they can inform your doctors that your symptoms are physiologically based.

986,"sef-Mom  -- So very sorry to hear this! I ran into this the first time during my disability hearing for SSD. Suddenly they are reading the results of a doctor's evaluation that I had never seen, who practices in a city I haven't lived in since I was a baby (I was in my late 40s at this point) and the city was a good 8 hours away. According to this doctor who had NEVER seen me and which apparently the judge based her decision on, I could crawl, kneel, etc. At that point I had two artificial knees and kneeling on them is horrifically painful.  I can't knee, nor can I crawl, and if I fall it takes hubby and me usually 15-20 minutes to get me back up on my feet! Is this someone that can crawl? How can these decisions be made by doctors who have never seen us? It took a whole additional year to be approved for SSD which meant I had no Medicare coverage, no money coming in, etc. Because I was an RN as well as a college graduate, they saw no reason to help me train me for a different career that would fit in with my abilities as well as my disabilities, especially the need for a several hour nap every afternoon. Can you imagine telling a boss daily, I have to go take my nap now? 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted many of you go through far worse than I do, but to be told that I am not disabled because I could do a job that is not available anywhere in our county nor could I drive to it if there were such a job - watching packages go by  on a CCTV at a UPS sorting center! It doesn't matter if there isn't a job within 1000 miles that will accommodate you if you can do it you aren't disabled. I'd like to see that judge when she comes to the point of being disabled herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the problem is the people that set these laws and enforce them have no imagination, compassion, or understanding what each person's needs are. One hospital where I worked 2nd shift,  we had a 1st shift employee that was in a motorized w/c. If she would go out at night but then had to use the bathroom, would have to get in her conversion van, drive to the hospital, come find me so I could help her get onto the toilet, wipe her up and get her back into the w/c and back she would go back to her night out. Apparently, she didn't ask for help from her friends. The same situation that the poster has said. It isn't all about them being taken advantage of, but most would have no idea the proper method of moving someone in and out of a w/c.",,,,sefreeman,,,1560099576,t5_2qhe8,t3_byjy7p,t3_byjy7p,5,1569283093,0,0,eqj64wh,disability,,,,,

Take a look at question three.  There may be laws in your city or state, which protect the rights of those w/ emotional support animals.  Make certain that you aren't infringing against those, if they exist.  

As to your question regarding what types of answers you can expect, you should be prepared for any number of responses.  [Here's](https://www.psychdogpartners.org/resources/work-tasks/work-task-list) a fairly comprehensive list of assigned tasks service animals may be trained to do.  There's also a PDF print-out available on that site.  And, [here](https://www.iaadp.org/psd_tasks.html) is a document pertaining to tasks fulfilled by psychiatric service animals.  Be certain to note the legal distinction between an emotional support animal and a psychiatric service animal.  While some of the tasks psychiatric service animals may be assisting w/ would seemingly fall under an emotional support category, they are still considered every bit a legal service animal.

One other item of note, just so it's stated, b/c it's not something people often think about, but service animals are there in a working capacity.  This means that they aren't to be disturbed, played w/, fed, etc. w/out the handler's permission.  Many people are fine w/ others attending to their animal or playing w/ them, but others are not, and they have a legal right to prevent others from interfering w/ the duties of their service animal.  While I realize that you are unable to control the patrons of your establishment, especially young children who might be enamored by a friendly ""pet,"" I think that it's good to know that if someone requests that their service animal be left to their job, they have the right to reasonably expect this.  Additionally, this can create an awkward situation for those in need of a service animal, b/c who wants to tell a young child that they can't pet your dog?  But, ultimately, they have a job to do, and your support will always make it easier for the person in need of the service animal.  Just something to consider.

Aside from this, I would like to commend you for coming here and seeking information on this subject.  I think that if more people did what you've done, it would make the process of taking a service animal out in public easier.  Basically, what I'm saying is, thank you having been accountable enough  to inform yourself on this topic. :D",,,,jeffe333,,,1561389056,t5_2qhe8,t3_c4lmhg,t3_c4lmhg,3,1570851987,0,0,erxncmt,disability,,,," [<URL>(<URL>)

990,"The ALJ will introduce the hearing and say what's going on. Then you (or your attorney, which I agree you should get one because they are essentially free) will be asked if you want to make an opening statement. Then you will be asked a bunch of questions by your attorney and the judge. 

The hearing generally ends with a ""vocational expert"" testifying about what jobs are available for someone who has the limitations that the ALJ thinks you have. Your goal for the hearing is to convince the ALJ that your impairments cause functional limitations that make you understand to work.

If you have anything in particular that you want to say, you may want to write something down and bring it with you so you remember.  

You always have the right to say something. This is your chance to stand up for yourself and tell a real person why you can't work. Being specific helps.

The one thing that would be the most helpful is a statement from your doctor. If you can, get a letter from the doctor addressed to whom it may concern that says something like this: 

1. I have treated [your name] for [time duration]. I have seen my patient, on average every [time duration].  

2. I performed these tests or examinations while I've been treating [your name]:  [names and dates of any examinations and/or tests]

3.  From my testing and examinations, I diagnosed [your name] with [list all the different diagnosises]. 

4. In my opinion [your name]'s [diagnosis] causes [list symptoms]. 

[Repeat that for every diagnosis]

5. [List the treatment that your doctors' have done]

6. [Address every medication and side effects they cause]

7. [Have your doctor state your functional limitations from symptoms of your diagnosises]

If you have the information available to you, you could even draft a copy of the letter for your doctor to edit and then sign and give back to you.

Touching. It's nice to see somebody really try despite not having the tools, materials and know-how, and this is literally the thought that counts. Treasure it. But don't use it. This thing will hurt you. But don't say I said so. xD

&amp;#x200B;

My journey back to my feet from bedridden has left me with the need for a cane occasionally. Depends on the day, the levels of pain and such. I've tried many. But, a cane can make one a target. It's a step down the food chain. Real talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

My cane nowadays is a tactical battle hammer and armor piercing pike as the hand grip, and a rubber cane tip on the end of the handle. 

&amp;#x200B;

The head and pike are bout 8 inches or so, and seeing that I am a big fella, fit my hand rather well, girth-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

I created a ""cap"" to disguise the lethal nature of my cane out of brown shipping tape, drawing faux wood grains and crumpling it to greatly resemble a piece of driftwood to cut down on the side-eyes from cops and nosy types wondering why a guy with a battle hammer was wandering around the kroger.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the south. I can open carry any kind of rifle or pistol and nobody would bat an eye. But a pronounced limp and a tactical cane could get me shot if I met the wrong type of paranoid cop or civilian.

1036,"Social Security typically values specific, well-explained statements about an inividual's limitations over generic statements that someone cannot work.

So when you are approaching your doctor to help support your claim, you should address the specific limitations that prevent you from working. Keep in mind that the typical standard for Social Security if you're &lt; 50 years old is basically an inability to perform any job, not just jobs you have done in the past, so a description of your past job duties is not particularly helpful. Usually that will involve addressing questions such as:

Is there some physical reason you can't sit, stand, and/or walk a total of 8 hours per day?

Do you struggle focusing throughout the day due to your symptoms and/or medication side effects to the point it would substantially interfere with your ability to work?

Do you have conditions that would regularly require you to miss a significant amount of work each month? 

Or conditions that require unscheduled breaks during the workday?

Your representative really should be walking you through this process, especially when it comes to helping articulate what specific limitations you have that are disabling.

The main exception to the above is if your conditions meet or equal a listing, which is a set of medical criteria developed by Social Security where they presume you are disabled if you have/satisfy all of the criteria specific to your impairment(s).",,,,Zhenshanre,,,1559673627,t5_2qhe8,t3_bwqs0j,t3_bwqs0j,10,1568871554,0,0,epzvu5k,disability,,,,,

1063,"??? Why is this some mystery? Do *you* want to live with *your* parents? Not like, out of necessity, I mean do you *want* to, is that a lifegoal.

Or is your lifegoal living on your own, living independently?

Living with a caregiver is, for disabled people, that independence. That caregiver is not family *and that's the point*. They're not, when they're good, nosy, invasive, interfering, they're not embarrassing, you can have your sex toys out on the bed, you can have your pride flags on the wall, you can do what you want, it's all fine, because they're just an employee basically, they're there to help you.

Unlike family who *are* nosy and embarrassing and curious and invasive and frequently bigoted.

And living with your family does not feel like independence. Living with a caregiver is *you* living on your own, with support. Living with family is living dependent on family. The whole mental connection is different.

You also typically get a bigger space to yourself living independently, but I'm not sure how the system works where you are. Here, typically a bigger space.

No judgement, at all, to those who live with family, out of desire or necessity. We all do what's right for us. I'm writing about why disabled people tend to want one over the other, not why one is better than the other.

I moved out the *instant* I financially could. I have support workers 10 hours a week. I would be back living with family without them. The fact that I need the support workers changes nothing for me. I wanted my own, bigger space. I was about ready to kms living in a box with no privacy with my parents, who I hated in that space. Don't like them much better now, but it's better than living with them.

My mental health improved leaps and bounds when I got my own space.",,,,magpiegoo,,,1561888050,t5_2qhe8,t3_c7as1c,t3_c7as1c,10,1571142163,0,0,ese94qc,disability,,,,,

1065,"As far as client/consumer vs patient my experiences have been that the former terms only seem to be used when the services are social work related or mental health related. I've never had a physician, nurse, PT, or other health professional refer to me using one of those terms when I see them for any kind of physical health related issue and that's regardless of how they were paid (via cash/insurance/pro bono).

 I have had the opposite experience when dealing with social workers/mental health care providers also regardless of how they were actually paid. Because of that, I feel it increases the stigma around MH-related issues as if they need to have separate terms to use for us in order to conceal and/or sugarcoat the type of care we're receiving.  Even if you're only using separate terminology to differentiate the type/source of payment then I still find that problematic. Perhaps if it was only used in writing for billing purposes I'd be more accepting but I've been called ""client"" and ""consumer"" directly to my face and have had SW and MH providers refer to other patients the same way. They sound colder and less neutral than ""patient"".

I prefer the term patient whenever possible. 

I don't really use the term ""victim"" very often because of negative connotations but I do say that I was ""victimized"" when referring to some of the abuse I've experienced. I'm not sure what to replace that verb with and feel it emphasizes that I had something unwanted (and illegal) done to me but I don't feel like a ""victim"", really, and think it sounds like a more permanent term when many people are able to move forward after abuse/crime/trauma. I don't use it for anything medical related but can understand why others might.

I don't like the word ""survivor"", either. Survivor sounds absolutely ridiculous to me and I will never use it because I feel like it forces people to only acknowledge positive aspects of whatever they're going through and that people are less accepting of ""survivors"" that are still struggling. I correct people that refer to me as a survivor or victim but don't have a problem with other people using those words for themselves.

I use the terms ""sick/ill"" somewhat frequently to describe how I'm feeling from my physical disabilities. I think it's very easy for most people to identify with what it feels like to be sick/ill and do not feel like those words have negative connotations/stigma and they can be used for both temporary/acute and chronic conditions.

I am only one person that feels this way and many others feel differently so, again, it really just boils down to personal preferences and trying to respect each individual's preferences as much as you reasonably can.",,,,NewtonGimmick,,,1560593981,t5_2qhe8,t3_c0pg8g,t1_er7l5ru,3,1569944370,0,0,er823cg,disability,,,,,

1089,"That is funny that our digestive issues are pretty much opposite. 

For every professor, I was given a letter from the disability resource center (it had a different name at my college)that informed them that I had a medical disability and what accommodations they would be required to provide, and the contact number of the resource center in case they had any questions. In the very rare cases that letter was not enough to convince a professor that my accommodations were necessary, I would email them (coping it to the coordinator at the disability resource center) stating politely but clearly what I expected and their legal obligations and how the issue needed to be resolved (like providing PowerPoint printouts, or allowing me to reschedule a test after I had been absent). That was always successful for me.

5. The fact that the person currently “helping” you (who will be paid the same as a lawyer but is not a lawyer and is clearly not doing lawyer level work) has not already made this clear is very distressing.

Look, I used to be an engineer, and the most important thing I learned was to be sure I was asking the right question, attempting to solve the real problem. Everyone is telling you that “What should I get the doc to write to get approved?” is the wrong question; it doesn’t work that way.

Think of it like a court case: the jury decides on the totality of the factual evidence, not on a few magic words. You must present a totality of evidence that is for your case. The person you are working with should be organizing and spearheading that.

I’m going to leave you with this, though it is clear you don’t want to hear it, and I don’t blame you as this is a tough situation, BUT, a 95% clearance rate, if that is even factual, means they pick “easy” cases. I genuinely hope yours is easy and you get approved despite the “helper”.

my issue with ""rules"" like that is that i think we get so focused on the specifics of language we start ignoring context and intent, which ironically creates a more difficult environment for autistic people (we tend to have issues in situations where people insist on really precise language and won't listen to our explanation about what we meant), but also misses the forest for the trees since people are fully capable of contributing to dehumanizing language while saying ""autistic person.""

1142,"From the American Midwest. I’ve been to well over 100 concerts in my chair and have only ever used the wheelchair seating once. If you’re able to make it work, I recommend getting up front, but it all depends on your situation and how comfortable you are with it. I go to mostly small venue shows with general admission, no seats, just standing area on the floor. I went to a lot of metal shows in high school with my old man. These days it’s mostly punk and alt rock shows. But they’re usually always in smaller venues or bar venues. Some of the smaller venues have wheelchair accommodations, but most of the bar venues do not. In order to see the show I need to be right up front against the stage, or barriers if there are any. Being in a wheelchair if you’re anywhere else you’re going to have people taller than you blocking your view. I tend to get to shows right when the doors open so I can get right up front. I also don’t drink alcohol at most shows because then I’ll have to use the restroom and it’ll be a pain in the ass to get back to my spot. Or in the case of one popular local venue, the restroom isn’t accessible. Neither is the venue for that matter. The bouncers have to carry me up two flights of stairs to get into it. But yeah, up front is where it’s at. You get a great view most of the time and you get the energy of the crowd. Like I said though, your comfort level comes into play.

1143,"Hi, I have cerebral palsy and just finished my first year of physics. I have fatigue issues so here are my tips for specific points. I'm from Ontario and study at the University of Waterloo but I know disability laws are fairly consistent across western countries.

Residence: Live in residence. They should have accessible options but you will have to formally request them. You can request specific aspects for the room such as having a larger space; the building like having a ground floor room; or the location being close to campus. It is helpful because many services such as tutoring, meals, recreation and counselling are provided through the residence. This was very important for me since it was a lot less running around and I was able to select a residence very close to all of my science and math buildings. I expect to live in residence for my whole degree.

Academics: University is brutal. Nobody cares about your feelings. Just being smart will no longer get you by. I made it through secondary school with a 94 average without much work. I have to take a reduced load to produce work at a level that is required for my future plans. They expect it to be 40-45 hours a week. Get to know your professors well so they understand your accommodations. You cannot miss class and they will not just tell you what you missed. You have to do the learning independently.

Accommodations: It is your job to provide proof you are disabled, what your limitations are and what accommodations are appropriate. This will come from a doctor. Plan for multiple discussions with the disability office and contact them as soon as you accept your offer. My specific accommodations include notetaking, scribes for homework, extra time, reduced course load, computer use, breaks during exams and no evening exams. For funding I get 10 000 $ from the government to pay for services related to university. This money can only be used for disability related services or equipment. Get this arranged early.

Your rights: Your university cannot reject you simply because of a disability; However, if it is preventing you from being a student they will expel you. This will affect you with your hospital stays and you may need to do online terms if you miss classes that much. The university and professors must accommodate you according to the accommodation plan you make with the disability office. Non-accommodated assignments may be re-considered if you prove there was a mix-up.

Living the life: Organize yourself and all your medical needs. Figure out how to get medication and framiliarize yourself with the student medical centre if you anticipate needing it. Plan how you will get around efficiently to reduce fatigue. I use a trike for this. If walking really fatigues you, your school may have a mobility van. This van will be limiting so you may want to explore a device instead. Make friends around residence and in your program. Have fun.",,,,quantumboss13,,,1560294678,t5_2qhe8,t3_bzj3oh,t3_bzj3oh,2,1569526407,0,0,eqsv7ah,disability,,,,"Hi, I have cerebral palsy and just finished my first year of physics.

I went through VR in 2009 &amp; they got me tested +enrolled in around 6 months or less. Unfortunately, I started getting spinal injections &amp; was only above to get an A in one class &amp; not the other. I was too ill to think straight enough for statistics. Anyways, in 2013, I contacted them again &amp; they set me up to get my Bachelor's in Psychology, due to my scoring highly in the human services area of the vocational aptitude test. Long story short, they ended up paying for my 2 yr. Bachelor's &amp; my 3 year Master's in Clinical Counseling. It was hell, due to my limitations &amp; chronic pain, but I worked my ass off &amp; it was beyond worth it. They ended up paying for around $150,000 for me to complete my education. But just know that you have to work hard and keep your grades up for them to keep supporting you. They reimbursed me for all of my counselor licensing &amp; program evaluations that added up to around $600, plus all of my textbooks, etc. They also have a gas reimbursement program, once you are enrolled. 

Essentially, I am telling you that don't let a measly thing like a $1.50 bus fare stop you from attaining the American dream of getting your entire college education paid for IN FULL with zero debt. I understand you are ill &amp; that even the idea of it working out is stressful, but IT IS WORTH it.

You will have to work hard &amp; coordinate with your VR couselor. Don't demonize them for this one dumb rule. I think it's silly of them to not be willing to pay $1.50, but do what you have to to get it, because you may regret it the rest of your life if you don't at least try.

Literally, please try hard to refrain from open disdain for them. Sometimes we have to grin &amp; bear it, while also faking it til we make it lol but it's worth it!

Also, they have very specific testing to pinpoint the type of employment that would best suit you &amp; your interests. I never, ever got crap from my VR ppl exhibiting doubt from those test results.

Mainly about my work history, what I did at job X, that kind of thing, and why/how I left. As for my medical record specifically, he spoke directly with my attorney regarding that. 

Overall, I'm glad it's over, and it was nothing like I thought it would be. My judge was nice and seemed very kind and knowledgable. He listened to my answers thoughtfully. The vocational expert never spoke with the exception of hellos and goodbyes. The clerk was an angel who could tell how scared I was and told me that it would be over so quickly that I'd be looking at her like ""that's it?"" so don't worry. She was right. Now, of course, not all hearings are that quick.  Again, I'm glad it's over. I'm guessing my experience is not typical.

I would say the *only* ""bad"" thing you're doing (here, specifically) is making a big deal out of disability and wanting to be inoffensive, but it's clear you're well-intentioned and willing to be corrected, so it evens out xD The reasoning, as I see it, is most people with disabilities tend to prefer being treated like everyone else as much as possible, but also you being this open/curious makes it easier for others to bring something up and problem solve with you, since it shows you're also willing to acknowledge it all point blank.

1235,"Exactly! It's not about not wanting to drive or being unable to drive. It's about being unable to drive *safely* and being unwilling to knowingly become a danger on the road.

I can drive. But I can't sleep at night knowing I'm a danger on the road and choosing to drive anyway. 

Even with training to mitigate my vision issues (I have after image issues so I can't tell if cars are moving or parked) the risk of an accident is still greater than someone without my condition.

I want to drive, but I want to drive *safely* or I won't drive at all. And driving safely is not an option with the current level of treatment and occupational therapy available to me.

There are some disabilities that you can overcome and be a safe driver, and it's important people are empowered to try.

But no offence to that guys sister, if she's crashing into things then she's not managing her disability in order to drive, she's ignoring her limits and putting herself and other's in danger. how does she feel comfortable getting behind the wheel when she knows she's prone to crashing? What if she crashed into a child?

I tell people ""I can't drive, I have a neurological condition"" since my vision issues are technically a processing problem in my brain and not a problem with my eyes, and while my connective tissue disorder causes the subluxations which cause the dysfunction in my joints it's my nerves that mean I can't control the pedals or wheel properly. So I feel like ""neurological condition"" is enough information to explain why glasses won't help, and why, yes, I look healthy, but there's more going on in my body that means it's not safe for me to drive and I don't want to put anyone else in danger by ignoring my issues and driving anyway.

1239,"The best way to find out answers to all of your questions is to just go back to the university and talk to them in depth about all of your issues. I would urge you to do this before you accept an offer to attend. Take your power chair and be prepared to talk to them about your limitations and needs. Set up meetings with housing and disability teams and try and guage how much they are willing to work with you.

Tell them you need an accessible dorm so you can properly use your mobility aids and tell them you have medical needs that will mean sharing a room is not appropriate. Ask about being able to record lectures as needed so that you can pace yourself properly and make sure that you explain how not being able to do that will result in hospitalization. It would probably be better for you to be housed on campus for your entire degree so make sure to bring that up.

If they can't or don't seem to want to accommodate your needs, I would strongly suggest you look at other universities. There is no point in going to a good university if it means coming out with a poor degree. I was steered towards going to a better university with no real weight put on accommodations for my disability. It is one of my biggest regrets. I had a university that was going to have me live on campus for the entire degree and they had a student who has similar issues before me so knew how to deal with much of it. If she couldn't make it to lectures then each of the lecturers would catch her up on what she'd missed face to face in her flat if needed. Instead, I ended up having to fight my way through my degree with very few accommodations being made. It took me two years longer than it should have done and my grades suffered greatly as a result.

It is possible to do a degree, but you need to put your health needs first. It doesn't matter how good they are in a particular subject, if they won't give you the accommodations you need then I would suggest looking elsewhere. If they are able and willing to do what they can to help you then that is wonderful, but you need to find that out before you commit to going there.",,,,luna-the-lunatic,,,1560331895,t5_2qhe8,t3_bzj3oh,t3_bzj3oh,1,1569603969,0,0,equm40v,disability,,,,,

In special regards to ""Always Ask"", though, I would point out that a lot of students are unaware when coming to college that they have to ask at all - in K-12 they are often handled with kid gloves (in fairness most students before college are now).

I'm fortunate enough to work part-time at a job that accommodates my needs. I wanted to make sure I knew the income limit and had some other questions, so I went to the SSA office.

SSA employee: okay, so, how much do you make?

Me: $15 an hour (for context, I have a four-year degree, I make well under the average wage for someone with my qualifications, my husband with no higher education makes significantly more than me, and the local McDonald's restaurants start new employees at $12/hour - so my wage isn't exactly shockingly high or anything)

SSA employee: (gives me a surprised look) wow, they pay you really well...

Me: umm, I guess (silently thinking, wow, that's pretty insulting, you don't know what my education and skills are yet you're assuming I'm paid peanuts because I'm on disability, I guess disabled people are just paid next to nothing when they're able to work)

1295,"Jobs like that definitely do exist, they are just hard to find. But if/when you find it, if you’re willing/able to do low-level dev work in a low-stress setting, you’ll be an absolute steal for the company. If they aren’t stupid, they’ll work really hard to accommodate you and keep you happy, in my experience. 

Sorry this is so long, but I hope my experience helps. I also have a background in tech and am on SSDI and ran into a similar problem. I’d look through job listings for smaller companies that talk about why the applicant wants to work for them, rather than just their requirements for an applicant. I fell into a very lucky job situation by applying to exactly 1 job, a telemarketer position, at an office walking distance from my house, that I chose because the job was easy and met all of my physical requirements and the company looked like they genuinely cared about their employees (check glassdoor etc.). I majorly downplayed my resume to get the interview and then wowed them with my experience in the interview (still downplaying though). Turns out though they were advertising for a part time employee they actually wanted full time, but made an exception for me and let me create my own schedule. Within a month they put me in a data analysis position and by the next month I became their in house web-developer and started doing product management. The great thing about this is they are getting an experienced developer for pretty much no money, which makes me basically irreplaceable, and gives me a lot of goodwill to burn at the company. 

I’m not able to do the job I could have done before I was sick (I find myself needing to look up basic syntax and forgetting pretty basic stuff and I’m much slower) and I’m not as reliable as they’d want and deserve if they were paying me market rate, but it all works out in the end because they aren’t paying me market rate. So no stress, things get done when they get done, I can work from home when I need to, I don’t feel bad about calling out when I need to, and whenever I need accommodations they are more than happy to provide them.

End of the day, I think your best bet is find a company that needs tech work but can’t afford it.

I decided that for me having a child would be too selfish and even self-sabotaging.I chose to have a hysterectomy when I was twenty-one. I have endometriosis, and the pain was debilitating through my teenage years.

I figured that if the hysterectomy helped, I could have a  better life, even though it meant I would never be able to have children in the usual way. It worked. I still have chronic pain, but it is manageable.

Before, I was bedridden 25% of the time, and taking opiates 50% of the time. I couldn't live alone, or work, or finish a semester of school. I didn't think that I could ever sign up to bring a child into that life. How could I tell my child that I don't want to read to her, or play with her, or even have her in the room with me? Not just once in a while, but for a week or more of every month? How could I ask a partner to be willing to be my love-in-nurse and a single parent for that same week? I just didn't want that for myself or my hypothetical family. 

But, my situation is unique(ish) to me. Having considered this question and answered it for myself, I think this question is one everyone considering having children should ask themselves. What would I want for my potential child, and can I provide that?

1348,"In addition to what others have mentioned, family *usually* can't be paid by insurance for caring for a loved one.

It's not 100% about money, but depending on the level of care needed, it can be exhausting (emotionally, physically, and financially) caring for a loved one. Using caregivers and SNFs may allow a family member to work and still provide support from a distance. Would you be able to financially support yourself and another person if you had to care for them, take extra time off work to go to doctors appointments, and help them get ready for bed/get ready in the morning every single day before you could go to work or go to sleep?

Parents and family members also have to plan for when they are unable to care for loved ones. Age and illness are very real things. Would you be able to care for someone while going through chemo or when you're 70?

I've was a young carer, I am a carer and I'm a caree. Caring for a family member is emotionally devistating and can give the caree a sense of feeling trapped and a burden. Long term that can screw with family dynamics. Having a sheltered accomodation (your own apparentment with care workers coming in and out regularly and staying in site) and care homes allows family dynamics to recover in some ways.

1361,"Yep. I have a lot of stories, but this one is probably the most unique: at my high school, the elevators in he academic building were old and only faculty and people with elevator passes are allowed to use them. The only way to get an elevator pass was if you had a temporary injury or disability that impacted your ability to take the stairs.

I use crutches or a wheelchair on a daily basis, so I had a permanent elevator pass. Nearly every day, students expressed their jealousy that I was allowed to take the elevator. Look, the elevators are rickety and the cables have snapped more than once. If the elevators were down, I either would have to brave the stairs and risk injuring myself or just not go to class... and they were down a lot. If I could take the stairs every day, I would. 

One student even told me that she’d been faking a twisted ankle so that she didn’t have to take the stairs. If I could’ve knocked her lights out, I would’ve. People faking injuries were actually pretty common, though. 

Students took the elevators (with fake injuries or just entirely without a pass) all the time, and the more they were used, the more often they broke down... so it made me (the only student with a permanent mobility impairment) and the one disabled instructor. 

One time, the power was out and the elevators and air conditioning were down... on a 96° day. Heat worsens my heart problems, so I was ready to faint by the time I’d climbed up to the fifth floor. My instructor insisted on walking me back to my residence building because I was in such bad shape. 

Another anecdote: anyone was allowed to use the elevators in the residence building bc the building was new. I also depended on these elevators to get to class. However, able-bodied people would cram into the elevators just so they wouldn’t have to go down a single flight of stairs. There was more than one occasion where the elevator doors opened to reveal a crammed elevator and the students would just shrug and not attempt to make any room for me even though I was the only one who really needed the elevator. So... I be late to class because I’d have to struggle to go down the stairs and walk across campus. Thankfully, I had a solid 504 plan and really understanding instructors. I was rarely more than a minute late to class anyway.

- encouraging you to stay in your chair when you want to transfer to the sofa, insisting on doing everything for you - things that emphasise your disability
- lots of photographs where your chair is clear, i.e you can see the wheels rather than a close up shot of just you which would have made more sense in context

So the therapist I saw actually did want to put me on a couple medications, but I turned them down cause I wouldn't have been able to afford them.
So I'm not sure if she was a therapist who was going to refer me to a psychiatrist for the meds or if she was a psychiatrist.


That was the 1st time I had ever been to one and ironically I wasn't able to make myself go back again cause of my anxiety lol



My experiences with people finding out I have anxiety is always dismissive. 
Or someone with a full time job in retail will say, ""Oh yeah, I have anxiety too""
Not saying that they don't, of course, but at this point in my life, I couldn't work a full time retail job without having panic attacks and an eventual mental break down...

To go to my son's wedding a 5-hour drive away, we decided to fly since a  5-hour ride in a car would almost guarantee I was too whooped to go to the wedding. So the first lap is okay and then a long extended delay until the sign said canceled and then they decided, without asking or talking to us, to put us on a bus and drive us the rest of the way! Uh, didn't I buy a plane ticket since I wouldn't have to ride in a car/bus? The driver was a maniac and on his phone the whole time.

You can only control the controllables and you only have so much energy in any day, so you have to consiously decide how to use it, and it would best be used in doing things that make you happier and healthier.

I think there's some miscommunication here and it's not really called for to call me a ""hypocritical asshole.""

I would obviously be open to dating a woman with a disability if she wanted to date me as well (the girl I've been hanging out with has depression, which is considered a disability). I would probably be open to dating a woman who is also in a wheelchair, depending on our connection, but it is my preference to try and date able-bodied women. I don't think that makes me a hypocrite. In our culture people are surprised when a person in a wheelchair and someone who is not are dating, and I think it's ableist to assume that disabled people only date other disabled people.

And I will agree with the poster below - stickyDan - that many logistics would need to be considered if I were to date someone also in a chair.

I have a hard enough time as it is trying to remain positive in my life. And as stickyDan also said, I am not expecting all women to accept me and my wheelchair - that would be ludicrous.

I have this coworker who gets very angry easily. If we don’t have an item, we often advise the customer on where they can go to get the item. I typically recommend a similar store to the one I work in that is close to where our store is. My coworker always recommends this one store that is a couple of miles across town. He gets angry when customers say that they don’t want to walk that far. I pointed out to him that they may not be able to walk that far. He said ‘these people are fine, you can tell they’re just lazy’ but like... you literally can’t tell?? Also, a huge portion of our customers are elderly. So of course they can’t walk all the way across town. But still, my coworker refuses to recommend the store that is closer to us.

Also, this same coworker was complaining about people walking slowly on footpaths. I pointed out that not everyone can walk quickly. He said ‘oh, I never think about that, I just get angry’ and brushed it off.

1473,"I didn’t know that, but I’m not surprised. I got my first iPhone in 2012 and first iPad in 2013, so the accessibility features I use were available to me immediately. I mean, at least Apple listened. It’s an incredibly low bar, but so many companies don’t clear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Case in point: I emailed Nintendo using their “accessibility” email address seven months ago about adding more accessibility features to the Switch, requesting they either make future games compatible with the XBox’s adaptive controller or make an adaptive controller themselves. They responded back with a form letter thanking me for my input but saying they have no plans to do either option at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

If the response is just “We’re not going to do anything,” why bother even having an email address devoted to accessibility issues? I’m a customer who wants to give you my money, but I won’t if your product won’t work for me or if I have to spend hundreds of more dollars *making* it work for me. People can say what they want about Apple, but at least a fair amount of their accessibility tools are built in to a free software update. How hard would it be for Nintendo to enable button remapping, or letting you throw a damn pokeball by using a button even when the Switch is connected to your TV?

1475,"My issue isn't so much with random public strangers as much as it is with getting the help I need to not be destitute/homeless and to also get healthy.

I can't walk. The doctors can't figure out what is going on and I'm still in the process of being diagnosed. I'm seeing different specialists along the way. I was an independent contractor so I had no medical insurance. I just woke up one day and could no longer put any weight on my feet and have to be in a wheelchair for any mobility.

My main problem is that I can't walk and without being able to walk I can't be independent. So I need help. And in order to get help you have to apply for food stamps, emergency financial assistance, medicaid, ssi, transportation assistance, etc. etc.

It requires doctor appointments and medical staff to sign off on things, it requires tons of forms, phone calls, etc. with various agencies.

My issue isn't so much with the general public as it is with the industry that fuels these programs. Whether it's doctors, nurses, social workers, etc. there's just this constant stigma/tension about my authenticity. Most people that I used to meet would give me the benefit of the doubt when I told them something. Like if I told someone that my favorite color is orange, and that I like playing baseball, or I enjoy the summer, the natural response is to believe those things.

Dealing with these agencies for help it's the total opposite. If I tell them my favorite color is orange, I'm probably going to need to tell them 100 more times along the way, and provide 3 different forms of proof. They will ask me a hundred different ways what my favorite color is so that they can catch me saying that I might like blue instead of orange.

1492,"It's a long form to fill out. You have to list all the jobs you've ever had and why your disability made you leave them or caused you to get fired. You have to list all the doctors, therapists, and hospitals you've interacted with so they can draw records from them. You have to list all the medications you've tried. You have to describe your typical day and how your disability interrupts your daily life. There's more I'm sure, but that's what I can remember. It takes several hours to fill this form out. You can elect a representative like your mom to help you. You can also save and come back later.

They review your case after application. This takes an unknown amount of time. Could be weeks or months. SSA will call you at some point and ask lots of questions about everything on your form to confirm. A doctor will review your medical records and decide if they are complete enough, or if a second opinion from another doctor would be necessary.

You'll get letters in the mail letting you know if you've been approved or denied. About 60% of cases are denied the first time. If that happens, you can re-apply with a disability attorney to increase your likelihood of success.

If you are approved, you'll know how much your benefit will be, when it will start, and if you are entitled to any back-pay (starting five months after your date of disability).

I was in a unique case. I have bipolar disorder. I applied once after my disability started, but went back to work so I cancelled the application (it was denied by default). After trying to work multiple times, I applied again. During the application process, I went to the hospital twice (my fourth and fifth stays). I was approved in about six weeks. It's a miracle that it took such a short amount of time, and that I was approved without an attorney.

1521,"I don’t know the situation you’re going to experience very well, but here are some tips that might help slightly. I try (not always successfully) to follow some of these tips:

If you can, take the day at your own pace. Try to find maybe a couple of people who are familiar with your situation. They might be able to accompany you or at least keep an eye out for you in case you need to take a break or need to step aside from the events. If worse comes to worst, excuse yourself to go take a break and rest/recharge (if this is an option).

Try to adapt the situation to best suit your needs. If your cane will help, use it! People will understand. You have to look after your body. If using something to adapt yourself to the environment will help a little then you’ll be thankful for it at the end of the day.

1522,"It’s such a messed up system. I am in my 20s and on SSDI, and I really don’t want to be on it for the rest of my life. I want to get healthy enough to go back to working and paying taxes and being (as they say, even though I hate the connotations and my apologies for the ableist language) a “contributing member of society”. You’d think the government would want that too. But I cannot work full time right now. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to work full time. So I got a part time job originally earning over the SGA and hoped I could make it work after my trial work period even losing my benefits. This was the only thing that allowed me to get off food stamps. I couldn’t manage though and had to cut back hours. Now I’m using up my work trial on my very part time return to work and if my earnings end up low enough to stay on disibility, I will never be given the opportunity to attempt upping my hours and testing my ability to work more and get off disibility without immediately losing my benefits because I already used up my trial working part time. 

As it is now, I’m hovering right at the SGA and sometimes go over depending on how many work days there are in the month. That is not enough to live on. I will lose 50% of my income and my health insurance if I can’t explain to my job that I have to work an hour less on months with more work days. And if I do cut back to stay under SGA, there are those who’d say I’m cheating the system. Over $20 because of the government’s rediculous all or nothing rules. 

Even with ssdi and working part time, I wouldn’t be able to make rent even with roommates without my partner, and I wouldn’t have the money to move somewhere cheaper. Literally my options would be starve in the street and die because I couldn’t afford healthcare, or go on government assistance everything. Food stamps, medicaid, public housing, etc. because I was working too much for disibility every couple months by $20. I would become the “drain on the system” so many are worried about because of their own stupid laws that prevent people with disabilities from building a stable future for themselves.

1544,"Hi! I have hEDS too. I'm also a doctor. I also have autoimmune issues.

I had a bunch of issues throughout my training - POTS lead to near syncope making standing for surgeries, especially with holding awkward positions, even harder. I developed some major GI issues in the last 6 months of residency leading to a lot of ER visits after long (30h) shifts and eventual multiple admissions &amp; a feeding tube I initially in my nose. I was sicker than a lot of my patients &amp; it was awkward. I used a mask to cover my face/nose. It eventually was moved to the abdomen. I currently am on TPN (IV nutrition) &amp; some tube feeds. My joints issues have been worse as well.

I made it through residency (Pediatrics), fellowship (global health but did not travel), &amp; took a full time community pediatrician job. My issues suddenly got a lot worse in 2017. I worked another year (mostly with a backpack which pumped in tube feeds or TPN) but had to cancel 74! clinic days, lot of call coverage. I resigned in 2018 &amp; activated my individual disability policy. I did work about another 4 months in a sedentary medical consultant job at Social Security processing disability claims but struggled to maintain the 15h/wk agreement. I'm not working at all now. 

This is just to give an example. Medicine is rough, more so with health issues but it can be done. I'm not sure I would do it again but I am happy with what I have done. There are more &amp; more accommodations, recognition &amp; support for disabled doctors. Patients have told me they are reassured to see a ""sick/disabled"" doctor but not every patient (or colleague) felt that way.

I don't know why having small children is an excuse? I was a single mom,  ages ago,  as my daughter is 20 now,  so yes she survived what I'm about to say. Anyway,  when we went to the store, and I got groceries,  I simply loaded all the groceries,  with her still in the cart.  Then I pushed the cart to the cart return,  with her still in it. Then I carried her back to the car and put her in it.  It's really not that difficult. To others it is it seems.  It reminds me of the riddle of the guy getting the animals across the lake in a row boat individually,  but doing it a certain way to make sure the animals don't eat each other while they're alone. So having small children doesn't absolve you from being inconsiderate. It's not some puzzle to figure out how to do things and not inconvenience others.  

I've been living with my disability for 3 and half years now. It has significantly decreased my mobility and significantly increased my pain.  I posted a few months ago about my Walmart having 5 carts filled in the last handicap spot.  Thankfully my husband and son were with me to move them. There's no excuse.  I don't care if they have workers, maybe they had call offs? Maybe they were short staffed? I try everyday through everything I deal with,  to remember and be considerate to others dealing with the same,  or worse.

that said if anyone is feeling conflicted but wants to be a parent i would suggest they adopt. you could even adopt a disabled child who already exists and might have trouble finding a supportive home. kids up for adoption deserve a home just as much as anyone.

Doing what you can to the existing apartment so that he can get around/use the kitchen/bathroom in a wheelchair or even use a rollator or computer chair easily and safely will be paramount.

He's also going to want a good occupational therapist who can help both him and your mom adapt their home to his needs as much as possible.","[{'start': 237, 'end': 247, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Even in worse case scenario, if a bad thing happens to you - you have a story to tell, something that happened in your life - it might be something to laugh with friends , it might be something sad we all can learn from , but thats better than overthinking why disabled people cant enjoy anything and just waiting life to pass.

I have no idea if you would agree with anything that I said, but I personally prefer to have few stories to tell , few experiences to have, which are unique to me and shaped who I am, than living with the idea that, since I'm disabled I can't or could have not did the things I really wanted to and exchanging them for whatever is safe and suitable for a disabled person .","[{'start': 2177, 'end': 2185, 'entity_type': 'PERSON', 'text': '<PERSON>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"
1803,"I get this. It’s a mixed bag with dating. I’d never want to discriminate against anyone for being basically the same as me (it’s hard enough out there) but at the same time I worry how we’d even get by if both of us were sick and limited. I am too sick to date at this point (stuck in bed) but I get how you feel.

Anyway, you’re not a fool. My cousin has MD &amp; a level of mobility similar to you it sounds like. They texted me today to tell me about fooling around in a pool for three hours yesterday with an able bodied Tinder date.  It’s a lie to pretend it isn’t harder out there for us, but I think sometimes we’re too easily discouraged, especially when we compare to able bodied people.

I’ve definitely had the thought “why would anyone choose me if they could have an able bodied person?” And the answer is, I’m not fucking anybody. I’m not replaceable by a warm body with legs that work. I’m unique, a good partner, funny, a kind person, fun to be around... I have to remind myself that just because I don’t bring working legs to the table doesn’t mean I don’t bring a lot of other important shit.

1814,"&gt; I am just wanting to know what the SSA wants to hear from my doctor in plain English to get SSDI. 

What folks here are telling you is this is *exactly* the job of a disability *lawyer*. If you are paying someone to help you with the application, understanding your specific conditions and limitations, and figuring out how to translate them to the forms *is their primary job*. Why has this person you’re paying thousands of dollars *not already done this*??? You absolutely should not have to turn to the internet to get these answers if you have paid assistance.

We’re not trying to be negative; we’re trying to protect you. I’d wager a large number of people here have been victimized by people who know people applying for disability are often too weak (limited energy) and have too few resources to fight back. Some of us have been taken advantage of by family members and “friends”.

Personally, I made contact with a “disability assistance” firm, which is what your friend’s mom sounds like. They were very good at giving me positive referrals, but when they outlined what they actually did, it was much less than a lawyer, they had no liability if they dropped the ball (unlike a lawyer who you have a contract with and can file a complaint with the BAR), and they seemed a lot more interested in making a huge deal about filling out a form for you rather than doing a thorough, good job. Basically, they wanted to make a quick buck off cases they thought they could win, where the medical evidence work seemed pretty much done, without investing in people with law degrees. They’re glorified form fillers amd borderline scammers. Your state probably has a *free* service that will do this, and possibly better since those volunteers care about what they do, not just a quick buck.

If you want to have some sort of guide for disability criteria for people filling out these forms, first place to check is the ssdi site itself: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm  These are the legal criteria a *lawyer* will work to and a judge will use to determine disability.

Asking a bunch of randos on the internet what they guess worked for their single, unique case (when their legal reps may know the real answer), is much less useful than talking to someone who has handled hundres of cases...you guessed it, a *lawyer*. 

And where on earth did you get those awful forms??? Are they generic forms for your diagnoses from the company this person works for? Good god, what an excellent way to get your doc to hate you and be denied!!!! These don’t help the doc describe *at all* in concrete terms what your work limitations are. They’re vague questions open to interpretation that only marginally justify a diagnosis, NOT define the work limitation consequences. They’re the definition of what to *not* do.

1844,"Santa Monica, CA

The OUTDOOR mall has a Tiffany and Louis Vuitton and The Third Street Promenade - as the reason I say “fancy”. Also, I wasn’t going shopping in the mall (which I do sometimes but don’t use the OW then - cause I park in the structure and walk to stores).  I live in Brentwood (Los Angeles) and had to take care of three things south of the mall (which has the Pier, Beach, and restaurants that make driving and parking horrible). I park a few blocks north of the touristy areas and ride down (through the Promenade and through the OUTDOOR mall.) Going through the mall has allowed me to avoid some of the tourist on the side walk (the mall has a wider path). 

I have been issued crutches and canes to help with my mobility - and I’m trying to stay away from the typical motorized devices they offer veterans at the V.A. Hospital. I have enough money to buy something better and a bit practical - so I bought a Onewheel 2 years ago - and it has increased my mobility and ability to do more things outside and by myself. 

Your roommate may have done tricks and sped on the unit he rode on - I use mine to avoid walking far and being stuck in my car to find that there are no handicap spots parking. Also, I don’t just have a handicap placard/plate - I have a disabled veteran plate which has a stricter criteria to get issued in California!

I have a my handicap information available because Santa Monica has been cracking down on scooter riders because of injuries and the machines just being left on the sidewalk for people to trip and fall. Im not traveling at 15mph as your roommate probably did but as a reasonable safe speed - cause I’m not trying to injure anyone or myself.

1847,"This is something that I am endlessly bitter about, it is an abusive system and I am barely living. All because I have a disability. I work very part time to the point that I still receive benefits, however, they take away my earned income out of the SSI payments, so I would have the same income whether I worked or not. 

Since I cannot work more than part time in a low skill field of work, I will forever be dependent on these systems, and in turn that means I will never be able to afford my own place to live, even a rental. I'm not allowed to save more than 2000 dollars of this money, or I am disqualified from benefits. So...I cannot earn it, cannot save it, and cannot move up in the world. All because I happen to have a disability. Fuck me, right?

Have you tried going through your state's vocational rehabilitation office? The counselors there can assess you and suggest jobs you might be able to do. If they say they cannot place you and can only help you achieve daily living skills -- then you have that on paper and it will help your case. There are numerous accommodations you can seek. If you need help locating your voc rehab office (It is usually under health and human services let me know and I will help you find them).   


You are young enough that you can still go back to school if your mental health can handle it.  Note that schools have disability offices that help with accommodations. Once upon a time I worked as a tutor/tester for students with disabilities in a community college. I'm so ancient that voice to text and text to voice was not as reliable and quick as they are today;  so some students needed readers to help, others needed someone to write down what they wanted to say. I had to speech-read them and touch-type.  But under ADA I could have refused those particular students. (there were other tutors/testers) I was being paid by the hour, so if I did not work I did not get paid).   


Anyway, I had some students with mental health issues whose medications slowed down their mental processes and made it hard to concentrate. My job was to help break down the information in bite sizes, teach them tricks in taking tests and guide them through directions while taking the test. Most of them also had extra time under 508 (and now IDEA) accommodations. I also had students who got extra time and help in writing papers. I taught them how to write and we talked our way through it, I would not just do the work for them and I left their thoughts and ideas even if they were getting the answer wrong. I was just there to help them get the ideas into a document in a way that made sense.   


Have you tried office jobs? I worked office jobs with severe hearing loss. I even worked when I had larger meetings and needed an interpreter. I can only function on the phone with people I know very well (like my wife and my mom). Thank goodness for email and messaging apps. Most offices use both of those now - and under the ADA they can accommodate you by always communicating via text. Mind you, the job cannot have phone use as a \*primary\* duty (reception and call center work for example). But when duties are \*secondary\* (talking on the phone to co workers) and can be eliminated or adjusted - it is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. (it is always better to get things in writing anyway!) While there are people trying to erode the ADA it is still in effect thank goodness.   


I had a period of disability in my 20s due to severe mental health issues that had me in a revolving door inpatient and multiple days a week outpatient. (as well as the hearing and somemobility issues). Once we got  my mental health under better control (and it took a LOT of work in therapy to do it) I was able to go try volunteering and learn to apply my coping skills in the real world. Volunteering helped me figure out what I was actually able to do and the kind of work I would like to do. You can also work a small amount while on disability.   
I went back to voc rehab and they decided to send me back to school for a graduate degree.   


In order to go to grad school voc rehab sent me to sign language classes so I could use a sign supported speech interpreter to get through classes that were more technical than my undergrad had been - as well as handling large groups where it is difficult to impossible to keep up and figure out who is speaking and what they are saying. Under the ADA, workplaces all had to have an interpreter for me during any large meetings (I'm ok 1-1 and in small groups).   


I'm back on disability now because I now have vision impairment (even with glasses and it started as adult) and worsening mobility issues, as well as mental health issues that reared back up and worsened. (I went from being diagnosed dissociative disorder/PTSD to also having Bipolar and bipolor worsened along with my physical health. )  


My hearing was from childhood, but worsened when I was a teen and \*adds\* to the complication of other disabilities. Childhood disabilities count when they complicate new disabilities. You need to point out to the person reviewing your disability application \*how\* your hearing complicates your ability to work while dealing with your mental health issues. In addition, you need to spell out how your adult onset disabilities affect your ability to function day to day. Focus on your activities not the diagnosis.   
If voc rehab says they cannot help you - I would hire a disability advocate. I did not go through a lawyer, it was an office of paralegals that helped me. (AllSup). They helped me gather all the records, complete the forms and generally get everything organized for the application. They got a chunk of my back pay but it was worth it.

1912,"You deciding who you're comfortable dating does not make you a fool. But this thought pattern you express in the latter part of your post... that's self-defeating. And defeating yourself is fairly foolish.

&gt;I actually met an able-bodied woman on Bumble, and we pretty much hit it off, so we’ve been hanging out a lot. But I just found out tonight that she might be dating another guy too, which I guess I’m cool with, but I don’t even know if we’ve been dating. Either way I think she wants to keep things casual. 

Don't know if you haven't already, but if you're unsure about your status together, it's a good idea to ask. But this is besides the main point.

&gt;But I just feel like I’m never going to be able to compete with an able-bodied guy. 

THIS is the main point. 

I suffer no (fewer than I used to, at least) illusions about how difficult, tedious and frustrating Dating While Disabled can be. It can really eat away at you to think that something about you -- something you have no control over, something that most other people don't have to deal with -- can do heavily affect how many people will even consider you. And it absolutely, undeniably DOES. But eventually, if this kind of connection is something you truly want, you kinda need to have a hard talk with yourself and realize a few things.

Every ""dateable"" person out there is playing the same game: they're all looking for somebody who best fits their wants and needs. They all have preferences that help define their own set of acceptable partners, and they all have hard limits that help define everyone else's. Some limits and preferences are more common, and this gives some people smaller sets to work with (eg, us).

It's not fair that the system screws us like this, and you can (and should) be upset and try to change the way people see the world, but unless somebody is personally harmed as a result, you can't begrudge individual people their relationship biases, even if it's pure prejudice. As you know, everybody swipes left sometimes, and there's always a reason they do. 

However, in your case I would examine your reasons for not dating anyone in a chair. Not because it's wrong of you to do so, but because, by your own admission,

&gt;I’m not sure what it is, but I just don’t think I could date a woman in a chair - perhaps it reminds me of myself too much for comfort.

it may have something to do with how you view yourself. 

When people make the judgment call on somebody's desirability, they're not really thinking about that person; they're thinking about themselves. And they should, because that's how they take care of their needs. The problem here is you are doing this backwards: you are making a judgment call on your own desirability because you know you don't fulfill their needs. This is the self-defeating behavior.

Internalized ableism is practically unavoidable because it is spit at us daily that we are not good enough for this world. However, we can't change our disabilities, and when you've accepted that you need to look at what can be changed. ADA law, for all its flaws and omissions, exists because people in power were forced to admit that people with disabilities are just as human and worthy as everyone else. It doesn't make everything completely accessible, but it makes a lot of things more accessible.

Take a minute and know that you are just as worthy as any other single person. Just to a smaller group of people. What can you do to make dating better in spite of the stacked odds? Change the things you can, and stop thinking about the things/people you can't. If you blame your lack of success on your disability, which is forever (I'm assuming), it takes all responsibility and agency away from you and gives you no reason to try. Forever. Which is way sadder than one relationship that didn't make it.

Tl;dr, the world sucks and while you have relatively limited options because of your impairment, that's no reason to beat yourself down and give up. Stop thinking that disability is the only thing stopping you; focus on doing what you can and meeting the people that are interested in you.

Also, final note:

&gt;...what the hell is the use?” Why would a woman, especially an attractive woman, ever want to date a guy in a chair, like me? Am I just doomed for aiming so high? Just fuck my life..,

Nobody is entitled to an attractive partner. Not even attractive people. And there are plenty of UNattractive people who are not interested in you.

Otherwise they would have people cutting themselves off without a safety net when they attempt to work, and then trying to jump back on if work didn't go well. To reduce the processes of jumping on and off, there are long grace periods like the work trial process to ensure someone is truly ready to go back to work without assistance.

If you haven't been making the amount over SGA (which I think is $800 a month?), those months won't count towards your work trial period. You have to make at least nine months over SGA to end the work trial period.

They'll send paperwork to you where you report your work activity, it's form [SSA-821](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-821.pdf).

1935,"There’s two halves to this question - ability to care for the child and possibility of the child inheriting the condition. For the first - Let’s take disability out of it for a second. If a teenage mother chooses to keep her baby, is she selfish, knowing that her child may spend their formative years at a socioeconomic disadvantage? Would the answer be the same if it she has strong family and financial support? What about family *or* financial, but not both?

Everyone has disadvantages. If there is a plan to care for the child, I don’t think a parent with a disability is any more selfish than any other parent.

For the second half (genetic inheritance) - if you want a child, the alternative is adoption. You do not know with 100% certainty the medical and social background of the parents. If you feel strongly about passing or not passing along your genes, that is a very personal decision that only you can make. But selfish, in the grand scheme of things?

1940,"I appreciate that you're trying to understand a little more about what they may be experiencing. 

The biggest thing for me just boils down to respecting their/my wishes which can be more difficult if verbal/written communication is a part of the disability but I'm sure you have other ways to tell when they're unhappy with something. 

 One of my disabilities is that I'm autistic but I also have several others. I have identified as disabled for a long time. I once had a psychiatrist berate me because I called myself disabled and he became agitated and disrespectful to me and he kept being adamant that ""you are not disabled; you ***have*** a disability"". He was so hell-bent on forcing me to use person-first language that I never went back. I hadn't even heard the terminology ""person-first"" or ""identity-first"" at that time and also struggled a little to explain my feelings about it especially since he rejected my views outright and was treating me like shit. His lecturing became the main focus of the visit.

I also refer to myself in what some others consider derogatory language (retarded, crippled, etc) and while I know that makes some people uncomfortable I ***hate*** when the non-disabled justice warriors attack me for my use of this language, especially when I'm referring to myself, or when someone I'm close to uses that kind of language towards me and they get berated by people that have no business inserting their opinions. I do not appreciate people getting offended on my behalf as if I can't decide for myself what is offensive or not. I'm not asking anyone else to use language they're uncomfortable with; I'm simply wanting them to respect my decision to use it (or my friends to use it) and to back off instead of thinking I'm some helpless, pitiful being that needs a savior to prevent me from having my feelings hurt. 



As a side note, I am likely in the minority when it comes to this but I cannot stand being referred to as a client and particularly dislike ""consumer"". I am really curious to see what other people's thoughts are when it comes to those two terms.

1944,"In this case I think you \*want\* to highlight difficulties and negative things. This is not a getting general empathy attempt. Your developers need to see how what they do impacts users. They need to see, from a website functional perspective -- does it meet the needs of the end user. When I've been on web teams, we tested functionality by using and, actually, trying to break the website. :) We would use it from the perspective of different user groups, based upon business analysis. (Publishers of content have different requirements than searchers/readers. Professionals have different needs than the general public. Treat this as one more user group in your website testing.   
Everyone else is posting excellent examples of how you can simulate different disabilities, but I wanted to assure you that you are not stepping on toes in this instance.   


Put the screen too far away, for blurry vision use smears of butter on a screen filter  for example.   
Have them use a screen reader. Use both an app for desktop and laptop computers. Have them \*also\* use the integrated screen reader that is in most modern cell phones. Many people with vision impairments use screen readers and website's navigation can really break down. Screen readers also benefit those with reading and vision processing disorders. It is also a way to understand how the alt tags for graphics and pictures work.

Have them use voice input.  
Forcing them to use voice input to navigate will help simulate the more severe hand mobility issues. When I worked with students in community college with severe reading disabilities -- they used both voice input and output.  
Have them use a keyboard only to navigate and \*interact\* with your site will help simulate both users with vision impairment and those with hand mobility/coordination issues.   


I'm not sure what to simulate to get them to understand why navigation and directions need to be simple, direct and clear. There are a variety of learning disabilities that benefit from this. But, it really benefits all of your users. 

Frankly, they don't even necessarily need to know the details -- just that different user groups are using different input and output devices. Put together the same kind of business analysis report you do with any user group.   


You might also benefit from running user studies with users that regularly use alternative ways to interact with your website. That way you can see how experienced users function on your website. Your developers may not be aware of all of the features within a screen reader for example. Those with vision loss can listen at faster than average speed for example. I would be curious to know if your website slows down their flow.

1950,"My college’s official dorm policy was that anyone not a resident of the county had to live in the dorms all four years. Freshmen had to live in one of three dorm sets. There were private rooms offered in these, but I was given “first choice” of rooms to guarantee my needs were met. For the upperclassmen years, housing choices were done based on a lottery system using points, but I was allowed to choose before the lottery took place. So there were only 3 female private rooms with private bathrooms on campus, but I was guaranteed one by not having to go through the lottery system. I definitely think you are within your rights to request a private room, but you might need more reasons than just the space (they might have a few rooms available that are larger than standard - my dorms did). You could probably get a doctor to support a private room by stating you need to have the ability to nap in a quiet environment when exhausted and that you require more sleep than your peers as well as access to privacy for your medical care and the ability to limit germs in your living environment to prevent illness. You will want to reach out to housing as soon as you accept at a college and make an accommodation request. At my college, housing was handled separately than all other accommodations. Oh, and if you need accommodations for dietary reasons that was separate too (like we were not normally allowed to take food out of the cafeteria, but I had a pass that allowed me to carry out meals back to my dorm room when I did not feel well but still wanted a meal; for food allergies they can or must provide ingredient lists if requested).",,,,one_sock_wonder_,,,1560346776,t5_2qhe8,t3_bzj3oh,t1_eqtmv94,1,1569638572,0,0,eqvlqzq,disability,,,,,

2025,"Really sorry you've had to go through that. While I can't say my disability has played much of a part in the opinion I've had about jobs in the past, I've been where you are--technically, am there.

2046,"A bit late to the party, but I’ve had ME/CFS for a bit over 5 years and have experience at both the mild and the moderate (mostly housebound the last 3.5 years) level of the illness. Apologies in advance for how long this got!

There can be so much grief in a situation like ours. It’s normal. It’s not wrong to be grieving, and to call it grieving. Many people won’t understand the legitimacy of this grieving process, but they don’t matter here— you do. 

Imagine a ball inside a box. Inside the box is also a “grief button”. At first, the box is small and that ball is pressing that button all the time. It feels awful and terrible and you’ve got the why-mes all day long. Feel those feelings as much as you need to, but also try to move towards other feelings. As time goes by, the box starts to get bigger, so that there are moments when the ball isn’t pushing the grief button. The box keeps getting bigger over time, and eventually you’ll have more hours, days or even weeks in a row where the ball isn’t constantly mashing the grief button. For me, seeing someone run by is a-ok some days, and other days it sends the ball straight to the grief button. Knowing  how normal that is has been really helpful for me. 

The most important ME/CFS-specific advice I can give is to try and learn to put your health first as much as you possibly can. If you’re trying to figure out if you have enough energy for something, or think maybe you shouldn’t do something— don’t do it! There’s gotta be energy left for processing everything that’s happening to you. 

A close second priority should be things you enjoy, things that are fun— I know the illness takes a lot of that, but whatever you have left that makes your life a little more enjoyable, make sure you prioritize it. It’s really really important to our overall well-being to try and do this. You might need to find new “bed friendly” hobbies, and this can take time, but don’t get discouraged. Everything takes more time with ME, even just coming up with a new thing you might like to try. 

It was a few years into being sick before I heard from any “medical” people that resting and having fun if possible were the best things I could do for myself, and I really wish I’d had this knowledge sooner, instead of feeling like I should keep working and cooking and cleaning until my body literally gave up.",,,,keepingthisasecret,,,1561551620,t5_2qhe8,t3_c5g78c,t3_c5g78c,6,1570950161,0,0,es32qkm,disability,,,,,

That is why the (grand) mother's offer to help raise the baby is not weighed into the decision.  


If someone is unable to make other medical decisions for themselves, at what point do we say that they can make \*this\* decision for themselves? It is always a very grey area when you get into those with cognitive disabilities.

I can’t even imagine the pain of children rejecting him.... he’s just so sweet &amp; loves other kids! All he wants to do is play, &amp; teach them, but also learn from them &amp; play.... 
I’m so so so scared for the future.... cause it’s only going to get worse.... &amp; I have no idea how to prepare him for it, let alone myself....

2089,"I suspect that what some people might be responding to is the assumption in the post that it is remarkable that Keller and Girma did so much hard work. The implication would be that other people with the same impairments haven’t worked as hard.

What most disability folks would argue is that, while Keller and Girma are both fascinating and compelling figures, it is social barriers that prevent most people with disabilities from achieving the same level of esteem. Rather than focusing on a personal narrative of “overcoming through hard work”, the important question would be, “What social constructs are standing in the way of people with disabilities that lead people to regard only a select few as remarkable?”

She will need some updated medical records and they will send out some letters to her doctors. 

I would see if you can talk to your local county office and get her on Medicaid. There is sometimes a waiver for interim disabled people who are waiting for SSI/SSDI cases to be approved. I was on that for two years while I waited for my case to be approved.

I almost got invited to a party once in middle school and then the kids mom said ""maybe we could hang out later"" because she didn't think the venue was accessible. 

Anyways, my parents were honest but incredibly empathetic. I think a simple ""sometimes people's bodies work and grow differently and we don't know why"" is sufficient re: explanation. I think it's important to keep it simple, metaphor free, and to the point. Flowery language is totally not helpful here.

2166,"My wife has a service dog, and actually carries around wallet cards from the Americans with Disabilities Association that explain the [legal rules](https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm) for service dogs. They vary slightly by state, but employees can ask two questions: 

1. Is this a service dog for a disability?
2. What task have they been trained to perform?

They cannot ask what disability a customer has, and they can't ask that the dog demonstrate their task. 

However, if a dog is badly behaved, the patron *can* be asked to leave, whether it's a ""real"" service dog or not. Misbehavior is anything from sniffing merchandise and approaching other customers, like you described (service dogs should heel at their handler's side), to having accidents or becoming aggressive. Normal shedding, other people not liking dogs, or allergies do not count as misbehaving.

They vary slightly by state, but employees can ask two questions: 

1. Is this a service dog for a disability?
2. What task have they been trained to perform?

They cannot ask what disability a customer has, and they can't ask that the dog demonstrate their task. 

However, if a dog is badly behaved, the patron *can* be asked to leave, whether it's a ""real"" service dog or not. Misbehavior is anything from sniffing merchandise and approaching other customers, like you described (service dogs should heel at their handler's side), to having accidents or becoming aggressive. Normal shedding, other people not liking dogs, or allergies do not count as misbehaving.

2181,"&gt;There's also this whole thing where we only allow the term disabled or PWD to be applied towards those with visible disabilities.

This makes me rage, I love the phrase ""person with disabilities"" because to me it sounds more inclusive of disabilities as a wide and varied range of issues.

Back when I was a full time crutches user I was comfortable telling people ""I'm a disabled person"" or ""I have *a* disability"" because there was this visual representation of one of my biggest limitations (mobility) and people didn't question it. 

But now that I'm doing well with PT, my issues are almost all invisible, and I am ""able-passing"" (a term which in itself is problematic, but it's a social situation that exists and needs to be talked about) if I say ""I have a disability"" or ""I'm disabled"" it always leads to questions or statements about how I'm ""not *that* disabled"" (uh, thanks, but I didn't quantify my level of disability, I merely disclosed that I had one) 

So now I'm more likely to say ""I identity as person with disabilities"" because for me, it's not just one thing that I struggle with, how my singular medical condition effects me results in multiple disabilities (when you define disability as a dysfunctional ability to carry out a task), and my issues are of varying levels of interference on my life.

To me, the word ""disabled"" sounds ultimate, you either can or can't, but ""person with disabilities"" sounds like it describes the true spectrum that is disability, sometimes I can and sometimes I can't, I have disabilities, but right now I am might not be disabled.",,,,DearyDairy,"UTCD, HoH",,1560585613,t5_2qhe8,t3_c0pg8g,t1_er7kljg,2,1569939557,0,0,er7rz97,disability,,,,,

I know I had to make due with a computer chair for a while before my wheelchair arrived.

There's a lot of features in a wheelchair friendly apartment that help. 

Electric outlets are higher up on the wall, light switches lowered, my front door is remote controlled, the hallways are wider. 

I also have a lot of grab bars around the toilet and the bathroom door slides like a closet door instead of opening plus the sink is lower while also having space underneath to get my wheelchair/legs underneath it so I'm close enough.

The kitchen I think is my favourite. The sink has no cabinets underneath so I can park my chair and do the dishes. My stovetop and oven are separated, with the stovetop being like the sink in that I can roll up to it and fit my legs underneath. The oven is actually in the wall at (for someone who is standing) torso level and opens like a microwave. It has pull-out cutting boards/countertops in the wall underneath it so I can slide things from the oven rack onto them and not get burned or have to put hot things in my lap.

2207,"it's basically illegal unless the business has fewer than 15 employees, which would mean that they're exempt from the ada (at that point you'd have to look at state law). i would give a request in writing specifically requesting accommodations under the americans with disabilities act and keep a copy for yourself. if they are just ignorant that the ada exists then this will give them a chance to learn about it.

the way the ada works is that they don't have to give you the accommodation you want, but they can't refuse to give accommodations at all because they ""aren't fair"" and they can't give you an accommodation you don't agree is an accommodation. if they still refuse, you would not be out of place contacting a lawyer or reporting them to the equal employment opportunity commission.

reporting to the eeoc sounds really foreboding and is in fact a requirement to sue them, but the first step they will do is assign a mediator to see if they can work out something that works for everyone. even if you never intend to sue, it's still a good option to get a neutral party into the picture and if the employer fires you in response to you doing the report it looks really bad. the mediator doesn't cost the business anything either.

2208,"I didn't get to finishing your post (brain fog strikes again) but I felt compelled to share how beautiful I find thunderstorms. Feel free to roll your eyes. 

I saw a quote when I was younger (pre disability) that said ""I love thunderstorms. The hiss of the wind, the boom of the thunder, the lightning that lights up the sky. Why? Because of the chaos. Because sometimes in this boring, scheduled life, this waiting-for-friday-night life that we all lead, we just need the world to remind us that not everything is perfect. Sometimes nature can't handle the pressure. Sometimes the sky explodes. ""

Now that I'm older and disabled, I like to take out the waiting-for-Friday-night part and it speaks to me as a metaphor for disability. (my disability specifically, where my body gets overwhelmed then overcompensates on repeat until I just passout and reset) my body can't handle the chaos and sometimes that turns into an episode of pseudobulbar affect or something else uncontrollable. 

I think that taking something scary and destructive and flipping it to be beautiful can have a calming effect.
