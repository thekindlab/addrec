5,"&gt;Would my dog have legal rights as a service animal if it was trained to encourage me to get up &amp; active?

The short answer is no. This is really no different from anyone who has a dog. You could definitely get your dog to be an ESA and that would come with some helpful components when it comes to housing.

Now, having said that, some of what you've described does seem like you might be looking for a psychiatric service dog (seen often with people with PTSD, for example) but it needs to provide more service than just getting you out of bed each day since a dog, by virtue of being a dog, is going to require that anyway. Do you have anxiety attacks in public? Do you get nervous if people get too close to you in public? When you're at home and you start to have emotional upheaval - do you self harm in a way that a dog could recognize the signs and distract you by, say, nudging your hand? (You don't have to answer any of these questions, I'm just trying to give you examples.) Those are all things that a dog can be trained to alert to and that would make them a service dog rather than an ESA.

All that said, you sound like you're straddling a really fine line. I'd recommend popping over to /r/service_dogs and asking your question there. The people on that sub are incredibly knowledgable and will be able to address the nuances of your situation better than I can.

10,"I'm a 32-year-old paraplegic man and my girlfriend is 27 with no disability.  Our sex life is great.  She's currently pregnant with our first child, so sex has been a little slower.  She used to live off of caffeine, being pregnant alone is hard work, but without the caffeine she's even more tired.  That's not to say that she denies sex because she's too tired.  The opposite, she's good to go almost anywhere/anytime.  It's just that I know she's tired and I feel bad initiating sex, so I don't do it as often.  We still have sex a couple times a week.  My girlfriend's sex drive is high.  We would spend half the day having sex every day if it was up to her.  We would never get anything done.  

I'd say our sex life is above normal just based on frequency alone, but there's more too it than that.  I see all sorts of men complain about how their SO's never want to have sex or never give them oral, etc. etc.  My girlfriend would give me oral all day if I let her and has said as much.  And, like I said previously, she's always game for sex.  I think out of the 3 years we've been together she has only turned me down once and that is because she was feeling sick.  I could go on and on about how great she is in bed.  Due to my physical limitations I sometimes feel that she's wasted on me.  She's just so damn good in bed.  My friends and I aren't the type to talk about our sexual conquests and shit like that, but sometimes I wish I could just to express how amazing she is.  That's why I'll take opportunities like this on the internet to sing her praises.

No girl is the same as another.  They are all different people.  Some might have known an uncle or a family member who was disabled and they are just used to it and it aint no big thing.  Some are curious and genuinely want to just ""Give it a shot"".  They might feel guilty for saying ""no"" to a person with a disability so they are giving it a shot.  All anyone can ask for is honesty.  Remember, a  lot of relationships in the world start out as friends and then get stronger from there. There are no ""rules"" for dating or when someone falls for another.

Put yourself out there, be honest and upfront, expect that the other person does that same.  If you are not getting back that same honesty, then move on.  If you are expecting emotional maturity, then make sure to look at yourself first, then the other person.

What are the concerns and pitfalls for someone using a wheelchair if I am designing X?  One option is to interview a bunch of wheelchair users, which should definitely be done.

Sometimes, getting the experience and getting in the mindset are a more effective way of understanding the practical concerns and developing an intuition.

In other words, they're not trying to get the ""disabled for a day"" experience for their own development - they're trying to recognize what challenges they never thought of so they can be better informed designers and not miss things that are obvious to anyone who actually uses a wheelchair but not people who never have.

I am not on SSI/SSDI but this is something that has been discussed the world over with various social safety nets. Your proposals are to say 'okay we'll support you for this disability you don't choose to have...but you have to live life how WE want.' It's a form of control.

83,"I'd been an adult for about a year when my disease hit again, and all my work experience was in fast food and restaurants (with a stint in retail that made me swear off retail itself, lol). I was in school but stopped for a while when my health got bad. I'm only now getting back 3 years later.

Anyway, I kept trying to push myself in restaurant work, with my boss taking it as a personal insult when I asked to leave early because it hurt too much to stand. To be fair, I should've been more open and communicative about it but it was all new to me and I had no idea how.

So after way too long of me limping to peoples tables, I quit and started seeking disability benefits because I wasn't qualified in anything I could physically manage. Not working or going to school was...depressing.

I tried to get office jobs for a while but with no relevnt experience it was hard. One day, with just a few minutes to spare, I found a listing for a medical assistant. I thought, I'm not qualified, but it's a fast app and that would be cool.

I got called 2 days later. I'm not qualified or certified, but between the amount of time I've spent with doctors in my life and the fact that I'm an uber-nerd bio major, they decided I had enough relevant knowledge and they would train me for the rest. I now have a part-time, decently paying, amazingly understanding and flexible workplace, just out of sheer luck and, like - just who I am.

I'm sometimes sitting, sometimes standing or walking a little, which is perfect for me. They understand if my arthritis is so bad I can't write or file or if my stomach flares up and I need to go home. I'm 6 months in with a raise and i still can't believe how blindly lucky I was to end up here.

They don't have a permit, which would include inspection for essential safety matters like proper means of egress, safety inspections and such. This means they are all profit, they don't care about guest safety.

138,"I just had a significant conversation with my closest friend to this effect. We are both C5-6 quads, intelligent, educated and motivated. Both of us were injured in motor vehicle accidents, mine about 10 years after his. In that 10 years the laws in our province changed from being tort law, where you would sue either the other driver, the province for negligence in maintaining roads, or simply the insurance company, to no fault insurance. I am under no fault insurance and have pretty significant coverage but have no control over it as it is deemed payouts as opposed to a lump sum of money. After a genuine attempt to become educated and return to work, I discovered that maintaining my health while completing education requirements in the time frame given, that I was probably better off not being so motivated.

The conversation I spoke about was friendly, because we are good friends, but hurt a little bit. My friend, who has needed to work all these years has, expressed that he felt somewhat bitter that I did not. We both agreed that if he were in my position he would not know what he would do. Would he force himself to go work, despite the risks of losing his income or would he settle for security and be disgusted at himself for not using what he has to help others and to contribute to society. I love my photography and am damn good at it. However, doing anything other than hobby work risks the financial security that I enjoy. If I actually did try to turn it into part-time work where I earned income and contributed more to society, I would risk the security that I need in order to feel like I could pursue my talents.

While I was receiving my education for business administration, specializing in accountancy, I met a neighbor who lived in the same building that I did, who had been disabled since his teenage years with severe arthritis. He told me about how he was once motivated and soon learned that it wasn't worth it with the way the systems were, that when he did need to be off for joint replacements or simple other things that affected him because of his disability, he never got the income he needed to survive properly and eventually he gave up. He lectured me that pursuing what I was pursuing was a waste and that eventually I would give in to mediocrity and the security that it would provide. To this date, he is right though I still feel motivated to do all that I am able to because it is in my nature. I should state that I gave up on the business administration and accounting once I discovered I was skilled in photography, which is what I pursue with my every spare moment, now.

Still, every time I push myself I always find myself metaphorically looking over my shoulder, wondering if the insurance company is ready to pounce on me for doing something useful and would deem me employable. Like I said, I wouldn't have a problem with that if something happened that I had a downturn in my health or needed to take care of some things, and would immediately and without question have income replacement reinstated. I know very well from other people in this area that that will not happen and risking the security of my income and my family's wellbeing would be foolish.

I've chosen to take a look at those bologna motivational posters telling you that you will look back and severely regret not having taken any chances and playing it safe. I'd like to know if the authors of those have ever really lost everything to the point that the only things that mattered were at risk because of the chance that they've taken. Maybe it's my nature, and there's always the tug of war of how far do I pursue my photography, what is reasonable to accept for remuneration without risking employment income? Or is the insurance company just too busy to worry about people like me. I have heard of cases where when anyone in a position like mine has been questioned they hired a couple of lawyers and the insurance company backed right off. I would hate to count on that because that sounds a little too risky to me and you know what I've already said about taking risks.

You are good at what you do and you want to do it, but your longevity is also on the table and for your well-being in the long-term you need to sacrifice something. A few of my friends worked themselves to death. They did not take care of pressure sores or infections and instead went to work until they died. They could not afford to not go to work and yet it cost them their life.

I hope that whatever the result is, and whatever conclusion you come to that is best for yourself, you have peace of mind at least.

150,"I'm seeing a lot of assumptions and mis-information about how vocational, or job, information is evaluated.

An evaluator will look at medical records and make a determination about what you are capable of doing based on your impairments and condition - either physical or mental. You may be able to lift a certain amount, only stand for a certain period of time, or you may not be able to use your hands all the time. For mental disabilities, you may not be able to work around others, or you may have some limitations in your ability to concentrate or maintain a good pace of work. 

Once the examiner has determined what you can do, he/she will look at your past work to see if you can do any of it. Only jobs where you earned SGA (substantial gainful activity) for that year are considered. Currently, you have to earn 1170/mo. So only jobs where you made that much are considered. 

If you cannot do any of your past jobs based on your physical and/or mental impairments, we will look at the medical/vocational rules set up by SSA. These rules dictate whether or not, based on age and education, a person can adjust to other work. It is true that the younger you are, the more likely it is that you can adjust to other work. By ""other work"", SSA means ANY jobs that are available that you are physically or mentally able to do. SSA does not factor in if you will not be hired due to location, sexuality, race, etc. That's just how it is.

""Other work"" could be work you have trained for or not. It can be anything from working in a fast food restaurant to being the CEO of a fortune 500 company. Other work is any employment that exists in adequate numbers in the national economy. 

The vocational rules are rigid, especially for younger people. They do not allow for a lot of case-to-case individual factors. However, these rules have been set by SSA, and examiners are not able to change them.

To address DivaPowers- ""Full or part time, if it's a job on its way to not existing anymore(assembly job replaced by machines), if it's something you'd get fired in a week or two from having to call in, any job or employment any situation ever.""
Part time work is only considered if it produced over the SGA amount, as discussed.
I do admit that the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), from the Department of Labor, is somewhat outdated. It is set to be updated 2019, I believe. 

I hope that made sense. It's a very complicated progress/idea. Examiner training is intensive and ongoing, and I tried to explain it as broadly, but concisely, as I could. ",,,,disability_examiner,Name says it all,,1499297048,t5_2qhe8,t3_6khdpx,t3_6khdpx,2,1500987629,0,0,djtxa11,disability,,,,,

157,"I don't have your disability (I'm an amputee) but everything you said sounds like anxiety I experience, so I also kind of wonder if it might actually be separate from your disability, because that's what I'm coming to realize about myself.

I'm in my early-30s too, and I made a lot of dumb mistakes at work when I got back from my disability leave, after my accident when I was 28. I started feeling like I didn't belong, and might not even belong in my industry anymore, and would just never be the same.

I ended up finding a new job, but all the same anxieties came back- feeling like I was falling behind, not pulling my weight, bringing my team down, etc. Not quite as high stakes as your job sounds, but similar. When I got laid off last year, it was because of a merger, but I neurotically felt like I would have been able to save my job had I not been disabled.

My therapist is helping me divorce all the anxiety of my job from the anxiety of the disability. I'm starting to see that they feed off each other and warp how I think others are perceiving me.

Reading your story, I hope it's the same for you. It sounds like you are valued at your job, and that maybe your coworkers aren't bothered by your mistakes as much as you are.

164,"I hate talking on the phone and find myself a particularly poor self-advocate over the phone.

Do you have a therapist, primary care doctor, social worker, or a parental/authority figure you trust? Ask someone you trust, and whom you let you guard down around, if they can accompany you to doctors/DSS/etc. appointments. If you must make a phone call, maybe do so after a relaxing walk or meal with your confidant. Joke around beforehand to reduce your anxiety and the stress you place on the importance of the call.

The symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and mental illness can seem like mild autism, but may not be. Particularly if your anxiety began at a young age, you may not have developed socially at the same pace as your peers, and recognizing that can produce even more anxiety and a sense that you are not good at talking to people. Most autistic people would not be able to recognize their social awkwardness as it is happening. I am not diagnosing you either, but I recognize the intense desire to figure out what is ""wrong"" with you and put a name on it to better understand yourself. The fact that you recognize your social awkwardness as it happens suggests social intelligence that can be nurtured. There is a future where you will not be ""inside your head,"" and you can exist without a running dialogue. I understand what it is like to perceive everything around you acutely, but feel unable to engage with people outside of self. All it takes is feeling understood by one person to get the ball rolling toward a better future with less social anxiety.

186,"I definitely understand the emotions you are going through.  I was awarded SSDI last April after being out of work for 2 and having really bad problems with employment due to my disability for several years before that.

I was also surprised that I did not have to go through the rejection and appeals process as mental health disability is not often approved the first time.

I still struggle with the 'label' though I really have been trying hard to get over it.

A few things to look out for that I had to deal with in the past year:  If you are receiving Medicaid, you may no longer qualify if your SSDI payments are more than the limit for Medicaid.  You also won't get Medicare from Social Security until 24 months of payments.  (starting from the month your back pay began, or 6 months from the official date you became disabled according to Social Security) This caused a big disruption in who I was able to see for care and my meds.  I am agoraphobic and lost my connection to my doctors because my insurance was dropped and had to purchase a marketplace plan that did not cover them, so it was really difficult for me and I still have not been able to resume care since I had to stop.  This is something that I'm currently working on being able to get back to that point.

If you get back pay, try to pocket as much away as a cushion as you can.  I would consider myself extremely frugal, but after several years of erratic employment, thing had gotten bad for me financially and a lot of that back pay check went to shoring up debt, finalizing bankruptcy, buying necessities like a bed (had basically been sleeping on the floor).",,,,merdepost,,,1500500767,t5_2qhe8,t3_6nuh18,t3_6nuh18,2,1501393216,0,0,dkg57pz,disability,,,,,

I've been lonely in relationships and totally socially connected as a single person. 

The truth is that single or no, you have all the tools you need for a joy-filled life, given time and some hard work. Become the person YOU want to be, and put a premium on kindness without precondition. I can't promise that will make your dream woman appear. What I can promise is that you'll be happier for it, and closer to being ready for a loving, adult relationship with her when she does arrive.

249,"There really is no special secret to it. Confidence helps a lot, as well as communicating. When HR asks for accommodations, especially during onboarding specify some of your solid limits. Simple, effective, not aggressive points to be recorded. You don't have to express details of your condition.  For example, I have specified that I don't lift over 15lbs and don't hand-write much. I also express a lot of solid confidence in what I can and cannot do. I have worked to not sound confused or questioning anymore. Some managers/employers may view this as ""lazy"" excuses, but I've got a paper trail supporting my claim. I also work very hard, so my bosses have learned that when I say no, it's a solid no. 
    
It really depends on the situation and people involved. I can deal with ""annoyed"" and will redirect to HR or my file that contains info on my accommodations, but if I was fired for not doing something that was not established to be one of my duties. I'd either be reaching out to HR to start with or possibly an employment lawyer. I've never had to, so I'm uncertain how that kind of procedure would go. Most of my workplaces have been very relaxed and are more concerned with me not hurting myself (and bringing a lawsuit to their door) than they are with my not being able to do the thing.  
  
  
Other than workplaces, I just don't let people try to push me around. Try to tell me I need to eat outside or cannot be in a public business because of my (well behaved) Service Dog, I don't apologize. It could make me come across as perhaps mean and standoffish, but I end up correcting someone every few months that it would be illegal and discrimination to tell me to leave. Usually a manager shows up and ends up correcting the employee as Service Dog handler customers are not often mentioned in their training and often they panic not being sure how to handle the situation.

272,""" in my experience typing is harder than using a mouse""
maybe speech to text? Well, it's very much possible this is not the best input methods for most people, but perhaps for a certain niche group of people.

Also if you want to digitize it, you're going to need to type the names on those blocks anyway, so not sure if the speed would that much faster when you could drag &amp; drop.

"" grab bag of pre-saved templates to pull from can also save me. ""

Good point. I did not explain yet, but the intent is to also have the options to include 'components' (groups of blocks with a name) and insert them with a single word. I'm still working this part out, but think along the lines of ""Add .fancyfooter"". Those components could then have pre-set attributes like 'type=image' making the block look like an image, or 'type=text', making it look like a piece of text in the rendering of the image. Where the rendering software could perhaps be set to be 'sketchy' or 'formal'.

Also since the source is also text like the input commands, you could very easily share your components.

292,"Hey! That's not a photo of my chair, but this happened to me too! Although I can't confirm it was United *because of reasons*. The airline refused to listen to me for instructions on moving the chair. The wheelchair lift was in use on another plane, so they tried to get it out of the plane using the regular luggage lift, extended as high as it would go. 

Some idiot forgot that he had disengaged the motors, so when he let go of the chair to do something else it rolled right off the platform and fell out the side of the plane. $35k, 300lbs for ~30 feet. It was fucking destroyed.it also could have easily killed someone.

And then they lied about it so they could put me on the plane and not tell me in the terminal. I was so upset. The only thing that calmed me down was that the person who had to tell me was also really upset.

When I got to my destination they had arranged for a loaner wheelchair to be delivered. It was brand new and from a dealer -- downside to this is he was constantly pressuring me to tell the airline I wanted to keep *that* chair so they would buy it from him, and it wound up with a lot of awkward conversations and him trying to constantly make me switch chairs so he could sell the one I was using. Real jerk.

In the end, it worked out pretty well. It took them well over 6 months to replace my chair, but they had a guy come out and do custom fittings, answer all my questions, etc. just like the first time. They allowed me to choose whether I wanted the same manufacturer or to switch to Permobile (the brand I'd been renting).

That's not a photo of my chair, but this happened to me too! Although I can't confirm it was United *because of reasons*. The airline refused to listen to me for instructions on moving the chair. The wheelchair lift was in use on another plane, so they tried to get it out of the plane using the regular luggage lift, extended as high as it would go. 

Some idiot forgot that he had disengaged the motors, so when he let go of the chair to do something else it rolled right off the platform and fell out the side of the plane. $35k, 300lbs for ~30 feet. It was fucking <URL> also could have easily killed someone.

And then they lied about it so they could put me on the plane and not tell me in the terminal. I was so upset. The only thing that calmed me down was that the person who had to tell me was also really upset.

When I got to my destination they had arranged for a loaner wheelchair to be delivered. It was brand new and from a dealer -- downside to this is he was constantly pressuring me to tell the airline I wanted to keep *that* chair so they would buy it from him, and it wound up with a lot of awkward conversations and him trying to constantly make me switch chairs so he could sell the one I was using. Real jerk.

In the end, it worked out pretty well. It took them well over 6 months to replace my chair, but they had a guy come out and do custom fittings, answer all my questions, etc. just like the first time.

307,"I have literally never posted a comment on Reddit, but your post is something that I really relate to, especially the ""I don't really have other people to talk to about this"" part.  I am able-bodied and my wife (who is also on Reddit and will likely read this) has cerebral palsy and has trouble walking.  Growing up her family helped her a lot, she was always very involved in sports and has a good education (better than mine), so she's a pretty well-rounded individual that just kind of needs ""help"" with mundane things around the house (like carrying coffee, or just ""getting"" something from another room) and tends to need rides everywhere she wants to go.

When we were dating and did not live together friends and family would drive her to appointments or to get groceries, she lived close enough to wherever she wanted to go that she could scoot there and, generally, I never had to deal with the challenges she had around the house and was happy to help her when I was around and she asked me.

When we moved in together all the things other people were doing for her shifted to me, suddenly I was constantly being interrupted from what I was doing to just ""grab something"" or ""carry this"" and every appointment required me to schedule time off work to drive her.  For the longest time I had no idea this was taking such a toll on me mentally and emotionally, I was easily irritable, I was feeling a lot of stress when I was home and our relationship was suffering (it didn't help that our first apartment was a hell-hole of epic proportions).

Eventually we moved (a couple of times) and I was still feeling stressed and burnt out, so I did the only thing I could and talked to her.  I just kind of laid it out, the things I needed from her.  She had never needed her license, but there's no reason she couldn't get it, there were just some additional hurdles, so we agreed to tackle that together.  When I was away for work or unavailable she needed to ask family and friends for help like when she lived with a roommate.  She needed to start seeking out help from the community and using the resources that were available.

I know you say you have talked to your partner, so I guess this comment is more a ""solidarity"" comment, I feel your pain and, in my experience, honesty is the best policy.  It's awkward and difficult and it sucks, but you need to take care of yourself too, or else you can't help anyone.  I have had to tell myself that ""I am not my wife's worker, I am her husband"" more than once in my life, and telling her that I was feeling this way helped our relationship and made us better partners.  We are still working and have a long way to go, but just knowing that we are working on it helps me feel better (and she feels good about it too).  We have made some modifications to our home to make things easier for her, she is getting her license and we regularly spend time with our other friends away from each-other.

It's just like any other relationship, but there's this dynamic that no one wants to talk about because it makes them feel awkward or like a jerk to acknowledge it.  The truth is your partner probably feels it too and, honestly, it makes them feel awkward too.  Every other relationship in my life has not had this dynamic, I wouldn't trade my wife for anyone else, but as partners we need to stop and make sure we take care of ourselves too.",,,,midnightLuke,,,1500649126,t5_2qhe8,t3_6ok9sw,t3_6ok9sw,5,1501441424,0,0,dkivdsq,disability,,,,,

If the qualifications are met, an initial decision takes 3-6 months - as little as *days* if a person is terminally ill (I have literally received approvals the very next day.)

You have to remember, not everyone who applies is going to meet the medical criteria, and for some who do, it may not be initially clear from the available evidence, so yes - in those cases they may take much much longer with appeals.

That was a horrible, one sided, and unfair opinion I had. After being exposed to actual Deaf people and watching a good documentary (it had Marlee Matlin in it! Hey!), it really started me being moved by the Deaf culture. 

Am I capital D? No, but perhaps I will be in the future. I wish to live in the hearing world, but for the time being it will be very difficult to do so, given my unique situation. It would be easier to be with other deaf people, even if I only know SEE. But, I still can't personally... identify or relate with them, culturally wise, you know? I can't say I'm proud of my disability... really, I am aggressively pursuing a new upgrade for one side of my CI implants, and trying to get an appointment for new mapping on the other processor I have now.

329,"I think it definitely depends person to person and condition to condition. For instance, I have a developmental disability, a visual impairment, and a chronic pain condition (which is accompanied by brain fog and IBS symptoms). Growing up, I was never ""proud"" per se of my eye condition (it's a birth defect) but I accepted it as my reality and rarely saw it as a huge obstacle. 

I have had times where my pain is so bad or my brain isn't working like it should or I can't do something I really wanted or needed to because of my disabilities. But honestly, now as an adult, on most days I find myself proud to be who I am and proud to accomplish what I do. Admittedly, sometimes that accomplishment is going downstairs to pee and making it back upstairs to lay down. But I find pride in the little things now, and I find pride in what I can do. 

I have never liked the ""handi-capable"", ""differently abled"", ""special needs"" view of disability. Even person-first ID (as in, ""person with autism"" versus ""autistic person"") is a little grating to me. I'm studying to teach Special Education, and I see this shit all the time. It takes away the agency from the disabled person to make their own judgements and feelings about their particular situation, and I feel like it's an effort to separate the person from their disability in a way that is unfair to the disabled person. I have limitations. I have a disability. I am disabled. Calling me anything else takes away those facts and makes me someone I am not: am abled person. I will always have these limitations, and it's a part of my identity--especially my developmental disability (most likely autism). My disabilities color the way I experience the world, and I take pride in my unique perspective. The ""we're all the same!"" model only serves to allow abled people to ignore us more, only now they can say they're being polite or it's for our own good. 

I hold my cane and stim toys with pride, because I am proud of myself as a person and they are part of who I am. It might not be the most popular opinion, and I understand how it would be different for folks in other situations, but for me this is how I feel.

339,"Again, I disagree with the first half of your post here. Especially in smaller towns/more rural areas, having an attorney has influence. The two SSA people I knew (since moved to a larger area) both agreed to that, and the paralegal on my case told me it was something g that looked like she could push through. 

There's also a difference in getting a good lawyer and a shitty lawyer. I didn't get into it here because the post was already long, but I've always advocated local lawyers because the national ones are awful, *and* they don't have any local contacts. Mine was on the phone with my SSA rep twice a week, and told me something like two weeks before it happened that mine was going to be approved, and then had the SSA rep call me the day it was approved -- another week before I got the official mail.

I also said I don't know anyone with my condition that gets approved first time. Even at the national conference, I couldn't find anyone (the year before I applied). The difference was an attorney, and where we filed. I know plenty of people with other disorders who were approved first go-round.

&gt; Finally, you clearly know nothing about SSDI/SSI and the attorney process. 

Yep. I'm an asshole here to cost everyone money, and I have no relation to this process at all. 

You're right my numbers were fucked. It's been a few years since I did this, and I completely forgot it was capped. It means the math is wrong, but not that the premise is incorrect. For most recipients hiring an attorney would still save you money a long as you hadn't waited more than 18 months from the date you became disabled to file. You'd need to have 24,0000 in backpay owed by the end of phase one to *not* save money. I'll update my post to reflect that. That's my fault.

I get that you're with the SSA. I still don't believe that having a *good* attorney has no impact, because since I was approved, the two other people I worked with locally were both approved when their conditions said it should have gone to an ALJ. It's anecdotal evidence, you're right. But having someone to handle the paperwork and saving several thousand dollars isn't going to hurt anyone, and as you said 65% need an attorney anyway. Most of the cases who will be approved immediately know they fit that criteria and won't get a lawyer. It won't harm the 65% moving on, and for those borderline cases, the ones I was speaking to specifically, it has the potential to save them several thousand dollars and quite a few headaches.",,,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1500217193,t5_2qhe8,t3_6ndkhy,t1_dkae7ap,2,1501292469,0,0,dkajo61,disability,,,,,

377,"I'm not 100% sure I understand your question. It sounds like you're asking whether autism can cause learning delays.

Although popular media has a lot of images of people with autism who have extraordinary abilities, many autistics have low IQs or intellectual disability.  (The exact percentage is hard to pin down because we've really increased the diagnosis of intellectually average-to-above-average autistics in the past 10 years, so the pool is shifting.) Regardless, there are many people with autism who have general low intellectual ability and that will impede learning. (And yes, low IQ and extraordinary ability can exist in the same person - but that's even rarer.)

Language impairments are a major symptom of autism, which slows learning in all domains, especially literacy.

A sizable percentage of autistic people have motor impairments which make handwriting difficult.

Thinking abstractly is a core deficit in autism, which can manifest as difficulties with reading comprehension, applied math, etc.

Autism inherently causes difficulties in imagining what others know, called theory of mind. This can lead to problems with reading comprehension (can't keep track of characters in a story), and particularly in writing (can't keep track of what the reader knows, so information is out of order, missing, repeated, etc.).

And of course, other autism symptoms impede learning indirectly. It's hard to pay attention to the teacher if you're more interested in sensory stimulation. If you don't have the social skills to handle a mild correction, you're going to be throwing a lot of tantrums as you learn basic academics. If you don't understand body language like pointing and eye contact, you'll have a hard time following lessons.  

Autistic children vary widely in their IQs and even more widely in their academic attainment. In some cases, the best strategy is to work on the autism symptoms directly - if the child has limited vocabulary, teach vocabulary. In other cases, it's better to try to accommodate the autism symptom to continue to teach academics - if the child's motor skills are delayed, it might be bests to teach typing rather than continue to push handwriting.",,,,nezumipi,,,1500903177,t5_2qhe8,t3_6p546j,t3_6p546j,1,1501520628,0,0,dknbkfo,disability,,,,,

384,"I vehemently disagree with your second point about not hiring an attorney immediately. If you do not meet the specific criteria for an SSDI Disability pre-approved condition, then hiring an attorney prior to filing shouldn't even be a question for you. It may well save you $5k+.

If you're obviously not qualified at all for disability, it won't help you. Most of us here are borderline cases, though -- we'll eventually be approved, but don't quite meet the criteria for a Round-1 approval. Almost everyone I know with my set of circumstances was approved eventually, but I've never met anyone approved on their first application. Except me, and I'm convinced that it was because I hired a lawyer out of the gate. 

First off, it's because an attorney acts as a signaling device. It tells the SSA two things: one, that a professional attorney, paid on contingency, who has done this their entire life, believes that your disability  is severe enough that it will eventually be approved (so they can get paid). It also signals that, if you are turned down, you are ready and able to fight this until the end. That certainly helps to tip borderline cases in favor of approval.

The second aspect is that these attorneys all have contacts in the offices. Never underestimate the power of having a contact in the bureaucracy. 

Third, they know how all the paperwork should be filled out. They also know all the deadlines and can be sued themselves for malpractice if they miss a deadline, so they won't. You don't know these things, and it is very easy for even a healthy person to miss that appeal deadline -- much less a disabled person.

*""But the money!""* I hear people shouting. If you explicitly meet the criteria for a condition on their list, don't hire an attorney and keep all your money. But if you have a disability that isn't *explicitly* listed, if there is *any chance* you could be denied on the first round, it will likely cost you far less to hire an attorney right now. 

As was pointed out below, your attorney will take up to $6,000 at 25% of your backpay. If your payment will be $1,000/month, you would have to have waited almost two years from the date you became disabled to *not* save money by hiring an attorney. 

If you file the day you become disabled and are approved at that three month mark, your attorney will take $750. If you wait to hire an attorney until after you've been declined, they will almost certainly get the full $6,000. So it depends on how much your monthly payment will be, but it's really a small risk money-wise to have someone handle all your paperwork, and have the potential for it to aid in your approval.

Even if you hire an attorney immediately and aren't approved on the first round, it doesn't cost you any more than hiring one after being declined would have, and you get the added benefit that they did all the paperwork for you!

So yes, you're potentially risking $1,320 that there was a (exceptionally slim) chance that you could have kept, but you're risking that in order to earn $6k more than you (very) likely would have.

tl;dr: Don't be dumb, hire an attorney immediately. It increases your chances of being approved, and, if your condition isn't listed as an automatic qualifier, you either break even or save $6k. It's a small monetary risk, and if there is *any* chance that it could help your approval, isn't it worth it to try?

You're right on the Medicaid thing.  Have to have kids to qualify here, and that ain't happening.

406,"This is just off the top of my head, but
 do performance art

There is a shortage of people just acting random in colorful entertaining ways (playfully, that is) in public spaces.

Obviously you would have to have the courage and confidence to do that.
But maybe a little could go a long way: start by wearing a funny hat maybe.

Another concept I started to do is I bought cheap T shirts and some acrylic paints at Wal-Mart and you can paint anything you want onto the T shirts (and maybe sell them).

More ideas: Engage in whatever you like to do, and be sociable when you do it.
Example might be hang out at your local library and say hello quietly to people who seem to be sociable (like if they are not grumpy, if they are relaxed, if they are looking for something etc. if they don't seem to be afraid of you, if they seem to be like you a little, and if they aren't too occupied.  I guess you can tell if they look around at other people they might not mind if you said hello to them.  A lot of people just look away and act uptight, so maybe not those ones!)

One time I bought a T shirt that had tire marks on it from a wheelchair, because it was part of a charity benefit from kids.  But then I didn't wear it very often.  I have another one that just looks like a light blue shirt with paint brush marks on it (white and red) and I have no idea what it looks like - I used to wear it some and nobody told me it was ugly or it was great or what did it mean or anything - I should try it again since my work environment has changed.",,,,mister_goodperson,,,1499530058,t5_2qhe8,t3_6l3wec,t3_6l3wec,1,1501066845,0,0,djy7s1d,disability,,,,,

appreciated!


1) if can’t extend. social worker look int getting getting dad placed into a Skilled Nursing Facility if he isn't ready to go home. This can act as a further bridge to discharge home and people usually stay there for 2-3 weeks. 

2) appeals process of discharge at willow facility level 

3) If it's a Medicare or insurance cut, there are multiple appeal levels. However dad or step mother must do the request of appeal before the date runs out.

 4)Severe historical Fall risk and he has not progressed as far as he can in PT, 

5) attending dr can suggest more PT if PT wont. 

6) if can’t extend, social worker can set up in home nur6)  if can’t  extend, social worker can set up in home nursing and in or out patient PT OT etc.  all i got for now..

2)  he is still a fall risk even though he is stronger.


3)  what is the law that says if he has to come back after being 
taking care of the facility gets penalized and loses money?  might be an angle.  

4) what is he entitled too and what are his patient rights if he feels this is not in his best interest?

468,"&lt;3 to you. I went through many cycles of acceptance after my team of docs started using the phrase ""end stage pain"" and put me on maintenance instead of actively seeking treatments. I'm 4 years into that phase of things and I still daydream about getting back to normal and doing things like going back to work. Then I have a flare or re-injure a joint (my issues are joint degeneration including spinal problems since my teens ... so going on 25+ years now ... but what took me down the last peg was surgically induced Adhesive Arachnoiditis). 

The cycle is real. Depression can actually be a self defense mechanism where your brain forces you to slow down. I'm still depressed regularly but the spikeyness of the cycle does flatten out. I do FAR less than I used to, but, that means that I can do what I can more regularly now since I don't overdo it as much. 

Absolutely none of this is meant to say you're doing anything wrong. Reaching out when you're at that point is good. We will always miss who we were and wish this hadn't happened.

492,"Hi!
Just over three years ago I was in a coma for about a month. It took me about a year to get over it physically and still not 100%. 
The dreams where some of the best and some of the worst I have ever experienced in my life and still to this day bother my waking life. At night I seem to dream consistently about the past and always I am moving from one place to another. Not sure wtf that is about. My GP said I was suffering from PTSD when I first got out of the hospital. I think it's stayed. In fact I know it's hanging around and messing with me because I can't get certain images out of my mind; all of them related to the coma dreams. This doesn't help my anxiety/depression one bit. I've recently re-taken up painting and trying to get those images out of my head and onto paper. The thinking being if I express them they will stop haunting me. That is the hope anyway! I have found in the past that as long as I refuse to acknowledge something my mind has brought to my attention that it will continue to do so. As soon as I write it out or use some other method of bringing it into my reality that it stops being an issue. Some things just need to be acknowledged and then you can move on. We have to push through the hurt rather than side step it, if you will. That being said I know I told people about the dreams when I was in hospital while I was still experiencing hospital psychosis so I wonder why this shit has stuck to me for so long. It's hard to remember what was said and what wasn't and I think that's why it's still there lurking in my mind. I am still trying to rid myself of the residue of over 3 yrs. Knowing it's ""all in my head"" is the worst part. Being able to blame the medications helps a tiny little bit. My spouse is a nurse she keeps reminding me that it was the drugs and not me. I still have buts about it all. Anyway friend. You are not alone.",,,,SyrensVoice,,,1499312997,t5_2qhe8,t3_6h0l49,t3_6h0l49,2,1500993390,0,0,dju8vx6,disability,,,,,

In light of what you are saying, had they debriefed people about the intention of their project, that would give more credence to the fact that this was primarily an engineering exercise.

However, because they were instructed to not say anything unless asked, I think that implies that the exercise also consists of what it is like for other people to interact with folks with a disability, see how people behave or respond to them, and so forth--which makes it seem like there's an attempted ""empathy awareness"" component to it.

517,"Wow... we are shockingly similar disease wise. I have Sjogren's and Crohn's Disease, and also on Humira, my fourth biologic. I've also carried my social life through online games and tabletops. And like you, I was really into outdoor activities pre-diagnosis, but I haven't been camping or out in the mountains in ten years. The sun sensitivity put a quick end to that and it hasn't let up. 

Getting our loved ones to understand the disease and fatigue is so difficult, but on the positive side at least your partner is pushing you to get out there. The real trouble is when they give up on us.

Perhaps the big takeaway here is for you to do you with what energy levels you have. If your boyfriend starts to get on your case, then it's probably time to reflect and see if you've been isolating yourself and why.

518,"It's hard enough meeting people without a disability, so you may as well start there.

Pick up a hobby, something public that brings in other people, and get involved. Avoid dating sites, especially disabled dating sites, and instead focus on getting yourself out there. 

As an example, the easiest one to get into that has a solid gender ratio, and is often a judgement free zone is boardgames and tabletop games. Look for drop-in game cafes, and/or online tabletop groups, and give it a spin. 

If you're into books look for local reading and writing groups. Movies? Get looking for movie viewing groups. Music? Start going to local shows and getting to know folks. Sports? Get to the gym and bars and join some groups. Church goer? Easy community right there. Outdoor stuff, hiking, camping, etc...

520,"Disability and loved ones, especially siblings, is always an interesting journey. Kids for the most part are shitty people. It's not their fault, they just haven't learned how not to be shitty people yet. 

With siblings, there's normally a bit a envy that gets translated in the wrong way. For example, I'm really close with my siblings and moved out with them ages ago. They've been by my side, and have been overall supportive throughout our life times, but even now, at the age of 30, the jealousy comes up. 

""I hate how everyone expects something from me""

""I wish I could get away with how little you have to do""

""It must be great not having to work.""

These are the quotes from my 27 year old brother in an argument we had the other night. His life has been a bit rough as of late, and was looking for an excuse. He'll be OK though, this has happened a few times over the years, and before the argument is over he realizes how shitty he was being --but the sentiment is always there. 

One of my sisters some years back, actively tried to give herself a 'disability' while still in junior high because she wanted the leeway and attention I was getting. 

Another sister in her teens got heavy into gender identity issues and faked a disability in an attempt to grab some attention. Huh, that sounds so rude without context, but she was the one who admitted falsehood and is doing fine these days. We were extremely supportive at the time, which helped her realize the attention wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

My point is, each time my siblings have lashed out, it has always resulted with them having a better understanding of my condition and disabilities in general. Humans are weird, and empathy is hard, especially for the fortunate and healthy, and it makes sense that they have to jump through some pretty fantastic hoops to get there. 

My advice? Be grateful of your sister and her newfound kindness. It's almost certain she will get shitty with you again in the future, but bear with it, and help them grow a little further in their understanding of disabilities. 

In case I've made my siblings out to be a tad selfish allow me to offset it with other stories. 

My brother, has always stuck up for disabled and sick folk, mentally and physically, and does not tolerate the slightest ignorant comment in the workplace. He's even thinking of going back to school for social work, because he can't stand the attitude towards disabilities in the industrial sector.

My first referenced sister now works in government law, specifically with our provincial health care system, and has been fighting on the side of disabled folk for years. She has accomplished some mighty tasks, and passed and stopped all sorts of bills affecting millions.

The other sister, just entering high school, is an accepting and lovely kid, that already has a good idea of what she wants out of life. Maturity has come quick to her, and I look forward to seeing where she ends up. 

I have stories like these for all members of my close, and extended family. There are times when they don't understand, they make a fuss, they become shitty, but eventually seeing me so often, they come around and grow a little more empathetic. 

The seeming majority of people in this world have a default setting of ""If I were disabled like you I'd kill myself"". It's hard to empathize with us, and it doesn't come naturally. Younger siblings have an extra bit of difficulty, because they look(ed) up to us and to see us weakened is all the more difficult. Fortunately, quite a few people develop beyond that default setting, because at some point most people are forced to confront a disability of a loved one. 

Anywho, one step at a time with your sister, and so long as you're patient with her she may become one of your greatest allies. 

Good luck!",,,,Akosce,,,1500561337,t5_2qhe8,t3_6og5f0,t3_6og5f0,9,1501411018,0,0,dkh5dq1,disability,,,,,
521,"It doesn't have to be often. Some months I can only get in one or two hours. I know others who can only make one or two hours a year. The trick is to never completely close yourself off from the world. We gotta make due with what bodies we have if there isn't the medicine to fix us. 

That being said there's always online gaming. Check out some MMORPGs and try to join a community. 

Don't get us wrong, we empathize with you, many of us being where you are or have been where you are, but the universal lesson has always been it's up to us to make our lives what we want it to be. This is just as true for us disabled folk as it is everyone else.

522,"Fellow RA sufferer here just wanting to say god damn that's some nasty work hours. Speaking for myself, the disease already takes off a good two to eight hours of my day, so for you to have any energy at all after work is amazing to me. To be able to maintain a relationship with your spouse is amazing. I know a lot of our fellow RA suffers get on a permanent dose of prednisone, so if that interests you ask your Rheumy. Mind you the idea of long term prednisone doesn't sit well with me, but for some it gives them the energy they need to finish out a day, and our disease is all about balancing quality of life with our shortened life expectancy. It's worth thinking about at least.  

Anywho, friends are hard work, and it's even more difficult for us adults. Friendship requires time and commitment, and good friends will let you get away with hanging out a few times a year, but when meeting new people you really have to put up a good front. My only advice for finding new friends is to pick up a hobby with a local community and make scheduled time for it. Online communities work too if that's your bag, but having an excuse to get out of house and routine is huge. 

Once you start to make some friends the really tricky part for us disabled folk is keeping them. I know how hard it is for us to schedule things weeks in advance, because we have no idea what our disease will look like at that time, but once you get those friends schedule events in advance. Say, every first Thursday of the month is friend-day. You know it, your spouse knows it, your friends know it, and this is the one day you do your absolute best to show up with bells on. This is the one day you allow others to have expectations for you, and you must do your best to follow through. If you have to show up run-down and barely able to keep your eyes open, then you do it. Your friends will get to see the effort you're putting in and eventually they'll start to give you some slack when you have to call a night short. 

Sadly, there's no real easy way to go about relationships. It requires time and commitment, and I would not fault you if those are impossible hurdles. As I said, it's amazing that you work those hours and have a spouse. If you're bored there's all sorts of hobbies you can pick up at home that you can do on your time. If you're lonely, then I wish you the best of luck in your fight. 

If I must plug one activity I highly recommend board game cafes and RPGs like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. These either have drop-in events with set days of the month, or require group scheduling in advance. The communities are often all inclusive and welcoming. The expectations from the players are low because it's a bunch of adults trying to find free time in their busy lives to goof around. It's extremely social, gets us out of our own minds, and is just a great time without taxing one's body. If you're not familiar with tabletop games don't worry as the people involved are usually happy to recruit new folk to the hobby. Look up board game cafes in your local area and try a drop-in. You could also check Facebook to see if there's any local groups recruiting new players. If you're really worried that tabletops have too huge of a learning curve, or you're merely unfamiliar with the hobby, I suggest you look up GeekandSundry's [TableTop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro&amp;list=PL0Y9n5uBJuXxjSe6lJEHRZICCHym3e-aS), or for D&amp;D [Critical Role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ&amp;list=PL7atuZxmT954bCkC062rKwXTvJtcqFB8i) or [Acquisitions Incorporated](https://youtu.be/FTHu-uv673E) on Youtube.

You can do a search for the Social Security Bluebook and see if your condition(s) is listed.

And about an attorney, I would consider waiting until the hearing appeal, if necessary, to hire representation.

526,"I've been told by some very good sources that SSA prefers medical records that are less than 90-120 days old because those are the most revelant to your case now. Your condition needs to be disabling despite treatment.   That's not to say that older records aren't useful, especially if they show a clear pattern in your condition.

If this is your 1st appeal, it's what they call the reconsideration phase (unless you live in one of the few states that goes directly to an appeals hearing)..  They will consider any new evidence you submit, but it's mainly a new examiner and a new doctor reviewing your case again to see if anything was missed or an incorrect decision was made.

You probably need to find a new provider.  The hard part is paying for it without insurance.  I guess you may have moved from an expanded Medicaid state to one that's not.  Maybe the health department in your county can direct you to free clinics where you might get treatment.  Also, a lot of providers offer cash discounts to those without insurance.

550,"I started filing out my application myself, then decided to hire an attorney because I felt like I would get extra help.  I know his office got copies of my records, but I'm not sure if they sent them to DDS or my providers did.  I actually got copies of my records when I applied for disability retirement benefits through my pension, and that's when I figured out how useful having my records my would be.  Personally, it saved me a lot of grief.

There are a lot of benefits of having an attorney.  I'm not disputing that.  I hired my attorney because he has been practicing social security law since 1989 and he a good reputation.  And it's not a money thing either, because I only have to pay a modest set fee because I was awarded on the initial application.  I also realize that every applicant is different, and some with severe physical and mental impairments may need an attorney to help them file their application.    I am severely visually impaired, but I was able to manage my case.  I just think too many people hand their case over to the attorney and check out of the process.  Your attorney works for you and is accountable to you, but at the end of the day, it's your claim and I think you should be proactive.  It got me my benefits months sooner, and when you go from being the primary income for a family of four to having no income, it's in your best interest to be on top of your case.

While contacts and reputation are essential for an attorney, at the first couple of phases, the disability examiners have a very specific set of criteria to work within.  That's why so many people who are eventually determined to be disabled by the ALJ get denied the first two times.  They are deserving, but they don't meet the diagnostic criteria to meet or equal a listing. Luckily, the Disability process doesn't end with the Blue Book, because there would be a lot of deserving people denied benefits.   I see an attorney having a much greater impact at the hearing level than at the initial or reconsideration phase.  It's just my opinion, and each applicant needs to look at his or her own situation and decide if an attorney can help them immediately.

It's not much, but it's a start.  And quite frankly, that begins with ourselves.

You definitely want to use the standard hospital-style chair for the shortest amount of time possible because they are heavy (around 45 lbs), difficult to steer, and *super* ugly. I personally love the <PERSON> brand but that all depends on you. Check out some websites and you should be able to find a place near you that will fit you for a custom chair. The possibilities are pretty much endless :)

Good luck! I'm really sorry that you had a shitty doctor.

Hooooowever...

Today she called me to tell me something random about my hubs that made me think someone had stolen his credit card. When I frantically tried to call him he didn't answer which made my brain conjure up a huge adrenaline dump. When he *finally* answered twenty calls later and rather annoyed he set me straight about the situation. I called mum back and told her to check her effing facts before she decides to give me another freaking panic attack. She replied with ""*I'M* having a panic attack!"" I said ""while I appreciate that you have anxiety, you don't literally run around the house screaming in terror and are not absolutely dependent on medication to chemically right your brain into a calmed state. You have *anxiety* attacks and they are *super* different. Please stop trying to one-up me on how stressed you are, mum. It's just disrespectful.""


I honestly don't care if people call them anxiety attacks or panic attacks or widdershins bandersnatches-- as long as they aren't trying to say that their meltdown is worse than *my* meltdown in a condescending way then I'm fine with it. She *could* be having a really bad panic attack but I just don't want to hear it when it's presented so childishly. Who wants to compare bruises anyways? I'm not going to tell a paraplegic that I'm way more disabled than him because I can actually feel the pain in my legs. That's just weirdly messed up. 

I'm 100% certain that my mum doesn't have attacks like I do because when I've explained my own attacks to her she just gets wide-eyed and tells me that it sounds awful and that she's really glad that has never happened to her.

668,"You've gotten some good responses so far on house requirements -- doorway widths, bathroom layouts, etc. A few other things to note: 

- The closer to downtown you get, generally the older the homes get. San Diego doesn't have many super old homes, though, and most of them are ranch style (single level). But even slightly older homes (70's, 80's) weren't built with accessibility in mind. You might find something better suited a little further out of town, in newer areas. 

- Several homes in San Diego don't have air conditioning. The weather is pretty good year-round, but San Diego isn't immune to summer heatwaves. If your mother is generally stuck home most days (not to mention, pets), you might want to double check a rental has AC. Again, it's less common in older areas, and more common in newer areas. 

- San Diego's public transportation network is alright, if you plan. Although it severely limits your options, I would look for housing walking distance to a light rail station. All of the stations are wheelchair accessible. This could grant your mother a bit of independence -- she could drive her chair to a station, and take the light rail around town (more comfortable than a bus, and generally more elbow room).

- The downtown station is serviced by the California Coaster, which takes you up to Los Angeles. Air Travel can be difficult with power wheelchairs, but train travel is generally much easier.

- All of the buses are handicap accessible, but some sidewalks can be narrow. 

- There's a few different public transit fare options. For people with disabilities, there's a reduced fare option that's pretty cheap. There's a few different ""levels"" depending on what you need access to. IIRC, the highest level also allows for travel on the coaster, so she can ride to LA on her metro pass if need be.

Unless you need a single family home with a yard, per Federal Housing Act, large rental operations are required to have accessible options (so, private owners renting homes don't have to be accessible, but complexes do). You could find a legitimate ADA unit, that will have the extra wide doors, roll-under counters, flush thresholds, etc. Some newer complexes even have on site dog parks, making pet ownership easier. If one of the animals is an emotional support animal or a service dog, they can't deny you on the basis of having an animal (side note: all of those online ""registries"" are fake.

- The closer to downtown you get, generally the older the homes get. <LOCATION> doesn't have many super old homes, though, and most of them are ranch style (single level). But even slightly older homes (70's, 80's) weren't built with accessibility in mind. You might find something better suited a little further out of town, in newer areas. 

- Several homes in <LOCATION> don't have air conditioning. The weather is pretty good year-round, but <LOCATION> isn't immune to summer heatwaves. If your mother is generally stuck home most days (not to mention, pets), you might want to double check a rental has AC. Again, it's less common in older areas, and more common in newer areas. 

- <LOCATION> public transportation network is alright, if you plan. Although it severely limits your options, I would look for housing walking distance to a light rail station. All of the stations are wheelchair accessible. This could grant your mother a bit of independence -- she could drive her chair to a station, and take the light rail around town (more comfortable than a bus, and generally more elbow room).

- The downtown station is serviced by the <LOCATION> Coaster, which takes you up to <LOCATION>. Air Travel can be difficult with power wheelchairs, but train travel is generally much easier.

- All of the buses are handicap accessible, but some sidewalks can be narrow. 

- There's a few different public transit fare options. For people with disabilities, there's a reduced fare option that's pretty cheap. There's a few different ""levels"" depending on what you need access to. IIRC, the highest level also allows for travel on the coaster, so she can ride to <LOCATION> on her metro pass if need be.

671,"I wouldn't suggest an RV. 

Standard RVs aren't designed for full-time living, and even advertised ""4 season"" RVs aren't well insulated enough for the wintertime. If you try to full-time in one, you'll start developing mold and rot issues. The ""tiny house"" movement is slightly better, most of the quality ones are built to a higher standard than most off-the-lot RVs, meaning they are better insulated (more suited for winter living) and better ventilated (less mold / rot issues). 

Not to mention, RV living isn't as cheap as people make it out to be. There aren't too many places you can park for free. City code enforcement or local laws often prevent parking on the street or in parking lots. Some businesses will let you set up for a night or two in their lot (Walmart, for example, lets you do this at multiple locations), but it's not a long-term option. 

RV parks get expensive. Like, ""you could rent a room in a house for that kind of money""-expensive. The cheaper parks are still like $400 / month easily, and that's (1) if you can find one that allows full time living / charges monthly rates, and (2) not including utilities. Since RVs aren't well insulated, you will spend a LOT in heating and cooling bills. Not to mention, refilling propane tanks, and having to pay to dump... ""other"" tanks (RV parks that are designed for long-term living should have hookups, so you don't have to drive to a dump station to empty your holding tanks, but RV plumbing isn't designed for that fancy, ultra soft toilet paper -- so I hope you like using the cheap, thin stuff to wipe). 

If you're planning on getting a trailer, you'd need a truck or SUV capable of towing it. Trucks / SUVs burn more fuel, and are generally more expensive to insure. If I were on a fixed income, I would want a vehicle with lower operating costs. If you plan on getting a motorhome, don't. The big busses (""class A"" motorhomes) cost an arm and a leg to maintain -- diesel mechanics are few and far between. And the smaller ""class C"" motorhomes (usually a van or truck cab, and a boxy bit for the ""house"") are still expensive to maintain. If you plan on parking somewhere for months at a time, it's just an additional expense you wouldn't need. 

If you're dead set on the RV idea, do this: look into the ""tiny house movement"". They're built to a much higher standard compared to off the lot RVs, and are built on trailers, so they're registered as an RV, and can usually be towed by a large truck or SUV (some of the bigger ones need to be moved commercially). Find a friend in Colorado who will let you set it up in their backyard. This way you don't have to pay expensive lot fees at an RV park. Pay a company to move it for you, and just move it once (bonus points: build it yourself, on site, so you never have to move it). Forgo the truck, and buy a small, economical car to keep your regular monthly costs down. An economy car will use less fuel, and be cheaper to register, insure and maintain. Alternatively, forgo the car entirely, and use a bike (if possible) or public transportation to save money. 

Definitely visit /r/personalfinance. Cannot stress that enough. PF can help you learn how to budget, track expenses, etc. I think once you run the numbers, you'll find that renting a room or a small apartment will be more economical than an RV, once you factor in the costs to insure and maintain an RV. 

Side note: Denver has a pretty decent light rail system. If you can find a place to live along one of the lines, it's pretty easy to get around. Outside of the light rail corridors, the bus system isn't great, but it works. Seattle has one light rail line, plus the Sounder line (larger, commuter rail -- higher speed, greater distance between stops). The bus system is pretty good as well. Portland has a really good bus, light rail and streetcar system.

673,"I literally just travelled with a leg brace and cane, and I'm flying internationally in a few weeks. 

When you book your ticket, you'll get an option to request a wheelchair. It's not humiliating. Do it. When you check in at ticketing, you can ask them there as well (in case you didn't do it when you booked). Some airlines will even let you reserve a specific seat -- try to get an isle seat. Bulkhead (front row) if possible. This will give you more legroom. 

Here's how it'll go down:

You get to the airport and go to ticketing. They'll check your checked luggage, and an airline attendant will meet you with a wheelchair. You get wheeled to the front of the TSA line. If you can walk with a cane, they'll ask you to get out of the wheelchair and walk through the X-ray. Depending on the airport, they might let you keep your shoes on (I had to, because of how my leg brace works). They have a 100% wooden, striped cane for you to use at the scanner, and they'll put your cane through the machine with any carry-on luggage you have. 

The attendant will see you all the way to the gate. If you need to use the restroom, get snacks, whatever, let the attendant know. They'll take you there. The attendant will drop you off at the gate, and let the gate agents know you're there. When it comes time to board, the gate agent will ask if you need an aisle chair (narrow wheelchair designed to get you down the plane). Since you can walk with a cane, you can turn down the aisle chair if you want. When they start the boarding process, they'll wheel you down to the plane first. Once at the plane, you can get out of the chair and find your seat (unless you really want that aisle chair, in which case they'll get you all the way there). 

If you have any connecting flights, you'll be the last off the plane if you want the aisle chair. If you don't want the aisle chair, you can get off with everyone else. An airline attendant will be waiting for you with another wheelchair. If you wait until you're the last to get off, they'll meet you at the end of the jet bridge. Otherwise, they'll be at the top, by the gate door. The attendant will escort you all the way to your next flight. 

If it's your final destination, the attendant will take you all the way to baggage claim, and help you get your checked luggage off the conveyor. They'll even help you get to your ground transportation (on my last flight, I was riding a charter bus, so they simply wheeled me to where the bus was waiting. They can take you curbside if you have someone picking you up -- or uber/lyft/taxi --, or even to a rental car desk). 

If you have any other questions, ask away. I'll be flying to Norway on the 22nd, so I'll get to see how the process works with international flights. For peace of mind, I would suggest calling the airline to verify you'll have wheelchair assistance throughout your travels. Never hurts to call on your way back as well, just to verify. Dallas is large enough that they shouldn't have any shortages of wheelchairs. But no idea if you're flying into a small airport in Washington, so wouldn't hurt to contact that airport directly, and verify they have wheelchair service (they should, but it's always good peace of mind to ask). 

Edit: just to add, since I saw this mentioned in other comments, and I just sort of glanced over it -- you will get a pat down once through the X-ray. It's not very invasive, and is the same pat down they give anyone else. They talk through every step of it, before they actually do it. If it makes you nervous, you can watch videos beforehand of TSA pat down procedures. They will also want to swab your brace. It's these little tester strip things. They'll use a few of them, testing your hands and testing your brace. It's a multi-spectral analysis machine. Basically looks for all sorts of different chemicals, all at once. Unless you run an at-home meth lab, or play with explosives in your free time, you should have nothing to worry about. If you're worried, since the 4th is tomorrow, just clean your brace with mild soap and water beforehand. If you have any anxiety issues, you might want to take an extra pill. They're not going to put you on a podium and shine the spotlight on you, but when people are waiting in line at security and the airline attendant wheels you through, people are going to be naturally curious and look at you. I wouldn't give them a second thought, though. Hell, half of them are probably jealous that you're getting wheeled through!

To answer questions 2, 3 and 6: all airlines are very accommodating of people with disabilities. Can't really go wrong. I would find the most direct flight available though, to minimize layovers. 

The airline will have an attendant meet her at ticketing with a wheelchair, and she will be escorted all the way to the gate. If she is unable to walk, they will even use an aisle chair to get her to her seat.

At her destination, they will get her all the way through to baggage claim, help her get her luggage, and take her to whichever method of ground transportation she'll be using (curbside pick up, rental car desk, bus, whatever). 

When you purchase tickets, there is a place to check that she will need assistance. If you call and make tickets, you can also request this. It also helps to call the airline after booking, and double check that it's in the reservation, that she will need assistance, and an aisle chair if applicable. 

Again, I can't speak for foreign airports, but most European countries have similar accessibility laws like our ADA requirements, so I can't imagine it'll be much more difficult.

At her destination, they will get her all the way through to baggage claim, help her get her luggage, and take her to whichever method of ground transportation she'll be using (curbside pick up, rental car desk, bus, whatever). 

When you purchase tickets, there is a place to check that she will need assistance. If you call and make tickets, you can also request this. It also helps to call the airline after booking, and double check that it's in the reservation, that she will need assistance, and an aisle chair if applicable. 

Again, I can't speak for foreign airports, but most European countries have similar accessibility laws like our ADA requirements, so I can't imagine it'll be much more difficult. I'm headed to <LOCATION> in a few weeks, though, so I'll let you know how accessible it is August 1st, if you remind me!

675,"Yeah, I've met countless people who beat themselves up over online dating. I've only met one person, in my entire life, who's online relationship actually worked out. I know a lot of people (especially in these subs) have social anxiety, and aren't good at putting themselves out there. But it's one of those things you just sort of ""have to do"". The internet can be a powerful tool, though. Use Facebook, Reddit, instagram, whatever. Find some local meet up groups, or some groups that share similar interests. Chat with people on there until you're just comfortable talking to people.

Confidence is key. People like confident people. And if you're talking to people with similar interests, it's a hell of a lot easier to be confident. The ""key"" (and it's a LOT harder than it seems) is to not over-think or over-analyze it. This is why I suggest interest-focused groups. It's easier to talk from the heart, and not over-think what you're talking about, when you're just chatting about a mutual interest.

For example, let's say you're really, really into Pokémon. Meeting somebody in a bar and making small talk is probably awkward as fuck. You'll be stumbling your way through it. Then you'll recognize how much of an idiot you must seem, since you're awkwardly stumbling through a seemingly basic conversation. That makes you more nervous, and it spirals downward until you just leave, and vow to never go back out... but let's say you meet up and start chatting about Pokémon. Suddenly you're talking about your favorite Pokémon, which games you played when you were a kid, which game was your favorite, your favorite character. Next thing you know, someone is inviting you back to their place for some Pokémon and chill. 

Kind of a ridiculous example, but that's basically how socialization works. Even the most socially-anxious person in the world can probably carry a conversation about their favorite hobby. One of my best friends has crippling social anxiety. He never wants to go out. But you get him talking about cars or video games, and I can't get the guy to shut up!

680,"Couldn't agree more about the service dog abuse. 

The other week, I was on a flight from San Antonio to Orlando. Since San Antonio is a fairly small airport, I didn't request wheelchair assistance to the gate, but was offered priority boarding. I will likely be getting a below-knee amputation soon, but for now use a special brace in order to walk. But when I'm wearing jeans, you would never know it's there, and I try to not walk with a limp or anything. 

So this family comes up. ""Trailer trash"" would be the kind way to put it. They have one person in a wheelchair. I don't want to discredit whether or not she had an actual disability, but I would wager ""laziness"" or ""obesity"". She actually walked up, pushing her young daughter in the wheelchair, and when they got to the gate, the daughter got up and started running around, and the mom sat down in the wheelchair. 

They had a dog with them. This dog had pretty mangy fur, and looked malnourished. The dog started barking and growling at anyone who walked past. They made motions as if to hit the dog (without actually hitting it). The dog stopped barking, but only because it was shaking, and cowering under one of the chairs. Clear signs of abuse. When one of the gate agents questioned whether or not the dog was a service animal (asking all the correct, legal questions), the family made a huge scene, accusing the gate agent of harassment, saying it was illegal for her to ask about their disability (pro tip: the agent didn't. She asked what tasks the dog was trained to do), and threatening to sue the airline if the harassment continued. 

When they were about to start the boarding process, I made my way towards the door. The mom (purposefully loud enough for me to hear) goes, ""don't worry, sweetheart, the employees will tell that man to go away until it's his turn. We get to go on the plane first since I'm disabled."" Meanwhile, the dog has started up its barking again, and has peed underneath the seats where it was cowering earlier. 

I chatted with the gate agent for a bit, and was the first on the plane. It's the kind of airline where seating is first come, first serve. I took the bulkhead (front row) isle seat, so I could stretch my leg out. A few other disabled people (mostly elderly) boarded next, taking the remainder of the bulkhead seats. Finally, this family boards. They make a huge scene, saying they ""need"" the bulkhead because of the mom's disability, and how they made special arrangements with the airline to reserve those seats (no, you didn't. This airline doesn't do that). None of us budged, so the mother said (rather loudly), ""Fine! Come on, kids, we'll go sit in the exit row."" 

They took their seats in the exit row, and were immediately told by the flight attendants they couldn't sit there (kids too young, mother disabled, etc, etc). This set the mother off on another rant about discrimination since she was disabled, and how I took her reserved seat (she specially called me out -- ""that man in the jeans and polo""). Meanwhile, the dog has started barking loudly, and growling at the flight attendants. 

Eventually, with threat of being removed from the aircraft, they found some new seats and settled down. The dog barked for literally the entire flight. They shouldn't have even been allowed to board. Getting off the flight, I waited until everyone was off, as Orlando is big and I requested a wheelchair getting off the plane. The family had apparently not requested wheelchair service to begin with -- they had just grabbed one in ticketing back in San Antonio. They were the second to last people off the plane. There was one attendant left waiting with a wheelchair (intended for me), and the mother called out ""oh, this must be for me"" and hopped in.

708,"I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I know SSA really prefers that you have seen a doctor(s) for your condition within 90 days of review of your application, and at the very least you should have seen them several times (from what the SSA told me).

So if you haven't seen a doctor somewhat consistently, I'm just guessing that the lawyers won't represent you if you don't have a doctor because they have a way higher chance of not winning your case. If they don't win your case then they don't get paid, as they are only paid through your back pay (I believe, I'd check with the lawyers you are talking to).

I'd recommend finding a county program that has a sliding scale, if possible. I don't know what your condition is, but I see a psychiatrist and therapist for bipolar at a county program and they have a great sliding scale and accept Medicaid.

725,"This is where I had huge issues with social security.  My ex set up my ssdi when I was in a coma, so she was the payee initially.  We parted ways and I started the process of becoming the payee.  I did my part in less than a month.  

  Go to social security and get a from for your doctor to fill out that states you're able to handle your own finances.  A signed statement from your doctor won't work, even though the social security website says that's all you need.  THE WEBSITE LIES!

  Make sure social security is aware of this and keep a statement from them that they are aware of this.  Have the doctor fax that very form directly to social security.  They won't accept it if you just bring it in.  They'll say it could be fake, even though they can call the doctor right them and there to confirm.  It doesn't matter.  Have the doctor fax it.  Get documentation that they received it.

  Give them bank information for direct deposit stuff and whatnot.  Answer their questions.  And then your part is done (not really).  They'll tell you to give it about a week to go through.  They'll send I notification in the mail.  

  AFTER A WEEK, CALL THEM TO MAKE GODDAMN SURE!  If you get a notification, congrats, they actually did what they were supposed to right off the bat.  I envy you.

I had to show 4 different records from that office of previous actions before the lady finally relented and finished my request.  

  Social security doesn't have your best interests at heart.  They just want to pass the buck onto someone else to do, and they'll juggle you forever if you let them get away with it.  You have to hold their feet to the flames.  Be polite about it of course, but don't let up.

We both lied in bed next to each other with ice packs, he said ""I hope your hip feels better tomorrow"" and it said ""I hope the swelling goes down soon"" and we spooned and rested as best we could with our pain.

Or maybe somehow I can manage to get to work, after 20 minutes of work, I start getting brain fog, I start slurring my words and dropping things, I need to vomit, I need to stop working and rest. 

What employer would willingly take that on? 

When a stranger sees me at the shops and thinks ""if you can shop,  you can work, deadbeat"" they don't see the hours of preparation and pre-medding it took to get me to the shops. They don't see the days of recovery my body needs after the shops. They don't think about how going to the shops can happen on a whim, ""I feel good today, let's quickly go get milk"", but going into work takes a few hours for HR to quickly schedule an unplanned shift, let another employee know they're not needed because the disabled employee is coming in today for once. 

They are don't see that. They see me at the shops. Buying milk. They are judge my apparent abilities in this unique circumstance that is in no way reflective of the hard work, reliability and dependability of working for an employer. 

-----------

I'm going into detail here too because I need a distraction, writing my feelings is a good distraction and while my fingers aren't aching I'm going to take advantage and type.

--

My illness is unpredictable, I'm lying awake at 4:45am right now. I was fine today, I did everything I set out to do, laundry, mopping, my PT and I even went to the milk bar and bought bread. I felt good. I went to sleep with my partner  next to me at 9:30pm. I was tired, but not drained and exhausted the way chronic illness can often make me. I felt normal, healthy even. If I have more days like this, I can start looking for work. 



At 11pm I woke up, my heart was beating in my neck, something was wrong. I tried to sit up, dizziness, I vomited up the dinner I ate at 4pm, all over the bed, I tried again to orientate myself and get up, my partner awoke. 
Illuminated by the moonlight through the window, he sat me on the floor, passed me the waste bin and he began undressing the bed while I continued to vomit.

 I couldn't see very well, couldn't breathe through the phlegm and food stuck in my throat. My partner came over, put my pulseoxs on my finger, O2sat=87%, hr=130bpm. He turns on the light, my face is bright red and blotchy, my arms covered in hives. He runs to get my IM benadryl. 

By midnight, My breathing has improved, 94% oxygen saturated. I'm still nauseous, my bowels are turning, my partner carries me to the toilet and I pass bright orange liquid followed by clear mucus. I vomit again, just bile this time. 

I struggle to walk back to bed, my vision is dark, my heart rate is shifting from 60bpm to 130bpm every few minutes. My partner gets my blood pressure cuff, 90/70, it's lowish, I need water, I'm dehydrated. I try a few sips, it gets stuck in my throat, I try to will my paralysed oesophagus to work. I vomit the water back up. 

I lie down in bed, my torso propped up by pillows to prevent aspiration. A heatpack on my cramping stomach and an ice pack on my aching head. I put my headphones in and begin a guided meditation session. I've taken my medicine, there are nothing else I can do but try to calm my body down and rest. 

It's 5:22am (this comment is taking a while to proof read) It's been 5 hours since that reaction. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep, my heart rate is better, fluctuating between 55 and 70, but it's still too racey to allow me time sleep. I'm simultaneously boiling and freezing.

Would an able bodied person go into work tomorrow if they had a night like this? 

I'll try to sleep. I probably won't. At 9am I'll get out of bed, my boyfriend will help me pack my bag and we'll drive up to the coast for my mother's birthday. I have to see her, it's been too long and it's her birthday. I'll be exhausted, I'll be pushing myself, I'll risk another mast cell reaction. I'll run to the bathroom every 15 minutes. I'll swallow down vomit all day long. 

I'll put on a brave face, and I'll be civil when my extended family say ""you're looking good, finally out of the wheelchair I see, so when are you going back to work?"" 

I'm out off the wheelchair because the house isn't wheelchair accessible and I'm forced to use crutches. My shoulders are dislocating with every other step. But I'm used to it. 


I want to work. I want to be useful so badly. I want to have more than $250AUD a week. I want to be able to afford health insurance to cover my care with money I have earned. I don't want charity or handouts. But for now, I  accept welfare, because I want to survive. I don't want to die.

When a stranger sees me at the shops and thinks ""if you can shop,  you can work, deadbeat"" they don't see the hours of preparation and pre-medding it took to get me to the shops. They don't see the days of recovery my body needs after the shops. They don't think about how going to the shops can happen on a whim, ""I feel good today, let's quickly go get milk"", but going into work takes a few hours for HR to quickly schedule an unplanned shift, let another employee know they're not needed because the disabled employee is coming in today for once. 

They are don't see that. They see me at the shops. Buying milk. They are judge my apparent abilities in this unique circumstance that is in no way reflective of the hard work, reliability and dependability of working for an employer.

I'm going into detail here too because I need a distraction, writing my feelings is a good distraction and while my fingers aren't aching I'm going to take advantage and type.

--

My illness is unpredictable, I'm lying awake at 4:45am right now. I was fine today, I did everything I set out to do, laundry, mopping, my PT and I even went to the milk bar and bought bread. I felt good. I went to sleep with my partner  next to me at 9:30pm. I was tired, but not drained and exhausted the way chronic illness can often make me. I felt normal, healthy even. If I have more days like this, I can start looking for work. 



At 11pm I woke up, my heart was beating in my neck, something was wrong. I tried to sit up, dizziness, I vomited up the dinner I ate at 4pm, all over the bed, I tried again to orientate myself and get up, my partner awoke. 
Illuminated by the moonlight through the window, he sat me on the floor, passed me the waste bin and he began undressing the bed while I continued to vomit.

 I couldn't see very well, couldn't breathe through the phlegm and food stuck in my throat. My partner came over, put my pulseoxs on my finger, O2sat=87%, hr=130bpm. He turns on the light, my face is bright red and blotchy, my arms covered in hives. He runs to get my IM benadryl. 

By midnight, My breathing has improved, 94% oxygen saturated. I'm still nauseous, my bowels are turning, my partner carries me to the toilet and I pass bright orange liquid followed by clear mucus. I vomit again, just bile this time. 

I struggle to walk back to bed, my vision is dark, my heart rate is shifting from 60bpm to 130bpm every few minutes. My partner gets my blood pressure cuff, 90/70, it's lowish, I need water, I'm dehydrated. I try a few sips, it gets stuck in my throat, I try to will my paralysed oesophagus to work. I vomit the water back up. 

I lie down in bed, my torso propped up by pillows to prevent aspiration. A heatpack on my cramping stomach and an ice pack on my aching head. I put my headphones in and begin a guided meditation session. I've taken my medicine, there are nothing else I can do but try to calm my body down and rest. 

It's 5:22am (this comment is taking a while to proof read) It's been 5 hours since that reaction. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep, my heart rate is better, fluctuating between 55 and 70, but it's still too racey to allow me time sleep. I'm simultaneously boiling and freezing.

Would an able bodied person go into work tomorrow if they had a night like this? 

I'll try to sleep. I probably won't. At 9am I'll get out of bed, my boyfriend will help me pack my bag and we'll drive up to the coast for my mother's birthday. I have to see her, it's been too long and it's her birthday. I'll be exhausted, I'll be pushing myself, I'll risk another mast cell reaction. I'll run to the bathroom every 15 minutes. I'll swallow down vomit all day long. 

I'll put on a brave face, and I'll be civil when my extended family say ""you're looking good, finally out of the wheelchair I see, so when are you going back to work?"" 

I'm out off the wheelchair because the house isn't wheelchair accessible and I'm forced to use crutches. My shoulders are dislocating with every other step. But I'm used to it. 


I want to work. I want to be useful so badly. I want to have more than $250AUD a week. I want to be able to afford health insurance to cover my care with money I have earned. I don't want charity or handouts. But for now, I  accept welfare, because I want to survive. I don't want to die.

774,"It's pretty normal, though I've been disabled since infancy so I don't really know what other people's version of normal is. 

I've usually only needed a few brief sentences to explain to new partners what I need. 

Though admittedly, sex with my current long term partner is much more comfortable and fun than any sex I've ever had before. He's trained to help relocate certain dislocated joints and he knows my body pretty well so I don't have to verbally communicate what I need as much, over the years we've been together we've developed a connection that has means I can often just tap and grunt during sex, or shift my leg and he'll instantly know I've dislocated something, or I'm getting too much friction or whatever he can get off and assess the situation with me. Sometimes dislocations cause a loud pop, that used to scare more casual partners, they'd often immediately jump off me (sometimes making things more painful) and I'd have to hope I can relocate it by myself or sex was over.

My current partner will hear a pop, freeze still and look at me for instructions. He'll be able to help me relocate it, and if not, he'll get me any ice pack, and depending on what's dislocated we usually just find another way to keep going with sex anyway. 

I have a few wedge pillows for sex, some different straps for holding legs into certain positions etc. I don't need them all the time but sometimes it's handy just to reduce pain or fatigue. 

Likewise sometimes it's just more comfortable to avoid certain positions, or skip certain foreplay acts (eg, if my hands are unstable, or if my jaw is unstable) 

I tend to have to avoid sex for a few days a month because I get vulval lichen sclerosis flare ups around ovulation, and there are definitely days when my allodynia, fatigue or inflammation are just too great, or I have a migraine, nausea etc and I'm not in the mood, but that's very human. 

My partner and I both have highish libidos, I'd say I'd like to have sex 6-8 times a week, in reality we have sex 3 times a week due to my disability. It's basically a non-issue. I think most people would be happy to have my sex life.

People who have never had mental illness can see the behaviour of someone with depression as self sabotage, but that's the illness, not the person.

778,"I think the individual has a right to choose what terminology they use. obvioysly we can't assume that the article has asked this girl what terminlogy she's comfortable with, it's likely the journalist is using outdated terminology by default.

But that's no reason to attack anyone who uses the term ""wheelchair bound""

I am a mobility aid user, but when I am having a flare up that requires me to use my wheelchair as my primary mobility aid I *choose* to use the term ""wheelchair bound"" to emphasise the gravity of my present condition, but also to imply that this is not a hopeful situation for me, personally.

For someone who is a full time chair user, that chair represents freedom of independence against the disease process, without that chair, they would be bound by their illness/disability, but the chair is their tool to fight back and live life. Terminology that does not imply being trapped or bound is important.

But for me, personally, as my condition only rarely requires wheelchair use for a few weeks during times that my condition is flaring at it's worst, I truly do feel bound by it, and for me, personally, using terminology like ""bound"" with it's inherent negativity, is motivating to keep up my PT and push harder on my docs to re-balance my medications so I can reduce the duration of my flare up and go back to using my crutches instead of my chair.

I will transition to terminology such as ""wheelchair user"" when my condition degenerates and I am no longer bound to my chair for a few weeks but rather *using* my chair for it's ability to liberate me from my illness. But right now my illness is not severe enough to require a chair as a tool, it's only just starting to get severe enough to bind me to a chair for a week or two here and there.

This is of course such a personal preference of language and I would never suggest that someone else with my exact circumstances is wheelchair bound.

Having chronic pain and chronic injury means I can emphasise when someone else has pain. 

My SO is not a whinger, he will only say ""ouch"" if something really, really hurts.

If my hands aren't too sore I'll offer a massage.

I have Classical Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, my partner has benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, or HSD - he's hypermobile but he doesn't get joint pain. 

I suspect his knee subluxes, due to an old football injury combined with his JHS. It makes the same loud Pop that my knee makes when it dislocates, and the way my partner describes the painless popping sensation is exactly what my painless subluxations felt like back when I was 12 and had painless subluxation (these days, my subluxations are painful). 

Once or twice a month his knee with ache. So he doesn't think it's connected to the popping. (but I know the more I sublux, the more inflammation develops, and I'll be achey later) 

His family has a history of hernias and he has strabismus and velvety skin like me, so I have a theory that he actually has a mild version of HEDS, not JHS, and his youth and masculinity is working in his favour right now.

781,"I definitely feel like this on my good days. 

I'll wake up and have so much energy, and so little pain and dysfunction, I'll do some housework, even go shopping and prepare dinner and still have energy for my PT. Then I'll start to feel guilty, I could have worked today. I could have gone to a place of employment and performed tasks or services in exchange for this money. I'm a lying cheat. 

Then I remember that all healthy people are expected to shower and dress themselves, buy groceries, cook food and clean up after themselves *and* go to work. 

Just because I had enough energy to take care of myself today and had a little left over doesn't automatically mean I had enough energy to do a day's work and take care of myself. 

And maybe I did have enough energy to work and take care of myself today. What about tomorrow? And the next day? Do I have enough energy and function to work and take care of myself enough days a week to earn a livable wage? How long could I keep that up? Till I retire? 

I know from experience that I don't. I need 12 hours on minimum wage to equal a living wage. I've done that before, a desk job, not too impacting​. Within a week the laundry had piled up, within three weeks I had was living on soylent because I had no energy to cook or go shopping, which resulted in gastric issues that effected my work, and within 3 months I had was calling in sick twice a week because I had physically couldn't get out of bed. I prioritised working over taking care of myself, because I felt that if I had any energy or function I would owed it to society to work. 

I have perfect balance now. I'm consistently doing my self care (showering, brushing my hair and teeth, etc) and housework (vacuuming, laundry and dishes - I still have home help for yard work and dusting because of my allergies causing anaphylaxis when I try to do these myself) and grocery shopping and PT. I take one or two days off a week from housework and PT to rest. 

Could I work? 

Not without giving up one of those other tasks. 

And if I give up one of those tasks, I am giving up something that is vital to maintaining my health, and it spirals. Suddenly, without regularly attending those tasks, I'm less healthy, and definitely unable to work. 

So no, I can't work. 

Even if I have a good day, or a good week. Heck even a good month. It takes time to train a new employee, and even if I  was on a payroll and worked when I could, I'd need a welfare pension to help during the bad weeks when I can't work. I'd be a nightmare for the workforce management team/scheduling team to try and roster, I'd end up costing a companies more in my unreliability and physical liability. 

I estimate I could work a low impact job ~30 days a year, once every 5-7 days, with a break in between shifts to rest, and the flexibility to call in on the day to say ""today is a good day, so I'm coming into work"". It can't be the same day and it can't be scheduled, because my illness isn't scheduled. If I can find a job like that I'll take it in a second. But so far I haven't found something like that, so I haven't been able to work.

Chairs are an extension of our body, and as they are a mobility device they are essentially our legs.

I've become used to screaming ""where are you taking me!? Who are you!?"" and then my boyfriend will yell ""stop, your kidnapping her! Help!"" because that's exactly what it feels like to have someone to start pushing you without even intruders themselves. It draws attention to the scene and gets people to immediately stop pushing me and think about how scary their situation is for me.

I have Classical Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, along with several comorbidities (POTS, MCAS, Gastroparesis to name a few) I've always had my symptoms so I don't know what I'm missing, so people generally don't say I'll ""recover"". 

I'm in PT to strengthen my joints to reduce the frequency that I  experience dislocations, it's definitely helping and I'm having fewer and fewer major dislocations. 

My Physio keeps saying stuff like ""you'll be back at work in no time at this rate!"" when I improve in an exercise, and I know she's just being encouraging, but it completely ignores my other barriers. Dislocating my hip on the bus to work was only my first obstacle. 

From there, I'd have an anaphylactic reaction to perfume someone in my office was wearing, or the smell of food someone was eating, or the heater being on inside the office. Then I'd vomit if tried to eat or drink due to my gastroparesis, meaning I was often dehydrated all day long, with brain fog from lack of water and food. The dehydration would aggravate my POTS and I'd pass out when standing up from my desk. Trying to get home with the heart palpitations, light headedness, the dehydration headache, trying not to vomit, it would take the last of my energy. But I wouldn't sleep, I'd be up all night sweating and itching and fighting due oxygen because I'd have a Mast Cell reaction from being out in public. Then I'd have to do it all again for my next shift. 

At the moment, my gastroparesis is barely managed, I'm still losing weight. 

My MCAS is barely managed, I've stopped having daily anaphylaxis since I moved out of my dirty sharehouse, but I'm housebound unless I take 7 different medications that I can't afford to take every day (I have enough to let me get out of the house once or twice a week) 

My POTS is completely self medicated with salt and water, my rheumatologist is trying to find a cardiologist who's even heard of POTS, we're talking about getting a port to run saline infusions, but that's 36+ months away (public health care waiting lists are insane!) 

So, No, Ms. Physio, I won't be back at work in no time. I'll be able to do more housework and have lower pain, but my dislocating joints are nothing compared to the rest of this illness. 

And no matter how well I can control all my other symptoms, there's still the issue of my fragile skin. Today I  tore a chunk of flesh off 3 of my knuckles while using a pair of scissors to cut open a thin plastic bag of cheese for my partner's dinner.   The pressure from the handle of the scissors took skin right off, the handle wasn't too small or anything, I didn't even feel the pressure or the pain, I just noticed blood in the cheese and looked down at my hand. 

When people say well intentioned things like ""you'll get better"" it really belittles the daily struggle in my opinion.

789,"I definitely got the impression from how you saw the situation play out that while the primary goal is to understand design flaws, they aren't opposed to having the students learn a bonus lesson of ""life with a disability is hard"" 

I'm definitely not opposed to people doing things that help them understand, but something about not disclosing their status as able bodied does not sit well with me. It's hard to put my finger on why. 

I have an invisible illness and only very recently started needing a wheelchair. It took a long time for me to get comfortable with the fact I needed the chair. I felt like I had imposter syndrome, like I was just playing disabled. 

Maybe I'm projecting some of those lingering feelings onto those students. 

Or maybe I'm worried that their project will decrease awareness for invisible disability. Not everyone is as understanding as you, when you saw them getting in and out of chairs you recognised that disability is not binary, people can be part time chair users. 

I guess I'm worried that people will see someone like me in public, on my feet one days and in my chair the next and assume ""oh, she's doing a project about disabled people"" and not ""oh she has a disability that requires occasional use of aids"" 

I know I'd be more comfortable with the way the students are executing their project if they had a sign on the back of the chair that said ""Disability Awareness Design Project"" or something on that told people ""we may not have disabilities, or we might have, it doesn't matter, we're here today to learn about design"" 

People are still going to treat them differently, there's just something about sitting in a chair that does that. 

I remember, before I got my own chair, I booked a chair when I went to the shopping centre. My boyfriend came with me as he was going to push me (my shoulders are too weak to self propel), he stood behind me while I waited at the service desk. I confirmed my name and booking and the staff member was lovely and explained the hire terms and arranged to take my cane and lock it in the storage area as collateral for the chair, he went to fetch the chair. 

The staff member came back and I quickly sat down because I was getting really unsteady/fatigued from having walked to the desk and standing in line. The staff member acknowledged me by showing me where the breaks were then took my cane... Then delivered the rest of the entire speech about what time to bring the chair back and what number to call if the desk was unattended to my boyfriend who was still standing several feet away near the queue, and hadn't been involved in the hire process at all, he hadn't said a word, the staff member hadn't even greeted my boyfriend before this point. In fact other than the fact that I was standing with him before I was called to the front of the queue for service, there was nothing to identify him as my partner. 

My boyfriend was brilliant he immediately cut the staff member off with ""huh? Sorry, were you talking to me"" and the staff member apologised, then started repeating himself about the chair return time to my boyfriend who replied ""this sounds like important information for the girl with the wheelchair, not me, I just want a print out of the store map"" 

The staff member apologised again, but there was still something strange about the way we were having a perfectly normal conversation when I was standing, with my cane hidden by the service desk, but as soon as I sat in the chair his whole attitude changed and he acted like I was incompetent. 

So even if the students are upfront ""we're doing a project"" they'll still get to experience some of the social stuff. 

I think being upfront that it's a project, that they don't have any experience of daily life with a disability, that it's a learning exercise is important. 

I don't want to draw hyperbolic examples, but to me it makes me feel like a kind of cultural appreciation when people are using mobility aids for empathy exercises. It's ok to try and learn about other cultures and lifestyles, and it'd ok to learn about them by submerging yourself, but you need to be upfront that you are here to learn.

790,"I completely agree with preferring ""disabled"" over ""differently abled"" 

My brother has ASD, he's differently abled, and certain things society expects of him causes disability. That's how he identifies. 

I have EDS, my joints dislocate just from engaging the muscles around them, my veins get floppy and I pass out randomly, my mast cells burst without warning and I get anaphylaxis without any triggers, my stomach randomly becomes paralysed and I can't eat. To me, in my personal case, That's disability. Not ""different ability"". 

Obviously everyone is free to choose their own labels, which is something I think a lot of able bodied people rob us of when they are assume self identifying as ""disabled"" is somehow thinking less of ourselves, eg: ""oh, no, you're not disabled, you're just differently abled, don't talk about yourself so negatively"" 

Who said anything about negativity? Disabled is just the way to define something that is dysfunctional in its ability.

969,"Your post is full of inaccurate information. 

SSA doesn't look at a disability file with an attorney and say ""ooohhh this person must be serious"". These claims are worked no differently than any other case. There are a lot of attorneys who take on any SSDI client, especially the larger firms. 

Attorney Reps miss deadlines all the time. When we give claimants deadlines to get in paperwork, the regulations require us to make a certain number of follow up attempts and get third party individuals involved. With an attorney? None of that is required. As soon as the deadline passes we can move on without the paperwork or just deny the claim for failure. A lot of them don't follow along when the case is in process. I can't tell you how many lawyers I've called to find out if a person is going to a Consultative Exam and the attorney has zero idea what I'm talking about. 

Having an attorney at the initial and reconsideration level of claims gives you no greater chance of being approved. Unless you have some cognitive difficulties that would inhibit your ability to fill out paperwork or keep track of deadlines (which a friend/family member could also do) there is no reason to get an attorney. Your using your anecdotal evidence that you were approved with an attorney on the first try and you don't know *anyone* who was. Approximately 35% of all initial applications are approved, a vast majority of them without legal representation. 

Finally, you clearly know nothing about SSDI/SSI and the attorney process. The attorney gets only 25% of a persons backpay **up to** $6,000. So all your mathematical examples are invalid.

Federal and State programs have arbitrary cut-offs for a reason. Because it is the only way to ensure that the program is ""fair"" and not left up to subjective decisions.

For someone who complains about people not being deserving of stuff, you sure do ask for a whole lot. 

There are state programs that can assist with your non-Medicare expenses. Being on SSDI also entitles you to a lot of other assistance programs like TANF, SNAP, transportation assistance, etc. You also get Medicaid to help you cover your premiums for Medicare. A lot of drug companies will give you cards for low/no copays if you call and ask them. Yes your income is low but the value of all the other benefits should be considered as a value added. 

Being low income does not mean you corner the market on having outrageous medical expenses either. I spend about 20% of my annual net income on my medical expenses. My illness is chronic and irreversible, so what do I get for that?

My best advice is to just go ahead and apply. Worse case scenario is that they deny you and you remain in the same situation that you're in now.

Was forced to quit for my own safety and when SSI sent me the overpayment letter, the slashed income left me broke enough that I had to go homeless for a while.  Now I've learned my lesson:  No one WANTS me to work, and therefore it's just financially and logistically easier for me to just stay home and never bother anyone with my ugly face ever again instead of trying to earn my own living like a normal human being.

I know that video games have become difficult but what about other types of games? Gaming meet ups are a thing. On another note, I know how depression can get you with this stuff, especially if you are in pain. I was in severe back and hip pain for over a year. I went through all kinds of PT, injections, and so much pain medication. It sucked! Nobody seemed able to help me. I was fortunate in that I finally asked my neuro about leg braces which everyone else (PT, Physical Medicine doc, and hip doc) said I did not need because I don't have foot drop - a common feature of my illness. Well, I did need them for stability and to help propel me forward. My back and hip pain is now sometimes non-existent since my gait is fixed. Sorry you are going through it.

The vast majority of people in general society won't be able to relate to you in terms of your disability because awareness just isn't there. Like many others and myself, you may be the only person with a disability at your school or such. This was the case for me because I was never in special education and I took Honors and AP classes like every other kid from elementary to high school. I didn't see any people with disabilities like mine until I went to college. 

I would say you can't dwell on your disability because it's a part of you and you can't control whether or not people will accept you.

1065,"There is SO MUCH about our illnesses that feels like is done TO us and that we can't control. So many changes to our bodies that we hadn't planned on. Some of my disabled friends have gone to great lengths to change and improve their appearance - makeup, hair, etc. - to try to have control over something and improve the way the world sees them because face it, a certain number of people can be dicks toward PWD, especially if a person doesn't LOOK disabled, whatever that means. So I think it's normal and natural for you to have these feelings of grief.

I have spent a lot of time being really sick and in and out of the hospital. I think the record was three and a half weeks without washing my hair or getting a real shower, just bed baths and those shower cap things that have some sort of stuff in them but don't actually remove the grease. I had horrible fungal infections in all the folds of my skin, like my armpits, because I wasn't getting enough hygiene and my normal skin flora were wiped out by antibiotics. My hair was beyond horrible; it was completely waterproof. I thought I was going to have to cut it off, but I was too weak to get to the hairdresser's so I just kept washing it and eventually it came clean. 

I'm doing MUCH better but I still don't have much energy to spend on self care. I'm still in bed more than 18 hours/day. Showers are twice as hard because I have a Hickman catheter in my chest for permanent IV access and I'm allergic to the covers that they make, so I have to hold a dry washcloth over it and use a handheld showerhead or washcloths to clean around that area. I wash my hair twice a week because it takes it right out of me. I feel like that's something that no one thinks about but other people with central lines have told me that they miss showering. I have to be hooked up to fluids and nutrition 24/7, so I have to always be conscious of those lines and I'm always tethered to the bag that holds the bags and pumps. I've actually just been online, buying some new clothes because I'm tired of wearing the same worn out, comfortable-but-frumpy outfits that have stains on them from various medical mishaps.

I also have a feeding tube with two ports that I use for putting medications in my small intestine and for draining my stomach so that I don't vomit or reflux all the time. Those two functions are really important for my quality of life but it didn't used to be like that. I think having the tube is one of the worst transitions I've had to make because it's disgusting to have stuff draining out of you. Even though I drain into a closed bag, sometimes I forget to close the bottom part all the way, and having to empty it is gross. And sometimes when I go to do meds, there will be too much pressure and bile will start coming out as soon as I open the port. If my body would just move things through the right direction at the right speed, I wouldn't need a tube, but then if that were true I wouldn't need to be fed by an IV, either. Going from walking poorly to being in a wheelchair was freeing, because I had more energy for other things. Going from not needing a tube to needing a tube was necessary but gross.

As for things that I thought would be too much, I honestly didn't think I was going to live through the pain, nausea, horrible sick feeling, electrolyte swings, etc., after a bad bout of sepsis this winter. I was home but still really sick and needed to go back in. I was ready to stop fighting but my friends and family wouldn't let me. I've had times when I've considered stopping TPN and other life-extending treatments because the pain was too much, but I just kept...persisting, I guess, for lack of a better phrase, and my pain is better controlled for now. I struggle, too, with not being able to really eat. I used to be a foodie. I love food, still, even though my body can't handle it. I'm able to eat small amounts and drain them out of my tube but it's small and only certain consistencies will actually drain. If I don't drain, I pay for it with pain, nausea, and reflux. I miss eating real meals, and fresh fruit and veggies, and turkey dinner at Thanksgiving. I chewed up some turkey and spit it out - not nearly as satisfying for some reason as actually eating - at Thanksgiving and drew a turkey on my bag of TPN.

Do you see a therapist who specializes or has experience with patients with chronic illness? It might be helpful in learning to adapt to these transitions.

I guess my advice would be to try to pick something that you CAN control, like your wig selection or your wardrobe or nails or something, and give yourself permission to spend some time and effort on taking ownership and making that area of your life reflect YOU. Let yourself feel sexy and attractive for doing that bit of self-improvement. And then spend some time pampering yourself physically, with gentle exercise, making a good meal, a massage, that sort of thing. Something to help yourself FEEL better. 

For the depression, even if you're depressed for a perfectly good reason like having an awful chronic illness, sometimes meds can help. It also helps me get through the low times to do some gratitude practice at the end of every day, where I either write down or meditate on things from that day that were good and made me grateful. It can be little things, like a stranger who held the door for you, or big things, like having a supportive family member, or both, but becoming more conscious of the things we're grateful for can help our brain focus on the good instead of the depressing.",,,,punstersquared,"mitochondriac - tubie, TPN, chronic pain, wheels",,1500279220,t5_2qhe8,t3_6nrkx9,t3_6nrkx9,4,1501313242,0,0,dkbpsdw,disability,,,,"There is SO MUCH about our illnesses that feels like is done TO us and that we can't control.

1070,"I'm an engineer and I'm disabled. You'd be surprised by how many people don't take into account someone who isn't like them when engineering something. Whether it's they don't take into account how a child or female is different than a male, or someone who is less physically able than someone else. It makes sense, if you're not affected by something day to day, you wouldn't think to incorporate those issues into your engineering design for a device. But it's critically important that you create a design that is accessible for all of your intended audience. My university recently created a pair of gloves that simulates what it is like to have arthritis and our engineers love using them. It gives them direct access to another set of abilities and then they can use that personal and first hand use to think about ways to improve or better design something. It's one thing to hear from the disabled population, which we do seek out in spades, but it's so much more helpful from an engineering perspective to be able to experience something first hand. That is the goal of these exercises. It's not to simulate your experience or overshadow it or to make fun of it. It's really to help give disabled populations better representation by creating literal physical awareness of limitations engineers will need to design around in the future. It's only for your benefit.

I think it reminds them they are vulnerable and powerless.

A guy who lifted weights, ran, showed feats of insane strength. Was wild, did crazy things. Been around the block. Full stop, no more.

I also think, in my remission days, it seems logical to wonder how someone can go from limping from place to place cringing from every movement, to walking through the isles of big-box store like a man who just did 2 of the fattest lines of the finest Colombian cocoa.

I think it makes them feel guilty they cant fix me, or change it, and they are powerless, and maybe it's their fault. But maybe it isn't if just.. I was faking it, or it wasn't as bad as I say and just snap out of it.

Does anyone have trouble with defining emotional boundaries? Example: You're out with a group of your friends and they start talking about something they want to do later in the evening. You know it's not accessible or would be hard for you to attend. You say nothing, smile politely, but feel quite hurt and upset inside. You make some excuse to leave so that you spare them that moment of ""oh shit, X can't come, damn, guess we'll have to think of something else to do"". You don't want them to think of you as the person who limits them, you want them to think of you as ""normal"" so you remove yourself from the situation to make it seem like you just didn't want to come.
