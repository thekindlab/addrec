13,"Hi! I have FSHD, a type of slowly progressing muscular dystrophy. I have a weirdly specific situation that might be interesting. 

One of my best friends recently had a baby, and I'd love to hold him but I'm TERRIFIED of dropping him or not being able to support his neck. FSHD causes the muscles that hold your scapula (shoulder blades) to deteriorate, and mine are pretty much shot, so holding something in my arms the way you'd hold a baby is super fatiguing in like 5 seconds. Also, Because of the shoulder thing it's hard to keep my elbows bent at the angle needed to support a babies neck. 

I've tried using a pillow to prop my arms up for support but it still feels really tenuous, especially if the baby gets fussy and squirmy. I've also tried just letting the baby rest on my thighs, but those muscles are also affected and it takes some effort to keep my thighs together (they sort of splay out when I'm seated). 

SO. I'm imagining some sort of sling I could wear over one shoulder, like a messenger bag, with a firm curved bottom for the baby to rest in, maybe with a slight rise to the end where the baby's head would rest. The sides would preferably be thinner, soft, and flexible (to enjoy the feeling and warmth of holding the baby), but with some sort of internal boning or structure to keep the sides from folding in on each other.

38,"Damn, that is such a bad situation, especially after all the trouble you had when the last one finished. I had something similar but she was just an in/out carer, so I just rang the office and asked them not to send her again.

As bad as the racism is [and it is fucking vile], I find it more soul destroying that the carer has such an advantage over us because we *literally* rely on them. It becomes difficult to call somebody out when you then have to ask them to do something very personal in the next breath... So, if you don't mind me saying, it is a perfectly good excuse for your staying silent.

It is a *completely* different scenario, but my carer it is very religious and I am an atheist, which has led to some very frothy conversations... I don't want to piss her off and I'm sure she doesn't want to piss off her 'boss', so we have agreed to leave it well alone. By this i mean it is out in the open, we both know where we stand, but we don't talk about it any more as we know it just causes unnecessary friction. It seems to work out well so far.

Maybe [if nothing else, to create a more comfortable environment] gently make it known that you disagree on these issues so whilst in your house can everyone just be professional and not use that type of language? You could tell that it upsets you and you don't want that to inform your opinion of her... Nobody wants to be disliked, so if you can get it over to her that *her* actions are making you form a bad opinion of her, she might reign it in.",,,,wheeliedave,,,1503484217,t5_2qhe8,t3_6vbjln,t3_6vbjln,5,1504305418,0,0,dm0d2nd,disability,,,,,

It may just seem higher up front. They also have staff with vested interest in cheap hearing device options, which I think will help keep them true to the mission statement.

Also, the licensing and approval process tends to incrase the price, so being able to bypass that by having a set of minimum requirements could help(battery life and reliability being really important).

But truth be told, I'm deathly afraid of Out of Order signs. It's an irrational fear, but I always think if I flush in the non-broken stall something will happen to the other stalls toilet. 

I went with my guy friend to this little playarea for disabled kids. He had to pee. The men's room was used for cleaning but he shrugged and went into the girls room no problem.

A few moments later I said ""ah fuck it I have to pee too"". And when I walked inside *HE WAS USING THE HANDICAPPED STALL. With the Out of Order sign.*

And what was worse? *He had the stall flung wide open.*

There was a case worker in the other stall, peeing. I'm diabetic, and I have to pee a lot because of how much water I drink. Now I'm thinking ""oh shit what do I say"".

He comes out and says ""Oh hey there."" Right about then the toilet water starts to rise. I peer in and see it, and fucking RUN.

I sprint like a bat out of hell to get the moderator of the playarea, who runs back. She was able to fix the toilet by plunging. Didn't question my guy friend who was mortified.

Supposedly the case worker didn't hear anything or never minded. Flushed, left it clean as a whistle, thank God, washed her hands and left. I later found out she was deaf and visually impaired. No wonder.

So I peed, washed up, and we rushed out.

63,"Likely, you are applying for SSI (income based social security) as I'm guessing you don't have an extensive work history. In these cases, the examiner will only request records one year back. Sources farther back than that do not show your current functioning, they do not show how you are doing NOW, so they are unfortunately not relevant to your claim. Your mom might have listed one doctor because it was the only one within the year time frame. If there were other doctors, call the local social security office and add these doctors.

Do not supply your medical records- you will get charged to get your records while social security can get them. Social security is required to get any and all sources from the period year before you applied for SSI. 

The process is not ""difficult on purpose"" as peewinkle claims. The process is the way it is in order to be FAIR.  There are many more intricate details the examiner has to be aware of and deal with that are very complicated- again, this is to keep the process FAIR. The initial process is entirely possible to complete without a lawyer, and I typically do not advise getting a lawyer on initial claims; I have had to deny claims because of uncooperative lawyers. However, if you find the process complicated, then it may be better for you to get an attorney representative. The lawyer will not take any money until after you have been awarded benefits; then they will take a percentage of your awarded benefits.

88,"I, a C5-C6 quadriplegic, have had my share of issues, on and off, these 20 years of being disabled. Here's my short list of what has helped me:

1. Minimizing urinary tract infections. Finding the source was my biggest issue. From there, it was an easy improvement. Long term, low dose, antibiotics were not a solution for me. Chance of developing resistance, and the numerous allergies I have to antibiotics, made it an unacceptable choice to me. that said, my closest friend, does use them.

2. Watching fluid intake after about 4PM for nighttime control, or until I'm home from an important morning meeting, appointment, photo shoot, etc. Darn, I hate allowing myself to dehydrate because of all the other consequences, but sometimes you've got to restrict when something important and meaningful is coming your way.

3. Sodium. Yep, my most guilt-filled solution when I see my kidneys waking up at an inopportune time. A quick salty snack slows them down until I can rehyrdrate and flush out.

4. Pee early &amp; often. Set an alarm at night.

5. Medication. Years ago the only best option was medication by the name of Dirtropan. The problem is that the side effects for me were worse than simply not taking it. Thankfully in the last 12 years, or so, I've been taking Detrol, long acting. After a few months the side effects became very manageable, especially if I took it before bed so that the dry mouth had mostly worn off by morning. Perhaps you be looking for the more effectiveness during the day by taking it in the morning. Talk to your doctor. One last thought, I seem to be prone to almost all side effects from medications but mine were mostly minimal and, as a young person, don't be afraid to try even when that intimidating potential side effect of reduced sexual function or desire stares back at you. It didn't affect me, even though some of the other stated side effects were definitely effecting me.

I hope that helps. The only other thing about odor or cleaning up that I can suggest is disposable wipes. They do a pretty good job minimizing smell until the opportunity presents itself to properly get cleaned up.

And what does she or anyone else know. You know what you can do, and more importantly, you know what you *want* to do. That's the important part. You're right, you don't want to get stuck in a major/career that you hate just because some idiots thought they knew better than you did for your life. Fuck that. 

Trust me, do whatever you want to do and don't listen to anyone else. Don't end up with a teaching degree like I did even though I never wanted to teach and I absolutely hated student teaching during my senior year of college (and I *hated* the kids too). I wish to god I'd stood up for myself more and gotten the degree I wanted. (Long-term it won't matter as with my disability I can't work anyway, but I still regret so much not getting the college degree I wanted.) So you do you, and fuck the rest of 'em.

And hahahaha your parents would've freaked me the hell out too! �� I can't even imagine. I had a parakeet when I was a kid and he used to say the weirdest shit. I never did figure out where he learned it. 

Oh man, I know exactly what you mean about being depressed in HS. I got depressed pretty badly, but I didn't dare tell my parents cause they're pretty strict fundamentalist baptists (my mom more so than my dad but he went along with it), and they didn't believe in depression. being ""depressed"" in their religion just meant you weren't praying or reading your Bible enough, and they would've taken me to their pastor for counseling. Hellllll no. So yeah, it built and built until it finally got to the point where when I was in my primary care doc's office for a checkup once I believe around age 18-19 (thankfully without my parents), I completely broke down sobbing to him and told him I was depressed. Thank god he understood and put me on Prozac which helped loads. 

I'm so sorry about your heart Fontaine. Honestly, I have no idea what that is and I couldn't find it on Google (unless you meant you had a heart Fontan procedure as a kid? But that's the closest I could find). But either way, it sounds horrible and I'm so sorry you've had to not only go through the pain, complications, disabilities, and limitations from it; but I'm so sorry that you've had to rearrange your life dreams because of it as well. :(

I really hope you end up with a job there at that zoo! 

And girl, you and I are on the same page. I honestly didn't want kids either, and getting my disease was like a relief because I cannot have kids anymore! Hahaha. So I completely get you! Most people don't understand and think it's odd for a young woman to not want kids, but nooooo thank you. That is just not for me. So between my disease and having gone through 2 straight years of 2 different kinds of chemo, I was pretty done on the children front a few years ago.

I have a loss of leg function; everything above my legs works OK. I can't stand or walk, but I can lie in bed with no trouble. On my back with my knees up and legs spread, I am like any other girl.

The biggest negative effect is that I cannot while sitting in my wheelchair, reach upper shelves and cabinets. So everything in my kitchen has to be on or below the counter.

Your condition is an asset if you use it right.

I do relate to that feeling of ""OMG how am I going to do this disabled thing the rest of my life I'm in so much pain maybe I should pack it in now"" though.

181,"Listen to this guy.

An allowance or a denial is not a determination of whether you are ""sick enough"" - it is based on an evaluation of your medical evidence and whether it is consistent, severe, and suggests marked limitations in the various domains that SSA determines (Understanding and memory; concentration, persistence, and pace; interacting with others; ability to take care of yourself). 

Your ""tags"" do not mean much - someone can have chronic anxiety/depression/ptsd/agoraphobia that are well-managed by medication. The fact that your psychiatrist and therapist used ""tags"" seems to say that they do not understand the SSA disability process. What documentation did they submit? What did they put down for your mental status exams? Did they write comprehensive notes?

The SSA does not doubt you - they doubt the evidence you submitted. Try again and build the strongest case you possibly can. Review all the evidence, fill out the function report comprehensively, get someone to fill out the 3rd-party function report, ask for letters from your providers documenting your limitations, request for consultative exams if you feel that documentation from your providers is not up to snuff.",,,,chiupacabra,,,1503072816,t5_2qhe8,t3_6uebva,t1_dlslgm0,2,1504174386,0,0,dlsz1m9,disability,,,,,
182,"That's super true. 

Super super true.


I'm sorry. All of my romantic partners have had them so I should know better. 

Perhaps I should also clarify that a situation id say to do that is mainly situations when for an example a whole group of friends talking and drinking are occupying all the disability seats, or when a parent puts each of their kids in all four of the seats instead of letting one stay in the stroller or having them since they're small maybe share a seat.

Especially since these at least where I live often will put their stroller so it's very difficult to walk past, and I've heard many say to the kids when the kids ask ""mom doesn't anyone else wanna sit"" they say ""no these seats are especially for kids"", and the time I've interfered to say that ""excuse me sorry hi actually they're for anyone with trouble standing, do you think there's anyway my partner could sit down?"" And only ever gotten rude replies about my partner being young and an adult, or something about how I don't think her kids deserve to be treated like everyone else.
(Not to fall on the kids but on the mom) 
Or on someone who has spread their bags all over the seats around them. -- even if you are disabled and need to get the bags easier (like not putting it on the shelf overhead or under the seat/on the floor because lifting difficulties) I believe that there's a difference between spreading them over several seats, and putting them on one seat next to you. Or if you need to have them spread, letting the person know that ""sorry I have difficulties lifting and I won't be able to pick them up if I put them on the ground"" which gives you the chance to say ""oh I understand. Could I perhaps keep them in my lap?/oh I understand, could my partner help lift them for you when you get off so I can sit?"" 

But you're definitely right. Thanks for pointing out that I was being erasing of invisible disabilities; that's not at all the kind of person I want to be. 

What if you tell the person you need to sit and they say ""why do you need to? You're young and healthy"" rather than ""I'm sorry I need to sit"" 

This isn't required but most times when my partner has asked to sit and the person has said they needed to sit, they've gently poked the person next to them to say ""sorry, I really need this seat, but this person needs to sit too, could you get up?"" And if that person isn't getting up, most of the time someone will overhear and get up. ",,,,Zach-uh-ri-uh,,,1503083904,t5_2qhe8,t3_5wpvuo,t1_dlqe42y,1,1504179434,0,0,dlt970g,disability,,,,,

189,"Wheelchair bound and dating an able bodied guy for the past 3 years- there are lots of times when he feels overwhelmed because he can't fix my health problems, and that definitely causes strain on the relationship. However, after talking about it, we both feel 10xs better. This is a cycle for us. We lived together when I was 18, had just started college, and he was 20 and working in a restaurant. We live in NY, so it was a lot of pressure on him to make his half of the rent. My parents paid mine, since I was never healthy enough to work and also go to class. I was hanging on by a thread physically the 2 semesters I was in college. After the first semester, we had to move out bc I just couldn't take care of myself and my health had spiraled so quickly. By the end of the second semester, I was actually dying of malnutrition due to my gastroparesis and intestinal dysmotility, so I was hospitalized for 1 month the week after class ended. By the middle of the summer, I couldn't walk anymore. Walking is something I struggled with a lot anyway. Turns out I have hip dysplasia. 

Using a wheelchair is a pain. Almost none of my drs have automatic doors. I live in my parents' two story house, which means I have to scoot down the stairs if I have to leave the house, in order to get to the second wheelchair. It's ridiculous, but no way am I about to let my parents pay for a stair lift. My parents also have trouble pushing me because they have the same syndrome I have, EDS. They are only mildly effected, luckily. It still hurts them to lift the chair into the trunk, though. We've been trying for a custom chair I can use on my own for many months, but my orthopedist turned out to be useless. He had no idea what he was doing when it came to writing letters to insurance about the chair. So, now I am using a different dr. Once the letters are sent to my insurance, it's just more waiting. 

Recently, we asked the town, after asking several times over the years, to fix the driveway skirt because it is cracked all over and this makes it really hard to push me over it. It took so many calls. One person even insinuated that I am not actually disabled and my parents just want their skirt fixed, since my parents had called 2xs before about fixing the skirt prior to me being disabled. 

When I'm out, mostly old people stare at me. It's a look of confusion, usually. If a kid stares at me, or asks their parent why I'm in a chair, the parent will usually tell them not to look at me and then pull the kid away. Most people do not move if they're in my way. Many times they just stare at me when I ask them to move. I've also had people rest their bags on my chair. Strangers. 

On the upside, I once had a man who worked at a store pull my chair over 30 ft of gravel(really hard to do) just so I could get inside. Occasionally, people hold the door open, but I'd say 90% of the time no one helps. 

I can't work, so I don't have any advice there. Hopefully one day, though. Right now, I can't do much of anything. I'm in my bed unless I have an appointment, although now that I have pain mgmt I am able to go out for a little bit once a week.

203,"Using and not using accommodations for disabilities is no one's business and it's totally valid to remind them of that. You don't have to prove you're ""disabled enough"" to people.

I get this sometimes when people know I'm Hard of Hearing and catch me not wearing my hearing aids, or catch me listening to music with earbuds. So many times I've explained that I don't always use hearing-aid-compatible headphones and if there's little background noise, I can turn my music all the way up to hear it. Or I've explained that I can understand people with lipreading and context clues (which inevitably turns into the person mouthing words at me to see if I can ""actually lipread"").

205,"I think most people dealing with disabilities have those thoughts. I know I have ok days and horribly crappy days. I feel horrible about my crappy days, because in the grand scheme of disabilities, mine is not that bad. My disability isn't going to kill me. I am still mobile. I can still do things for myself, for the most part. I just can't do what I used to do. I can't be the person I used to be. I can't achieve the dreams I had. My dream job is out of the question for me. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's not the end. I went into a different field of study than I wanted to, because it's something I can do. I chose it because of earning potential. If I can't do what I want, I might as well do something that will make me enough money to play with, right? So far, I have enjoyed all of the classes I have taken in that field. I really didn't think I would like it, but it's kind of fun. I originally wanted to be a veterinarian. I worked in the veterinary field for eight years, before my disability showed up. I loved my job. Now, I am a computer science major. Once I get to a place, financially, where I can afford it, I will be getting into rescue work again. My dream job will become my hobby, in a way. There are ways you can do things you want to do. Sometimes, you have to be creative or compromise a bit, but you can get close. 
That being said, if you are seriously thinking about ending it, you should talk to someone. I know you said it will only cause more problems, but dealing with a little drama from family and friends is small when compared to not seeing what tomorrow has to offer. If you are so unhappy with your life that you are seriously considering ending it, you need to identify what it is that is making you miserable. I have had to cut a lot of people out of my life over the years. I have had to stand up and take control of my life and myself, which is a scary thing to do, but I am happier for doing it. I cut the only family I have off, because they fed my negativity. If you are in college, they should have mental health services. Those services are confidential, meaning they cannot tell your family if you tell them not to. I'm not sure how it works with crisis situations, but I think, legally, they can only notify people if you give permission.  Life does get better. There are things worth experiencing, even with a disability. Going for a stroll outside always reminds me of that. Just sitting outside, listening to the wind, birds, bugs; watching the animals around; putting my feet in the grass all remind me that most things in the world are good. It reminds me that it's the humans in my life, or myself, that complicates things. I like peaceful moments, so I try to savor them when I find them. I also go out of my way to find them. 
I wish you luck and I hope you find someone you can really talk to. Just try to keep your mind open to different options. Life rarely ends up exactly how you envision it, even if you don't have a disability. ",,,,jax4112,,,1503039406,t5_2qhe8,t3_6udt94,t3_6udt94,7,1504164860,0,0,dlsfdj3,disability,,,,,

209,"I'm sorry to hear about all that bullshit. People really give disabled people the short end of the stick.


My best suggestion is to see if you can get some sort of soundboard that you can use to prerecord someone else's voice saying different very general things about yourself. Have the games microphone handy so that you can play these messages from the sound board into the mic. You should be able to find a sound board app for your iPad. If you get some sort of stand and rig a microphone up near the speaker you should be able to hit a few messages to ""chat"" with other players.


I would recommend recording stuff ranging from basic commands to mildly personal information.


Basic stuff might be ""good game,"" ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""okay"" ""hi guys!"" Etc. Or even add statements of exaggeration ""fuck, shit GODDAMMIT!"" (That might be a real winner lol)


More personal stuff might be ""I'm mute, I cannot talk, don't be mean, we're all gamers and I'm here to have fun"" or ""I can only respond to yes/no questions because I can't talk."" You can even lie if you want and have a button for ""I don't speak English I can only answer basic yes no questions."" or even stuff like ""my favorite map/character is X, what's yours?""


You should be able to load up a soundboard with whatever you want. Be creative, make occasional changes, customize recordings for different games, etc.


That's how I might handle this situation. I'd not perfect, but it might make gameplay more interesting. With any luck your guild members might have some good humor in dealing with you in that way, especially if you periodically change up your recordings.

215,"I know someone in a wheelchair, but not a working woman. They became disabled at working age. Here are some things I recall.

A few kids can be really interested in the wheelchair especially really young boys. They seem to think it is a super cool go cart and want to mess with it or ask questions about it. 

People seem to like to share information about supplements and nutrition drinks, etc. that they feel the wheelchair bound person should be taking. Sometimes the person sells these themselves and sometimes it is something they just buy and take themselves or someone they know does. Some of these sharers are barely acquaintances if that to the wheelchair bound person.

People who want to share their religion with others seem to like to approach those in wheelchairs. I think they think a wheelchair bound person would be more interested, or not run away, or not beat them up so they are considered less threatening. The person I know belongs to a religion and doesnt really get offended easily but they get approached a fair amount when out in public.

Even with fairly new construction those bars in bathrooms such as at a gym, attraction, historical site, etc. are sometimes installed in a less helpful or completely unhelpful manner. Maybe no vertical bar in the handicapped gym shower or a horizontal bar right over and behind the toilet. Also some places have grandfathered in old construction so that the handicapped stall is an old regular size with bars that just is not big enough to use.

Some people like to tell their health problems to disabled people in a wheelchair. Maybe they think disabled people like talking about health. Sometimes I think overly talkative people like to monopolize the time of those in a wheelchair because it is harder for them to make a quick getaway.

A nice thing to do besides helping with doors is to ask the wheelchair bound person if they would like a cup of coffee or water if at a place that offers them. It is hard to wheel with a coffee cup in one hand.

Disabled people with placards for a car can give the card to a person to use in picking them up and dropping them off. Thus an able bodied person can park in a handicapped spot and put the placard on the mirror or dash and  go in a building to wheel out their friend to the car. Sometimes debbie dogooder will run over after the ablebodied person gets out to walk in the building to check that it is there and glare at the abled body person who debbie dogooder is certain is not handicapped. 

People love to watch how disabled people get from a wheelchair into a car. If they are sitting on a bench near a business this is considered great entertainment apparently and the watchers apparently think the disabled person or their friend have no peripheral vision.

Sometimes people who the disabled person has helped before becoming disabled when the other person was in a fix, offer no help in return when the disabled person could use help.

There are some nice people who offer anonymous gifts especially around Christmas.

219,"Ugh. I'm so sorry that you have so many external factors to consider when deciding whether to use your scooter or not (such as your future employment). I've never been in that situation specifically, but I can understand some of your fears, me being a disabled person who had my own struggles with being disabled and still trying to have a career at one point. It can be downright terrifying wondering if you can still provide for yourself and how your future will look if your disability affects your employment, and I'm sure that fear goes double with trying to preserve your ability to work your dream job. :(

Also, I love zoos! I especially love the zoos that rescue wounded or needy animals, and give them a better home and a good life. (And as an aside, you and I definitely share the trait of not doing well in heat. Lol. Of course, it doesn't help that I live in the desert. Ugh. Well, that just means that I get to stay at home with the AC cranked for 3-4 months during the summer time. ��)

You say that using your scooter too much triggers your mental rhetoric. What mental rhetoric is that? Just seeing yourself as a fully disabled person? Fearing you'll begin needing your scooter more in life? Fearing what others will say? Or what do you mean, I'd you don't mind my asking?

And as far as spiralling into those certain thoughts, I've been there 100% (and still find myself there at times), so I know how you feel. It's something I think we disabled people fight more often than able-bodied people realize, even those we love and who are close to us. I mean, I love my family dearly, and there's a *lot* I share with them regarding my disability/illness, but my mental struggles with thinking about ""not being here anymore"" is one thing I've never shared with them. How often I get ""down"" or get sick of the state of my life. How many times I wonder if things would be easier not just on myself but also on others close to me if I were just gone. 

So yeah, I completely understand you and what you mean. And if you ever want or need to chat when you're in a bad head space; or hell, even if you're not and you just want to talk about disability or zoos or really *anything*, please feel free to PM me.

Honestly after the first year none drank much at all. I found a lot less people drank because of some anti depressants and stuff. I did miss out on some activities or felt a bit alienated at others but most knew it was beyond my control and didn't force it on me.
On that note too not many people drove either. ",,,,bionicears,,,1501607858,t5_2qhe8,t3_6qv4be,t1_dl0kbvw,2,1503674262,0,0,dl0qthb,disability,,,,,

Huge difference between me (who lives by the beach) just freaking going to the beach, vs me and two-ish helpers-or-friends going to the beach! I do think it's suuuuper cool that some of those chairs have started to crop up at public beaches, and I see that as a sign of some design innovation unfolding. Maybe it is the future. I've also found a tiny sector of self-propelled beach wheelchairs, but my word it's a tiny sector. Not yet at all propagated to public beaches.

250,"I'm 34/F with MD and just want to let you know you're not alone in this struggle! Over the past 2 years my condition has really progressed. I had to sell my condo because it wasn't safe for me to get in and out of anymore (architectural barriers). I had to stop working in March due to my mobility issues. I briefly lived with a boyfriend but we parted ways last month and now I'm living with my parents. 

I don't really feel safe going out alone anymore, and my fatigue often prevents me from doing things. Super depressing. So I'm trying to figure out how to feel less isolated as well. So far, what has helped is:

1. resisting the urge to hide or isolate because I'm sad or feel like I'm boring or a burden or whatever 

2. staying in touch with a few close friends (even though some are in different parts of the country, keeping in touch via text/FaceTime/Facebook etc.), 

3. trying to make plans that involve local friends or family coming to me. 

4. Identify other safe spaces that meet your needs and be open to going to them when you can. (For example, one friend and her husband built a ramp to make their house accessible to me when I explained I wanted to come over but couldn't get up the stairs at the entry. My brother &amp; his wife put up a ramp and railing in the garage so I could come hang out). 

5. Encourage your husband to bring round his friends/colleagues/family and be open to meeting new people when the opportunity arises.

6. Forgive yourself when your stamina breaks and you can't attend something or have to cancel plans. Make sure the other person knows that it's because of your condition, it's not them, and make plans to try again another day

7. (Not here yet personally but trying to psych myself up to do it) Join a group (it could be a support group, a book club, a class, whatever). Pick something you feel like is a feasible time commitment, is interesting or helpful, and that is safe or convenient for you to participate in. That might mean you're G-chatting with a book club once a month instead of going to a physical place. That's okay, too.

8. Pay attention when you feel resistant to going to something or seeing someone. Coping with chronic illness is hard. Sometimes I feel like as much as I want to do something, if I'm not feeling safe or confident I might not be ready to engage with that person or situation. Be gentle and kind to yourself. Give yourself the time you need, but if there are other things going on (like if you made plans with a friend who somehow always makes you feel shitty about yourself, or maybe it's time to re-evaluate your mobility aids because they're not meeting your needs anymore but that's upsetting and stressful because it might mean things are getting worse). You have to hash that shit out and figure out what's what. If you avoid it (a personal favorite strategy of mine, lol), you are going to stay stuck and feel frustrated and angry about it. 

9. Searching for a community online and reaching out to people (like you just did! Woot!)

10. Making sure your husband has adequate support in his caregiver role. Consider options like a personal assistant (if you have $) or a personal care aid (might be covered depending on what state you're in) - even if that person is just around to accompany you on errands, it might help you feel less stranded when your hubby isn't around.

254,"I have mild Cerebral Palsy in my legs. I can walk but it's instantly noticeable. 

Only have had 1 girlfriend so far for a few months in 2014. Childhood friend and able-bodied. I was forced to use a Walker at school for six and half years starting at age 12 until the end of high school. Really screwed me up body image wise but I've started to heal with of all things my local BDSM scene. Single right now but not opposed to looking in a little while. (I write mainly in /r/BDSMCommunity about this stuff, search that sub for Walker Freak if you want, not the point of your post but if you want to know more go ahead and read a bit). There are some with physical disabilities in my local scene. Not specifically looking for a disabled partner as having us both be disabled would create certain roadblocks; and I'd fear bureaucracy might start interfering if we wanted to have kids, but not totally opposed to it if I met someone I connected with. 

I'm going back to school in September. Personality wise I get along with most people for small talk and volunteer somewhere that inspired me to go to school for the new field. I hate job interviews though. 

Small, if theirs no railing I need a ramp or elevator which usualy means I'm going up alone while the group all goes up the stairs unless it's my family. 

Big: Stares of strangers. Still struggle with the first thing people notice about me is what's wrong with my body. 

Strangers mostly tend to be overly nice or unintentionally insulting. A woman was surprised I was using the bathroom alone...at age 15. If I'm waiting for someone just standing somewhere people assume ""Buddy"" needs some help. 

People that know me get used to it most of the time. 

I have personal stories over in the BDSM text based areas here. Again, not expecting you to write based off them but if you want insight into my worldview which is fairly unique go ahead and read.

267,"It sounds like it's definitely time to consider increasing the frequency of OT! Occupational engagement changes throughout the course of our lives, especially from childhood to early adolescence. It's hard to give specific strategies without knowing your daughter's current level of function, strengths vs weaknesses, bathroom set up at home, etc, so I unfortunately can't give you any detailed information on how to help her. What I can tell you is that you don't need to be buying adaptive equipment of Craigslist, insurance pays for that stuff! There's lots of different adaptive equipment available, and her OT should be able to help you choose the ones that are most appropriate and least invasive and write letters of medical necessity to get insurance to cover it. They can teach transfer techniques, too, with proper body mechanics to minimize the risk of injury to both you and her.

 As far as handicap vehicles go, most/all states have medical waiver programs through Medicaid that can fund the cost of a handicap vehicle or the cost of adapting your personal vehicle to be handicap accessible. Unfortunately, wait lists for the waiver can be crazy long (I've heard 15 years in Louisiana!), but better to get on the list now rather than later. You could also check with your state's assistive technology organizations for grant opportunities, or they should at least be able to help you get in contact with the right people who would know where to look for grants. Mobility companies sometimes offer grants and loans, too, so check with them as well as national spina bifida organizations.

There's lots of different adaptive equipment available, and her OT should be able to help you choose the ones that are most appropriate and least invasive and write letters of medical necessity to get insurance to cover it. They can teach transfer techniques, too, with proper body mechanics to minimize the risk of injury to both you and her.

 As far as handicap vehicles go, most/all states have medical waiver programs through Medicaid that can fund the cost of a handicap vehicle or the cost of adapting your personal vehicle to be handicap accessible. Unfortunately, wait lists for the waiver can be crazy long (I've heard 15 years in <LOCATION>!), but better to get on the list now rather than later. You could also check with your state's assistive technology organizations for grant opportunities, or they should at least be able to help you get in contact with the right people who would know where to look for grants. Mobility companies sometimes offer grants and loans, too, so check with them as well as national spina bifida organizations. Hope this helps!","[{'start': 1189, 'end': 1199, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

270,"Try to give it at least 6 months before you do anything drastic like dropping out.

For the record, my first year in college was pretty awful. The campus was huge and inaccessible in some parts, and because I was a freshman with a crappy schedule, I spent so much of my time going around campus drenched in sweat from trying to make it to all my classes. By the time I got there I would usually be too tired to even really pay attention or take notes. That, coupled with the independence of having to live by myself almost did me in.

What helped was contacting the Disability Services Office to make getting around campus easier (I got priority registration to plan my classes so they were closer together, and was allowed to leave class early and arrive late), getting to know a small group of friends who could help me out, and learning how to meal plan and use my energy wisely.

My advice would be:
* Contact the disability services office to see what accommodations they can offer. Some of them are not very helpful, but you might have access to tutoring services, priority registration, note taking assistance, or other help.
* Identify what exactly about the physical and mental strain is causing you issues: Is it hard to comprehend the material? To take good notes? To get around campus? Then zero in and try to come up with a solution.
* Realize that everyone feels stressed out and unable to cope when they first start college, it's just compounded for those of us with disabilities. You were smart enough to get in, so you deserve to be there.
* Try to make at least a few friends if you can. Everyone is looking for friends at the beginning of the semester, and having people to talk to can really lift some of the strain off of you.

College is not for everyone, and if you ultimately decide it's not for you, that's okay. But just realize that it takes a lot of people a while to adjust (seriously, it took me about a year), and I think you'll want to give it your best shot before giving up and deciding to do something else.

I had no problem catching them, unlike OP.  They don't move most of the time, although he does get a reverberation tremor in one leg when it gets dragged somewhere new.  They were easy for me to catch and work with.  I was surprised that his nails, which looked heavy and overgrown, were actually thin and almost flaked away when I trimmed them.  Very much like dry, old paper.  Just one more thing that shows me how ill he really is, despite his cheeriness.

So I cradled his foot, caught each toe and trimmed it into submission, then followed up with a light file and buff to take off the rough edges.

274,"I think the issue in the article is that a doctor may personally think that all disabled people have a low quality of life--like the nurse who told the girl that she (the nurse) would have killed herself rather than be intubated. 

Also, I'm not a believer in the ""disabled body worse than abled body"" idea. For example, I'm blind. My blindness does not make my body ""worse."" I just live differently than sighted people. My vision will not limit my lifespan or cause me additional health problems. It's essentially a lifestyle difference. Obviously, not every person with a disability is in that position. Some people with disabilities may consider their condition objectively worse, but it's probably not a good idea to think that all disabled bodies are categorically worse than abled bodies in all situations.

I would suggest focusing on solo-able sports, maybe. Cycling, swimming, running (either race chairs or hey, maybe a cooler running prosthesis, or a visual aid/substitute of some sort?) That's where my mind goes -- cheaper team-sport chairs are awesome and all, but rural folks may not really benefit much.

In fact maybe that's an angle -- some really smart eggheads are already working on commercial sporting stuff, but maybe they're not looking at the intersectionality between disability and other social crap like living in a small town.

MPS is sort of in a grey area of neuromusculoskeletal pain disorders with conditions like fibromyalgia. The pathophysiology of MPS is poorly understood, and the disease process itself has not been very well characterized in the medical literature. This is unfortunate because many physicians believe that MPS is a functional pain disorder (a nice way of saying that the pain is psychogenic, or originating from your mind.)


This is unfortunate for you, because as far as you know, the pain is real wether it originates from your muscles/fascia, your spinal cord, your brain or the chip that aliens implanted there (joke). 


Just keep in mind that not everyone is going to take you seriously and you may have to be your own advocate. Select your physician carefully.

Sex Ed started in 6th grade, they split the boys and girls to teach us basic body part names and what happens in puberty. 

Grades 7 &amp; 8 we were together, basic forms of birth control, the first time I saw a condom it was put on a souvenir lighthouse with the word ""Woody"" on it. Periods, circumcision. Heavy focus on STDs, think they were trying to gross us away from it, we each had to do a presentation on one. 

High school 9th grade was the last time PE is mandatory where I am, boys and girls separate again. I was taken out of gym in 7th grade as I couldn't keep up and the high school just didn't enroll me for the 2 weeks of health classes; I didn't ask so I just missed that. 

It was accessible in the sense I did the exact same study as everyone else and got the grades. But I was also forced to use a walker at school from 7th grade through high school. It killed my self-worth and I spent those classes privately thinking they were useless as nobody would ever want me.

316,"Hey, I'm a wheelchair user and a film student/screenwriter. If you want to have a chat send me a PM. There are a lot of films that depict wheelchair users in a superficial way so I'd be more than happy to dispel some of the myths around it. I've also studied neuroscience and medical biology in my bachelors so I know a lot about disability in general.  

To quickly answer some of your questions:

* I've never dated any other people with a disability and don't really have any inclination to. I don't really socialize with other people with disabilities. This is because of various personal reasons, but mostly because my disability is not a big part of my identity. When I first got my disability I was quite selfconcious and worried about my love life, but I've only had good experiences. I won't really have one night stands, because that just doesn't really work, but LTR is not a problem. 

* Most annoyances involve how other people treat me as you kind of allude to. I am lucky that I am able to walk short distances, meaning I can walk up and down stairs. I am also very capable with my chair meaning I can take escalators, get into busses, do anything someone without a disability can do. 

* You get looks from strangers and people try to help you, which usually is easily ignored. If I'm in a bad mood though or if they do something that actually worsens the situation I can get quite annoyed. Just an example is that I am much faster in my chair than someone who walks so if they try to get out of my way they usually step into the way. 

* I've never been professionally affected in a direct way by my disability. I mean I have not been rejected from a job because of my disability. However, there are just some jobs that I will not apply for because I can't do them. The same thing in my school, there are some roles I won't be able to take on a shoot, but that is just life. I won't be able to do these professionally, so why bother learning them in school. I mostly focus on editing, directing and AD'ing. 

* This is a huge topic, but one 'positive' experience that I can talk about is that I really don't look at my accident as being something terrible that happened to me. I can honestly say that I don't regret it happening. It changed my life completely, and besides the physical aspect, it made my life much more meaningful. I found my passion and I found a kind of happiness and peace that I never thought I could have. Rehabilitation, going from not being able to do shit, to being able to take care of yourself, is a struggle, but its a struggle with a lot of victories and proud moments along the way. 

I hope this helps. You can probably see that I don't mind talking about this. I have a lot of stories so let me know if you want to talk. If you wouldn't mind, can you tell me a bit more about what you plan to do with this script?

Last thing, someone already mentioned this, but you should check your language. Wheelchair bound, sufferer, able-bodied, living with disability are words and sentences you should avoid. The appropriate way to talk about this is with people first language. This means *person* with a disability and *lead character* with a disability. Wheelchair user is the term I prefer when I'm being formal (my friends can call me whatever they want). I use a wheelchair and I have a disability, but I am also a lot of others things. These things don't define me. That is the idea behind it. By the way, its not a problem that you didn't know this! So don't feel bad about it or anything.

343,"I've been going to barbers for years. In my opinion they're much more easy going then a salon when it comes to clients in wheelchairs. My first advice is to go buy a big, heavy duty rain poncho that is big enough to cover you and almost all of your chair. Put this on while getting a haircut and also ask the barber to put their own apron over that. Also, depending on your chair, and if it's easy to do, flip your headrest out of the way so the barber has better access to the back of your head. When finished just have the barber blow off any hair that may be on your poncho or your wheelchair and when you get home just have someone check to make sure it's totally clean. Most barbers have chairs to sit in. If you can easily transfer that's fine to use if you want. In my experience they're always happy to move it out of the way when I roll up and I just pull in the empty spot. Honestly I've never had to ask.

356,"Just because they *do,* doesn't mean they *should.*
Urine has components that break down skin over time, so it's extremely important to clean it off of the skin as soon as possible, not to mention that leaving your skin in a moist environment will cause breakdown on its own as well. Being in a an environment like that can cause wounds, skin infections, fungal/yeast infections, rashes, urinary tract infections, and can affect her self-image and confidence because she's *mentally* aware of her needs and is not actually incontinent. Additionally, the weight of a person and their positioning (angled up in bed or sitting in a chair) can put pressure on the skin in those places as well, which babies might not experience as much. That weight can cause sores and skin ulcers too, especially if she has reduced mobility, and can press the urine into her skin even more.

I'm surprised that she's not receiving additional assistance if she has multiple amputations--like it literally does not sound like the expected accommodations. She needs to have her mother request additional services and maybe call for a reevaluation of her medical needs, both from a medical assistance aid standpoint and actual additional care--*especially* at school.
She'd probably do best with scheduled bathroom times, both at home and at school, to reduce the number of ""unplanned"" bathroom trips and not having someone available.

363,"Damn that is much worse than me. I've only had one bad experience. Mostly because I only need to use the handicap one on really bad days. I have a balance condition so I only have to use the hand rails to help me up if I fall. 

So I'm in my 6th form and I hadn't eaten much and was quite a bit more dizzy than normal. After my lesson I got pulled in the hall before it was quiet enough for me to get out safely. It was an old building (about 1850-1900) and the corridor is less than half the size of the newer buildings. So I'm get shuffled around and my nausea levels sky rocket. I got to the bathroom just before it started to get busy. I basically throw myself in to the handicap stall. 

When I look down it was covered in shit. It's on everywhere, the bowl, the seat, the back. I hadn't noticed the smell until I was in there. It was, in a word, ungodly. The toilet paper is spilling out. It was actually still attached to the holder. So I end up throwing up. Meaning, now it's covered vomit too. I still had to sit on the floor and wait until the nausea to subside. With the smell.

It was at that point more people coming in and I could hear them gaging. I have to try flush but the world is still spinning. I got the flush on my fourth attempt. It barely made a dent. So I try again but my hand slipped and I put my hand is a skid mark. Yep it was as gross as you'd expect.

10 minutes later I'm well enough to stand-up but I'm still swaying. Thank God I'm the only one in there now. I get the door open and then spend another 5 minutes scrubbing my hands because gross. Thank fuck it's class time now so the hall is empty. All would be well except I didn't notice I had a bit of used bog roll attached to my shin. 

So when I walk into the office to say I'm going home early all they see is a white faced skinny teenager that is stumbling around with shit covered loo roll on her leg. Unsurprisingly the teacher that was in the office asked if I was drunk or high. That was a fun conversation.

371,"It is surprising how dumb and insensitive doctors can be sometimes.  My partner was 30 and got advice by a physio to be tested for rheumatoid arthritis. Her GP said ok but you are to young for rheumatoid arthritis. Ironic as most common age to get it is 30-50, although can get at any age. He was still going on about her being to young when the blood work came in. He then looked at it went very muted and said I'm sending you to a rheumatologist while looking rather sheepish. She was diagnosed and thanks to modern drugs she is in remission, hopefully it will stay that way. Another interesting thing the same doctor said was ""you can have this done when you are better"" can not remember what this was but poor choice of words when referring to a chronic currently incurable condition. 

I have a slipped disc that has been getting progressive worse over the last year and a bit. I am having a slightly better time last month due to a more successful steroid injection and have been able to resume physio and walking short distances 5 to 10 min much better than the 1 min I was at. Before it if I tried physio or moved to much it just flared up my sciatica nerve more but was still told to do everything that made it worse as if I was being lazy, I was just taking more and more pain meds.  

Also can relate to the wheelchair thing a bit. I have been using wheelchair when going out as otherwise I would be house bound. The physio said I needed to stop using it. When I asked why she said I need to stand and walk more. I said I want too and that I walk behind the wheelchair when I can but without it I would just not go out as my pain can go from 1 to 10 in seconds, I have nearly passed out before and have ended up lying on the floor when out. She seemed to think I was using it to avoid walking. If anything I'm using it so I can have more options to walk and stand. My motivation to walk and stand at home is low but at least if I'm out I am happier and able to deal with my pain better, depression definitely makes my pain worse.  I am more likely to try short periods of standing and walking if have wheelchair as backup. Also another interesting bit of advice was stand and walk as much as possible but listen to your body and stop if pain is getting worse. I was thinking that is why I use the wheelchair but apparently I have to stop using it.  I should add I like my physio and I'm sure she deals with lazy people, she does not know me so I do understand her bias. She never says it in a mocking way, more try and do this I think it would be best. So I think sometimes doctors just have a bias especially if not specialised as see all sorts. However they should at least listen and do the relevant referral to an appropriate specialist without being directly rude and mocking.

Also another story I went to a follow-up to my injection have had 3 in total now. When getting the last one my consultant admitted to me that he thought I needed surgery when I first saw him (wish he had told me at the time) and that is the best option if this one does not work. Anyway he was to busy when I came for follow-up and so saw someone else in his team. I told him despite feeling a little better I can feel the injection wearing off. I had lots of questions about surgery outcomes and options. He could not answer any of them. I kept saying the pain despite being better is still really bad. Anyway he said come back in a month.  I was not happy and complained at reception that I wanted to see my consultant, they agreed and put me in a room next to his.  We heard the doctor I had just seen talking to him, apparently I was happy and ""pain free"". My consultant sounded a bit confused and said last time I saw me he said I needed surgery.  I was so annoyed that he had not even listened to me and would say I was pain free.  

TL;DR
So yeah some doctors are great, some medical people are good but bias and some doctors are just arse holes who do not listen. I hope you get a better consultant soon or he will come around, all doctors have bad days but his remarks were not acceptable in this instance.

385,"Sorry, but it's none of their business 1, *why* you choose to use a scooter, and 2, *when* you choose to use your scooter. Hell, you could use it just to go 10 feet and it should not be a problem, because it's 100% your decision when to use it based solely upon how you feel in that moment. 

And BTW - yes, using your scooter when you're unfamiliar with a route and unaware how far the distance may be is not only a perfectly fine situation in which to use it, it's also a **very smart** decision for you to make. Other people don't know the consequences you would face should you get stuck on a long walk without your scooter, and I doubt they would come help you if you found yourself in trouble as a result. So they have zero say about your using your scooter in such a situation.

But I do realize that my reaction to your post may be tainted by my own personal experiences in similar situations. I don't have a scooter, but I have a wheelchair which I didn't always use back when I still had some abilities in my legs and could walk short distances. 

I had run-ins with people I didn't know who said I didn't need a wheelchair, their opinions based solely upon the fact I was a 28-year-old person, therefore I couldn't have needed a wheelchair! Ugh. (I'm currently 30, so this was quite recently.) And that's not even including the people who would berate me for using handicapped parking despite my handicapped placard solely because, again, there were some days when I didn't need to use my wheelchair.

But while inwardly I like to rant and rave against such people with silent middle fingers and inaudible swearing, I've always found that outwardly killing them with kindness is the best way to make them feel embarrassed for what they've done or make them reassess their assumptions/judgments or even just to shut them up. (Granted, some people are just horrible people and won't feel badly for their words/actions no matter what, but most people realized their insensitivity, I found.)

All that to say, I feel for you, OP. I'm sorry there are people who feel it's their place to judge your physical abilities without any foreknowledge; but please keep your head up, and feel free to use your scooter as often or as sparsely as you deem necessary. After all, no one knows your physical state/abilities on that specific day better than you do. ",,,,supremeanonymity,,,1502846369,t5_2qhe8,t3_6ty9hz,t3_6ty9hz,9,1504096399,0,0,dlokbbx,disability,,,,,

As far as anti-overturn goes...rugby chairs (and sport chairs generally) have a wide [camber](http://www.streetsie.com/wp-content/uploads/manual-wheelchair-camber.jpg) which makes the chair base more stable and more importantly helps with manoeuvrability. There are [anti-tip wheels](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/thingstodo/image/608x342/2017/01/27/Wheelchair-Rugby-15443830-Ilan-Amith_8d7e2ce3.jpg) on the rear so you can't tip backwards, and if you do tip over (murderball is an impact sport after all) you're sat really quite far down but with space for your arms to be free so the risk of a head or upper body injury is minimal.

I do feel like a burden to my partners sometimes but never 'just a cripple'. I'm a person who happens to have a disability, not a disability in itself. We have to think about my wheelchair when going places and plan things around hospital visits, but that's about it. It takes up a large amount of my time but isn't a large part of who I am. 

In general your posts in this sub are concerning and if at all possible you should go see a therapist. I appreciate some people post only when they are stressed but your relationship and general outlook seem really negative. It's normal to feel lost and depressed about disability, but it's not healthy. It's something you can change with work and time and I promise life is a lot better when you're not worrying about it 24/7.

445,"Okay so most of the issues you've listed here are solvable with good wheelchair skills, if your wife has the upper body strength and mobility (or can build it). This isn't an option for quads or anyone else with low trunk or arm function, but assuming your wife has a solid upper half she can learn to navigate cracks, drain covers and so on in a rolling wheelie - where you tip the front castors up off the ground and keep moving forward on your back wheels.  

The Freewheel /u/jjay listed is a way of causing this rolling wheelie without having to hold yourself up. It's a great bit of kit but it does have some drawbacks - it makes your turning circle absolutely massive, it's more weight on the chair and it lowers your general manoeuvrability. When I go hiking I use the Freewheel with two mountain bike tyres on the back wheels and it does a great job over long-term rough terrain. Woodland, bark, gravel, mud, wet sand, general rough stony ground. For urban areas though I will always use my street wheels and bump over cracks on the back wheels rather than using the Freewheel.

What kind of chair does she have at the moment? That also makes a difference on how easy she will find it to bump over bumps and cracks.

446,"You're very welcome, it took a lot of experimenting but I'm now pretty comfortable with my outdoor capabilities and was recently asked by a wheelchair OT about teaching a wheelchair skills class. I am a Scout leader over here in the UK and wasn't willing to give it up because of a wheelchair, but so many of our activities are on rough terrain I had to find a way to adapt. 

As your wife is comfortable on crutches, would it be an idea to look at different types of crutches or as /u/cutol mentioned, a rollator? The huge advantage of a rollator is that it has a seat and is far less strain on your arms, but it's harder to get up and down kerbs with a rollator than with a hop on crutches. 

Crutches are hell on the arms over long periods but like wheelchair use it's something you can build up to, particularly if it's just for travelling rather than long term. It's difficult to get good exercise with a disability and I find it helpful to get it through mobility aid use if possible! There are various grips and attachements that can make crutch use more comfortable, when I used them I had moulded hand grips and different tips which both make a huge difference in terms of stability and arm strain.

These are very much an individual thing and I'd strongly advise she try them out in a showroom first. 

You say she has very little upper body strength. Is that something she's interested in changing? If she's happy with you pushing her on trips she won't ever really need it, but if she likes to use crutches or would ever like to push her own chair it makes a huge difference. Personally I fucking love speeding along in my wheelchair, and I love the muscle on my arms and core. My shitty body has often made me feel weak and feeble, and it's an incredible feeling to zoom along the pavement or bump along a rough track. Plus biceps for days!

You say she has a traditional chair that's crazy heavy, so I'm assuming it's one of [these](http://www.dreams.metroeve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Wheelchair.jpg) big bastards. They're cheap and okay as transport chairs, but heavy, clunky and don't turn well. Have you ever looked at an [active user chair](http://www.azarim.org.il/SiteCollectionImages/products/manual_wheelchairs/active_user_wheelchairs/126734lp.jpg)? This is what every full time wheelchair user should have and for good reason. The wheels sit further forward on the chair which affects your centre of gravity and causes you to 'tip' easier. Some models can be adjusted to try different levels of tippiness and see what works. This is really designed so a self-propell user can get themselves up and down from a wheelie, but it also works from an attendant propelled perspective.

Personally I like a very tippy chair, as it's easier to push and makes tipping into a wheelie much easier - good for going over cracks and getting up and down kerbs without a kerb cut. As a user tippy is more dangerous as it means you're more likely to fall over backwards, there are anti-tip devices available but I always found them to be so restrictive for getting up kerbs they were useless. However with an attendant this wouldn't be a problem, you could tip as far as you like, have the large back wheels to miss obstacles, and still have her completely supported.

Now active user chairs are really fucking expensive. My current chair was around 2.5k (GBP, not USD). That said, there is a huge market in used active user chairs and they generally go for a few hundred around me. Occasionally you will see one free. Active users are custom made to fit and don't keep value but as your wife would not be using it full time it wouldn't need to be an exact fit. Additionally if you are using it as a transport chair that gives you a lot of leeway in terms of size. Most of the concern for fit is around the ergonomics of someone pushing all day, every day and the strain that puts on their shoulders and back, which is not an issue for someone in a transport chair.

The one issue you might have is that backs on active user chairs are very low to allow for free arm movement, which is a problem for someone tall pushing. However there are extenders available, or it would be easy to make your own assuming you have access to a metalshop.

I would say that in general going for a larger wheel rather than changing the position of the castors is the way I would go, but I'm no engineer! From a pushing perspective I'd want the front castors lifted for manouverability and use of the rear wheels with perhaps one large back castor rather than back castors. Actually just how the Mountain Trike has it now I think on it. From an attendant perspective I'd look at using the big back wheels to my advantage, as they're the ones great at going over cracks and also the ones that act as shock absorbers and make the ride more pleasant. 

When you do have a tip and she falls out of the chair, why is that? Does the whole chair fall over, or does she just pitch out with the jolt while you keep hold of the chair?

447,"Aw thank you. I found when I started using a chair there was a lot to learn and no-one to ask, my doctor just kind of gave me the chair and sent me off. It was really hard to begin with so if I can help someone else skip that bit I will!

Honestly, she needs to get some upper body strength now. When her leg is bad enough that she has to use a chair full time, she'll find it hard because she'll have to learn to use the chair with no breaks. If you can do it in staged learning it's much better as you're not tiring yourself out all the time. It is also going to wreck **your** shoulders and back to push someone consistently even over short breaks.

It's not about working out necessarily, even just doing a daily walk/roll to the shop on crutches/in a wheelchair would help her build some muscle. Exercise in general is just so important for those with disabilities, we as a group get less in general and good cardiovascular health can help with compensating for broken bits. Is there any sport she would be interested in, even for the social aspect? I have am acquaintance with a high level amputation and he does adapted rock climbing, great for your arms and climbing is an incredibly social sport. 

What a lot of ladies worry about is becoming overly muscular, but that's definitely not going to happen unless you're gymming it up. I swim or gym a couple of days a week and have a pullup bar at home as well as regularly doing half-marathon distances in my chair. I am not bulky at all, I have defined muscle when I tense my arms and back but no-one would ever mistake me for a bodybuilder lol.

Anyway I won't go on about it. Exercise is important, if you can get her building some muscle it would help her, but I completely appreciate that some people just aren't interested and nothing will budge em.

Re rough ground and bleeding, which cushion does she have at the moment? The comfort in a chair can be drastically improved by a decent cushion, especially for prosthetics patients who like you say, can be very rough and sore by the time they are sitting down. Although a cushion adds bulk, it is very light (depending on material) and can be fitted with velcro to stick onto the chair/frame so that it can be easily carried on the folded frame. 

Yes this is the problem with active user chairs, the frame is generally a fixed frame and doesn't fold. The more foldable joints you have in a chair the less energy efficient it is as the energy is lost through the joints with movement. This makes it harder to push for the attendant and much more uncomfortable for the rider. The trade off is that an active user chair is bulky, so even though they are light (my chair is under 10kg including wheel, lighter wheels make make it around 7.5) the shape of them makes them difficult to carry. Not a problem for most people who, when they use it, are sat in it the full time. 

Re the telescoping frame - neat idea, but remember your wife's legs will go over that bend. If you extend the frame out too much she's going to end up with her knee bent up higher which I personally find very uncomfortable over bumps. YMMV. Putting the wheels further back on the frame will make it less tippy (so harder for you) and further forward will make it more tippy.


You may also want to look at the bucket of the seat, sometimes called the dump. Basically what angle your seat is tilted from front to back. My bucket is minimal, as I have good trunk support and push hard. Your wife may be more comfortable with more of an angle to her seat as she is a rider and it may help with the jolts she's getting out of the chair. Your backrest angle and height is important too - if you make your backrest lean further back (more open) the chair will be more tippy. As a user a high bucket angle will also affect your tippiness but I don't think that matters so much with an attendant propelled.

It seems you're looking at something similar to the Mountain Trike, I believe they use disk brakes on their wheels. Just out of curiosity, do you need to use brakes much? I don't think I understand what you mean about axle contact points...active user chairs and many standard chairs operate with quick-release wheels, where they clip right into the end of the axle. You then just push a button and yank it off again. Very quick, very good for getting in and out of cars and taxis. 

I have been to Rome and lived in Edinburgh, both cobble central. The best way to deal with them is (sorry) to tip as a practised user and watch where you're going. When you know your chair and how it handles you can adjust your positioning, lean into one side, take the weight off when you go over a crack with one wheel etc. That's something no attendant can ever imitate I'm afraid. The Freewheel works on cobbles but with it on you can't jump up high kerbs without taking it off, something also common in old cities. It clips on and off easily but I find it a pain in the ass personally. 

How about a pretty seatbelt cover? Again I completely understand this, I might like hiking and getting muddy but I also like to go out on a date in a dress and makeup and have often felt less feminine in my chair. Nowadays I sparkle that shit up, it gets decorated for holidays and I have covers for the frame to match outfits. The blue sections can become red or silvery or whatever I fancy that day.

I took some pics of my chair so you can get the idea of it folded and with the Freewheel, if you're like any close-up pics let me know. My hands shake so they're not the clearest but I hope you get the idea. Fluffs for scale, they wouldn't get out of frame so I gave up.

I took some pics of my chair so you can get the idea of it folded and with the Freewheel, if you're like any close-up pics let me know. My hands shake so they're not the clearest but I hope you get the idea. Fluffs for scale, they wouldn't get out of frame so I gave up.

449,"Have you tried just posting in /r/penpals with a 'I'd like to meet another person with a disability/someone who understands gaps in communication'? There are lots of people who post saying they can only communicate x times a time period or want someone who lives in a certain country or has a specific hobby. I have seen a few posts about people with disabilities as they're a prime group for being penpals. 

I do think though you're doing able bodied people a disservice by assuming how you'll connect with them. I've met some amazing people through reddit and we are very close. We send real-life parcels and I've had visits from some of them. One has called me a sister and asked me to be her bridesmaid. Another puts up with a lot of my shit and is my friend 'wife'. Only one of them has a disability (fibro) and it doesn't restrict their life anywhere near to the extent that my health does. 

They accept that I have periods where I don't reply and times when I am miserable and depressed. They don't pretend to know what it's like but are still supportive. Actually they're better than some 'disability positive' people who are all 'YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE DOING THINGS, FUCK IT THAT YOUR LEGS DON'T WORK.' Don't rule them out for being healthy any more than you'd rule someone out for being disabled. People are individuals.

450,"My wife has CRPS in her legs. She could walk about a block, maybe 2 a day. As in her total walking all day. So you measure it out and you figure out what walking to do and when to be in the chair (which had its own pain points). 

Doctors are concerned that people give up walking when it is hard. This is a fine line for doctors and patients. For some people the doctor has to push them to walk and the patient has to push themselves. For others they will do even more than they can and they need to be reminded to not walk. My wife pushes, she will push herself to the breaking point. So my job *in this situation* is to remind her that she can take the chair, that she can take a day of bed rest, that it is OK to accept the disability for the momen.

So let us say you are getting $1K a month. They award you today and pay back to Jan 1, 2016. That means $24K this year. But you can treat $12K as though you earned it last year and $12K as though you earned it this year.

The flip side is that in her case it helped. The treatment for her condition, the only treatment that is not just palliative care, is desensitizing. It takes physical therapy, which is impossible with allodynia. So anyway, she broke her leg. And the broken bone pain ""turned off"" the CRPS pain. She was able to do her physical therapy. And she did, 3 times a day every day. Then when the break healed her CRPS snapped back. Only it was tamped down from the physical therapy. She is still in agony, but she is in agony gardening rather than in agony in bed. She has to take days of rest but she can do so much more.

But when it took 10 minutes and more to get to the corner that was a problem. And when she keep not attending event that was a big problem. So we pushed her to get a chair.

And uncomfortable is precisely the grey area to watch. There is uncomfortable that is minor and uncomfortable that means you don't move for days.

477,"It can get complicated working while on SSI.  SSI is reduced by earnings, and once earnings reach a certain level, the benefit ceases.  As an incentive to work, a certain amount of income is excluded from the calaculation.  For example, if she made $500 a month from her job,  the first $65 would be exempt (general and earned income exemption), bringing her earned income down to $435.  Next, she would divide her earned income in half (435/2=217.5), but we'll round up to $218.  You would subtract this $218 from the amount of her SSI benefit, which is $735 plus any applicable state supplements.  So her benefit would be at least $517.  Added together with her wages, she would have $1017 of income vs. $735, so while her benefit would be reduced, her overall income would increase.

That's on paper, but it's very complicated.  You can hear a gamut of opinions on working while receiving SSI ranging from from it's perfectly ok to work and earn up to a certain amount to horror stories where folks needed to repay several months of benefits.  I know from personal experience because my wife received SSI for bipolar disorder back when we were in college.  I got a part-time paid internship right before I graduated, so I reported my change of income to the SSA.  Seven months later we received a letter saying her benefits had ceased and we needed to repay 6 months of benefits.  Luckily, I had a gut feeling that would happen so we hadn't cashed any of the checks from the previous months.  I feel my wife may have been cheated out those benefits because I didn't know enough about the regulations, and between work and finishing my degree, didn't invest the effort to educate myself. 

My suggestion would be to contact the local SSA office and ask a caseworker.  Take meticulous notes.  Ask to be referred to a specialist who deals in helping recipients return to work.  Compare what they tell you to what the case worker said.  There are several sites like NOLO that have extensive articles on issues like working while disabled.  Good luck, and I hope your sister in law can get out into community and enjoy the social benefits of employment while still receiving the benefits she deserves.",,,,B-dub31,,,1503929228,t5_2qhe8,t3_6wj1t1,t3_6wj1t1,2,1504450491,0,0,dm8gfd8,disability,,,,,
478,"You might have the option to re-open your old claim if you do so immediately, but I'm not sure if it would help you.  One of our fellow redditors who are SSA/DDS employees can better advise you regarding that issue.

You should definitely try to get Medicaid or subsidized coverage through an insurance exchange so you can start up treatment again.  If that's not an option, you might be able to find free treatment through the local health department.  At a last resort, many hospitals have charity programs, but that would require going to the ER first and getting referred to their network of providers.  

SSA likes medical records within the past 90-120 days because they reflect your current condition.  You are trying to prove that despite treatment, you are still unable to work due to your conditions.  It's daunting, especially for someone with mental illness (my wife has bipolar I), but it's the process that you need to go through to seek benefits.

480,"Social Security Disability, which requires a certain number of credits earned by working, allows you to receive up to 12 months of retroactive backpay prior to your application date if you can prove your disability began then.  However, there is a five month waiting period for benefits, so you would actually only receive 7 months of retroactive benefits.  You will also receive backpay back to your onset date (or up to 12 retroactivelymonths should the medical evidence prove you were disabled prior to applying) should your SSDI case take longer than 5 months to determine (or appeal).

SSI, which is available to disabled individuals who do not have enough credits for SSDI (or SSDI benefit is below a certain amount) who meet certain income and resource guidelines.  SSI does not pay retroactively, but will provide backpay to your application date once your case is approved.

The only way you could receive more backpay would be to appeal your SSDI decision and argue that our onset date is earlier than your application date (or alleged onset date).  However, this also opens your case back up for additional medical review and will also delay the payment of your benefits until the appeal process is concluded.

	SEPTEMBER 11, 2015 by: Markus Häusling as told to David Vajda
I had already been working as a prison guard for five years at a high-security prison in Kassel, Germany, when I was confined to a wheelchair for life because of a rare autoimmune disease. When I called the prison director just before the end of my physical rehabilitation therapy, I expected to hear two words: early retirement. They were never said, and I was back at work a month later.

I started with administrative tasks and then slowly moved back to working with the prisoners. The prison couldn’t hire anyone else to compensate for my limited working hours, so my colleagues put in extra shifts to make sure I could keep my job.

As Kassel prisoners mostly serve long terms for offences such as rape, murder and terrorism, most of the inmates already knew me from before. Contrary to my worries, they reacted to my disability with reservation and even fear. The closest I got to a confrontation with a prisoner was when I was rolling through the deserted old wing by myself one day, and an inmate appeared out of nowhere and blocked the way. “What would you do if I took you hostage right now?” he asked. Adrenaline shot through my body, as my mouth spurted out words. “I doubt I’d be a good hostage,” I replied. “Firstly, I wouldn’t shield your chest, so you’d be an easy target for the snipers on the towers. Secondly, you’d have to push the wheelchair with one hand and hold your weapon with the other — we’d go around in circles like a spinning top. And, thirdly, if I toppled over, you definitely wouldn’t be able to carry me.” He went pretty quiet after that.


Markus Häusling is in training for next year’s Paralympics
For technical reasons, I don’t do some day-to-day ward services, such as checking on inmates in their cells, because some of the corridors are too narrow for my wheelchair. But I supervise when the prisoners work at our in-prison factory facilities and in the bakery, which is right next to my office. If they get permission, prisoners can come straight in and ask me about work-related issues. My role includes setting wages and deciding on disciplinary action if prisoners don’t stick to the rules.

My paralysis started in 2004, when I was in goal at an amateur football club. I suddenly stopped feeling my legs for a moment and stumbled over. I didn’t make much of it and put the incident down to lack of sleep — the night shifts got to me sometimes. But it happened again at work a month later and then my symptoms got worse and worse. In 2005, the doctors diagnosed me with a rare disease of the central nervous system. Even today, no one knows with certainty what caused the nerve infection but it was most likely a contaminated needle used when I was vaccinated.

At that moment, it all seemed very evident to me: I would lose my job; I wouldn’t be able to pay back my debts; my wife would leave me; my family would fall apart. On November 21 2005, I slowly rolled my wheelchair on to the balcony of my hospital room, hauled myself over the railing with my arms, and let go. However, the hospital psychiatrists had noticed my suicidal tendencies weeks before and had moved me to a room with a safety net beneath the balcony. It was my family’s unconditional support that helped me pull myself out of this hopeless phase in my life.

The prisoners respect me even more because of my sporting success. I took up cycling with a hand-powered bike to be able to go cycling with my sons and, in 2008, I started training professionally. About three years later, I moved on to paratriathlon and have won the German championships nine times over different distances. I’ve come second in the European championships and I’m training for next year’s Paralympics in Rio.

One of the prisoners once said: “We’re both on national television, mate — you’re in the sports news, and I’m on Crimewatch.”

Contrary to my worries, they reacted to my disability with reservation and even fear. The closest I got to a confrontation with a prisoner was when I was rolling through the deserted old wing by myself one day, and an inmate appeared out of nowhere and blocked the way. “What would you do if I took you hostage right now?” he asked. Adrenaline shot through my body, as my mouth spurted out words. “I doubt I’d be a good hostage,” I replied. “Firstly, I wouldn’t shield your chest, so you’d be an easy target for the snipers on the towers. Secondly, you’d have to push the wheelchair with one hand and hold your weapon with the other — we’d go around in circles like a spinning top. And, thirdly, if I toppled over, you definitely wouldn’t be able to carry me.” He went pretty quiet after that.


<PERSON> is in training for next year’s Paralympics
For technical reasons, I don’t do some day-to-day ward services, such as checking on inmates in their cells, because some of the corridors are too narrow for my wheelchair. But I supervise when the prisoners work at our in-prison factory facilities and in the bakery, which is right next to my office. If they get permission, prisoners can come straight in and ask me about work-related issues. My role includes setting wages and deciding on disciplinary action if prisoners don’t stick to the rules.

My paralysis started in 2004, when I was in goal at an amateur football club. I suddenly stopped feeling my legs for a moment and stumbled over. I didn’t make much of it and put the incident down to lack of sleep — the night shifts got to me sometimes. But it happened again at work a month later and then my symptoms got worse and worse. In 2005, the doctors diagnosed me with a rare disease of the central nervous system. Even today, no one knows with certainty what caused the nerve infection but it was most likely a contaminated needle used when I was vaccinated.

At that moment, it all seemed very evident to me: I would lose my job; I wouldn’t be able to pay back my debts; my wife would leave me; my family would fall apart. On November 21 2005, I slowly rolled my wheelchair on to the balcony of my hospital room, hauled myself over the railing with my arms, and let go. However, the hospital psychiatrists had noticed my suicidal tendencies weeks before and had moved me to a room with a safety net beneath the balcony. It was my family’s unconditional support that helped me pull myself out of this hopeless phase in my life.

The prisoners respect me even more because of my sporting success. I took up cycling with a hand-powered bike to be able to go cycling with my sons and, in 2008, I started training professionally. About three years later, I moved on to paratriathlon and have won the German championships nine times over different distances. I’ve come second in the European championships and I’m training for next year’s Paralympics in <LOCATION>.

One of the prisoners once said: “We’re both on national television, mate — you’re in the sports news, and I’m on Crimewatch.”

507,"Dude, unless you take charge of your recovery then you *will* end up dead. You obviously do not suffer from a severe form of cognitive disability so you are competent enough to make your own judgements involving your healthcare... *unless* you are a minor. If you are a minor then it would be prudent to let your doctor -- *any* doctor -- know that your parents are keeping you away from treatment. This is a form of abuse and is a very serious offense that could get your parents into a great deal of trouble legally. I understand all too well... My ex-husband denied me healthcare and it took me nearly suffocating from an asthma attack to finally get medical help on my own while he was away. 

You've also put up a barrier to every suggestion I've made. Calling the Suicide Hotline will not bring the police to your door so it will not bring you any ""trouble"". It is operated by volunteers who get what you're going through and costs nothing. If you cannot call them then you can chat online with them anonymously. There is no viable reason for you to not be able to access this free resource unless you don't want help.

As for the mental hospital, they keep you safe while you recover. You don't go in there and get left alone during your stay, you participate in group therapy, art therapy, group activities, and you meet people who have it both better and worse than you. It's a place for respite and it was pivotal to my own recovery. Public mental hospitals can be kind of rough but if you have good insurance then it can be like a week (or however long) at a summer camp for depressed people.

All we can do is give you suggestions and it is your choice to follow them.

You don't *really* want a pity party, do you? Try to understand that there WILL be hard times but also realise that dragging concerned bystanders down with you is not good for *anyone*. Imagine how horrible we'd all feel if you *did* kill yourself or become maimed/brain damaged from a botched attempt. 


Please utilise the suicide hotline. The suicide prevention chat can be found by googling ""I want to die"" and is usually one of the first results. It is all anonymous and no one is going to tell your parents.

If you feel suicidal right now then you can also go to any emergency room.

I used to be suicidal and have spent a few months (collectively) in the mental hospital over the past several years. While it didn't *fix* my problems, it gave me time to reflect on the direction of my life and what had ultimately lead me to feel suicidal. For me, it was always about a loss of control. I would toy with the idea of death when I was in severe physical or emotional pain that had no end in sight, when everything seemed hopeless, when no light at the end of the proverbial tunnel could be seen. When I was forced to take stock of my life I found that I had actually had it pretty good despite some very horrible things that have happened to me (rape, abuse, chronic illness, etcetera). 

It's also worth noting, out of practicality, that your suicide attempt may fail. A good friend of mine botched her attempt and ended up in a coma. When she woke up she had some pretty severe brain damage. Others have jumped from high places and survived only to become paralysed or mutilated. If you have the stomach for it, /r/watchpeopledie is actually a pretty damned good deterrent for those contemplating ending their lives. I sometimes still get suicidal thoughts and WPD absolutely slaps me the fuck out of that. The community is also pretty supportive and awesome which surprised me.

I love walking. It's my favourite form of exercise and I would walk for several miles daily. Now I suddenly just can't and it's devastating.

575,"I applied at 18 too with mental health issues. How long have you been seeing a therapist? Do you see a psychiatrist? On any meds? 

It should say Social Security on it. I believe all my mail came from there. 

I understand. I live with emotional/verbal abuse. I got denied initially, got approved 2 years later. Now I'm on the wait list for public housing so I can finally get out of this toxic environment. 

My parents are the same. My mom says she wishes she didn't have to work. My parents expect me to do all their stuff. They act as if I'm perfectly fine, just that I dont work so I should be doing all their stuff for them. It's hard when your own family doesn't believe how much you're struggling. 

Honestly, I don't think it's something you can keep from them. Unless you drive yourself to appointments and get the mail before them all the time. My mother wrote a summary of my life and everything I've been through to the judge. I still believe that was the main thing that helped me get approved. 

So even if your parents see it just as 'free money' could they at least provide testimony as to your limitations or things that have happened in your life due to your disabilities? (like going to a mental hospital, or missing so many days of school/work,etc)

I hope you get approved quickly but it may take a few years so be prepared. As my therapist said ""You survived 18 years. You can survive another 2"". ",,,,maipoxx,,,1504130446,t5_2qhe8,t3_6x2hya,t3_6x2hya,2,1504522893,0,0,dmckvau,disability,,,,,

586,"So, I went on a trip last week to Europe. Took 3 flights to get there, and 3 flights back. The trip went well, and I had very few accessibility issues around Europe (on crutches though -- different story if I were in a chair). 

On the return leg, I had two layovers -- one in a major European hub, and another in a major American hub (keeping some details out, as this may become a legal thing and I want to keep it anonymous).

When checking in at my initial airport, the lady at the ticketing counter said she did not see wheelchair / assistance on my record, even though, during booking, I made it very clear I needed assistance at each stop. I also made it very clear during booking, that I needed an aisle seat, with my left leg towards the aisle. I paid extra for the middle-class seats with extra legroom, so I could (1) have the extra legroom, and (2) select a specific seat so I knew I would have extra legroom, with my leg in the aisle. The lady at the desk said it shouldn't be a problem, easy to add the note, and even double checked all of my seat assignments all the way through to my destination.

So, I get to the European hub. As we are descending, the flight attendant tells me to wait until everyone is off the plane before getting off. Our plane was parked far from the terminal. There was a stair car to get off the plane, and a bus to get to the terminal. It was raining slightly, and the metal staircase was slick. I waited as instructed, and some airport attendants came down the aisle with a specialized wheelchair, that not only squeezed down the aisle, but also rolled down the steps off the plane. The bus had already left, and in its place was a van marked ""Assistance"". Two employees made sure I got off the plane with all of my stuff, and got to the terminal. Once there, I was loaded onto a golf cart, and we hauled ass across the airport. We went through a side hallway, through a separate customs checkpoint just for us, and all the way to my gate. They made sure I had food and had used the bathroom, and got me from the seat on the old plane, all the way to the seat on the new plane. 10/10, would recommend going through them again. 

Then came the flight into the US. I verified with the gate agents, and again with the flight attendants after boarding, that I would have assistance waiting for me when I arrived. I had a decently long layover, and figured I would be good to go. 

The plane lands, and everyone gets off... And I wait. And wait. Finally, the flight attendant who's clearing the cabin asks why I'm waiting. Mind you, this is the same attendant I spoke to before we departed, who assured me assistance would be waiting. It wasn't. She denied having ever spoken with me. I collect my carry on backpack and my crutches, and hop up the ramp to the gate agent. The gate agent says it doesn't call for assistance anywhere on my record (I show her my boarding pass, which clearly indicates it). She reluctantly calls for a wheelchair, which I have to wait for. 

The wheelchair comes, and I'm told we have to go to customs. Cool, no problem. They wheel me to the Customs agent, who essentially interrogates me about my travels for a good 10 mins (look, buddy, I'm traveling on military orders, and was visiting a fellow NATO country, and I'm in a God damn wheelchair. I don't exactly scream ""terrorist""). After customs, I have to go through TSA screening. I have TSA pre-check, and doctors orders telling me not to bear weight on my left leg. The TSA agent immediately tells me to take off my shoe and cast, get out of the chair, and walk through the scanner. I legitimately ask him to repeat himself, thinking it's some kind of joke. But no, he wants me to *remove my God damned cast* (which is a removable, hard plastic air cast, but I'm not supposed to walk without it), and walk through the scanner. I explain again that I cannot physically do this. The airline representative pushing the wheelchair asks if I'm able to walk through with the crutches. The TSA agent says that, since my crutches and boot have already been cleared, they can't come back through the scanner, because of ""the rules"". Painfully, I get myself out of the chair, and hop on one leg through the scanner. After this, I'm told I've been ""randomly selected"" for additional screening. I hop my way to the side, and stand on one leg while a TSA agent pats me down. When he gets to my injured leg, he very roughly grabs it with both hands, and squeezes and twists around, causing me extreme pain. 

Once that nightmare was over, I had to collect my bags and get them checked back in. The airline representative is useless, and I have to haul my bag from the floor into my lap. I get wheeled to the baggage / check-in, and drop my stuff off. I'm informed of a seat change, but I'm assured it's identical to my old seat. The airline agent wheels me to my gate, and drops be off. Before leaving, I'm told the gate agents will assist me further if I need to get food, use the restroom, etc. I transfer out of the wheelchair and into the waiting area chairs. Eventually, I have to use the restroom and eat. So I hop (on crutches) to the gate agent to ask about assistance. She tells me that they're only required to escort me from gate to gate, and that there's nothing she can do for me. Tired and defeated, I return to my waiting room seat hungry. Luckily the restroom is around the corner, so that need is fulfilled. 

After a few more hungry hours waiting, it's finally time to start pre-boarding. I collect my things and head down the bridge. Once on the plane, it's fairly obvious that my new seat assignment is not in the middle-class seating, but regular coach. While my left leg will still be towards the aisle, there's not nearly enough legroom to fit the cast behind the seat in front of me. 

I make my way back to the front, and let the flight attendant know about the issue. She says I have to go all the way back to the gate agent. I plead, and she calls the gate agent instead (I did not want to have to hop all the way back up the ramp). The gate agent informs us that the flight is completely booked, and there's nothing they can do to help me. She tells me I can call customer service when I arrive home. 

Reluctantly, I go sit back down, with my foot awkwardly lying in the aisle. At this time, general boarding has begun. As the masses start to hoard, literally everyone sitting in the rows behind me either (1) kicks my leg, (2) trips over it, (3) slams their suitcase into it, or (4) some combination of the above. By now, I'm in a lot of pain. I wait until everyone has surely seated, before attempting to reach my carry on to get pain meds. But, I'm immediately told that the cabin door has been closed, and I need to remain seated. I ask the attendant if he can retrieve my meds for me, but I'm told airline policy prohibits him from going into passenger's luggage. Finally, we reach cruising altitude, but we're expecting turbulence, so I'm told again, I cannot access my medications. At this point, I'm in tears, in extreme pain, with nothing I can do about it. I'm sitting there, foot out, face buried in my hands, when suddenly I feel an impact, followed by a lot of pain, followed by another impact, then another. I look up, to see the flight attendant, absent-mindedly ramming the beverage cart into my leg, thinking it must be stuck on something. I yell in pain. The attendant tells me that's what I get for having my foot in the aisle, and that I should pay more attention to where my limbs are. This happens for the two other beverage carts coming down the aisle, as well as the garbage cart... And again when the four carts return to the front. 

When I arrive at my destination, there's no wheelchair assistance waiting for me at the gate. I hop my way all the way to baggage claim, and thankfully find a complete stranger to help me collect my bag. I get the stranger to help me outside to a bench, and call for a ride home. 

On Tuesday, I contacted customer service. They told me there was absolutely nothing they could or would do, since I booked the flights through a partner. When I contacted the partner I hooked through, they said there's nothing they can do, since the flight wasn't one of their flights, but actually one of the main partner's flights.

The attendant tells me that's what I get for having my foot in the aisle, and that I should pay more attention to where my limbs are. This happens for the two other beverage carts coming down the aisle, as well as the garbage cart... And again when the four carts return to the front. 

When I arrive at my destination, there's no wheelchair assistance waiting for me at the gate. I hop my way all the way to baggage claim, and thankfully find a complete stranger to help me collect my bag. I get the stranger to help me outside to a bench, and call for a ride home. 

On Tuesday, I contacted customer service. They told me there was absolutely nothing they could or would do, since I booked the flights through a partner. When I contacted the partner I hooked through, they said there's nothing they can do, since the flight wasn't one of their flights, but actually one of the main partner's flights. 

Once I'm out of the hospital, I'll contact a lawyer and escalate this further...

I've been recovering from a pretty significant accident for the past year. For awhile, I needed a manual chair. Most recently, I was walking around with the use of a fancy leg brace, but I just had surgery on Thursday, so I'm back to non-weight-bearing. 

The biggest one that comes to mind was when I'm on my way to the handicapped stall in a shopping mall. This dude forces his way past me (literally grabs my chair from the handles in the back and moves me to the side), and goes in the stall first. I have to sit there, about to piss myself in an empty bathroom, because this guy took the only handicapped stall. He was in there a solid 10-15 minutes. While in there, he changed his clothes (old clothes got hung over the stall door, arms went up to put new shirt on, etc). He made 3 lengthy phone calls (didn't recognize the language, though). When he finally emerged, though, he hadn't even used the stall for its intended purpose. To make matters worse, when he emerged, he was wearing the uniform of the mall we were in, and proceeded to tell me that the bathroom was now closed for cleaning, and I would have to find the restroom at the other end of the hall.

So we'll be a bit stuck with me pushing for the forseeable future. I tried to use her heavier traditional chair, but with its 3inch caster wheels it was so much worse and caught every little thing on rougher roads.

My hope with back castors mainly was if they drag sideways it's not going to tuck under on her and kick her over the front. At the front if they grab all the momentum will tip her, at the back if they catch the momentum will cause a hop but I don't think that's gunna knock her out as most of her weight will already be past the obstacle, as opposed to all her weight tripping on it. I was also thinking I could put a small guide rail ahead of the rear castor that anything big like a tree root or rock could slide against first before making wheel contact, so if a surface makes contact it won't be with the middle of the flat face of the wheel, but lower on the tire itself, thinking easier to deflect.

With crutches (the forearm kind) she's decent for the short bits too rough for the chair sometimes, she's done big (like basketball big) stone fields on her crutches while i am following carrying the chair (light chairs help a lot, I can fold the one we have and i made backpack type straps i can lug it around a few kms easy and hands free), but it's more of a half km-ish limit with her. She sadly has almost no interest in the upper body strength part, she's been tiny and skinny her whole life, working out she seems to dislike, some things are hard to change, probably until she can't use the leg most of the time anymore she won't bother. That lighter chair i linked is actually a 2-in-1 rollator and transport chair, she won't use it for the former, very much ripping at the skin issue overall, as she has a really short residual limb the prosthetic socket is right up so high to get a grip that the entire top edge except the front pretty much grinds against her skin. On flat repetitive ground and slow speed it's ok 1-2 kms a day of gentle indoor walking, but the jolting and uneven movements of rough ground, since she has no muscles able to do any fine tuning movement, will make her bleed after 2+kms of walking on cobblestone streets or dirt, etc etc. I want to take her out, must be a chair, I must be pushing. Tis life.

Yup you got it, one of those big crappy chairs. I looked at the active chairs, look good, but ya expensive, will look online used again. Size is often a problem, saw a few that don't fold down well, she's from overseas and we take a lot of flights, hoping for something folding, after another used posted the ""compass"" reverse castor chair I found some bad reviews of the design, so thinking maybe work on adjustable front castor forks, so on rougher trips I can extend them out to get the effect of the clip on wheel jjay posted. Looking at a chair like this http://imagelibrary.sunrisemedical.com/asset-bank/images/assets/3201-3300/3266/22_5R_BackrestFoldedDown_O_01.jpg right now, found some detailed CAD files someone already made, so looking at how to make a latching pivot at the main bend for the castors/footrest, and make it telescoping so on rough ground i can have the longer wheel base to stop tipping. And yes as you said, add decent push bars for me, and since I have a bit of background in bike parts I'm looking at hubs that accept bike disc brakes, as I'll be the one needing brake control from behind. Looking at building axle contact points into the back and bottom of the seat so i can unsnap those big wheels and tip them inline with the folded frame, this should be fun.

The problem mainly stems of me pushing and not always seeing the small cracks and things, when we did europe the rough streets (think rome... damn you rome...) the front castors would catch, turn sideways, and just bite right in with the side of the wheel facing forward into some obstacle, tipping the chair forward. Tons of times I saw the holes and cracks and tipped onto the back wheels, but when everywhere is rough roads it was just too common. Maybe I'll experiment with more extreme castor rake angles to see if they have a harder time catching sideways? I need to make wood models for trials... SO many things to build now...

We were viewing student houses one year and the estate agent was lovely in the shop, and then we stood up to get into the car and go view some properties and he saw the stick- from that point he stopped talking to me, and referred all questions about me to my friends (can she handle those stairs, is she going to be alright with an upstairs bathroom) as if my brain suddenly stopped working when he realised my legs don't and my friends immediately became my carers. Some people are weird, and it was kinda nice to see my friends lose their temper and refuse to get any house through that agency while I sort of shrugged it off.

Honestly to be disabled I feel like you need to build good wit for responses to dumbass questions, and if you approach everything with a good sense of humour you will be fine. I have had so many more times where having the sticks helped me (people were helpful, it's a conversation starter, I get compliments on how awesome my collection of brightly coloured sticks are) so it is really just a thing of owning it and being a badass.

I don't know about other markets, but the cost of renting a room here can be almost as much as a studio, or more depending on the area. It also comes with many stipulations, including income discrimination. 

People here won't rent a room to people on a fixed income because they don't want someone who stays in the house all the time. Even if their income meets the 2.5× rule.

If you take medications or have medical supplies be sure to sign up for medicare and medicaid and get a good prescription plain (Part D) Look and see if you qualify in you state for Extra Help program through <URL> 
Every little bit helps in the long run.
 Make sure you get with the Dept of Family and Children services in your state for. SNAP or Food stamps to help you with food for your apartment. Go to thrift stores for pots and pans until you can do better. Buy a crockpot those come in handy anytime.
 Most people have cell phones and I have one through ATT go phone with unlimited talk and text all over the <LOCATION>. Having cheap phone plans help save some of your money for other expenses.
Everyone needs something for entertainment: So I have Netflix and Hulu. Both are cheaper than cable or Dish or Direct tv. You can see all you need to see or want to see through streaming.
If you have it in your budget see about getting a computer it could be desk top of lap top. Having a computer gives you some other choices for entertainment like watching <PERSON> or looking at all that Reddit has to offer. When its close to the end of the month see how much you have left after paying ALL your bills. Whatever is left over don't touch it and hold it til the next month. You will have a small cushion to fall on in case something like car repairs and so on happen. 
This is all I can think of based on what I do to live in my apartment. I haven't ever been late on rent or my electric bills. I hope this gives you some ideas to see what direction you can go in.

663,"I know this isn't much but I wanted to give my two cents. I suffer from urinary incontinence other than that I am healthy. Typically I get enough warning before an accident that I can use a toilet so I use pull on protection and for that I don't need a handicapped toilet but when I am going to be in a situation where I won't be able to use a restroom for a while, most notably when I fly places but also in other situations I wear a heavy plastic backed diaper in case I have accidents. Both putting on and taking off a diaper is basically impossible in a normal sized stall so I use a handicapped stall in that situation or preferably a private or family bathroom because being a otherwise healthy college male I hate the idea of others hearing me changing such as the plastic crinkling as I unfold it and the sound of me tearing tapes and also I don't want to have to walk to the trash by everyone carrying a soaked diaper. Back to my point though, I always feel nervous that someone else who needs the handicap restroom will walk in needing to use the stall or family restroom while I am changing. I also always feel like people are judging me when I walk into a family restroom at an airport especially since I think by all appearances I am a perfectly healthy 20 year old male. Luckily I have never had any real issues with this the only slight one was once after I had finished changing in the family restroom I went to walk out and a mother with her infant was waiting to use it and she stared me down didn't say anything. I wasn't sure what to do on one side I felt bad about having used the family restroom but on the other I do need it. Sorry for the ramblings and if I gave tmi.

Sorry if I get a little off topic my mind tends to wander and jump the fun of ADHD. I don't drink a lot of fluids anyways thanks to my ADHD meds I am barely ever hungry or thirsty during the day and at least for me it seems like sometimes I'll drink basically nothing and I'll be having to use the restroom every half an hour and then others days I'll drink a lot and will only have to use the restroom two or three times it is the inconsistency that has made it so difficult to manage. Some days I'll be perfectly fine with no issues but others I will be leaking a lot and barely get any warning before my bladder starts to empty also it can make choosing how best to protect my self difficult if it was just maybe the occasional leak everyday I would definately be fine with pull ons I use for protection but the fact that some days my issues are a good bit worse makes me wonder whether I should transition to my plastic backed premium briefs that I currently use at night in the daytime. Sodium I think is definately good advice I know I laid off of it in high school since it helps retain water when I was wrestling to stay at the right weight (luckily my bladder issues hadn't started yet). I find keeping to a timed voiding schedule nearly impossible for me since I have a highly vayiable daily schedule. As for medication I don't remember the name of the medication I was on but it made me stop sweating which nearly led to me having heat stroke several times. I am wary of taking new medications.

Absolutely! it cant be mentioned in a context outside of my being on disability around my folks without getting a flippant comment about anger issues like a disproportionate amount of those on disability are basically millenials that refuse to grow up.

They were outraged that it took ""so long"" for my disability to be approved (iirc 4 months which afaik is fast).

They were likewise outraged at the means testing when we asked about help with medical expenses. ( I had fantastic insurance but COBRA was expensive)

When it comes to me(or them) from their perspective of course I(they) should get all the help in the world. Everyone else though? More means testing, more red tape etc.

When that doesn't get the point across they  pivot to how illegals would get treatment for free. This happened often when I got meds at no cost on my states medicare expansion. They had to find a way to be mad about that without directing it at me.

Now that I'm on medicare? They think the 20% copay is absurd. Anti socialism/singlepayer unless its for them/me then ts ""we don't get more because people I don't like get too much.

708,"As someone with IBD *and* mobility aids, I started thinking about my own bathroom needs during your comic con story. I will often use the accessible stall because manoeuvring with crutches in a standard stall is very difficult and I really benefit from the leverage/handrails in the handicap stalls in order to get up and down from the throne, I *can* technically use a standard stall, my needs for the wide stall are certainly not as great as a wheelchair users needs. But I'm sure we can all appreciate that having hand rails and not having to do yoga just to fit in a standard stall with crutches can reduce pain and potential flare ups and crashes later in the day.

Especially when combined with IBD, Sometimes I'm in a rush and I don't have time to manoeuvre carefully in a standard stall, I need to just run in and plant my bum down asap. I have had situations where I have tried to use a standard stall, lost my balance, and landed on the floor, not had time to get up before my bowels open, and had a bigger mess to deal with than if i'd just accepted that I need the wide stall and handrails.

I digress.

I've definitely been that asshole, sitting on the handicapped toilet for 40-50 minutes, A human fire hydrant of faeces, praying to god that no one else with mobility needs enters the bathroom. From the crack in the stall door, I'm just some bitch on my phone, trying to distract myself from the pain and cramps with facebook, My crutches resting against the wall out of site.

But at least unlike OP's Comic Con woman, I'm vocal when someone asks what my deal is. I'm apologetic and self aware enough to say ""I'm sorry, at the time I had great need for this stall, but I understand at this point, your need is greater""

I can usually hear a mobility aid on the tiled floor and I will be quick to say ""I'm so sorry if you need this stall, I have IBD, I don't know how long I will be, maybe you should ask staff if there's another accessible bathroom?""

It's only happened once, But there was a definite scramble to just hold in what was left inside me, wipe myself up, wipe up my surroundings, double check the stall was presentable, grab my crutches and then get out to let the other person in. I don't compromise on making sure the stall was clean, But it was embarrassing and I felt guilty knowing every extra second I took some poor person was having to hold themselves longer, I know that pain all to well.

Since it was no longer an ""urgent"" situation to get to the toilet, after departing the handicapped stall, I was able to take my time with my crutches to manoeuvre in a standard stall to finish my business.

I've been lucky that the only time that happened, there was no queue for standard stalls.

I can only imagine the discussion I would need to have, Flushing and exiting the handicap stall with my crutches, then making eye contact with the ambulant women in the front of the queue and saying ""can I jump the queue, I need to get back into any stall ASAP... I have IBD and I wasn't finished, but they needed that stall more than me""

It really is a difficult balance bathroom etiquette with addressing our personal needs. We all need to use the bathroom, it's human. But the ""handicap stall"" caters to such a wide range of different needs. People with Ostomy bags and catheters need the stall because the sink is inside the stall allowing for better hygiene when draining bags. People with impaired mobility and balance need the stall for the handrails and people with mobility aids or larger bodies need the stall for is ample size to turn and manoeuvre. The handicap stall is also large enough that people with severe mobility needs or intellectual/functional disabilities can have a carer or assistant with them to help them with hygiene or dressing. So many people need this stall for so many different reasons, We're a small percentage of the population so It's understandable that there is only ever 1 handicapp stall, But it's so hard to know what to do when there are multiple people who need it.

Comic Con and similar conventions are the worst too, Because people with large, obstructive props/costumes tend to require these stalls too because their costume wont fit in a standard stall.",,,,DearyDairy,"Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, POTS, MCAS",,1502073897,t5_2qhe8,t3_6s0iih,t3_6s0iih,6,1503831264,0,0,dl9m0hr,disability,,,,"As someone with IBD *and* mobility aids, I started thinking about my own bathroom needs during your comic con story. I will often use the accessible stall because manoeuvring with crutches in a standard stall is very difficult and I really benefit from the leverage/handrails in the handicap stalls in order to get up and down from the throne, I *can* technically use a standard stall, my needs for the wide stall are certainly not as great as a wheelchair users needs. But I'm sure we can all appreciate that having hand rails and not having to do yoga just to fit in a standard stall with crutches can reduce pain and potential flare ups and crashes later in the day.

Especially when combined with IBD, Sometimes I'm in a rush and I don't have time to manoeuvre carefully in a standard stall, I need to just run in and plant my bum down asap. I have had situations where I have tried to use a standard stall, lost my balance, and landed on the floor, not had time to get up before my bowels open, and had a bigger mess to deal with than if i'd just accepted that I need the wide stall and handrails.

I digress.

I've definitely been that asshole, sitting on the handicapped toilet for 40-50 minutes, A human fire hydrant of faeces, praying to god that no one else with mobility needs enters the bathroom. From the crack in the stall door, I'm just some bitch on my phone, trying to distract myself from the pain and cramps with facebook, My crutches resting against the wall out of site.

But at least unlike OP's Comic Con woman, I'm vocal when someone asks what my deal is. I'm apologetic and self aware enough to say ""I'm sorry, at the time I had great need for this stall, but I understand at this point, your need is greater""

I can usually hear a mobility aid on the tiled floor and I will be quick to say ""I'm so sorry if you need this stall, I have IBD, I don't know how long I will be, maybe you should ask staff if there's another accessible bathroom?""

It's only happened once, But there was a definite scramble to just hold in what was left inside me, wipe myself up, wipe up my surroundings, double check the stall was presentable, grab my crutches and then get out to let the other person in. I don't compromise on making sure the stall was clean, But it was embarrassing and I felt guilty knowing every extra second I took some poor person was having to hold themselves longer, I know that pain all to well.

Since it was no longer an ""urgent"" situation to get to the toilet, after departing the handicapped stall, I was able to take my time with my crutches to manoeuvre in a standard stall to finish my business.

I've been lucky that the only time that happened, there was no queue for standard stalls.

I can only imagine the discussion I would need to have, <PERSON> and exiting the handicap stall with my crutches, then making eye contact with the ambulant women in the front of the queue and saying ""can I jump the queue, I need to get back into any stall <LOCATION>... I have IBD and I wasn't finished, but they needed that stall more than me""

It really is a difficult balance bathroom etiquette with addressing our personal needs. We all need to use the bathroom, it's human. But the ""handicap stall"" caters to such a wide range of different needs. People with Ostomy bags and catheters need the stall because the sink is inside the stall allowing for better hygiene when draining bags. People with impaired mobility and balance need the stall for the handrails and people with mobility aids or larger bodies need the stall for is ample size to turn and manoeuvre. The handicap stall is also large enough that people with severe mobility needs or intellectual/functional disabilities can have a carer or assistant with them to help them with hygiene or dressing. So many people need this stall for so many different reasons, We're a small percentage of the population so It's understandable that there is only ever 1 handicapp stall, But it's so hard to know what to do when there are multiple people who need it.

737,"Here's a very brief rundown:
SSI - basically for kids and adults who haven't paid FICA. Maxes at $735/month, but drops from there depending on your living situation, outside help, income (they take $1 for every $2 you make over $65), plus income of a spouse. With it you get Medicaid, they are both welfare benefits so additionally your assets can't exceed $2,000. 

SSDI - for those who have paid FICA. Benefit amount based on your prior earnings. Basically nothing counts against it unless you earn too much in 9 months out of 60. You get Medicare after 2 years. If your SSDI is under $735, you could get the balance from SSI but all in the paragraph about SSI would apply. 

DAC - this is a benefit you can collect if you are unmarried, found disabled young enough, and have a parent who paid in but is now retired, on SSDI themselves, or deceased. 

That's just a sketch. The big hurdle is getting approved. Only about 40% ever do and it can take years. ",,,,Frugalista1,,,1502342494,t5_2qhe8,t3_6sr21p,t1_dlex7cu,7,1503925606,0,0,dlexqaz,disability,,,,,

785,"I've been a regular opiate user for about 5 years; the amount has waxed and waned, but I take at least one pill per day. I tried all non-opiates first. NSAIDs, all the gaba drugs, epidural injections, PT, acupuncture, chiropractor, and I have a SCS. 

What you should focus on is quality of life. I hate taking opiates, I hate how they make me feel (I never understood the ""high"" factor). But they allow me to lead a relatively normal life. If you're worried about other people - just don't tell them. Its none of their business anyway. Personally, I'm upfront with people (if it comes up in conversation) because I think that it provides an alternative to the epidemic-narrative. They need to see people who use the drugs as intended. 

There are a lot of things to consider with the drugs though. Dependence (different than abuse!) will happen with regular use. So even if I'm going through a really good spurt where I don't need the opiates [rare] I will start to go through withdrawal after about 24-36 hours. Unless you are a heavy user, the withdrawals aren't immediate. I might get a bit of a runny nose or watery eyes after about 12 hours, but the significant symptoms come much later. 

With dependence comes habituation and increased tolerance; a lot of this will depend on your genetics. I've been lucky that the same dose has worked for the last 2 years, but I know that it still doesn't work quite as good as when I started on it. But, for my own reasons, I'm not going up any higher. 

Even the most well intentioned and responsible user runs the risk of addiction. Never take more than prescribed, and always take them as prescribed (don't take the next dose early). Don't take them more than you need (even if within prescribed guidelines). Be mindful of your relationship with them. 

The politics of the moment do make things more difficult for sure, but try not to focus on that. I would recommend seeking treatment with a pain management doctor, they are more versed on the drugs and will [probably] be less skittish.

789,"&gt; You would be surprised how many people have told me to hide this money - from the IRS and from SSA

Its one of those ""risk vs reward"" scenarios. If you work under the table for cash, there is a very small chance that you'd get in trouble with the IRS/SSA. Its one of those thing that they wouldn't necessarily know unless you or someone else told them. But its easy to mess up and say something, or you piss the wrong person off and they will report you to OIG. 

But the risk comes in getting caught. I can't speak to the IRS side (back taxes I suppose) but on the SSA side it will be unpleasant. They have an entire division with SSA/OIG devoted to fraud, and this is one area they specialize in. People regularly get civil monetary penalties (fines) and have to pay back everything that SSA gave them. Some get jail but that is rare. And then your file gets a big ol' FRAUD flag on it. So then down the line if you [legitimately] file again everything gets double scrutiny and you end up with very little credibility. We do not take kindly to those who try to cheat the system.

790,"The first big questions - is she on SSI-only or is she on SSDI based on a parents SSN?

If SSI only, the work rules are much stricter. She can work and still be eligible for benefits, *but* as she earns income (even under the SGA limit) it will lessen her monthly benefits. Generally speaking, its about a 2:1 ration (for every $2 earned, her SSI goes down $1). 

Are either of her parents retired, disabled or deceased? When any of those things happen she will be eligible for CDB benefits (childhood disability benefits) as long as she was found disabled between the ages of 18-22. She would get to draw on their SSN's earnings (up to about 75% of their check) and the work rules become much more lax. 

Is her mother her representative payee? and is she reporting all of her earnings to SSA? She is required to report all earnings to SSA; if not it could result in an overpayment and she will then owe SSA money. 

As for her future goals - she needs to consider HUD housing. These are apartments (sometimes townhomes) where their rent is capped at 30% of their income. Plus moving out would make her eligible for a host of other state benefits like food stamps. Its difficult, but I know people who live independently on SSI this way. 

If you don't think she is capable of living by herself - she needs to get hooked up with a community residential habilitation agency. She can live in a HUD apartment and Medicaid would pay the agency to ""staff"" her. (assuming the medical need is present). This can range from a few hours per week to 24 hour care. Most agencies do require anyone in 24 care to live with a roommate; the reimbursement rates are abysmal and they can't afford to staff someone 24/7 along.

793,"Sometimes unidentified illness can be difficult when you're dealing with SSA. Especially the kinds where there is some interaction between mental and physical causes of your symptoms. So the physical doctor is only looking at your GI issues, and the mental doctor is just looking at the psych. Its hard to get them to meet in the middle and see the interaction sometimes (that falls more on the adjudicator themselves)

What does your current treatment consist of? Do you see a GI doctor and are you on meds? You mention psych providers, but how often do you see them? What kind of response do you get from the medication and treatment?

You say you went from 40hrs/week to 12 hrs/week, how long ago was the switch? A person's disability has to prevent working for an entire year (or be expected to last). So even if you've had the issues when you were working 40hrs, that 12 month clock really starts when you start earning under SGA. So if you are early in that timeframe, they might project that, with treatment, you'll be able to work again. (not saying that is the right thing in your situation, just a possibility). Or if your symptoms have been consistent from when you were working 40 hrs a week, the argument might be that there is nothing new (medical wise) to suggest that you can't work a full-time job. 

Its important to remember that the disability decision isn't just about what your *perceived* limitations are, it is about the limitations that the *medical evidence* can support. So when people say ""why would SSA deny me clearly I have these issues!"" the first thing I say is to see what is in your medical records. You'd be surprised at how inaccurate they can be, or how much stuff you tell you doctor that won't make it into the records.

795,"You're going to hear conflicting information about whether you can work while applying. The fact is that the issue is a total grey area. Someone will not get automatically denied for working under SGA, but it could hurt their chances. Or it may not matter at all. 

A lot of it will depend on the type of work, how similar it is to other work you've done, and your conditions.  In your particular situation - I believe that it *could* hurt your chances, if you don't present it the right way. You're going to be asked about it, so the best thing to do is be honest with why you are working part-time.

The central issue of any disability determination is the question of whether this person can earn SGA and sustain full-time employment. Sustainability is a big part of the decision, and that is where your limitations come in. If you make the argument that you can only work 2 days per week because that is all your mental health will allow, they are more willing to overlook it. 

Is there any other options besides teaching? Depending on the adjudicator/judge, sometimes it will be held against you if you're arguing that you can't do a specific job, but then you do that specific job part-time.

You're timeline so far is on the faster end of average. The long wait time at the beginning is usually if there is a backlog of claims at the DDS waiting to be assigned (they can only hand out so many at once). And then from there it depends on how quickly the paperwork gets completed and how quickly medical records are received. 

It is entirely possible that your medical records have been received already. With so many vendors using electronic records, its as simple as a push of a button. Hell, there are some large corporations that have the technology where as soon as you finish your application, it automatically goes out and pulls the records into your file before it even reaches the DDS.

How quickly things go from here will depend on a few things. Assuming that they don't need any additional medical (via consultative exam) as soon as they receive your paperwork (it can take 7-10 days from mailing to hit the file)then can send it to a doctor for review. Sometimes that only takes a few days, sometimes it can take a week or two. It all depends on how big the wait list is. Once its back from the doctor the rest of it only takes maybe an hour to finish. But after that it might get caught by the federal QA system which can take up to 30 days (if they don't find an error) to clear or, if they do find the DDS made an error, that can cause another 30-60 delay.

807,The simplish answer is that we can see the body but not the mind. We don't fully understand how mental illness physiologically affects us. The mind in many cases is viewed as more important than the body as it defines us as an individual person.if our minds are broken society tends to generalize and put us all under the loony bin category because that is easier to do than to treat the us as someone suffering from a condition. If a person is aggressive due to mental illness it's much easier to say the person is a bad egg than to realize they are also suffering. In short we talk more about things we understand better than things we understand poorly or not as well,,,,cheerfulKing,,,1503626459,t5_2qhe8,t3_6vtque,t3_6vtque,4,1504358707,0,0,dm3b4qi,disability,,,,,

If the physical strains are too much, talk to your school's version of an Accessibility Office. Even if you've already talked to them, many places let you rework accommodations if new or unexpected things come up.

Almost every school has ample help and tutoring available, especially for freshmen. Look into these services and take advantage of them. 

Definitely give it more than one day. Keep going at it at least for the semester. Medical withdrawals are an option in emergency situations. Also, a lot of professors talk really tough at the beginning of the semester, just to send the ""this is not the class to slack off in"" message.

This is a sadly common thing. I see this on any given day that I leave the house. At this point most of the anger has subsided in lieu of simply accepting that the world is covered with assholes, and all over them think they're entitled to handicapped parking spots.

On the other hand, if you have iOS there is an app called Parking Mobility which, if your local police department participates, allows you to take photos of the vehicle and report it to the police who then issue a ticket. Some by mail, some send an officer out. Petty revenge is the best revenge.

At one point I had a lady do something similar to your situation -- she took up the only handicapped spot on street-side parking. I was gonna let it slide, until she hit my car when she was reversing.

I'm a paraplegic so there is no hiding my disability.  Not that I have the option, but trying to hide my disability sounds like an exhausting chore that's not worth the hassle.

I can worry about it or I can just live the best life I possibly can.""  

I made tons of friends in college.  None of them gave a shit about my disability.  Yeah, you'll get weird questions from time to time, but so what.  Like I said, work on discovering why you hate it about yourself so much, and come to terms with it.  You're going to get awkward questions no matter what.  Little kids, old people, ignorant people, they all ask questions.  People in college are there to learn.  Sometimes they're a little more tactful and don't ask, but sometimes their quest for knowledge begs them to.  It's no big deal.  You'll get it through out your entire life.  Don't let it ruin your day, brush it off the best you can and move forward.  I had my leg crossed over the other when I went out to smoke at the bar last night.  Some young girl asked me if I broke my leg.  I said no and told her I am paralyzed.  She said she felt bad for asking, but of course, that didn't stop her from proceeding.  She asked how long it's been.  She asked how old I was.  She asked if my dick still worked.  Some of the usual questions.  She then commented that I probably have a big dick (I don't) and that while she doesn't necessarily enjoy anal sex, it makes her cum really hard.  And THAT was way more awkward than any question she asked me about my disability.

I hate children so much like they're loud and unpredictable and I just kinda go ""never again"" whenever I babysit.(4 more days and my niece will be old enough for school and someone else can watch her in the summer.)

If you're a lady you might have to skip the hair-washing bit they do before-hand (do they do this with guys? no idea!) but that's OK because they'll spray your hair to wet it using a bottle with water. At the end, there shouldn't be much hair on your wheelchair but I often find there is some (this is probably more of a problem if you have long hair and getting a lot cut off). They usually use a hair-dryer to blow it off the chair, if you notice any hair just ask them to blow it off.",,,,TinyLittleStormCloud,,,1502108660,t5_2qhe8,t3_6rzw7v,t3_6rzw7v,2,1503839579,0,0,dla31nc,disability,,,,,
1056,"Yeah, I think I know exactly what you mean. I also feel, like you do, that it makes it harder for people to see themselves in you. And I feel like it detracts from the main issue being discussed by turning it into  a race to identify who has the longest list of minority traits. 

Totally agree on the issue of disability being very hard to relate to. I think most times I've talked with people about my experiences they've been surprised. And I have a physical disability so I can't imagine how little they know about invisible or other kinds of disabilities, must be even harder for those with invisible disabilities to get their experiences across. I do feel most ableism is rooted in ignorance and misunderstanding rather than malice, although the latter does exist too of course.",,,,TinyLittleStormCloud,,,1502613660,t5_2qhe8,t3_6t1sp3,t1_dlijdmm,3,1504014701,0,0,dljyeq5,disability,,,,,
