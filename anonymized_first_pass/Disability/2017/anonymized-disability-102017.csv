0,You pretty much nailed it. I'm a little late to the party but been para for 3 years and after finding out that there was such a thing as someone who had a chair fetish I was just kind of put off. But your reasoning is surely sound. I have enough headache trying to convince people and sometimes even medical professionals that I'm not gonna lay around waiting to die. Or worry about something I find fun hurting me. It's amazing the people you pass day to day that you don't even know who (with all the best intentions) try to help out or keep you from injuring yourself.

6,"Ugh, sooooo annoys me that the cause of my son's congenital limb amputation has never been fully corrected.  The idiots who did not even see it in the first place in the womb just jumped to the first possibility without apparently knowing anything about how these injuries can occur to a fetus (except the one thing they did know).

Now it's forever on his record as an amniotic band injury, but actual experts have said it definitely is not.  It's just a random failure of his limb to form. I'm not sure what to even call that, to be honest... it's not drug related.  Sometimes if you are on a perfectly safe prescription when *not* pregnant it could cause a similar injury, but I wasn't.  So I guess idiopathic meromelia?

Anyhoo, I have said every time I visit his doc that the diagnosis is not correct.  They have an addendum noting this, but it's still the first thing you see in his visit records.  :(

I also have fought since he was born for a referral to OT and PT to get advice on how to proceed.  All of it totally ignored until recently.

I mean, if we're talking the example some people give in that thread of rando mostly abandoned second story office bathroom, then whatever who cares.

I go through periods of frustration at my abilities (eff expensive, uncomfortable splints and adaptive equipment, it's not the same anyway) and then sometimes periods of grief over my lost abilities and hobbies. All apparently common. Here's what I've found helpful in dealing with frustration:

Therapy. If nothing else, it's someone to vent to, no strings attached. At best, sometimes they have some darn good ideas and the validation is sometimes helpful too.

Giving able bodied friends a snap shot of the amount of planning I put into a simple activity (easy enough to slip into a conversation) and reveling in their surprised/stunned reaction.

Actually talking to a friend. I don't know about you, but I like to project super-competent, so sharing the burden with a friend's gets a real ""well shit dude"" that's super satisfying. And it's not even like they get to share the daily grind of trying and failing and falling and ugh, but it helps to have someone who knows the nitty gritty.

It's all more taking than I generally care for, but I find it helps to have people who understand how frustrating shit really is and get that reality check that I am in fact dealing with a lot and yet somehow still kicking.

39,"I really appreciate your insight! I was denied SSI and the website says SSDI is still as processing. I definitely have enough work credits, I worked full time for 20 years plus. I didn’t know what to do so since couldn’t sleep I stayed awake until 5am to check when the site reopened. No change. Then I slept from 6-9am when offices open. I called my DDS examiner and he said the same as you. So I then called the FO. Finally got to someone and she at first pulled up one screen that said I was medically approved and then she opened another screen in another system that said I was denied, so I really have no idea but I’m guessing it’s a denial. She was kind enough to mail me a copy of the letter so that I receive it quicker as the FO is in my town. Do you have any advice as to how to maximize the chances I could get approved at the reconsideration level? I was thinking I would not only get more records from doctors since the originals, but also letters of observation from family and longtime friends and former coworkers, along with copies of financial status (I’m filing bankruptcy soon). Is that a bad idea? Any other things I can do? Again, thank you for the help. Truly appreciate it so much. ����

124,"I'm chronically ill and disabled due to a genetic disease, and I've been w my bf for 3 years now. I've been in a wheelchair for over a year, and unable to eat or drink anything for almost a year. I think the hardest parts of a relationship when you're disabled are trying to get the other person to understand what you're going through, and trying to not weigh down that person w your problems. It comes down to having enough chemistry that you're not miserable together, and being able to communicate.  

We've gone through hard times where we weren't sure how our relationship would work, but we always concluded that we are happier together and breaking up would not fix the problem. Unfortunately, dating w a disability is just one of those things you can't plan. It's sort of like becoming a parent and learning as you go. There's no one way to have a successful relationship, either. 

I met my bf when I was 17. At the time, we all knew something was very wrong, but had no idea what. I'd been seeing all sorts of Drs since I was a baby, and nobody ever really came up w anything significant, until I was nearly 18. So my bf had to learn that I wasn't going to stay the person I was before I got severely ill. He takes me to appointments, drives hours to get me to them, sleeps over so my parents have a break from doing IV fluids and TPN. There are people out there willing to love you and also be a carer.",,,,chronicallyhangry,,,1508103019,t5_2qhe8,t3_76ka0w,t3_76ka0w,5,1509861383,0,0,doeyvew,disability,,,,,

Oh, so sometime who can walk is able bodied enough to use a regular stall? What if I'm using a cane, do I get a pass? Arthritis makes it hard for me to stand and sit without help. What if I'm not carrying my cane today? I just look like another person, because many disabilities are invisible. 

My take on this? If you see a person in a wheelchair, let them take precedent in line to get to that handicapped stall. If you don't see a person in a wheelchair, don't judge when someone goes to use the big stall *because people should not be judging eachother based on looks*. You don't know their life.

152,"Yes. All of the above.

At the checkouts, I'd add that it's a royal pain when the keypad for the credit card reader is pointed up and I can't read it because of the glare from looking at it from the side because it's mounted at my chin height.

Freezer doors that are sliding and that aren't a royal pain to keep open would be lovely. Like you said, it's hard for me to hold the door open, maneuver my chair into position, and then awkwardly reach into the freezer at the same time. It would be great if there were some sort of pin or switch that you could set so that the door would stay open and not hit you in the head when you were trying to reach in for your product. If there's a big freezer with a line of doors going into it, I have trouble with items that are stocked behind the posts in between the doors. 

At the checkouts, there are some stores that are designed for two lines of customers to move between two checkout counters that are on the outside. It's common to put a barrier down the middle that makes it impossible to get a wheelchair down either side. Just stop doing this, and/or consider having a bit more room in an accessible checkout aisle - and have the accessible checkout open all the time, as is required by law around here but not enforced.

It would be lovely to have some smaller baskets to take around the store. I find that the shopping baskets around here are wider than I remember and they're so wide, yet shallow, that I can't fit them on my lap. I also have trouble pushing a cart while driving my chair. Having a smaller, shorter cart that's easier to drive with one hand and/or a taller but skinnier basket to put on my lap would make life easier. I currently end up just carefully stacking items on my lap.

169,"Have you asked her why she is cancelling appointments, not using her chair and not trying to increase her mobility?  Does she give a reason, if the reason does not make sense do you push her on it.  I am not saying you should it really depends what type of person she is and what kind of relationship you have. Her actions do not match what she is is saying and the reason needs to be resolved. If she would go to counselling they would be the best placed to resolve this.  

Its possible she is not depressed however this does not automatically mean she is happy and motivated
Her previous diagnosis could be wrong, even specialist make mistakes. She may just feel helpless or she is just lacking self belief. If she always going to be in a chair now? What was her level of mobility before her back surgery. 

One interesting thing you say is she previously had an online job, has she always had disability or did she just choose to work from home though choice.  Before her disability was she a generally motivated person did she have a lot of get up and go? Was she also doing new things, going for walks and meeting friends.  Did she enjoy her job previously?

I am sorry it's quite hard to give direct help as it will be very dependent on who your sister is as a person and your relationship. 

If she was always doing a lot rushing about and was a very active person I may think she is feeling helpless as can not do things as easily and quickly as before. Everthing that used to be easy is now hard. The more challenges she overcomes the more new ones she will have to face and all of them were non issues before. Some people that seemed very motivated are just people that find things easy and they do not know what to do when things become hard. 

If previously she was very lazy and always had a reason not to do something I would think her disability has less to do with it and she is continuing her previous behaviour.  In this case a bit of pressure may be needed however if the issue was the above issue pressure could make the problem worse. 

If a lot of her enjoyment was from physical activities then depression could be a big issue as she would likely grieve the loss of things that she did that made her happy. 

I should definitely add I am only taking from personal experience and as such could give bad advice. I think getting her into counselling regularly would be a good idea.  

If you are close you could try and push her to give clearer reasoning if she does things that are clearly harming her recovery.  However a councillor may be a better person to do this as you may not want to risk harming your relationship.  I think if I was in your position (your feelings and wellbeing are important too) I would be start to be a bit more direct about calling her out on her possiblely self destructive actions. She has an excellent support network and yet is not doing as much as it appears she could to get better.

176,"&gt; Does she have anything else she can bring up medically ?

I'm not sure.  There's a laundry list of remaining conditions related to the original stroke.  She's recently been seeing a psychiatrist, but he honestly just seems to be chatting with her rather than investigating anything.  She also recently been seeing a physical therapist to treat muscular degeneration due to the stroke.  These two things are recent and were at the advice of legal aid.

&gt; This seems excessive, she should be on disability, they must think she can do substantial work ?

It does.  It almost seems like it is being judged by comparison to her initial application for disability.  After the first stroke in 2005, she could not walk, could barely speak, and required surgery and therapy on one eye.  Not to mention the bacterial endocarditis that caused the stroke and necessitated the replacement heart valve. 
 She still has no depth perception, notable weakness on one side, occasional bell's palsy, and poor control over her emotions.  In the denial, they felt the need to mention that she now ""reads books"" and ""goes for walks"" as if they were somehow justification.

&gt; I would get an attorney, lay everything out and reapply.

She's working with a retired lawyer that legal aid referred her to.  What worries me is that the guy is in his 80s.  I worry that he might be missing details.

&gt; How old is she now?

37, so no benefits from parents.  Her estranged mother is a piece of work anyway, in and out of jail, issues with drugs, and ironically has been on disability for a decade or longer, likely due to complications from drug use.  I'm honestly really curious if the relation has somehow been weighed against her.

&gt; I mean if she's not working she should be on Medicaid, unless she happen to live in one of those states that Medicaid didn't expand.

She was maintaining benefits through the appeal process, so she has to wait until her monthly income is nothing and medicare coverage is certified gone before applying for medicaid - at least that's what I believe needs to happen.

&gt; It's not that common for someone to be kicked off disability so there must be some reasoning behind this?

Your guess is as good as mine.

(Unless there's an unusual monetary situation, but people with disabilities are disproportionately poor and medicaid reimbursement is spotty.) So she's not so much ""taking advantage"" as she's being strategic to get her needs met.

For the night shifts, it sounds like you just want to get to bed by 11 and she expects you to be available to her past that time.  That's a difference in expectations that isn't going to go away. You can talk with her and negotiate - she may think that you've been trying to rush her and brush her off for selfish reasons. It may also be the case that you're not a compatable carer for those shifts. 

You're trying to get paid for the work you do. Which is fair. You shouldn't be asked to work off the clock. The thing to realize is that your client might not have any funds to pay for the care she needs.  You can politely explain your concerns; just be prepared for her to say, ""I just can't hire you in a way that's more convenient to you or pays more to you. Take it or leave it.""  That's her being reasonable to herself.

It carooms over the guardrail and into a parking lot, and smashes into a bunch of other parked cars. You're fine, nobody's hurt -- but the car is toast and the bad guy is getting away.

There's a small *pop pop* as the roof and windshield are blown out of the way with controlled detonations, and the radio chirps a sweet-sounding ""Goodbye."" Then the driver's seat is pulled forwards. It slides up over the engine, which has come detached from the vehicle, and the front wheels lock into place just behind you. Spring-loaded casters pop out in front, and pod-racing control levers shoot up out of the armrest.

Well that's another relief, and I can manage those two things. How did you go about learning their protocols? Did you just surf every page? How much do you think I can make with my typing speed and decent/proper software + foot pedal?


At what point did you transition to Upwork (how many months or assignments)?


How did you manage to sell yourself while letting them know of your health issues? 


I'm all ears (or eyes?) lol! Sorry for asking so many questions. 


It is definitely hard to find or keep motivation. Perhaps it is due to the way we're wired or something else. I've started things I haven't finished either, in an attempt to find that motivation i.e. playing an instrument or improving my drawing skills, DIY stuff, etc


Maybe making more money with the ability to do it on my own time at home will help a little. I don't leave the house much either and I know it's ridiculous but it's stressful cause I feel anxious, and then if I feel anxious = stress = catastrophizing the chronic pain that lingers. I agree... there's just no easy way.


I see. I don't really know how to describe how I feel about my situation. I still feel very humiliated/irritated/angry at my body and I'm working on accepting my situation but every fiber of my being absolutely detests my genetics and it takes a lot of work to just 'get over it'. I try and remind myself that I'm just being too obsessive (since my shallow criticism applies to other people as well) and that I'm not as terrible looking as I think I am... Or even if I do think that I'm 'ugly' then my way of accepting it now is, ""alright so that's what I think, so be it"".


If I do try and apply again I'll probably have to wait another year :/ but I guess there's no harm in registering anyways. Gotta push for a physical test this time...


Out of curiousity, how did you end up meeting your ex or exs'? I figured I'd remove dating/seeking any interaction with the opposite sex off the table cause of how embarrassed I feel about the situation I put myself in. My lack of activity limits the things I have to talk about so I distance myself from anybody who goes beyond surface-level chitchat...

If you go to the disability discharge website there is  form for your physician to fill out to verify that you are permanently disabled.  

Also, any SSDI eligibility would be based solely on your work history, so it would not matter how much your wife makes.  If your wife makes a decent income you will likely not qualify for SSI, but still apply for both.

265,"I had a very similar issue and I sympathize. It's hard to deal with because whatever you do, it involves interrupting the natural flow of greeting people. However, a strange handshake could be felt to be as bad. It's sort of a no-win situation that means you have to pick your poison.

One piece of advice I have is that if you are going to say something, it could help to have ready beforehand exactly what you are going to say and when. Formulate what you need to make it concise and clear what you want to the other person to know without embarrassing them. For instance, if you're willing to try the handshake so long as they know about your issue, make sure they'll understand that right away as otherwise they might panic and take back their hand. If you'd really rather not, you don't want them misinterpreting and grasping for your hand. Trial and error: try to see what works and what doesn't.

It is a tricky situation because handshakes are normally a formality that happens in a matter of seconds without really needing any thought, so I think it helps if you are ready with a different script when you have to stop the expected one. You'll have more experience than anyone else with the situation, so they'll probably be happy to follow your lead. I can't say I ever got used to it myself, though, so I'm not saying it's easy by any means.

Having a tube down your nose or your arse in a chair is in no way a positive for me. My body doesn't work the way it is supposed to. We don't pass a car's MOT when it doesn't work because it's 'differently abled.' We say it's broken. 

I'm broken. That's okay. I don't need to have a perfectly functioning body to be a good person and enjoy my life. And I don't need people to pretend I'm different rather than broken to make me feel better. I'd rather make the world adapt to help those of us with broken bits do anything we want. 

So yes I dislike them for me. If another individual wants me to call them differently abled, I will do so, but I will politely ask people not to do so for me.

He wasn't sure how'd he'd handle the tough times but he also didn't see much that affected him. We're both home bodies so me having to stay in most and now just about all the time didn't bother him. But there were tough times, times when I needed his assistance. It took awhile for him to learn when I needed his help, when I could manage myself and when I was doing too much. Mostly learning that if I ask for his help most of the time it's because I can't do it myself and I'm not being lazy.

As an examiner in another state, does this status ever mean anything concrete? I’ve read it can be an approval or a denial and I’ve read many that lean one way or the other. What can I do now? I know I’m never going to fall asleep tonight, my heart is racing. If I don’t see any updated status in the morning, should I call my DDS examiner? Is that bad? He left me a message about two weeks ago saying that he had everything needed and the claim was being reviewed. I’ve been consumed even more so since. Will he have any information for me? Is he even allowed to tell me? Should I call a local office? Any advice would be so appreciated. Thank you :-/

332,"Dear god, please wait. An airline dropped mine out of the side door of the massive jet I was on and completely destroyed my 8-month old chair.

I was doing the same thing, moving across several states, when it happened. I was supposed to have a direct flight. When I got to the airport, the plane they had me scheduled on couldn't accept my powerchair for some reason. So I got put on another plane, and went from a direct flight to one where I had to transfer planes at a different airport. I then watched three guys try to force it up the luggage loading conveyor belt with no supports at all to get it on my first flight.

When I got to the next airport, they had to transfer my chair from one plane to the other. I was flying on a much larger plane, and I was approached by some managers while waiting. I was told there was a delay because the cherry picker they use to transfer wheelchairs was being used somewhere else. I said they needed to wait then, but the manager tried to explain to me that it would be fine if they laid the luggage conveyor horizontally and lifted it up to meet the door. The luggage conveyor that has no sides, mind you. It was a terrible idea. I told them absolutely not to, that they would drop it and kill someone. Another manager comes up, pulls someone away, and I'm told that, okay, they won't do that. They'll wait, and I should just get on my flight, 

I'd been in my seat for maybe five minutes when I see the most terrified looking manager walking up the aisle toward me. It was one of those moments when you just know something terrible happened. She squatted down next to my seat and started to explain to me that they had in fact done what they told me they wouldn't. Apparently, while maneuvering the conveyor into place, someone moved my powerchair to the door of the luggage bay and let go/turned around. It was at that point that the chair rolled out of the door, and crashed the 30-ish feet down to the tarmac. They're lucky it didn't kill someone. Apparently it had happened while the managers were talking to me, which is why I was rushed away so suddenly and put on the plane. I guess they were drawing straws to see who had to tell me.

The chair was predictably destroyed. I was also very, very not happy, and had to sit through the rest of my flight with this.

I will say, though, that the airline was good about replacing it. It took 6 months or so, but they got me a decent loaner chair. They also didn't say ""no"" to anything I wanted on my new chair, so I wound up getting a tray &amp; hydration system that I didn't have previously. The chair was of course brand new.

346,"If you apply with a paper application, you can apply for SSDI and SSI simultaneously.  However, there is no way to apply for SSI online.  You can print the forms and fill them out at home, but you'll have to take them to your local SSA office.

SSI does not require any work history, but it also does not pay benefits retroactive to filing (whereas SSDI can pay for up to a year before filing if onset was that early), so you'll want to file as early as possible-which would be, now.  It's also worth noting that SSI is a fixed amount, likely less than a sufficient work history would grant via SSDI-but it certainly beats nothing.

Disability lawyers work on contingency, the amount of which is restricted by law to 25% of the post-filing yet pre-approval benefits.  As an example, if it takes two months post-filing to be denied, and your lawyer takes another four months to get your SSI approved, they are paid 1.5 months (25% of 6 months) worth of your benefits, out of what you are paid for that time period.  They don't get anything out of any subsequent benefit checks you get, so don't be afraid to use one if you wind up needing one.  That said, a lawyer is of minimal utility until you get your first denial (in this case, your first denial for SSI specifically).

I understand that can seem like a long time, and it is, but having a lawyer will expedite matters, and in the meantime, you should be eligible for temporary disability assistance.  That's on the order of about $180 per month for six months, and doesn't have to be repaid even if your disability claim is denied, so generally processes fairly quickly.",,,,AnomalousAlex,,,1508978863,t5_2qhe8,t3_78r909,t3_78r909,9,1510187694,0,0,dow80b3,disability,,,,,

350,"You say she is not depressed but I'm not sure why. Even if she seems like she is not she may be.  How long has she not been fully able bodied for?  A lot of people find it hard to be happy when they can not do as much as they would like.  Also online work depending on the kind of person you are could be soul destroying.  She seems to be resigning herself to being bed bound even though she could get around more.  It is possible she is happy doing this but more than possibly something else is going on. As another poster has suggested has she had any therapy.  I will not ignore the possibility she is taking advantage of your good will however it seems much more likely something else is going on.  

Edit: On a second reading a few more things stuck out for me 

&gt;My concern is, she doesn't want to push herself or want to be independent at all. She just lays in bed all day even though she can now get around on her wheelchair. 

You have said she does not want to be independent but why do you think that. Some people want things they feel unable to achieve this can lead to giving up due to fear of failure 

Also you then say. 
&gt;She constantly complains abt not being to support her kids.

This would surgest she wants to be independent but is not taking action. 

Also 
&gt;She is not depressed at all 

Unless you have considerable training in this area that is a very strong statement. I am sure you mean she does not seem depressed at all. 

You actions would surgest you are a very caring and supportive sister. Have you asked her why she is not pushing her self to be more independent?  She may need some ""pushing"" to be more independent but I think getting an understanding of why she is not pushing herself would be the first thing. As far as how to support her to be independent would depend on the person.

Why is your health getting worse? For me, it's a huge lack of activity, drinking &amp; smoking, lack of appetite... then it just kind of spirals from there on.


Welp. Gotta make another appointment with the family doc. 


Key word being probably, but I've come to the conclusion that ""I'm going to think what I'm going to think"" and leave it at that... although I still avoid taking pictures or being in front of cameras and have not taken a photo in years. I do know that confidence &amp; a likable, funny personality goes a long way. Though it is hard to develop a unique and likable personality though while still being ""you (me)"". I mentioned earlier that I'm quite shallow when it comes to physical attraction, so it's always been a struggle for me to break out of.


Oh, I am a guy! That's quite a relationship... but I can see where the problems arise from, which is why I never considered open relationships, I'd get way too jealous or maybe someone else would.

How did you get sick? Is it diagnosed at least?

5 year polyamorous relationship from meeting off a game? Well I suppose it's becoming more normal now to meet people over games. I can imagine how it would amplify drama.

I'm actually quite certain that even with our positions, it's pretty easy to find someone else (if you are willing to settle for someone who is desperate). The process of finding that person requires vulnerability, putting ourselves out there and possibly stating to the rest of the world what we do and we like. That's the hard part. I'm not willing to let people know what living situation I'm in so any interaction is limited to ""hey how's it going"". The other undesirable aspect of this is being in a relationship with someone who is willing to forgo a lot of things just to be with someone (at least for me).

I don't really have an ideal situation. There are lots of things I wouldn't mind doing, or would love to do with someone else. I think if you're willing to expose your limitations you would find someone, but the ones you do find might not be the ones you want to be in a relationship with.


Honestly it's almost impossible given the circumstances. ""Trying to stay sane"" isn't exactly something I like to share with others... but I try to focus on putting the ball back in their court by asking about their life and attempting to genuinely listen without asking for the sake of politeness. 


I do not have many words of encouragement, but It's quite possible that you will try again some day, and I probably will too...

So then, why did you bother to help with my questionnaire? I am very appreciate of the help and I apologize for replying a day - 2 days later. Sometimes I feel to flustered and then get stressed out thinking about how I should respond cause I'm currently procrastinating the starting of a ""job"". I know it's no excuse but I feel tired from just simply cleaning/maintaining my apartment and cooking.

- Height. Everything is up too high.

Some shops offset this by providing a personal shopper to reach things for you. I really don't like this as I want to do my shopping myself, take my time, look at the bargains etc. But going to find someone every time you need something up high is a pain. 

Could also be helped by putting light items up high. I'll risk pulling a box of powdered soup down on me, but I won't risk a can. Unfortunately shops place their items according to where the eye is drawn as it sells more, and they're unlikely to risk profits for a small number of disabled customers. 

On that, height at checkouts. A lot of places have a checkout of two that is lowered for wheelchair users or little people. But they're never open. I know you will pack my bag for me. But I want to do it myself. PIN machines that don't remove from the bracket are also a nightmare to reach. 

* Self checkouts

If a shop has nothing but self checkouts on, I leave. They're awful. I struggle to stretch across to the screen and they shout at me for being too slow. On some designs I have to reach over again to use cash or card - contactless has taken a lot of pain out of shopping for me.

When I shop I normally put items directly into my rucksack on the back of my chair. Can't do that in a self checkout, because it needs to weigh them. There is also far less space. 

Some are better than others. In the UK, Morrisons checkouts are far superior to Tesco - they're a little smaller, have the coin slot right in front of you, and screen is easier to use. 

* Freezers

Chest freezers are just a no unless they're full to the top with product. Cupboard freezers are difficult if the door opens out the way, as I have to grab the handle, move back, and get round the door to get product before it swings shut. Sliding doors are awesome! If the shelves are set back from the freezer that's difficult again.

A few comments about disability reviews:

They need to be reviews, not all or nothing (""accessible - yes""). We are all different; what is accessible to one may not be to another.

The should be separate from the other reviews so that if there are one or two accessibility reviews they don't get lost in all the food reviews.

Some reviews may describe bathroom accessibility. Again, reviews should keep mind that we are different. I need to be able to transfer sideways my chair to the toilet, so there must be space beside the toilet for me to back in. Others can stand (with grab bars) - men prefer to do so if they can. Some approach the toilet from the front, stand to turn around, and then sit. People who walk to the bathroom (with a walker or cane) may prefer a smaller stall with walls to lean against. Some of us need larger.

Lack of an accessible bathroom does not make a restaurant inaccessible. I don't care that the diner near my apartment has an inaccessible (and unclean) bathroom: I go from home to there and back.

If it is not a regular (salaried) amount, they may require a frequent reporting of your income.  If you go over $1170 they can completely stop your benefits.

SSI has different rules. You can make up to a certain amount with no problemb thst amount is currently $85.  Above that, your SSI payment is reduced by $1 for every $2 earned.

So, if you earn $200/month on SSDI  you just report it to the SSA (and the IRS), and that's that.

Edit : To put it another way if she feels unable to cope now putting too much pressure on could have a very negative affect. I think some of what she has said support the she feels like she would not cope.   She seems to feel guilty she can not support her kids. If she was taking advantage she would feel guilty that her sister is having to support her kids.

471,"Blah. Sorry for making you think of all that :/

I kind of understand the scary aspect of it though. For me, my entire genital area is under constant discomfort or pain and it moves around quite frequently with the symptoms changing with no detectable pattern or cause. Not having an actual diagnosis, solution &amp; having health deteriorate is... quite annoying &amp; very stressful.

I think it's 'okay' not to expect much... trying to push ourselves to be optimistic can be unreasonable at times.

Couldn't the same be said for monogamous relationships too? I suppose it would be less-likely to have as much drama or conflict since the relationship is between 2 people... but unfortunately I've seen so many people fail because they have unrealistic expectations or they're blinded by lust &amp; desperation.

Yeah, I agree. That also applies to ourselves I think. That's why I try to avoid making promises that most people tend to break. ""We'll see where things go"" is an attitude that I have adopted. I'm pretty sure we all suck at screening other people and ourselves. 

Have you ever tried just hanging out with people or someone at home to watch Netflix, play some MarioKart, etc, just as friends?

I have the opposite problem, kinda. I don't have much going for me, I know I have insecurity issues, I don't feel or look as healthy as I want to be, I would really want someone in my life to hang out with and improve together, even if we were just friends... but I'm also too scared to put myself out there and whenever a relationship might have developed, I backed out. I feel like I would be the bad guy for the other person.

I think the hang-out option is better. Whenever people search for relationships or love, I find that they almost always never find it. ""The more you squeeze, the more it slips away"". It is very rare for two compatible people to meet-up online or through friends or at a bar and then 'click'. 

Err... my bad. It's equivalent exchange. :)

And I hope I'm not making you feel inclined to do so. I sort of understand the sentiment here too... except when someone judges me harshly or negatively, I reflect and think, ""I'm already my own harshest critic"".

I didn't mean to say that you were, just to say that I am trying to keep myself sane as well. It takes a mountain of effort to look in the mirror, tell myself I look okay and then walk away... so when I'm feeling pain/humiliating symptoms down 'there', then it does drive me nuts, quite literally.

I see. Well thank you for sharing your information &amp; experiences that will save me some time, effort &amp; energy! Don't worry, I do not think you're being bitter at all. I mean, my roommate left last month on 'okay' terms but left garbage he didn't want to get rid of behind &amp; had a girlfriend that constantly stayed over everyday for over half a year, rent-free, everything free... and I have petty thoughts of, ""dammit roommate, I hope you mess up!"" but then I realize that I'm being petty and shouldn't wish such things.

They are long! I think it's easier to have a face-to-face discussion cause it doesn't take as much energy to read and imagine body language/tone of voice, etc. 

Well, regardless of whether or not it's worth it to me, it's something that has to be done... being on disability probably contributes to the embarrassment and humiliation I feel. Maybe I'll feel better about working now than I did before, since my goals and mindset have changed.

Yes... it is ironic though. I am so much more grateful for the home-cooked dinners I had, the parental maintenance of a home, etc.

When I apply, I need a resume *and* cover letter, or just the resume? Cause I have a ridiculously tough time trying to come up with a proper &amp; fluffy yet realistic CV.

A couple of pain specialists I went to see didn't like that I suggested we look into medical marijuana and became very aggressive and decided not to help. It was pretty rough. When I checked my records later they had ""diagnosed"" me with histrionic and borderline personality disorder. At no point had we discussed either, when we did discuss mental health they dismissed PTSD because I didn't physically see my traumatic memories (this was the only criteria he brought up). I've been trying to see a psychologist to get these sorted out (I have social anxiety so histrionic is laughable, I don't think I fit the criteria for borderline and I probably have CPTSD) for YEARS, but the mental health system here is appalling, so that's just going to sit there for all my doctors to read and these ""diagnoses"" come with stigmas. 

There's also marijuana dependency in my records because I wanted to use it to help with my pain. So that's in there forever.

There were also a bunch of minor things where the doctor clearly wasn't listening or didn't care.

God knows what other horseshit's in there now. At the very least there's something from cardio saying I'm not really sick. I'll be ordering my records again soon because I'll probably need to them during the complaint process against the cardio specialist I'm going through.

521,"Not that it matters, but I'm not with SSA. I've represented many clients and put in many years with a firm which represents people at the Initial Application and Reconsideration levels as well as Hearing. We do win cases at those initial levels, but I certainly didn't think our firm's ability to fax paperwork or send appeals by certified mail (in the pre-internet filing days) at those early levels always justified our fee.

I agree with your point that people who are limited in their ability to participate in the application process due to their impairments should obtain help - that's why I mentioned getting a trusted and organized friend or family member. If they would feel better going with an attorney from day one, that's their prerogative; again, I just don't think that's necessarily worth the attorney's fee, especially if they had the sort of profile or impairment which would be likely to actually result in a grant at IA/Recon. 

As for your hypothetical on why the approval rate is so much higher at the hearing level, while it's easy to blame incompetence, I think it's much more nuanced than that. ALJs, for one, often are seeing a vastly more developed record. Heck, I'd be hard pressed to grant most clients under 50 based upon the information usually available to DDS at the IA level. 

Some of the risks/case damage examples you bring up can be rectified even if an attorney is retained later, and such errors aren't necessarily avoided by having an attorney at the IA/Recon levels. For example, even if all documents get in on time, maybe the claimant overstated their ADLs or minimized the physical demands of their past work. That can be clarified and isn't necessarily irreparable. The long inpatient stays you mention can be obtained and submitted as (likely fairly decent) evidence. Since retro pay is an option, a delay caused by something like an inpatient stay would be frustrating but wouldn't necessarily result in loss of benefits. 

Long story short, I think we basically agree with each other on the fact that the disability process shouldn't be done alone, and that competent help is essential. :)",,,,Hanford,,,1508905166,t5_2qhe8,t3_78echa,t1_doujd7h,1,1510160105,0,0,douqv39,disability,,,,,

523,"I'm not the person you replied to, but I'm a person who represents people applying for disability and can maybe clarify a couple of things. 

You can't apply for SSI online so I'm guessing you only applied for SSD. 

An asset limit is basically your money/stuff and how much it's worth. It sounds like you are under the $2,000 limit. 

If you were to be awarded benefits, would the person you live with expect repayment? If so, have them put that in writing as that can be taken into consideration when your SSI benefits are calculated. 

You can qualify for SSI even if you've never worked. However, keep in mind that the burden is on you to show that you're disabled and unable to do ANY fulltime work. So while I know you are having financial issues with medications and doctor's appointments, it's very very important that you try to keep up with those as much as you can. 

If some of that part-time work you mentioned is recent, it's possible that it could get added to your earnings record later and give you enough credits to qualify for SSD. Even if this is done though, the SSD amount is calculated based upon your historical earnings; since you're so young and some of your work is part-time, the SSD amount is probably pretty low. I assume you made an online account with Social Security when you filed your application; if so, you should be able to see your earnings record/a statement documenting the number of credits you have. Review that and make sure all of your earnings are accounted for. ",,,,Hanford,,,1508989770,t5_2qhe8,t3_78r909,t1_dow4amk,3,1510192321,0,0,dowh1c9,disability,,,,,
524,"Most cases are denied initially, especially for those under age 50. The standard of disability for a person under 50 is the inability to perform ANY fulltime work.

Think of the simplest job you can - like a basic assembly job - and keep in mind that if you can do even that job, you're not disabled according to Social Security. 

As others said, appeal the denial. Make sure Social Security obtained all of your medical records. Keep treating with your doctors and comply with all of their instructions - I see a lot of mental health claims denied because of noncompliance.

525,"As a rep who both performs hearings and drafts briefs at the federal court level, some comments:

1. Based on the several firms I've worked with, your lawyer is correct in that not many cases are appealed to federal court. That usually requires both decent medical evidence AND serious errors in the hearing decision. So I would find it encouraging that she wants to appeal it. 

2. Appealing is almost always a better idea than filing a new application. If you stop appealing the old one and file a new one, the judge's decision from your hearing becomes final and binding and you lose any chance to claim any benefits prior to the date of the judge's decision. The decision can also make it harder to win on new applications. 

3. Usually, you can only have one application pending at a time. But (unless something has changed recently), you should be able to file a new application while your case is pending in federal court. Your onset date of disability on the new application will have to be the day after the judge's decision on your older case. 

4. You certainly have the right to look for a new attorney - I recommend consulting your local bar association. However, from my experience, the further along your case is, the harder it can be to find someone willing to take it because they weren't there to develop it from step one. If you want to find a new attorney, you can contact the disability office where you had your hearing (it's called the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review, or ""ODAR"") for a copy of your ""exhibit file"" - this is basically all of the evidence Social Security currently has. Take this and a copy of the denial letter from the judge (not the Appeals Council) to any attorneys you consult with, as that's what they'll want to see. A good attorney should be able to review these materials and roughly explain what they think about your case and the arguments that they plan to make in federal court, such as ""The judge rejected this statement from your doctor, but the reasons he gave are insufficient."" 

5. For the advice in #4, ask your current attorney some of the same questions - like what arguments she wants to make in federal court. Nothing you have said so far raises giant red flags for me about your attorney. Sometimes judges are very thorough in hearings, so maybe there was a reason she didn't ask a lot of questions. As for third parties, they carry very little weight compared to what your doctors/medical records say. I never allow spouses/friends to testify because sometimes they will inadvertently say things which weaken the case. Plus, bad judges only use third-party testimony to find inconsistencies. That said, I wasn't at your hearing, so I'm not saying your attorney was correct, just that there may have been a strategy behind her actions. The best way to figure that out would be to talk to her.

As for my German Shepherd.. She's my angel but I think it is best for her to be with my brother who has a large yard and will build a fence so she can lay outside all day.

542,"That's a good typing speed and accuracy! Mine is similar but I think you're faster. When you're doing transcription, you will have to be sure to fix your mistakes, but that's fine. I wasn't doing transcription for long enough to bother, but there are foot pedals and software that make it easier to pause the recording, go back, etc so that you can maintain your speed.

Yes, by good English I meant either a native speaker or fluent, so you are fine. 

So if you are freelance, your exact resume doesn't matter much, your disability doesn't matter much, and your sleep schedule doesn't matter much. Here's what people care about: 

* Is the work done well? Good accuracy, annotations if the audio was unclear, and so on.

* Is the work done on time? Deadlines will vary, but you'll know what they are before you take a job on, so you can gauge what you're able to handle.

That's it. So basically what I did was gotranscript.com for a few weeks to learn proper transcription protocols. You do have to learn their rules really well, because every job you do will be checked and if you get rated poorly I think they stop giving you work. The rules are a little complicated but it's good to get the free training. The pay is awful though, it works out to a few dollars an hour with my typing speed (with no software or foot pedal).

Then after GoTranscript, I said I was ""experienced in transcription"" when applying to Upwork assignments (possibly a little misleading but I knew I could do the work with no problems). 

Upwork has a range of jobs. From one-time jobs that only take an hour to ongoing jobs that need you every day on a set schedule. And everything in between. Just don't agree to work with someone who needs you to work a schedule that isn't realistic for you. 

It will be helpful to start out with small jobs and assess what you can handle. For me, my health fluctuates; some days are worse than others. So if I'm working with someone who may be impacted if I'm having a bad day, someone who needs me on a regular basis, I do let them know about my health situation. It was practically the first thing out of my mouth in the interview I had with my current job, because they were wondering why I was freelancing instead of working in chemistry. I don't dance around it if they want to know. That job is a 20-25 hour a week job, so it's more relevant to them. I have had sick days where I had to pause their work, and they have been very understanding. 

However, for smaller jobs, nobody even asks why I'm freelancing. They often don't even ask about prior experience; instead, they give you a small job as a test to see if you can do the work. If you can, then that's all they care about.

My favorite type of transcription is podcasts. The audio is clear and the material is intended to be informational or entertaining or a combination. The GoTranscript jobs tended to be more boring and difficult to transcribe. If I hadn't found the job I did, my plan was to increase my services for podcasters - learn audio editing, write their blog posts, etc. Then expand into YouTubers, video editing etc. If you go on Upwork you'll see some podcasters and YouTubers asking for a bunch of services like this together so they don't have to hire multiple people. People who actually have money to pay a freelancer are usually podcasting or vlogging for their business.

You can also use transcription to lead into more virtual assistant type work if you get bored of transcribing all the time. You can do different things for different clients if you want variety. It's flexible. 

Remember I mentioned that people charge a few hundred dollars to teach you how to do transcription? [This](https://transcribeanywhere.com/) is one example. Even though the course is not worth it imo, I still like the site for their blog. They have information about how to find clients (outside of Upwork or freelance sites), what kind of clients need transcription, how to market yourself, etc. You don't have to stick to a freelance site, it's just an easier way to get up and running. I do think their paid course has more detail about finding clients outside of freelance sites.

You do have to be able to talk yourself up a little to get your foot in the door. If you do decide to go the Upwork route let me know, I can explain a method I used to apply to jobs quickly after they're posted which I think helped quite a bit.

Again, I have so much more to say on the job stuff! 

Motivation is hard. In my free time, I start a lot of things that I never finish: online classes, learning a new hobby, learning to program. Somehow just making a little bit of money adds that motivation for me. I think when I hit an obstacle in my own hobbies, I just stop doing that thing. But if it's something I'm responsible for, that someone else is depending on me, I have to push through and figure it out. Or ask for help if I really can't figure it out.

But yes, it's hard to figure out your purpose when your life has no structure to it, no school or job. Maybe barely leaving the house (I am definitely in this boat). This is what's been working for me, but it might not be what works for you. But I don't think you can accomplish great things without working hard at them, for a long time, whether it's a script or a video game or changing the world for the better. Those things don't come easy. People who really make a difference, in any area, dedicate themselves to that thing. Maybe not for their whole lives, but it's not for a week or a month.

I don't particularly feel the need to accomplish something great. I'm just miserable when I'm doing nothing. Accomplishments are nice, money is nice, but I'm not in it for those things. I'm just trying to stay sane.

I mention the narcolepsy thing just because there is medicine that can really help like Provigil. However I think they generally need a full sleep study to justify the prescription.

544,"Yes, I'm sure there are explanations included with the foot pedals. There is free software out there [like this one](http://www.nch.com.au/scribe/index.html), although I haven't tried it. I've found other places on reddit where there are people more experience with transcription, like r/WorkOnline, where you can ask questions like what software to use, what pedal, etc. 

When you apply to GoTranscript, they send you guidelines to follow and a test job. I read them thoroughly and took notes. As I worked, I would get feedback from their editors, and add those onto my notes so that I wouldn't make the same mistake again.

There are other sites out there, also. I had also looked at transcribeme.com and rev.com. 

Honestly, I was only on GoTranscript for 2 or 3 weeks. The pay is pretty terrible, like $2 or $3 an hour for me. Having a foot pedal and software would have helped with the speed but it would've been difficult to hit $5/hr.   You are faster than me so it'll be a little better than that. 

So that's why I think of GoTranscript like training. You learn how to do it and get feedback on your work. It's very valuable that way. But if you're a quick learner you don't need to stay there for very long, in my opinion. 

My first several jobs, I didn't even need to let them know about my health issues. If a job is less than an hour of work per day, on my laptop, I can usually manage that even if I'm very ill. So they simply don't need to know unless they're giving me quite a bit of work. 

So you sell yourself by talking about what makes you qualified for that job. For transcription, it's mostly about accuracy and the ability to deliver on time. Having experience in transcription and knowing what a transcript should look like. Actually, there are different types of transcripts. On GoTranscript, they have two types:

* Full verbatim - including stutters, ""um"", ""ah"", basically ever single sound that comes out of their mouth

* Clean verbatim - removing those extra things

But honestly on Upwork, some people want it cleaned up even more than that. Sometimes they want it to read well, like a natural piece of writing, so they can have it on their website or whatever. So for those kind of clients, you need to be able to edit the writing, too.

So this is why it helps to have experience. You can ask people what style they want (sometimes they have prior examples that they can show you, this is always awesome). 

For my current job, I did rely on my past work experience to sell myself. Having a PhD does come in handy from time to time! But in reality I could be doing this job without all of that; I probably would have needed to get some more writing experience and virtual assistant experience first (both of which you can do on Upwork if you ever want to branch out). 

Ah yes, acceptance. I have found chronic illness to be a massive lesson in acceptance. I can't say I'm never frustrated, but mostly I just worry about the future. My health keeps getting worse, and I'm already at the point where it would be very difficult for me to live independently. So I'm afraid of what it will be like in five or ten years.

Even if you have to wait a year, narcolepsy meds would be worth the wait. If that's what you have, it's a lifelong condition, so it could improve your quality of life for years and years to come. But yes, sometimes you do have to push doctors for the proper tests and treatments!

You probably are not as terrible looking as you think you are. Most people under-rate themselves rather than over-rate themselves. But honestly, confidence and personality are a really big factor in how attractive someone is. I personally am more attracted to people based on personality than how they look; I become attracted to how they look because I like them as a person. 

My relationship history is... interesting. I'm a woman, by the way. My last relationship was polyamorous. I was dating a married woman (with the consent of her husband). Eventually her husband and I started having feelings for each other, so it was all three of us together for about five years. 

But those relationships started when I was just starting to get sick. I was a lot healthier then. I might have some bad days but it was nothing like it is now. I lived by myself, had a car and a job, etc. My health is a big part of why that relationship ended. But it also ended just because polyamory is hard and my gf wasn't dealing well.

As for how we met, that's complicated too! The short story is online gaming, but the long story involves a prior marriage, more polyamory, and much drama. Polyamory equals drama.

I don't know how much I can date with my health how it is now. I'm still getting over my ex basically, so I'm not really interested in dating right now. But it will be very difficult to date since it's hard for me to do a lot of stuff out of the house. My ideal situation would be someone who's happy to stay in on a Friday night and curl up with Netflix or play MarioKart or board games. I have no idea if I'll ever find that, it's kind of a lot to ask someone to accept all the limitations that I have.

But yeah, I hear you about not having much to talk about. Like, I love my job, and I would totally just talk about work, but most people think that's boring. It worked well when I was in science and had scientist friends.

545,"Well, I have either Lyme disease or chronic fatigue syndrome, depending which doctor you ask. I did Lyme treatment for about three years but I wasn't seeing much improvement by that point. It got really expensive because insurance doesn't cover it, so eventually I stopped. I've been out of treatment for three years now.

I don't know exactly why my health is getting worse. I might have active Lyme bacteria in my body, or another tick-borne disease, or it could be deconditioning. Or a combination. It's hard to say. But it's pretty freakin scary. And nobody seems to be able to help. Most doctors have no idea what to do with me. Lyme doctors want to keep putting me on one expensive treatment after another. But even they start to run out of ideas eventually.

I am going to actually try some herbs and supplements I was recommended, mostly as a ""why not?"" But I've been on enough of that type of thing to not expect much.

Yeah, I don't want to be too down on polyamory as a whole, because there are people out there who make it work, but there are also a lot of people who try really hard to make it work and ultimately fail. Sometimes causing a lot of damage in the process.

What I'm learning is that you can't just take someone at their word when they're saying the things you want to hear, you have to wait and see how they actually handle the relationship. And everyone is on their best behavior in the beginning, and at the same time you're wearing your own rose-colored glasses, so by the time all the messiness comes out you're really in love and invested. I suck at screening, and I suck at holding back feelings and waiting to get invested.

That's why I'm worried about putting myself out there at this point. I have a track record of getting in too deep with people who ultimately turn out to be bad for me. And I worry that in my current circumstances, my dating pool would have more people who are bad for me than people who are good for me. 

It's not so much about the physical appearance or the income level or that kind of thing, it's more about ""is this person capable of being in a healthy relationship?"" I'd rather be alone than in a crap relationship or abusive relationship. I can't afford to get into a live-in situation in an abusive relationship, that's for sure. I'm too vulnerable, I'm not physically able to move out without help. 

So I could go for a hang-out-on-Fridays relationship but not necessarily a fall-in-love-forever relationship. My guard is just way too high from being burned too bad, by people who used to love me and then decided one day that they didn't. And from being so sick that I can't let myself to get into a situation that I wouldn't be able to get out of.

Now I'm just depressing myself, lol. Sorry to vent all this on you, I've just been thinking about these things a lot.

I don't particularly care about disclosing my living situation. I worked my ass off through my 20s and I'm here through no fault of my own except possibly my inability to identify a black speck that was attached to my leg for three days. So anyone who judges me for my circumstances either doesn't know the whole story, or is not the kind of person I would want to be around anyway.

I didn't mean it to sound like I'm on the verge of going insane, lol. I have a tendency to hyperbolize. But I'm unhappy when I'm bored and unproductive, so working is saving me from depression. *Especially* post-breakup. It was great to have work to throw myself into.

Honestly, I answered your questions because I happened to be on this sub and it's a topic I care about, people with disabilities being able to find a way to work if they want to. It's so hard to get started with a work-from-home career if you have no experience and no one to help guide you. I was looking for ways to work from home when I first got out of grad school but I was focused on finding something related to my degree, which is virtually impossible. I couldn't figure out how to work from home, so I gave up for a good while. 

So it took me a while to figure out all this stuff I'm telling you. I had given up. I wasn't working for two years. I would have been a lot happier those two years, being both in a relationship and being able to work.

Slightly ironic that the breakup happened just after I started to work again. More ironic that the money would have really helped out my exes if we had stayed together. 

... I swear I'm not bitter!

No worries about the delays, these are looong messages and sometimes it takes time to find the time or energy. 

Don't get too stressed out! I am no stranger to procrastination. I procrastinate ten times more when it's something unfamiliar or that I don't feel like I know what I'm doing. 

For me, working is so worth it, but I know it's not like that for everybody. And there isn't anything wrong with that. 

And, I can't even manage to cook every day or maintain my own place. So I hear you on that. It is legitimately exhausting.

But if you do want to go for it, just take it one step at a time. 

Step 1: Apply on one of the transcription sites. You don't even need to buy the pedal or get software to get started, you can do that stuff if you stick with it. 

Step 2: Wait a few days. If they accept you, follow through on their instructions. If they don't, try another site.

546,"Sorry to hear about your pain issues! That sounds really uncomfortable, and very distressing. It's so very frustrating to be having symptoms like that with no diagnosis.

Yes, I totally meant most of that stuff about relationships in general. I've spent more time in monogamous relationships than poly, and basically have always had those kinds of problems. At this point in my life I'm kind of looking back at all my failed relationships. I feel like I've learned more and more each time, and if I was healthy I'd probably keep improving with each relationship. But I'm a slow learner, I'd probably be dead before I really got it right. :)

That's the thing, I don't really have friends here. I've moved long-distance twice in the past few years, and I don't know anyone in this area other than family. A lot of the things people do to make new friends in a new area are fairly exhausting for me, like meetups or whatever, so I haven't done much of that at all. 

And I've been kind of a hot mess emotionally, I'm just starting to pull myself out of all of that. So I haven't been in a great space to meet new people. When I'm a mess inside, and just trying to pretend to be normal to the outside world, I'm kind of closed off. But it is getting better, so I should make an effort soon.

Yeah, it sucks to get judged, especially when you're doing the best you can with the hand you've been dealt. It's never a fun experience. I guess I just try to limit my exposure to those kinds of people. I am probably my own harshest critic too, though.

When you're getting started with working, there will be a certain amount that you can make per month before your disability is effected. I don't know the exact amount but I recall it being in the neighborhood of $700. That's just something to keep in mind. I don't get SSDI or SSI or anything so it doesn't effect me.

I honestly don't recall the application process! I just remember there being a test job. If they do require a resume or cover letter then of course do your best, but don't stress out too much, because they will care more about your performance on the test job than anything else. With these kinds of jobs it's mostly a question of whether you can do the work, which is why test jobs are common.

577,"Congress wants to make Americans with disabilities second-class citizens again  
By Tammy Duckworth  
Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat, represents Illinois in the U.S. Senate.

On May 28, 1988, Lisa Carl went to her local movie theater, something millions of Americans can do with ease and comfort. Yet when Lisa tried to go into the theater, the manager refused her ticket, denying her entry because Lisa had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair. When an advocate called the theater owner about the incident, the manager coldly stated, “I don’t want her in here, and I don’t have to let her in.”

Lisa later testified before Congress, “I was not crying on the outside, but I was crying on the inside. I just wanted to watch the movie like everyone else.” While the cruelty is heartbreaking, the true outrage was that in 1988, the law actually sided with the theater owner, who was free to legally discriminate against Lisa and deny her access to a public theater because she was born with a disability.

Fortunately, millions of Americans with disabilities and their families refused to accept this discrimination. They shared their stories and pushed and prodded a bipartisan coalition of legislators to end decades of legally sanctioned discrimination through passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.

At the signing ceremony, President George H.W. Bush noted that before the ADA, “tragically, for too many Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied. The Civil Rights Act of ’64 took a bold step towards righting that wrong. But the stark fact remained that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination, and this was intolerable.” Bush declared, “Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.”

Decades later, the forces of discrimination are working hard to rebuild that wall. Led by the hospitality and retail industries, special interests want to shift the burden of ADA compliance away from business owners and onto individuals with disabilities. They’re backing a bill that has already passed the House Judiciary Committee, the so-called ADA Education and Reform Act, which would reward businesses that fail to comply with the law. The bill would allow businesses to wait until they are notified of their failure to meet legal obligations before they even have to start removing barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities from leading independent lives.

This offensive legislation would segregate the disability community, making it the only protected class under civil rights law that must rely on “education” — rather than strong enforcement — to guarantee access to public spaces. As the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force and other civil rights organizations wrote in opposing this bill, “We know of no other law that outlaws discrimination but permits entities to discriminate with impunity until victims experience that discrimination and educate the entities perpetrating it about their obligations not to discriminate.”

For decades, from enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through passage of the ADA, Congress has worked to enshrine the principle in law that no American should be denied access to a public space because of who they are, be it their race, nationality, religion, gender or disability. The ADA Education and Reform Act betrays this bipartisan legacy.

Businesses have had 27 years to comply with the ADA public-access protections. Yet rather than investing time and energy to achieve this goal, they are waging a propaganda campaign to convince Congress that their own lack of accessibility isn’t the problem — so-called drive-by lawsuits are. Notably, supporters of the ADA Education and Reform Act often do not dispute that they are violating the law. Rather, they simply resent being sued for what they believe are “minor” ADA infractions.

Ever since I lost my legs when an RPG tore through the cockpit of the Black Hawk helicopter I was flying over Iraq, getting around has been difficult. I can’t always enter restaurants or other public spaces. I have to spend a lot of time planning how to get from one place to the next.

An incline that is a few degrees too steep or an entrance that is a few inches off the ground can determine whether I am able to access an area without assistance. Being unable to independently enter a movie theater, store, hotel or restaurant is not only humiliating, it limits the freedom to pursue certain jobs, to access necessary services and to enjoy basic conveniences that most Americans don’t think twice about.

I understand that not everyone thinks about these things because, for most of my adult life, I didn’t either. But the truth is that everyone, whether they realize it or not, is just one bad day away from needing accessible options to help them get around their community.

While I understand people might not think of some ADA violations as significant at first glance, I can assure you they are more significant for those of us with disabilities than you know.

If Congress passed this misguided legislation, it would send a disgraceful message to Americans with disabilities that their civil rights are not worthy of strong enforcement. It is not too late to defeat this dangerous legislation and keep every American living with a disability from becoming a second-class citizen.

On May 28, 1988, <PERSON> went to her local movie theater, something millions of Americans can do with ease and comfort. Yet when <PERSON> tried to go into the theater, the manager refused her ticket, denying her entry because <PERSON> had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair. When an advocate called the theater owner about the incident, the manager coldly stated, “I don’t want her in here, and I don’t have to let her in.”

Lisa later testified before Congress, “I was not crying on the outside, but I was crying on the inside. I just wanted to watch the movie like everyone else.” While the cruelty is heartbreaking, the true outrage was that in 1988, the law actually sided with the theater owner, who was free to legally discriminate against <PERSON> and deny her access to a public theater because she was born with a disability.

Fortunately, millions of Americans with disabilities and their families refused to accept this discrimination. They shared their stories and pushed and prodded a bipartisan coalition of legislators to end decades of legally sanctioned discrimination through passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.

At the signing ceremony, President <PERSON> noted that before the ADA, “tragically, for too many Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied. The Civil Rights Act of ’64 took a bold step towards righting that wrong. But the stark fact remained that people with disabilities were still victims of segregation and discrimination, and this was intolerable.” <PERSON> declared, “Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.”

Decades later, the forces of discrimination are working hard to rebuild that wall. Led by the hospitality and retail industries, special interests want to shift the burden of ADA compliance away from business owners and onto individuals with disabilities. They’re backing a bill that has already passed the House Judiciary Committee, the so-called ADA Education and Reform Act, which would reward businesses that fail to comply with the law. The bill would allow businesses to wait until they are notified of their failure to meet legal obligations before they even have to start removing barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities from leading independent lives.

This offensive legislation would segregate the disability community, making it the only protected class under civil rights law that must rely on “education” — rather than strong enforcement — to guarantee access to public spaces. As the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force and other civil rights organizations wrote in opposing this bill, “We know of no other law that outlaws discrimination but permits entities to discriminate with impunity until victims experience that discrimination and educate the entities perpetrating it about their obligations not to discriminate.”

For decades, from enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through passage of the ADA, Congress has worked to enshrine the principle in law that no American should be denied access to a public space because of who they are, be it their race, nationality, religion, gender or disability. The ADA Education and Reform Act betrays this bipartisan legacy.

Businesses have had 27 years to comply with the ADA public-access protections. Yet rather than investing time and energy to achieve this goal, they are waging a propaganda campaign to convince Congress that their own lack of accessibility isn’t the problem — so-called drive-by lawsuits are. Notably, supporters of the ADA Education and Reform Act often do not dispute that they are violating the law. Rather, they simply resent being sued for what they believe are “minor” ADA infractions.

Ever since I lost my legs when an RPG tore through the cockpit of the Black Hawk helicopter I was flying over <LOCATION>, getting around has been difficult. I can’t always enter restaurants or other public spaces. I have to spend a lot of time planning how to get from one place to the next.

An incline that is a few degrees too steep or an entrance that is a few inches off the ground can determine whether I am able to access an area without assistance. Being unable to independently enter a movie theater, store, hotel or restaurant is not only humiliating, it limits the freedom to pursue certain jobs, to access necessary services and to enjoy basic conveniences that most Americans don’t think twice about.

I understand that not everyone thinks about these things because, for most of my adult life, I didn’t either. But the truth is that everyone, whether they realize it or not, is just one bad day away from needing accessible options to help them get around their community.

While I understand people might not think of some ADA violations as significant at first glance, I can assure you they are more significant for those of us with disabilities than you know.

If Congress passed this misguided legislation, it would send a disgraceful message to Americans with disabilities that their civil rights are not worthy of strong enforcement. It is not too late to defeat this dangerous legislation and keep every American living with a disability from becoming a second-class citizen.

I tend to hear ""wow, I'm amazed at how positive you are, If I had your condition, I would have killed myself"" a lot, and it strikes me the same way that inspiration-porn strikes me.

Like, Ok, That doesn't help me on the days I *do* feel suicidal, because lets be honest, Chronic illness and Chronic pain takes a mental toll, and some of us to think about it sometimes. To imply I don't think about killing myself is to imply you think you know me, and know how I think. Maybe I have never considered it, but how does this person know that?

But on top of that, I'm human, I have to cope with the hand i've been dealt or what else am I going to do? I'm not amazing for not killing myself, I know so many people with my illness who *have* killed themselves and they were amazing too! their choice to have a controlled death does not make them less strong, less positive about the life they had.

I've had physiotherapists try to inspire me to do well in my physical therapy with stories like ""I had this one patient who was worse than you and now they run marathons"" and It's NOT inspiring. Firstly, I don't want to run marathons, so how about taking some time to understand my goals before trying to inspire me, but second, That's their story, their journey, their life. They are a strong and resilient person, But they didn't do it to prove anything to anyone, they did it because that was their goal. 

I'm happy for my disability to be brought into public awareness, because that's honestly necessary in terms of better access and treatment. But I don't want to be socially elevated because I was born/became different, the same way we don't want to be left behind.

674,"I have mobility aids that benefit from the extra stall room, and a physical disability that benefits from the handrails to help me up and down. I have nerve and spine issues that cause urgency/delayed sensation of needing to go, and I have medical conditions which cause irregular bowel habits. So I feel I'm able to genuinely make use of a handicap stall, but obviously my opinion isn't gospel.

My opinion on able bodied people using handicapped stall is simple: we're all human, when you've gotta go, you've gotta go. If the handicap stall is the only one free and you are busting, yes, use it.

However if you can hold it until a regular stall opens up, please consider doing so, as there may be someone with a disability who can't physically hold it who will come along shortly after you enter the stall, and be out of luck.

The way I see it. We all need somewhere to piss, sometimes I'll come to the bathroom and the handicapped stall is occupied. It makes no difference to me if the person inside is able or disabled. I still have to wait. 

The only time it's a problem is when there are clean regular stalls open and an able bodied person chooses to use the handicapped stall anyway. As an able bodied person you have the choice between multiple regular stalls. As someone with a disability I don't have a choice, it's the handicap stall or I piss myself.

So don't take away my only option with your choice.

But if the handicap stall is your only option because other stalls are in use and you can't hold it, then you and I are not so different, we've both had our choice removed, and the handicap stall is the only option, so use it.

675,"I think people have the right to choose which label fits them, But when we talk about each other as a community ""disabled"" should be the politically correct term, because it's the most accurate term, It covers all of us.

Some people are disabled by society because they are diffrently abled

Some people are disabled because they have a condition which literally limits and applies dysfunction to their abilities.

I fall in the later camp, I'm disabled, No amount of changing the way society functions, changing the architecture of buildings and building roll-in-showers in my house is going to change the fact that some days I can't wipe my own arse or wash my own hair. That's disability. I have tools which help me overcome disability, But that doesn't change that my ability is dysfunctional.

My brother has ASD, he would call himself ""differently abled"", his condition does not cause him to be unable to do the things he wants and needs to do to stay alive in the wilderness and get along with people who meet him on his level or on the middle ground. But because he lives in a western society where he is expected to get a job to afford food, communicate with neurotypical people on *their* terms and understand the structure of a neurotypical society, He has become disabled because society is not designed to work with his condition. So he is Disabled *and* differently abled, but it's important for him to be able to highlight that he is *differently abled* and therefore has *special needs* and if those needs are met he wont actualy be disabled. Simultaneously it's also important that I am able to express that no matter how many accommodations you give to me, I am disabled because I have a disability.

678,"&gt; Although has any one else noticed that most lighting in Galleries is designed for those standing up? All I can see is glare and reflection from the lights in the top half of most painting's which his very annoying!

Yes! I used to work in lighting design as a side gig after I left highschool before I was accepted to uni and this is sadly intentional by most designers as requested by the artist.

I was part of a summer TAFE program where we learned how to design sound and lighting and as someone with visual and hearing impairments it was really enlightening (pun intended?) to see just how accessibility does not factor into an artists vision in the slightest. I was one of the first wheelchair users at that TAFE let alone that course, thankfully I was a very infrequent user at the time because it was not very accessible, My lecturers had a bit of their own learning curve, they'd be showing the class something and say ""See how the light is able to reflect on these elements simultaneously?"" and me and this other girl who was very short would yell back ""No, we see glare"".

We had a final exam where we were able to rent a space and light it, and the light was the art. So I teamed up with the short girl and we named our show ""eyes open, brain shut"" and our aim was to recreate how art can feel inaccessible. We mounted everything higher than it should be, to recreate being in a seated postion even when standing, and we had some parts lit far too bright, creating washout, and some parts lit too dimly, to create shadows, to recreate how my visual impairment was manifesting at the time. We had to repeat our aim like 20 times because initially our teacher was like ""well this is poorly designed"" and we were like ""yeah, for *you*, because you're used to seeing the world the way it is designed""

On the one hand, art is a from of self expression and if what you need to express doesn't involve a relationship with altered sensory input or mobility, then the art wont be accessible to those who do have mobility or sensory issues.

But when you chose to open it to the public and welcome everyone, you then have to start asking how your art will be interpreted by people of different abilities and backgrounds.

And in some cases, you should be offering discounts to entry fees if your art is inaccessible.

(Rant time!)

I went on a sky gondola ride for Father's Day this year, it was $40 a ticket, No discounts, You're supposed to stand in the carriage and look out the window over the landscape, and there are steps around the walls for children and shorter people to look over.

The Gondolas are wheelchair accessible, So they did an awesome job making sure that was well designed... However you can't see shit out the windows from the area where they get you to park yourself. This was only apparent *after* I was situated in the gondola.

I tried standing up and using my dad for support, but the gondola swayed so much I wasn't able to balance without intense pain in my hips, so I remained seated and I used my phone as a periscope to look out the window.  I paid $40 to look at a landscape through my phone, and to be swayed uncomfortably. When we disembarked we had the option to leave feedback, so I explained that while the carriage is physically accessible, the experience is not accessible, because you can't see without standing. The customer rep taking the feedback said ""well there are rails on the roof you can hold onto after you stand up"" as if a) everyone on a wheelchair can stand up and b) everyone is tall enough to reach the rails on the roof (I wasn't, and I'm not *crazy* short at 5'3"")

Nobody warned me that I would *need* to be able to stand up to get the full experience. Had we known before boarding I wouldn't be able to see, I would have just taken the foot bridge and met my dad and brother at the ground on the other end and enjoyed the scenery along the walkway and saved my money. 

I'd love to see more art spaces design their exhibits with accessibility in mind. I love that the space is usually very accessible, most large galleries i've visited are wide, open and well lit, have braille on the important signs and offer both audio tours and have tour guides on staff who sign their tours. But the art itself? it's not nearly as accessible. 

And As I type this, I'm respecting that these complains come from a place of privilege, when it comes to accessibility there are people who can't access their basic needs, shelter, food, medical care, emergency evacuation etc because of lack of planning for people with disabilities ""Waaaa~ I can't see the pretty art"" is a first world problem. But accessibility to Art, or hobbies and interests in general is a large part of maintaining good mental health, and it's not enough for organisations to say ""well the building is physically accessible"" if the experience is not accessible.

680,"Disability is a spectrum and comes in many forms.

My autistic brother considers me to be abled when we're socialising, but I consider him to be abled when we're going for a walk, because our disabilities are different, and limit us in ways that are unique to us.

Even my mother, who has the same condition as me, is differently disabled to me. Her issues are far more invisible, she works full time and she's a full time mother to my brother, but she is still disabled because her condition causes shoulder dislocation and gastrointestinal symptoms which will effect how she performs during the day.

Meanwhile I'm disabled by my hip dislocations, and my mast cell dysfunction making it dangerous to go into public without pre-meds and allergy masks.

You're right to say ""my friend is not disabled the same way I'm disabled, he does not face the same challenges I face as a person with a disability""

But that's not to say he doesn't face his own challenges (one's you may not even see) and have his own limitations or different abilities due to his unique circumstances as a person with a *different* disability.

681,"&gt;Alternately, can you call the store? Speak to a manager while you are outside and let them know your situation. I imagine it would be mortifying for them if they have any shred of empathy.


As much as I hate being inconvenienced by people blocking the accessible route, when it does happen, (because it does happen) this is absolutely my guilty pleasure.

*Ring ring* ""hello, my name is DearyDairy, I am a customer keen to visit your store today, I'm in the parking lot ready to shop, but unfortunately a promotional sandwich board with sandbags weighing it down is blocking the footpath cut out. Would there be an employee free to come outside and help me move it? unfortunately my mobility aid can't get up the footpath lip, I need the ramp cleared""

For bonus points, because this usually happens to me at Coles, who's customer service desk is right at the the front, I can usually see the person on the phone through the window, so I make sure to smile and wave.

The key is to kill them with kindness, when they apologise for the path being blocked you say ""oh it's fine, the wind is really unpredictable, anything could have been blown into my path, thank you for helping"" and you stare them right in the eyes and watch them panic as they realise it wasn't the wind, it was their ignorance due to privilege, and they don't know what to say.

I absolutely hold nothing against them the first few times. If you don't deal with mobility issues, it's true you don't really notice when something could cause a mobility issue. But by the time third time I definitely hold them accountable. If you know you've had issues in the past with your actions causing inaccessibility, and you're still failing to spot where you're going wrong, time to take responsibility for yourself and put into place some self checks, or ask someone with a different perspective for their opinion.

682,"It honestly depends on the wheelchair and the mobility concerns of the wheelchair user. Personally, I can't move my chair at all while holding a door, so any non automatic door is inaccessible to me - but if I have a friend with me, it's totally fine as long as there are no stairs. So it's probably best when leaving a review to write what the structure is, to help others decide for themselves if they can manage that circumstance. ""building is large enough for a wheelchair to manoeuvre, however manual door opens outwards onto a ground level threshold which could pose a some difficulty""

It's a tough call. I don't like how Google seems to approach wheelchair access as black or white, because chairs and their users come in different shapes and sizes with different access requirements. I've seen people in lightweight self propelled chairs slide down flights of stairs, making subway stations technically accessible to them, but a power chair user, or someone with poor arm mobility could not have the same level of access despite also being a chair user.

A year ago my wife and I had a favorite restaurant that was all booths. I could fold my walker and get into the booth. Now, however, we can't go there because I need to sit at a table where I can stay in my wheelchair. We have a different favorite.

Of course, menu information and reviews of the food is just as helpful to me as to anyone. That should be in the same app or website as the accessibility information.

I will join the Google Local Guides group. Sounds interesting and useful.","[{'start': 164, 'end': 174, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}, {'start': 23, 'end': 33, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

Losing contact or lapses in treatment with a therapist is not a good enough reason to take someone off disability.

She needs to apply for Medicaid right away. Medicaid is not linked to disability, so even if she is not 'disabled' based on SSA standards she can still obtain it through the state due to income/medical necessity. She would have to apply through her state's relevant agency (usually family services, HHS, etc). She can also apply for welfare and food stamps as well (if she doesn't receive these already). 

It sounds like she still has some residual deficits, but she has been found capable of performing other work. It sounds like she is susceptible to additional brain bleeds, but that in of itself is not disabling.

That is where the SSDI based on your parents record comes in.

That is SSA's way of ""acknowledging"" that you weren't able to work long enough to become insured on your own record.

Both of these require that the seizures continue despite treatment. And you'd have to have tried different medications as well. 

Even if you don't quite meet the eligibility requirements above, you can still be found disabled if they don't feel you can sustain a 40 hour work week. But then it has to be shown that the inability to sustain a full work week has lasted, or can be expected to last for a full 12 months. 

How often do you see your doctor? Do you keep a seizure log? All of these things are going to be helpful. You can't just tell SSA ""I have x number of seizures"" and be given 100% credibility. It has to be supported by your doctor's notes or ER visits for post-ictal complications.

At the initial and reconsideration stage of a disability application, having an attorney doesn't provide any significant advantage. If a person is denied after the initial stages, and will be going in front of a judge, then the attorney is necessary.

Your SSI and SSDI claims should be linked and have the same decision unless your SSDI claim somehow has a Date Last Insured (DLI) on it. That would mean your disability ""insurance"" lapsed - but you would have had to quit working 5 years ago for that to happen.  

Somewhere on the top of that denial letter (usually top left) it is going to say Social Security, but then underneath it will say something else - either Supplemental Security Income,  Retirement Survivors and Disability Insurance, or it will have both listed. The first is SSI, the second is SSDI, and if they are combined its both.

The other thing that I sure hope didn't happen is that the FO sent that letter out while the claim was still pending at FedQA, or had just come back from FedQA.

I live 40 minutes away from town so there's no way for me to get to work. No bus or uber, but I meant that I don't qualify for jobs because they want a valid license. 

I can't stay focused for a sit down job and can't take adhd medication because of tachycardia. That part IS in my medical records. I have hypermobility syndrome, and that causes pain when I type. I do better with voice to text programs and then correcting the errors by going in with type when needed. 

Screens cause headaches after a couple hours and trigger  migraines, which are also documented. I can only work that amount of time because anything past that leaves me really drained physically and mentally and I can only manage for a couple months without ending up crying at work constantly and spending my lunch break self harming in the bathroom. 

Idk what all I have in my charts because so many of the drs I have had in the past contradict one another. When the drs for disability checked me, they sent me to a chiropractor who asked me like 4 questions, had me push with my feet, and had me walk in a line and bend once. The therapist asked me some questions, but was really nice, so I was comfortable and didn't end up having very much trouble talking. 

I can't do phones because I have trouble speaking and stutter and all my words come out in the wrong order and then I can't really remember what I'm saying or what they are saying and by the end of it I have no idea what's going on. I even told them the wrong address TWICE accidentally (just the number) when they did the phone interview. And I cried after. When I worked at the walmart bakery, I cried when I had to take orders and ended up exhausted after just a couple of hours of making donuts or bread. Having to go in and out of the freezer and lift heavy boxes made my sciatica (also documented) hurt a lot.

Also my local <LOCATION> just happens to include a few family members and good friends who would gladly check up on her. I will say it one last time: I do not want to get any authorities involved if I don't have to. It would only upset her and her family. I posted this in hopes of getting some good advice (which I did on other subs and on some Facebook groups). The only way I would contact someone is if it was my last resort. I tried to respectfully provide you with the information that lead me to think that something is amiss. You are entitled to your opinion but the fact that you keep trying to ram it down my throat makes me think that you're just a troll.

I think the main challenge is finding someone willing to work with you to make a relationship work in the first place. There may or may not be some cultural barriers that you may need to overcome.

All relationships can be challenging from time to time, and the reality is that your disorder may occasionally introduce more challenges that will need to be overcome together.

I think one of the upsides to having a disability is that when you do find a relationship, it's less likely to be something superficial because it can require a lot of effort. It is definitely possible though.

You can be denied SSDI and allowed on SSI and vice versa. SSI is based on resources and income, while SSDI is based on how long you have worked and paid into the system. If you have not worked much, you will not qualify for SSDI. If you own a house, or if your spouse makes a decent living, or if you have money in the bank, you may not qualify for SSI.

Likely, the FO is checking the financial aspects of your claim before making the final decision, but I am making an educated guess without any real knowledge.

909,"The amount of people in this thread that somehow know how social security adjudicate claims is amazing.

First and foremost, for the zillionth time, a lawyer is not needed for the initial and appeal. An attorney is useful when/if you go before an ALJ. The initial and appeal process can all be done by the applicant. Lawyers can do more harm than good by purposely not responding to examiners to ensure that their claimants go to the ALJ, thus getting the representative more money. I have denied claims because a lawyer wouldn't let me contact a claimant, then the lawyer did not return forms or phone calls. 

Second-
&gt; Social Security gives a lot more consideration to what your doctors say you can do vs. what you say, so if you can get your doctors to back you up, that's helpful. 

This is only half true. While it can sometimes be helpful to get a statement from your doctor indicating what you can and cannot do, if that statement is not supported by exams and other evidence (imaging, hospital stays, etc), then we will give the doctor's statement very little weight. We look at the objective medical evidence- the exams, the x-rays/CTs/MRIs, the hospital stays and mental status exams, etc- the most weight. We do give a weight to function reports and claimant reports of pain, inability to perform daily tasks, etc, especially if these claims are consistent throughout the medical evidence. Third party function reports from family/friends/case managers are also given weight. I have given third party/claimant reports more weight than doctor statements, simply because the doctor statements were so out of alignment with exams.

&gt;Most cases are denied initially, especially for those under age 50. The standard of disability for a person under 50 is the inability to perform ANY fulltime work. And for depression/anxiety claims, Social Security often assumes that you could at least do a simple job with low interpersonal contact. Think of the simplest job you can - like a basic assembly job - and keep in mind that if you can do even that job, you're not disabled according to Social Security. 

Again, half correct. The age issue is for physical claims. People under 50 are physically able to do more work than people over 50, which is why they are denied more. For mental issues, age is irrelevant. Whether you are 20 or 60, your anxiety/depression/schizophrenia will impact your work the same. Now, a combination of physical and mental may be impacted by age, but mental alone is not. 
Social security does not ""assume"" you can do anything. Social security looks at all the objective and subjective evidence to make a determination on what kind of work you are capable of doing. Simple and repetitive tasks, such as a basic assembly job, is a classification, a functional capacity. Some people have severe mental impairments, but they are able to regularly go to work and follow simple instructions. These people are capable of simple and repetitive work. 
Hanford was right that social security is looking to see if the claimant's impairments preclude ALL work. Disability is reserved for those people whose impairments render them unable to complete a 40 hour work week. Not being able to drive is not a disability- there are other methods to get to a job. If you can't do prolonged standing or heavy lifting, can you do a sit down job? Why can't you use phones, and why do screens and typing hurt? Why can you only work 6 hours 3 days a week? Do you have medical evidence to support these limitations? This is what social security is looking for.

I apologize for my irritation. The assumptions about disability make me angry, because I don't know how to combat them, and I feel like I'm constantly repeating myself. Hope I helped.
