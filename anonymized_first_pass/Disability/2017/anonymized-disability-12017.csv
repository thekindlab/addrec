It's like, people simply aren't expected to look out for YOUR individual needs or interests. I keep drawing examples but I'm as white as rice, so everything seems pretty racist and over-reachy. My understanding is that 'being disabled' in and of itself is not taboo -- but making it other people's problem is sorta getting towards that. If a blind man were to walk into a bar and order a drink, he'd be served without hesitation -- maybe even with excitement and enthusiasm. If a blind man were to walk into a bar and demand a braille menu, it might go differently.

18,"I can't reliably do an office type job with how frequently I lose the ability to use my hands+arms reliably, including writing and typing. It's part of why my school support job is so few hours a week- I can do an hour here or there, stop when my body stops cooperating, pick up at an obscene hour to do paperwork at home when necessary. I've been able to call in with no ramifications when my leg is completely unresponsive, making it so I can't stand, let alone walk.

I know it's not a 'slam dunk' but getting disapproved on the basis of *what* I have is really is extremely low on the list of things I'm concerned about.

38,"I'm very new to this, as I spent the better part of 15 years thinking and being told that nothing was wrong with me, I'm milking my issues, I'm lazy, and the best one: it's all in my head. 

I largely ignored all of my issues until my doctors started finding corroborating evidence that my issues were legitimate and likely worse than I thought. 

My wife is behind me 100% and totally understands, but I have been hella apprehensive about discussing any of my issues as well as my SSDI application with anyone friend or family. 

I, too, am very guarded about what I say and how I say it. I censor a lot of information to avoid being accused or perceived as being lazy, a mooch, a liar, etc. 

It's a pretty awful feeling knowing that you can't open up truthfully to your parents, close friends, and other family because you're afraid of being labeled as a worthless liar. 

OP, I hope your social situation improves and thank you for sharing.

I have a disability ( AMC - Para using a wheelchair and crutches) and if I were going to be going into a PhD Program, I would have already chatted with my professor and have let them known about any possible accomodations that I might need for ensuring my education prior to stepping foot into the schools facilities.

60,"I dated someone who used a wheelchair, here are some thoughts:

Be sensitive with language and follow the person's lead about how the describe themselves and their relationship to their chair, disability, etc. Use the same language as them.  

Some people prefer to say ""USE a chair"" rather than ""IN a chair""- it highlights that the chair is a tool, not a prison.

Let them choose the restaurant and table, because they might have insight about accessibility stuff you wouldn't think of.  

If you choose a date space, check ahead of time for accessibility- call ahead and ask, look at the entrance on Google Maps, find photos of the interior on their website or on Yelp. A lot of times people who don't need to think about stairs completely forget about stairs. My ex's aide- who should know better- actually recommended a restaurant for us and when I checked, it had a huge flight of stairs and no lift!

If you know what their disability is called, research it (there are great youtube videos and lots of blogs) so you have an idea of what to expect around things they can do or might need- but also remember everyone is different and this person's needs and wants will still be unique.  You're not researching to help them, you're just researching to make sure you're cool with whatever their needs might entail.

Make sure to get to know them on a level beyond their physical needs- talk about ideas and interests, and don't be obsessed about their body (not that you would be! but I think a lot of times ppl kind of focus on physical traits, as you know).

Don't grill them about how their disability came to be or what accident they were in or whatever- talking about that stuff could be unpleasant or traumatic for them. But if they want to talk, be a good listener.

Make sure to frame them as a badass rather than a victim. My ex was SUCH a good wheelchair driver- like he remembered that I had kicked off a boot kind of behind his chair, and without turning around, an hour later backed up and swerved perfectly so he passed over it without hitting it. I was like WTF? And he was like ""Hey, I'm a good driver."" It was pretty impressive.

My ex sometimes admitted that he felt like a bit of a burden when he needed my help with tasks. I actually liked helping him- I thought it was a nice way to connect and the time we spent together could be special and intimate rather than feeling annoying or task-focussed. When he mentioned that he felt bad for me helping him all the time, I told him that and he said he appreciated it.

Let them ask for help rather than jumping to offer it, especially at first.

Most of all, just enjoy each other as humans, and get to know each other.

I use OK Cupid which has a bit more room for writing and I'm up front about my disability on the profile. I give it a name, make sure they know I don't work, and have a picture of myself in my wheelchair. There's enough there that no one can miss it, but most of the profile is about things outside of disability. 

What I'd found is that it tends to weed out people who wouldn't be understanding, and that I've had really good success connecting with people who are pretty friendly to my situation. 

Having it out front makes it less scary for me too - I can answer questions in the first date and I don't have to work up the courage to disclose. ",,,,kwxt,,,1483284358,t5_2qhe8,t3_5lelqx,t3_5lelqx,8,1485690739,0,0,dbv95n5,disability,,,,,

69,"I am a female college student who uses a wheelchair.

I like it when people offer to help, but please do not push the chair until I ask. It is very important that I have my feet on the foot rests if I am going to be pushed, or my feet will be caught under the chair. When I am not being pushed (such as right now while typing on a computer) I have my feet on the floor and the foot rests pushed to the side.

Also, if you are pushing and stop and let go, tell the person first. That way the person in the chair can hold the wheels or the breaks to keep from rolling.

Bathrooms are a particular problem. Often a bathroom in a restaurant does not have enough room for a wheel chair. Men sometimes wheel up to the toilet and grab bars to standup (if they can), or roll up closer and ""hang it over the side"". Of course, for women it is different. We like to be able to transfer from sitting on the chair to sitting on the toilet, but to do that there must be room on the side.

""Single stall"" or ""one hole"" restrooms are the best and are often found in restaurants, even if the are labeled ""men"" or ""women"". Many other public places have ""family"" restrooms that have one toilet. These usually have enough room and (in spite of the sign on the door) the date can go in, help with any transfer, step out, and then go back in to help the other person leave the room.

Most of all, remember that we are all different, and have different needs. ",,,,mhalltltotbar,,,1485802978,t5_2qhe8,t3_5qpgr7,t3_5qpgr7,2,1486564476,0,0,dd3xwvu,disability,,,,,

He went to the mother of one of the girls he was helping with her college applications and said that he couldn't believe she had gotten into this pretty prestigious college. He literally told her that he didn't know why the college wanted her. It was the most bizarre thing I'd ever heard. I don't know if he lacks social skills or what... but he seems to take pleasure in tearing other people down. Empathy is a big issue for him. I don't know if bad teachers, doctors, and others in helping professions start out that way or become ineffectual over time because of the demands of their jobs. I sure hope it's the latter. 

No one from my high school is attending my college but I talk to my best friend all the time. I'm planning to see her over the summer too. 

I didn't skip a grade but my parents sent me a year early so I was always the youngest in my grade. I was in a bad place to start college last year. I'd been fighting for a diagnosis for two years and even though I'd gotten it I was still anxious and very insecure. I was having panic attacks and really doubted myself and my ability to handle college. I think that's just a consequence of chronic illness especially when you're undiagnosed and there are so many people in your life who don't believe you're ill. Most of that has resolved itself with time. So I definitely understand what you mean about emotional maturity and readiness. Even half a year has made a huge difference for me. 

I'm definitely going to get involved with any clubs that my school has for people with disabilities. It's good that your group leader was so discreet.

126,"I've used a cane for extended walking and heavy travel walking like the airport for over 20 years. I was 35 years old when I had to start using it due to a traffic accident injury. My thought is that if I'm not using the cane, I have no need to pre-board. Most of the time I don't bother pre-boarding since doing so prohibits me from sitting in an exit row, and my leg and back pain would not keep me from operating the exit. I have a spinal cord stimulator in use, and normally can't feel that pain when the stimulator is on. 

That being said, I realize that your need to pre-board is different than mine. I travel with a folding cane, because I may or may not need it at times. If I were you, I'd use a folding cane if you are that worried about what people think, then fold it up and put it away once you are on the plane. No one is going to give you a second look or remember you if you get off the plane without it. 

I always assume the people pre-boarding without assistance are Air Marshals, not people skirting the system. 

In a similar instance, I have a disability parking placard and there are days when I really need it, and days that I don't. I always figure that if I don't need the cane at that time, there is someone who needs that parking space worse than I do and will use regular parking spaces. On the other hand, there are days when walking 50-100 feet can be a real challenge, and I feel no apprehension about using the placard, as my doctor certified me for it and I'm using it responsibly, not abusing it.

166,"&gt; The letter says there is not enough information about your vocational information to say if you can do the work you used to due because of a process called ""expediting""

Not necessarily for OP, but for others wondering more about this. If you get a denial letter that says that there wasn't enough vocational information and you can do other work. 

All disability decisions are completed using what is essentially a ""flow chart"" called [sequential evaluation](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0422001001). Once a person has a mental or physical RFC assessment, SSA has to look at whether they are capable of their past work or not. If they aren't, then the case is moved onto the [med/voc grid chart](http://www.ultimatedisabilityguide.com/grid_rules.html). 

If you look at the chart, basically anyone under the age of 50 is always going to be a denial. Regardless of a person's past relevant work, their age, education, or RFC. In these situations, SSA allows examiners to ""expedite"" the process by skipping the 4th step (past work) and going straight to step 5.  Doing a complete vocational assessment can take upwards of an hour, and usually involves extra phone calls for more information.

Not necessarily for OP, but for others wondering more about this. If you get a denial letter that says that there wasn't enough vocational information and you can do other work. 

All disability decisions are completed using what is essentially a ""flow chart"" called [sequential evaluation](<URL>). Once a person has a mental or physical RFC assessment, SSA has to look at whether they are capable of their past work or not. If they aren't, then the case is moved onto the [med/voc grid chart](<URL>). 

If you look at the chart, basically anyone under the age of 50 is always going to be a denial. Regardless of a person's past relevant work, their age, education, or RFC. In these situations, SSA allows examiners to ""expedite"" the process by skipping the 4th step (past work) and going straight to step 5.  Doing a complete vocational assessment can take upwards of an hour, and usually involves extra phone calls for more information. Since the outcome of the case will be the same whether the person is found to be capable of their past work, it just saves time to skip it. 

Legally we have to tell people we skipped step 4, hence the language in the disability notice saying that there wasn't enough information.

175,"It's really going to depend on the property manager, the state, and the property itself. One place may be vastly better than the next, so everyone's opinion will differ a bit.

My family lived in public housing for a few years in highschool and it was pretty good. They would do inspections about twice a year, and at my apartment they only gave 12 hour notice, which was the minimum requires in the state. Maintenance was pretty quick to fix things, but they used the cheapest stuff so everything would break sooner or later. It was a townhouse and while we didn't have central air but there was a window AC built into the wall on the main floor, and we were allowed to put a small portable AC upstairs. We weren't allowed to have pets other than fish, and even then no more than a five gallon tank. However, therapy and service dogs were allowed if you managed to jump through all the right hoops. That said, we were turned down for an ESA for my sisters depression because the letter her therapist sent didn't arrive at their office within a specific amount of time. Later a new property manager was hired and we asked her about trying to get approved for an ESA/service dog again (this time for me.) She told us she would let us have a dog as long as we took it somewhere else when the people that did inspections came around, as the management company tried to turn down as many dog requests as they could. I could also hear my neighbors alarm clock in the mornings, but it wasn't that loud.

Overall it was pretty good. I mean, it was a place to live, we didn't have rodents or bugs (with the exception of one fluke summer where the town was overwhelmed by box elder beetles,) everyone was pretty nice. 

Also, we were on the waiting list about two years.

Another idea that's easier that I've been thinking of: at sewing stores you can buy clear elastic tape meant for seams on knit garments.

Remember, social security is not concerned that you have diseases, but how much and what kind of work you are able to do. The majority of your impairments do not impact your ability work.

Positive ana is not a disease. It means you have a marker gene that is related to rheumatoid arthritis. It is not disorder.
Lyme Disease is RARELY, if ever, a disabling condition. I do not think I have ever allowed, nor heard of anyone being allowed, for Lyme Disease.
Asthma is only disabling according to SSA if you end up in the  hospital frequently. Just having asthma and having to use an inhaler occasionally is not disabling. 
Migraines are the same. This is a very frequent allegation. Migraines suck; I get them. I might miss a day or two of work a month. However, I CAN work. They do not make me unable to work, especially with medication. Migraines are rarely, if ever, disabling.

Other days, your vision is fine, and therefore, those days, your vision does not impact your ability to work.

Rheumatoid arthritis can and often does allow people, depending on symptoms- swollen joints, frozen joints, inability to use hands, and how often. Doctors' notes documenting these observable symptoms will go a long way.

I've been pushing myself up a hill in a busy train station, people rushing past me and I'm struggling. The person who stopped, asked me if I needed help and helped was a Muslim.

A big hill near my house is really hard and I have to go backwards to have any chance of getting up it. There was a Muslim lady and her child in a park nearby. She gathered up her kid and came over to ask me if I needed help.

I find that from most other people I get either pity or anger. 

Another thing I have noticed is that I get more of the baby talk/treating me like a child thing from white Australians than anyone else too. Also a lot of the negative comments. I think this is due in part because of media depictions of people with disabilities.

It's become a bit of a hobby to watch people and their reactions.","[{'start': 79, 'end': 89, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

I was getting friendly with a neighbor but found out from my child (who rides the bus with hers) that she didn't want to get hooked in to helping me all the time. Never once did I ask this woman for help.

228,"&gt; A lot of people don't realize that you can request to fill everything out over the phone with a case worker. It's the best way.

If possible, I would actually suggest not doing this. The problem with doing things over the phone is that what the examiner puts down is what becomes the record. If you get a good examiner who documents well, and who asks follow up questions, then that will work out into your favor. But if you have an overworked examiner, they will probably paraphrase and leave stuff out. Mailing it in makes your words the official document. 

For example: 
lets say that the question is ""do you cook for yourself""

on the phone you say ""I do cook for myself sometimes, but other times I don't have the motivation to make food. I eat a lot of microwave/frozen dinners because it requires no preparation. I wouldn't be able to pay attention long enough to follow a recipe, and I would just get frustrated and quit. Sometimes I don't eat all together.""

What gets noted: claimant is capable of cooking for themselves. cooks simple meals in the microwave. 

Now, does that accurately convey the information? Not really. Examiners are trained to listen for key phrases and answer central questions as they relate to the case. So those questions about taking care of your personal hygiene, cooking, cleaning, etc is getting at the central question ""can they take care of their daily needs?"" The expanded reply shows difficult with preparing even simple meals, but the condensed version implies that they have only minor limitations in this area.

241,"I'm not entirely sure why the government didn't set parity between the amounts initially, but I can explain why they've grown at different rates over time, and offer an explanation about why they're so low now.

Part of the reason that SGA and SSI awards were set differently may have to do with the fact that SSI was a program created after SSDI.  A quick look suggests that the disparity between the growth rate of SGA and benefits awarded has to do with the fact that they are calculated using two different formulas, the cost of living adjustment, and the wage-based adjustment (both first passed in amendments from 1972).

The Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) adjusts for increases in prices, whereas the wage-base adjustment corrects for increases in wages. The purpose of the COLA was to maintain the purchasing power of benefits already awarded. The purpose of the automatic adjustment in the wage base was to maintain the relative value of Social Security benefits for future applicants. 

However, the procedure for adjusting for price and wage increases was flawed from the outset.  It almost immediately began causing problems, and needed to be amended in 1977. The 1977 amendments also tried to tackle some funding problems which became apparent almost immediately after the 1972 amendments.  

Basically, it became apparent that Social Security faced a significant funding shortfall, both in the short-term and in the long-term. The short-term problem was caused by the bad economy, and the long-term problem by the demographics associated with the baby boom. By their 1975 report the Trustees said the Trust Funds would be exhausted by 1979. This financing shortfall was addressed by the 1977 Social Security Amendments. These amendments raised the payroll tax slightly (from 6.45% to the current 7.65%), increased the wage base; reduced benefits slightly; and ""decoupled"" the wage adjustment from the COLA adjustment. These fixes restored the long-term balance of the program for the next 50 years (but not the full 75 years used by the actuaries). Despite this, major amendments in 1983 would be needed to avoid short-term funding problems, and to address the remaining long-range program deficit.

To date, we still face major solvency issues with the disability trust fund.  Part of the way congress and SSA try to keep those funds solvent is by limiting payouts to a sustainable amount.  

TL;DR:  The increase is small because the fund will go broke if we increase it much more.  SGA and SSI increase at different rates because they look at different things.",,,,DrMuffinPHD,SSA ODAR Attorney,,1484248416,t5_2qhe8,t3_5nhqz2,t1_dcc73g8,3,1485995404,0,0,dccckat,disability,,,,,

Other than that our only non-mandatory bill is Netflix, and that's the lowest package we can get at that. Things like phone and internet are a necessity (and we even have a home phone, no cell phones). The big thing is just a massive build up of credit card debt due to emergencies that happen like my wife getting sick with the flu and missing three days of work, or having to relocate because we couldn't afford to stay at our last place, or now having to pay for oil because of winter when we couldn't really afford what we had before.

Not meaning to rant, just trying to say I've tried cutting any and all corners I could find financially speaking.

291,"I have disabilities too. I acquired them in a motorcycled accident when I was 20. At the time I was non-disabled and working. Then I was on SSDI (because I had worked enough to qualify for that instead of SSI) for seven years until I finished recovering from my injuries and after finishing college. I then went back to work for 26 years, until my initial disabilities, plus secondary disabling conditions that I developed along the way, and simple aging left me unable to do enough work to be gainfully employed, so I now receive SSDI again, and work a little part time, when I am able. 

If you have a diagnosis as being on the ASD from a physician, phychiatrist, or psychologist then you have a disability, in a medical sense. The fact that you’re seeing a therapist also confirms that you are medically qualified as disabled. Having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t work or that you shouldn’t ever work or even try to work. It just means you have a physical or mental condition that impacts a part of your life. There are millions of us out there, welcome to the club :)

I think it’s brave and admirable that you want to work despite the fact that you have a disability. In addition to being disabled, I’ve worked with at least a couple thousand other people with disabilities through jobs I’ve had with companies and agencies that help people with disabilities. There are many people who would give up without even really trying to find work if they have or acquire a disability. They would get on SSI and live their life without even trying to get not only the money, but the fun and satisfaction a person can get from working.  

The Social Security Administration is the government agency that you’d be interacting with if you choose to apply for SSI. While it is clear that you have a disability from a medical sense, they decide if your disability is severe enough from a vocational sense to mean that it keeps you from being gainfully employed. This process can be very technical and it requires a lot of paperwork from your past and current doctors, therapists and any past employers that you’ve worked for.

I would strongly recommend that you find an attorney that specializes in Social Security Disability to help you through this process. They take a percentage of any back pay you receive if your case is decided in your favor (you get the cash benefits you would have received from the date you applied for SSI through the date your case is decided, if the case is decided in your favor). You don’t pay them anything if you lose. You said that your therapist recommended that you apply for these benefits. A lawyer specializing in helping people qualify for SSI / SSDI can give you a good assessment, usually during an initial meeting, whether they think you’d qualify for SSI benefits. Because the lawyers only get paid if they win, they aren’t going to take a case that they don’t believe has a chance of winning. Be prepared for this process to take a while, up to a year or two. Also, you’ll likely be turned down the first time, so don’t let that discourage you. Your lawyers will help with your appeal. It’s a normal part of the process. 

[Every state has a vocational rehabilitation program] (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM277757.pdf). This program is available to all people with disabilities whether they qualify for SSI or not. They can help you find work. I would also contact your state vocational rehabilitation agency and apply for their services. They should be able to take your application over the phone, and they will pay for any tests or assessments they need to determine if you qualify for their services. Once you qualify you’ll develop an employment plan with your vocational rehabilitation counselor. These plans can be simple and short, or long and span years. What they will help you with is the costs and planning associated with getting any skills, education or other forms of assistance that lead to you achieving your employment goals. 

What I’m suggesting to you is that if you want to work, you should begin looking for whatever help and supports you need to address any barriers to being employed that you have as soon as possible, at the same time. 

Tell your therapist that you’re open to pursuing SSI as a temporary support as you work towards being employed, but that employment and financial independence is your goal. 

Contact a lawyer that specializes in SSI to get their assessment as to whether they think they can help you.

Call your state vocational rehabilitation agency and tell them that you’d like to apply for services. 

Lastly, be honest and open with all the people you interact with. 
The better you communicate your reality and circumstances to them, the better they will be in helping you achieve your goals. 

Good Luck!

303,"Mental health approvals for anxiety/depression, are VERY hard to get approved. Make sure you see at least two or three different doctors/psychiatrists. The more documentation you have from different sources with the same diagnosis, the better. Get every single medical record that pertains to your condition. Hospital visits, urgent care, etc. Get written statements from your healthcare professionals explaining why they believe you are unable to work in any capacity. That's the super hard part right there. You have to prove to them that you can't work any type of job, due to your condition. The more you send them, the better. Even if you're not sure if they'll want it, send it. Also, copy everything in triplicate, send two copies of everything to them, and keep an exact set for yourself. Log all correspondence with dates and times. Don't be afraid to contact your case manager after you're assigned one. 

Most people get denied there first time because they are unprepared. You need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've turned over every stone, gotten a second and third opinion on your diagnosis. Have more than enough medical documentation to prove what you've gone through. And make sure it's all filled out properly.

Now, this was all pretty traumatic of course and it took years working with my doctors to find the correct medicine and dosage and all those other fun things you have to do when you get diagnosed suddenly with a deadly illness. And lucky me, I live in the US which means that all of this added up to over a million dollars of debt for my parents. Btw, this all happened in a fairly small town so by the end of the day everyone in it knew what had happened to me and eventually what became of my parent financially.

Athe time that thought had never even occurred to me before then. I was so stunned that someone would even say that I just said ""Ha!"" Loudly in his face and went to class.

She then asks me how a girl of only 25 ended up on SSI and I try to explain, Russian Roulette Heart, migraines, debilitating back pain ect. Nope, she wouldn't accept it. She sat there lecturing me for over an hour about how selfish I was wasting tax payer money, how I'm too young and beautiful to be ""disabled"", and how really I should be a better role model for other people with heart diseases, like her son, yes her son, who she claimed always lied about being tired, or dizzy, when really he was just lazy, like I obviously was. So, not only was this lady a Cardiology Nurse whom I had never met before and knew nothing about me, she was also a mother to someone with a heart disease and she was saying all this stuff. I never went back there and ended up bouncing from cardiologist to cardiologist for about 2 years and also pushed me into a deep depression. But now I know that even Health Professionals sometimes let their own bias and beliefs cloud their judgment. At the time I thought she was telling the truth so I never did anything about her, now, I really wish I did.

Powering add-ons off the chair battery is a big no-no as it can void warranties. We ended up working with a designer and customizing a LED light staff to her specs.

- Make sure all correspondence with HR and your advisor is in hard copy. No face-to-face conversations or phone calls. Email and letters only. Request things in writing.

- Politely contact HR by email saying something along the lines of ""I understand I was supposed to hear back from you on X date about Y issue further to our conversation/your correspondence on Z date. I appreciate that HR has been closed for the holidays. I have been unable to work for X period of time, is there any chance you could let me know when I can expect to hear back and be able to work?"". This type of thing is all evidence and pushing them like this (politely) will make them realize that you know it's evidence.

- Only speak about this with people you trust. Think carefully about mentioning it to anyone who has a professional relationship with your advisor (e.g. other professors) as he/she may then use this against you. Could argue you created a hostile working environment. You are the injured party here so don't let them change that narrative.

- Definitely try to seek free legal help if you can, see what resources are in your area or your school. I know that isn't always possible. If that's the case, certainly do not show them that you have no back-up. As far as they are concerned they should conclude from their correspondence with you that you are prepared to take this further.

But my #1 recommendation is keto; a number of people with pain issues find help from it, and while it didn't help my pain I felt otherwise awesome on it and was losing weight at a very steady pace. 

As for exercise, perhaps slowly ramp up the distance you walk? Find a distance that tires you but does not flare you up, and work at increasing that distance by a few minutes each time. That approach has worked really well for me, last May I could walk maybe 20 minutes before hitting a wall for a day, now it's hours.

Let the students who are donating books know what your intentions are as far as using their books to sell for a cause. Selling the books (as opposed to a bake sale) for charity also gives you a marketing point in terms of fundraising for learning disabilities. I.e.

503,"Thank you, that makes me feel a lot better! As you can tell from my comment... I'm still angry about it. I absolutely loved my high school so it was painful to have to leave during my senior year. He wasn't fired, probably because his position as dean was only temporary and he was doing the school a favor by taking on more responsibility. The dean the school had for ten years left, and he filled the position at the last minute because the school couldn't find a more qualified replacement. He was actually the head of college counseling before so he went back to that job this year. I heard through the grapevine that all the teachers hate him. My teachers all expressed to me how disappointed they were with his decision which was comforting. He really messed up the school. 

That's a really keen observation, I never thought about it that way but you're totally right. I don't know if I'm more surprised by people in positions of power discriminating against disabled folks or close family and friends... honestly it's pretty shocking whenever it happens. 

Your college sounds great. I don't think a school's acceptance rate has much to do with the quality of education it provides. I've seen a few articles that discussed how easy it is to manipulate that number. Way too much emphasis is placed on it.

People don't like being pointed out when they do something wrong--I've said some ignorant things before and have gotten defensive.

564,"What you would need to do is just go to a SS office and tell them that you want to file a CDB claim on your parents' records. It won't affect their benefits and you don't need their permission (just their SSNs). 

How old are you now? And do you have physical copies of the records from when you were 18-22? When they do your CDB claim they will have to look at whether they can extend your disability onset date from 23 (your SSI filing date) to 22. I don't *think* that would be an issue. All SSI claims gather medical records 12 months back from the filing date; so they should have records from when you are 22. But if you have physical copies I would make sure to submit them (submit copies, not your originals) to SSA to add to the file. 

For CDB benefits what they will do is take whichever of your parent's RIB benefits are higher, and you'll get about 75% of it. Depending on how much that is, it may lower your SSI amount or stop your SSI altogether. But even if your SSI is lowered/stopped you'll still be coming out better than before **and** you won't have those asset restrictions and its easier to work some. 

edit: forgot to mention; CDB benefits will terminate if you get married (except for a few specific situations like you marry another CDB beneficiary). Just something to keep in mind.

Crohn's can be tricky, since the condition waxes and wanes. Your surgeries won't come into play because of how far apart they are from each other. Whether your hospitalizations will help depends on how long each hospitalization was. If it was over 24 hours then that helps your case. 

Are your other conditions significantly limiting? Or is crohn's the big one. The other conditions would likely help call into question your sustainability (the ability to work a 40 hour/week), but your age is also going to work against you.  

It will probably come down to your work history. What types of employment have you had over the last 5-6 years? If you've had significant employment then they will likely say you can still work.

592,"First off, I'm not really good at giving advice. So instead, I will just give examples of how my past dating has gone.
I have been a spastic quadriplegic, and have been in a wheelchair for 18 years. I have only been dating for the last five and can count the number of dates I have been on on one hand. In my situation, I have always been the one to initiate a date. Most guys are very uncomfortable with the thought of being more than friends/acquaintances. The dates I have been on have been the result of charity bachelor auctions, but I feel the interaction would have been the same if they would have said yes to a simple request.
It was always up to me to choose the activities for the date, but I always enjoyed their input because they are on the date as well. They were always very standard dinner and a movie.
One thing I particularly enjoyed, or appreciate, is when they don't focus on my wheelchair at all. Not ignoring it per se, but just acting as if it is nothing to be concerned with. Accessibility is already figured into the night, so there is no worrying or stressing about that on the date. During the date, I usually expect to be asked about my disability, which doesn't bother me. To me, it's no different than somebody asking where I was born or what my hobbies are. It's a part of who I am.
Where I can't use my arms enough to feed myself, it is usually up to them to assist me with eating, drinks, etc. or if we are going to be somewhere a long period of time is uncomfortable for me to have my chest strap on, so having them help me get comfortable. I always worry that they feel like they are just another caregiver in this situation, and I still haven't figured out how to beat that frame of mind. They are always more than willing to help, and with them not having a hesitation makes the night go smoother.
As far as being worried about saying something stupid, we all say stupid things, is a learning curve. That's why you're going on a date, to learn about the other person. And if they are so sensitive that they can't understand that the awkwardness goes both ways, then maybe it's not the right match.

When adjusting your diet, cut down on the things that provide a lot of calories but don't make you feel full for very long. In my experience that's largely plain carbs,  like white bread, white rice and potatoes. Whole grain alternatives keeps you full for a lot longer, since dietary fibre fills you up without providing any extra calories. Whole grain foods also have a lower GI, so you won't experience as much of a dip in blood sugar between meals.

598,"So mental illness isnt a serious disability? People just love to live in poverty because they get depressed or anxious? You sound very judgemental for someone who has a mental illness themself. You seem to think 'If they dont have the problems I have or have it as severely, then they should get over it and learn to cope'. People deal with things differently as well. Nobody has the same mindset, some people with depression can handle it while others resort to .. well suicide. Some people with anxiety can go to therapy and come out stronger and can lessen it and make it managable by counting to 10 or taking deep breaths. Sometimes that just doesnt work/help though. Just because you dont think mental illness is serious, doesnt mean it isnt. You can call bullshit all you want, but that just shows how little you care for others and the way they feel and/or react to things. Ive gone to therapy for years, mental hospital, psychiatrists, on soo many meds and NOTHING has helped.

664,"It's more complicated than that. You do not have to disclose when you are interviewing or applying. You might have to disclose once you have an offer. If they revoke your offer because of a disability that can be accommodated for, that is a violation of the ADA. If you were applying to drive a forklife, and you have a double above knee amputation, the company doesn't have to accommodate that. (I don't know anything about amputations, so it's probably likely there is a way to rig up or use prosthetics, but for sake of the example, let's say there's not). Now lets say you applied to drive a forklift, and you have a back issue that requires a special pillow on the seat. Once you have an offer or are an employee, asking for a reasonable accommodation to use your back pillow, which does not alter the nature of the job itself, would be fine. You couldn't be fired for asking to use the pillow (if you are, find a lawyer lol you're in for a nice payday). 

So, no you do not have to disclose while job hunting. Once you have an offer, you can be made to disclose, and once you're an employee, you should file for reasonable accommodations if you require them. If they revoke and offer or fire you because you require accommodation that is reasonable, that's an ADA violation.

674,"Mental cases are difficulty without medical records. From what you posted, you do have every reason to apply. Your lack of treatment as an adult would probably require you to see an SSA examiner (called a consultative exam) in order to get enough information. This would likely be very difficult considering your agoraphobia; however, if a consultative exam is needed, you *have* to go, because it means they need that information. You can ask for a specific gender of examiner, if that helps. 

The autism listings are pretty specific, so I don't think that is the most favorable direction. Anxiety seems to be your biggest issue, social anxiety specifically. I would focus on the fact that you were unable to go back to school or keep a job due to your anxiety. This shows how your anxiety keeps you from completely daily life. If you get a call asking about function or get a function report, be sure to fill it out honestly about your struggles. 

I think you definitely have a reason to apply. There is no reason to be stressed. SSA will only look back three years, so unfortunately, the issues you dealt with in childhood will not be part of the determination. However, any recent treatment (including just general primary care) would be looked at, as well as a consultative exam, as mentioned.

I think self-confidence combined with a sense of humor will take you further than machismo -- especially humor about your disability! If you can develop some jokes related to your disability, ones that don't reek of self-pity, you can use that to defuse the potentially awkward situations when you display or describe your disabilities.

Most of my friends have been female, and I know the intelligent and emotionally-stable guy nets better ladies than the angry machismo jerk -- those types often attract women with similar attitudes.

About your anxiety: I suggest looking into cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). That could help you learn to manage those situations better, help you keep your cool. Perhaps consult a psychiatrist for a mild medication to ease anxiety.  Those can absolutely make all the difference! I wish I had those when I was in school.

Do you think there are any sports you could handle? Ping pong? Just saying, it is essential that you keep yourself in circulation as much as your condition permits. The more time you spend with others, the greater your chances of making connections. Also it keeps your social skills sharp! 

One thing I used to do when I was younger and was trying to build self-confidence: when I was out around people I would pretend to wear the confidence of a admired movie star. I would pretend to be self-confident by behaving in a similar manner as one of their performances. It sounds odd now writing it out, but it actually was helpful!

If I were you I would report him. Especially if you know that he isn't reporting it to SSA. They'll look at his case and determine if it warrants an investigation. 

Let's say he is committing fraud, there are several things that can happen.

1. His benefits are ceased for fraudulent activity. This cessation can be immediate ( so he won't owe backpay) or they can go back as far as they can prove. If they go back and do a retro-active cease he will owe back all that backpay. 

2. aside fro everything in #1 they can also fine him a civil monetary penalty that he will have to pay back. 

3. Everything in #1 plus the case will be referred to the OGC and they will determine if criminal charges should be filed.

690,"if you think you are capable of working, and you've worked in the past; you likely aren't going to qualify for SSI. She is correct that you won't know until you try, but the chances are very low. Even if you do, the max payout for SSI is about $730-ish per month, which isn't enough to really live on. And any halfway decent part-time job can net you that in a month.

If I were you I'd bring a cane in case I actually needed it and if I got any questions (that I felt like answering) I would say that I'm currently having a good day but I have a condition that can flare up and limit my mobility. Easy peasy. If they give you shit you can then beat them with your cane that you conveniently have handy.

728,"Definitely call the airport ahead of time to ensure all your questions/concerns are answered! You can even do a ""run through"" a week or two before to make sure you feel comfortable on the actual travel day! 

I'm not sure how long the flight will be, but I'd bring an empty Nalgene bottle (or bigger if you need to!) and fill it once you go through security. I believe you can bring packaged food through security in your carry on (so you have snacks that you can eat!) but they won't let any type of liquid through. 

As for restrooms, they are supposed to have ""accessible"" rooms on the planes, however they are always small... I'd check into seeing if you can book a seat close-ish to the bathroom, so if you do need to go, it's a short walk for you. I'd also try to get an aisle seat so you don't have to worry about crawling over people!

737,"Hmm, Look at it from her perspective.  Your professor now has to ""by law"" make sure that they are correctly accommodating your entire education and also to make sure that she is not breaking any laws with how things were originally done.   By filing for accommodations, this also means that her and her research and the entire research in her group could be in jeopardy if anything is found to be ""Not Accommodating"" to you.

It sounds to me that she is trying to get her ducks in a row with regards to how to properly be accommodating within the scope of the universities procedures and policies.

Say for example you are doing lab work and her lab is not ADA complaint, this will take money and resources to get this up to compliance and the money might not come from her resources, but rather the resources from her department and possibly her college.  Procuring these resources would not be an easy task as there is a lot of red tape.

738,"Frugalista1 is correct. She won't have enough work credits (20 of 40 quarters) to qualify for SSDI based on her own record. And for SSI your income is counted towards her so she wouldn't qualify for that (income/need-based) program. 

Once your son is 18 he might qualify for SSI benefits (which would at least help out the family situation). For blindness his best corrected vision (in at least one eye) would need to be 20/200 or worse. Or he would have to have a severely restricted visual field (about 80% loss)

On the non-SSA side of things; you really  need to get her to see a doctor. I know that she doesn't want to, but for me this would be ultimatum territory. I know you guys have been married for 10+ years, but if she is requiring assistance with daily tasks, then there is no excuse to not see a doctor. She is putting the burden of her care onto you. If it continues to worsen, then is she going to be able to assist with your son? Now you are stuck taking care of both of them.
