You created a bank account in their name with you as a 'representative payee'. The bank will know what this is.   Get a debit card for the account.  Then every month, the deposit is made to that account ( or accounts, when you have 2 children). Use that money for living expenses such as Food, clothes, household items, literally anything you need.

You will get 4 years of backpay for your child. And you do not have to pay taxes on it, because it is your child's money, not yours.  Please be very responsible with this lump sum.

8,"It is hard to tell where one begins and the others ends. The important thing is that you are yourself and that your everyday experience is your normal. Others may not view it as their normal and you may sometimes feel the affects of that, but the important thing is you are a much stronger person then them for the experiences you have gone through and more importantly you are aware of the ableism and discrimination which somehow still permeates our 'modern' society and is deemed as somehow permissible.

This is super empowering as, at least for me, it allows me to not just be angry at a set of conditions I have (which is pointless) but instead be angry at a system which constantly creates limitations for me.

One of the things I have is a voice and a shitload of experience with disability, so If by being vocal I can help a few people or inform a few others and about disability and ableism, then I have been successful.

Your not a burden, please use your voice and your unique perspective and feel empowered!

48,"You have a very difficult situation, one of which I've experienced before. However, in my times at community college and most recently, my state uni, they always put the onus on *me* to inform the instructor or the TAs (in the case of the state uni) that I have accommodations. 

In other words, you seem to have a unique situation in which your disability office is supposed to do the legwork for you -- which they failed to do. This is a 50-50 situation. When I know I need an accommodation for sure, I always verify that the relevant person got it and that they're going to comply. In your situation, you seem to have *assumed* (which you should never do in college) that things were going according to plan. And the other 50% of the blame lies squarely on the disability services for them not forwarding your accommodation to the professor. This is your strongest argument that you will want to exploit, if you decide to pursue this case. 

Here's my suggestion. Talk to your advisor, and director at disability services. Tell them what you told us. And ask for them to advocate on your behalf with the instructor because they made a boo boo by not forwarding your accommodation letter. If you've already done this, or you know they won't back you, then you can go at it alone. Speak to the dean of student services (theortically the boss of your disability director) and inform him/her that they dropped the ball, and that you have this situation, and you want some mediation. Make note that I never mentioned going to the dean of your English department. Why not? Because they always back the instructors. But feel free to talk to that person as well. 

And as brazen as it sounds, it would be a good idea, probably after knowing where your disability people stand (with you or not), that you inform the teacher that you will contest the grade to the highiest levels possible (like the example of talking to a dean of the college). You need to have what they call chutzpah. Most instructors prey on the power imbalance, and run their classes like dictators, but they're always accountable to someone. And like most humans, at the end of the day, they don't want a headache/issue to take away days or weeks of their life. You might make this obstinate instructor cave just by showing her that you won't go down without a fight. 

Well, good luck.  ",,,,AnxietyThrowaway992,,,1513973656,t5_2qhe8,t3_7l8v8k,t3_7l8v8k,3,1514994660,0,0,drmrwfy,disability,,,,,

55,"Not knowing exactly why you need a tricycle instead of a bicycle, it is hard to recommend a certain type of tricycle over another one.

* **Bicycle with training wheels** are probably the worst with regard to lateral stability. And if you travel on uneven grounds, you are likely to stand on the training wheels and have your drive wheel spin in the air. Any kind of tricycle is better than that. Even adult training wheels are less interesting than other options below.

*  **A tricycle with 2 rear wheels** like the one you pictured is probably your cheapest option. There are two drawbacks to these:

– Worksman tricycles are generally strong but heavy. You won't ruin it unless you try really hard, but you won't ride at record speeds anyways.

– If you have coordination issues and can't spin your pedals very well, you might find the low gear isn't low enough. If that's the case, you might ask the bike shop to replace the cog (the toothed sprocket on the rear wheel) by a larger cog. A larger cog makes the low gear lower and easier to use, but it also makes your top speed a bit slower.

– Stability has its limits. While the Worksman tricycle is very stable, you can't turn corners at full speed. I know there aren't too many hills in Florida, but slow down if you want to turn a corner.

* **A tricycle with 2 front wheels** is often called a ""tadpole tricycle"". It is by far the most stable, the fastest... and the most expensive. I would suggest it might be your second tricycle if you find you enjoy it a lot and want to ride really fast. A tadpole tricycle is often faster than a regular road bike. But don't go there first as it is useless to spend a few thousand dollars unless you really enjoy cycling. If you want to investigate more in that field, check for ""recumbrent tricycles"" (or recumbrent bicycles in general); one good brand (also $$$) is Greenspeed.

82,"It's been a while since I've had to run the numbers on Social Security Disability so these are ballpark numbers and my advice so here goes:

You can still get your disability checks AND make as much money during your trial work period for around 6 months I believe.

You can still get your benefits AND work if you earn less than their max income amount. I believe it was around 14 dollars an hour at 20 hours a week.

I'm sure these numbers have changed. I would suggest to go down to your nearest Social Security office when you get your first pay stub so they have your work information.

A couple things that can get tricky.

1. If you live off of disability income this is not taxed. When you start working and still receiving disability income for your trial period, your disability income is now taxable so you will have to pay taxes on your 6 months worth of disability payments so save up for this.

2. If you decide that you can not continue working I would provide doctors notes to your local social security office stating why you can not continue work. Otherwise, it's up to someone deep within the bowels of the Social Security department to come up an arbitrary call that might go against you. It's happened to me. They determined that I should have been able to work when I could not and that I should not have received disability payments so I owed them.

It's been a while but I believe that your disability work trial period resets every 2 years but need clarification on this.

If you are permanently disabled you can still work, have employer insurance and still receive medicaid/care but then you have additional premiums which may or may not help. 

Like I said, I would highly suggest going to your local office and ask questions or visit their website.

Good luck. Hope things work out for you.",,,,iamhotwheels,,,1513134473,t5_2qhe8,t3_7jbflr,t3_7jbflr,2,1514652281,0,0,dr64n7o,disability,,,,,

I have not used Dragon on a Mac, but have used versions 9, 10, 11, and 13 on the PC. For reference, I'm a student and a creative writer; the words I use aren't too technical, which is something you want to keep in mind as using more jargon requires more training.

You’re also basically looking at a Permobile or a Quantum for your chair manufacturer — they’re the best. Permobile has always been really nice, and their equipment is very modular in case you need to make adjustments later. 

However, Quantum redesigned their flagship chair a couple years ago. It’s now the Quantum Q6 Edge 2.0. They kept all of the great features and solidness of the Q6 Edge, but they gave it a sleeker and more modern look. They also copied most of the important parts of Permobile’s modularity by incorporating more, longer, and better accessory rails, and by installing multiple user-adjustable settings especially in the seat and back areas. It’s the best of both worlds in my opinion, and I really love mine.

*That being said*, if you are someone who needs to put a lot of weight on the armrests, the Edge 2.0 may not be best.

No. You shouldn’t be given any blood tests or anything like that. Just psychological tests.  

Really explain why your situation is bad. Don’t be afraid to be personal with them either. They are there to listen and help you. This is a very important step in the process. Make use of the time there and they will guide you in the right direction.

163,"I just now saw your reply. It sounds like you have a really different disease than me, one that limits your ability but not your energy as much. Did I read your post correctly? With or without a wheelchair I wouldn’t be able to get out as far. 

I am in the U.K. I am currently not using a wheelchair. I would definitely need an electric one because my cells are damaged. I wasn’t wheelchair bound before coming to school but may be when I leave due to the toll pushing beyond my limits is taking on my body.

There is delivery but to get it I have to pick it up at the front gate of my college. In order to do that I need to walk .3 miles (father than to get to the dining hall). Obviously if I could get meals delivered when I am sick it would change everything.

I admire your energy and spirit for life. I used to be like that (and still am but I’m a different way). The biggest challenge is that any ATP sink affects me in a similar way (walking, wheeling a wheelchair, learning how to use an electric chair, waiting in the cold for the elevator operator, constantly explaining why I am in a wheelchair or can’t do x,y,z). Most of the people with this disease my mentor has said spend the majority of their time in their room. What I haven’t figured out yet is how those other students got food.

If I did get a wheelchair wouldn’t it be weird if I used it sometimes to get to/from the dining hall but then not other times? Wouldn’t people notice and then start to ask questions or judge me for “faking” the rest of the time?

Some mornings I am so tired I drag myself across the room to get medicine, my whole body feels like lead was pourned in my muscles. On those days I barely get to class and am always late.

168," Sorry I didn't reply earlier.  I misread the tone of your response and thought you didn't want a reply.   Communicating in text is funny like that.     

Really the only thing I can say is to keep trying to get adequate healthcare.   It sucks that those of us who need healthcare most are sometimes least able to advocate for themselves.  I would imagine that the right doctor could figure out your facial pain and spasms, the right psychiatrist could get you on meds that are right for your brain chemistry,  the right physiotherapist could reduce your pain.... My dad always told me when I was fed up with searching for a diagnosis,  ""the doctor who will diagnose you and help you get better is out there.  You just have to keep trying to find them. ""  And he was right.   Sticking with the search was the hardest,  most frustrating thing I've done,  but it was worth it.   So that's the best advice I have.  
    
One other thing that stood out to me was that you were unhappy with the services you had received because they were repetitive and unhelpful.   Definitely speak up about that and any other concerns you have about treatment.     
  
Sorry that's all I've got.  Anything else goes beyond the scope of a Reddit discussion.   I know its not super helpful,  but that's why IRL services are so important.

170,"Another hyperacusis sufferer here with a severe case. My hyperacusis sounds about as bad as yours (I can only talk for about an hour a day and have been basically housebound for years) but yikes at barely being able to use sound protection. I couldn't cope without mine.

My right hand and left wrist are messed up, so I understand how hard it can be not having ways to express yourself, or things like gaming for escapism.

As for your question, I don't know if this would work for you, but I write using a combination of a smartNav AT head tracker (the version with the dwell clicking software: https://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/) and a free program called dasher (http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/). The head tracker isn't cheap (though maybe a used one could be purchased cheaper, there are also eye trackers but I'm not sure how well they'd work with dasher, better or worse), but it's hands-free. It does take a little getting used to and isn't as quick as typing, but it's not all that slow either after getting used to it. I've been writing a novel with it which has helped me quite a lot mentally and emotionally while also having a chance at earning income. It gives me something to strive for, and a way to express myself with a world to escape to and play in.

I want to repeat that it does take some getting used to the head tracker, and learning to write prose as well, but I can definitely get the words flowing using this method.

There's also apparently a lot of work out there on the internet for freelance writers. I haven't gotten into it because the pressure of work is just too much when I'm stuggling to handle my situation mentally and emotionally as it is, and working on a novel doubles to help make me feel better at the same time.

That's another reason writing stories might work for you as well because of the other problems you mentioned -- with self-publishing, you can work at your own pace. It's not quick money, though, as writing novels takes a while, and it's not guaranteed money, either, but I think it's worth trying if you can. If you can handle the freelance writing though, the money would be a lot faster and more reliable. I've read that it can be pretty decent money too if you can put in the hours.

Mood-wise, I recently regained the ability to do a little art, but it's with my non-dominant hand so it's clumsy and at most I can only manage about an hour a day, but between that and the writing, it's improved my mood so, *so* much. It's made the difference between uncontrollable suicidal thoughts multiple times daily and having them occasionally and with far less intensity, so maybe writing could help your mood too.

It's also possible to play some types of games with the head tracker too, but honestly it is really limited to which games you can play. It might be worth looking into the ablegamers charity or the disabled gamers subreddit, they might be able to help more with ways to play games without using your hands. Custom controllers might be possible too, but I don't know much about them or how much they cost though doubt there are many, if any, cheap options.

I understand the fear of being unable to support yourself and how hard it is that society requires sound. What you're going through is clearly brutal, but I've found that though it's crazy hard and takes effort, finding some happiness amidst the misery can be possible, and I enjoy the happiness as much as I can.

You want to know something? I was tucked up on the sofa when I read your post on my phone. I got up, took my wrist splints off, transferred to my wheelchair, pushed to my office chair, transferred again, booted up my TTS, and 'wrote' out the above reply to you. It took several tries, because guess what? I also have hyperacusis and couldn't find my earplugs, which sit in-ear so I don't feel like ripping my face off when my cluster headaches and/or TMJ decide to be a pain in the ass. 

Like many people with a disability I struggle with focus, another giant pain in the ass, especially at night when I'm really tired. It took me a long time. When I was finished, I had to go replace my cath, because I'd pulled it out moving to talk to you. I took an extra painkiller because I'd stayed up a bit too late, I put my splints for my fucked up hands back on, and I went to sleep. 

I can't drive. I have to get my shopping delivered. I need home care. I didn't shower for three days last week because I physically couldn't transfer myself. I spent a long time unable to cook for myself, I ate bread and crisps because I didn't have parents to help me out and couldn't afford to hire someone. With a couple of aids in the kitchen, I can do that now. It's incredible. I'm the first to want to share the ways I've found around obstacles because I'm so grateful to have found a way.

I had one lawyer for a year who dropped me a month I think it was before my hearing and wouldn't explain why aside from that they didn't think they would win. Then the next one dropped me right before the hearing and explained there was nothing in the medical documentation of my case file that indicated I was disabled. It was only after I got a copy of the medical info that revealed that they had no listings for the entire year before my hearing when I was seeing doctors - which was something that was incredibly difficult for me to do and something they said was needed for my case.

So yeah, the disability office makes a request to doctors for information, but what they have doesn't get updated automatically, they have to specifically make another request, which they didn't even do in my case until after my hearing was rescheduled, and if I recall correctly, there was some form that they gave me to make a second request for any additional info.",,,,SilentlyStriving,"Hyperacusis, hand injury, bursitis",,1512352258,t5_2qhe8,t3_7gx0bt,t1_dqp7vpj,1,1514320243,0,0,dqq9jd3,disability,,,,,

211,"First, I'd recommend checking out r/ehlersdanlos. There a lot of EDS people who are helpful and full of information and experience to share.

In terms of crutches, try them out. I found that underarm (aka A-frame) crutches didn't work very well for me, apparently the people that designed didn't factor in elbows that bent backwards. I ended up getting all twisted and tangled up in them. 

I ended up getting a pair of forearm crutches. After a number of failed attempts at orders from medical supply places (for some reason it was back-ordered everywhere), I ended ordering a set from Amazon. They were like $50-70 for some basic ones.  Depending on insurance and what you can take your doctor into, should be even cheaper, but you'll have less control of the specifics. If you just do a search for forearm crutches on Amazon you'll see see some of the variety out there. Some people swear by a specific fancy type call Smart Crutches. Don't have any experience myself. 

Virtually all of them have some basic height adjustment in the base. I quickly added some socks for padding and found a padded pair of biking gloves to help give my hands some padding. 

Nowadays (may 2-3 years using them) I've gotten some pads designed specifically for forearm crutch cuffs. They can in a selection of colors, not sure where there where ordered from but if you're interested I can dig it up. My hands toughened up that about the time that I wore out the bike gloves (maybe 6 months), I didn't need them any more. 

I'm sure if you ask the same question over at r/ehlersdanlos you'll get a bunch of answers from other people with hEDS.",,,,dnabre,,,1512179771,t5_2qhe8,t3_7gzkaj,t3_7gzkaj,2,1514253087,0,0,dqn0z7x,disability,,,,,

214,"First, just drop out. Reduce the amount of online media and news you consume. You will feel better. Reduce the amount of political media you consume even further, and you’ll feel better still. I’m not saying ignore it entirely, but a quick check-in is enough to stay abreast of what’s happening,

There is no point in worrying about what could be or might be or may be until it is what will be. So much of our pain and anguish (as people in general, not disabled people specifically) comes from a fixation on the future and the past, along with  a desire to control it. It’s impossible. There is nothing to do about it right now. When it is a guarantee, you should plan for it. When there is an action that can be taken, take that action. When all there is to do is stress, remember that this moment is the only one you have. Relax and embrace what is actually happening. 

Don’t hit me for saying meditation. It’s become a buzzword recently, but it is a solid portion of what saved my life almost ten years ago. It helps to keep things in focus and calm you mind. Hit me up if you want help/more information/whatever.

That’s all I have. There is nothing to be done at the moment — nothing will stop them from passing this because they see it as a major policy victory. Eventually Trump will be gone and we’ll begin repairing the shit he broke. It may take a while, but until that happens we have to adjust. Short of leaving the country, there’s nothing else to be done. No amount of stress and anxiety will fix that, so why ruin your life with unproductive worry?

225,"Yeah. I'm gonna step out of character for this one. 

I feel for you, my wife has multiple issues and we've struggled for years. I'd like to say it's all gonna be good and get better, but if I'm going to be serious, I can't truthfully say that here. 

Instead, I'm going to give some suggestions here and let you see if any helps you, or others that see this. 

Therapy. Doesn't have to be professional. Support Groups are great places to go and realize you're not alone. Work on your Google fu and see what's around you and what forums you can find. 

Arts and crafts. Seriously people. I built cat condos and natural cat trees designed for people's houses and desires. Started as making something because we couldn't afford the expensive ones. Winter hit and had time to try again. Wife sold the first one to a friend after they offered cash. Realized how much those trees cost as opposed to what they sell for. Most of that money is wrapped up in my time. I have sleep issues, so it works out well and has grown without trying. 

Same thing for the wife, she sees up cat sleeping bags and little pop up tent napping beds. She also makes cat hammocks using 1/2 inch conduit as support. 

Cash can be hidden and locked in a safe at home. Nice to finally have something to lean on when something breaks. 

Also nice to be able to give to the local food bank during the holidays. We used them in the past and now that we are more stable, we give some back when we have enough orders to make that reserve a little bigger. 

Also, use the food banks, check online with medical companies and pharmaceutical companies. Most have some kind of outreach and coupon program. Local shelters, food banks, and soup kitchens have a list of places for uninsured and poor people to check with to receive reduced cost services. 

It's embarrassing, it sucks, it causes anxiety, and tests your humility. But dammit people, they're there to help. Give back by donating time if you feel you need to, but don't pass up on it if you need help. 

We all need help once in a while. Don't say there's nothing you can do. Figure out what you can do make it fit in this fucked up place we live in. 

I carry socks and a tire repair kit in my vehicle. I will always stop and help fix a tire of it looks like they need help. And those socks might be the shitty dollar store ones, but I can attest that having clean socks on your feet, even once in a while, when you're homeless  and cold is something most people will never fully grasp the understanding of. Those signs that say *Anything helps* really means ANYTHING to someone whose really homeless and panhandling. 

I'm on mobile so I'm stopping here for now. I'm sure the formatting is butchered and there are enough typos. Feel free to PM me (any of you seeing this) if you want to. I'll help where I can. There's too much apathy in the world right now for me to stand by and not help. I'm not made that way.

244,"Two ways I can think of.

1) Give them a set amount in cash every week. This should be an amount that you know (from past experience) will cover all your food and laundry requirements almost exactly (i.e it will either be *just* enough or you will be left with a small amount of change). It should be made clear to them that you know the amount you've given should cover all items so if money goes missing that means something has gone wrong on their end somewhere. This is what I do. It makes them shop smart and keeps them on edge just a little bit. In about 7 years, a carer has only ever once or twice told me there hasn't been enough money and asked me if I can give them a few extra pounds to buy one or two necessary items. 

2) Better than the above is to get a pre-paid card and transfer money to it weekly from your bank account in exact amounts using the logic above (i.e. the same each week that you know will cover expenses. No large amounts). Again this lets them know there is a hard limit and also lets them know that you know that if something goes wrong then something must have happened on their end to mess it up.

Do you have a disability? Well technically yes.

During the interview stage if they ask again if you have a disability, I tend to rearrange the sentence in my answer ""I'm not disabled, I do have a medical condition, but it will not impact my ability to function or work, I have a good medical team, I can provide any clearance and restriction documentation you need""

(this is irrelevant for me, I am disabled and a lot of types of work are inaccessible, so I'm very open in telling employers ""I am disabled"" because there's no point wasting anyone's time just to find out I can't actually do the job) 

The problem with the question ""do you have a disability?"" is binary, and doesn't actually give the employer the information they really need.

Like ""Yes, I have a disability, I'm missing my right foot"" isn't relevant if you're applying for a seasonal job just answering outbound customer service calls from your own home office. 

Basically, with the current system ""do you have a disability?"" first you have to figure out what is the company is actually asking, then answer that, it's not a straightforward question so it's impossible to give a straightforward answer.

If the person without a foot said ""no, I don't have a disability"" and got the job to answer phone calls from home, that's no problem, until they tell you that company induction is on site, and it's going to be 3x8 hour shifts on your feet while you stand around listening to company guidelines and values, well now this guy has to say ""can I get a chair? I'm missing a foot"" and the employer will probably wonder why he didn't tick ""yes, I have a disability"" even though what they really meant was ""do you have a condition that could effect your work?"" and you could have said ""no"" and later added ""this condition doesn't effect my work, but it does effect this induction, which is drastically different from my expected work duties"" and everyone could have been clear and honest from the get go that way.

What do we need to help you"" it's actually asking ""Are you part of a minority that has been systematically and socially held back? will answering this question raise fears that doors will close in your face without taking into account your ability, while not answering this question will remove the ramps you need to get into the open doors, so either answer you give you feel you got fucked?""

Tick ""No"" if you truly believe your condition will not impact your work even remotely. 

Tick ""Yes"" to weed out employers that likely won't provide medically nessesary accommodations you do need.","[{'start': 3, 'end': 13, 'entity_type': 'LOCATION', 'text': '<LOCATION>', 'operator': 'replace'}]"

283,"I don't think your father's racist, I think it's PRIDE that is standing in his way. He has to understand that it's not taking a handout, but rather getting what is OWED to him. Every pay check he received the govt took his money and set it aside for when he needed it. That being said, it is not so easy to take what is yours. 

I am 50 y/o with multiple, well documented (1300+ pages), illnesses. It took 5 years with the help of an attorney to get SSDI.  I survived off welfare, food stamps, and the generosity of my children. 

Your dad needs to understand that there are very few people on SSDI who do not belong there. Some have died waiting for approval. There is no shame in getting the help you need. Even things like welfare are paid with his tax money. And if it helps, tell him either he takes it, or some refugee will! jk

The first thing he needs to do is go to the doctor to find out exactly what is going on with him. Make sure the doctor would be willing to write a letter on his behalf for disability. 

Once he has confirmation there is a serious problem, get an attorney. Personally, I would avoid the large, commercial firms. Select a lesser known, local attorney who can give him the attention he will need in this case. He will need one not only to help fill out the application, but for all the BS SSA will throw at him. 

Then, wait... and wait.... and wait some more. I do not say this to discourage you (or him) But it is a waiting game and whomever holds out the longest will win.

Once a doctor has made a diagnosis, one has to apply for ""disability,"" either SSI or SSDI or both. Applying involves filling out forms and providing medical records attesting to the condition which has rendered that person unable to work. 

Many people are denied benefits on the first application, even those with long term, well documented illnesses. An appeal process is available (which can vary somewhat on your state).  The average time for an application with an appeal to go through all stages is about 2 years. There are many articles linked here on this sub that talk about the long wait times.

He needs to be diagnosed with something that prevents him from working. After you have medical records, you can file for SSI or SSDI or both on your own,  or hire an atty to handle the case. But you MUST have medical records showing diagnosed illness/es. And he needs to tell the doctor absolutely everything that is wrong with him. 

It is not ""sketchy"" people on it for the most part. I'm sure there are some. But SSA and the judges are pretty good at weeding out those cases. It's NOT a corrupt system. It's there to help people like me who cannot work anymore. There are no ""tricks"" to be done to get on it. It's not the doctor that you have to convince, it's SSA. Although, SSA sometimes does send people to doctors on their payroll. I had to go to 2 of those. 

Depending on his case, this could take anywhere from 6 months to 4 years after he files, so you will still be giving him that allowance for a while.

People with mobility challenges face different issues than those with developmental or sensory disabilities. You'll find it difficult or impossible to satisfy everyone's needs on every tour, so you need to rethink your premise.

The easiest and most helpful thing that you can do right away is present as much information as possible to prospective attendees. If you are very explicit about the event, people will at least be able to decide for themselves if it is appropriate for them. How much walking is involved? How would it be for someone in a wheelchair, or with crutches, or a walker? How would it be for someone with a vision or hearing impairment? Create an accessibility webpage for your event (be sure to make the webpage itself accessible) that includes as much detail as possible. Provide an email address or phone number to contact if the person has any concerns or questions. Be sure the person that responds to those questions knows what they are talking about.

When I consider going to a new venue or attending an event, I always check the accessibility. If there is little or no information readily available I often times give up on it. Even the mere existence of detailed accessibility information suggests to me that the venue or event operator has at least considered accessibility issues, and is likely to have provided reasonable accommodations.

1. I travel with a custom manual wheelchair that is skinnier than many people
2. Tours could ABSOLUTELY be more accessible
3. Ensuring the touring area is possible to complete in a stroller typically means a somebody using wheelchair or walker could also complete it, but not always. If alternative pathways are necessary, know where they are and direct people to them. Wait to continue the tour until they get there. Try doing the tour yourself using a wheelchair. You'll get a whole new vantage point and possibly see problems you otherwise would have missed. Likewise, try doing the tour blind. See if you have reliable access to accessible bathrooms. Does the elevator regularly break? Are there some areas/exhibits that cannot be seen or visited because of physical limitations? How easily can somebody's service dog get around? Etc.
4. The absolute best thing (and one of the cheapest!!) you can do to help people with disabilities enjoy your tour is to have an easy to find web page that details the accessibility aspects of the tour, whether that is mentioning noise, steps, lack of restrooms, big hills, cobblestone/rough terrain, length of tour, whether there will be a chance to catch your breath etc. This allows people to know if they can manage your tour or not. This would be a *massive* help! 
5. Find people with all sorts of disabilities and have them demo your tour and provide specific feedback along with suggestions on how to fix things. You'll be surprised--little, easy fixes can go a long way!!

294,"I am Autistic. In my experience traveling, sensory problems are the biggest concerns for me.

Offering sensory friendly/“mellow” yours is a great idea. It doesn’t nexessarily have to targetted at autistic folks, but you should clarify what specific things are done on the tour regardless.

Ideas for this:

Going through the quieter/back roads of a city, preferably a part with non-bumpy roads if possible. 

Asking people to not wear perfume or bring scented things.

Providing some method for people with auditory processing difficulties (and d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing people) to access what the tour guide is saying. Perhaps a script, or headphones that connect to the audio of a mic, etc. Also perhaps providing cheapo sunglasses for people to borrow (although most people may be able to bring these themselves, so it’s less of a concern).

Explicitly stating what food will be offered (if any). Offering alternatives (“Here are some local restaraunts! These are their price ranges. This is the kind of food they serve”.)

Many autistic people have epilepsy (and it’s a good thing to worry about anyway) so being conscious of flashing or strobing lights, and knowing what to do in case of a seizure.

Optional “agendas” for tours - a lot of us have a lot of anxiety if there’s no predictability and we don’t know what’s going to be happening when - so even just a list of the stops, possible time for food or breaks, etc - would be helpful.

Of course, all of these combined would be great, but even one would make the tours vastly more accessible.

Also, I agree with Benjogias! There’s a reason this subreddit isn’t called /r/DifferentlyAbled or /r/DifferentAbilities or the such. Most of us prefer “disabled” or “person with a disability”.

Depending on your budget/disability support, of course. I'm not sure how often you anticipate needing these services while you work on finding a replacement.

If they needed specialized knowledge, I wouldn't recommend this, but since you're otherwise able to do this with just your guide dog it might be okay for last minute situations like this one. I know we usually think of sitters as something parents hire when they need someone to watch their kids, but people with elderly parents or who are recovering from surgery and wouldn't otherwise have the support they need often do the same.

Other cheaper solutions would be to look for non-profit agencies in your area that can provide volunteers to make sure you can get to career events.

I've never heard of the condition you described but a large part of disability stems around just general unawareness. 

What I have found is that those who stare or make mean comments are people who just don't understand. 

The best way to counter the negativity is to educate people. Once they know about her condition, they'll be less fearful. 

Your sister has really got to show people that even with her disability she is still capable of being a friend, having a personality, and being productive in society. 

People look for these qualities regardless of whether a disability exist because it's about showing yourself as a person, and being more than just disabled. 

It sucks having to build and develop confidence but rejection is just part of that process. People will reject you for the most trivial of reasons that may or may not relate to a disability. 

The important thing with rejection is to keep going and move on. Eventually, she will find someone that accepts her. 

I liken rejection to the job process that lots of people go through. If you get rejected from a job interview, do you just stop searching for a job? 

The answer is no you don't because to survive and pay your bills you have to keep searching. There's going to be a lot of rejection in the job search but eventually people do eventually get a job. 

Ask your sister if she listened to every no that she was told if she would be where she is today. 


Your sister seems to have successfully graduated high school and is now in college. That's huge. Not to mention the fact that she's attending an out of state school, which many people disabled or not may not get the opportunity to do. 


I grew up as the only physically disabled kid with a visible disability in all of my classes up until law school. I was told that I wasn't good enough for AP/honors classes yet I still graduated in the 1st quarter of my high school class.

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is in the same family of connective tissue disorders, rarely diagnosed and very poorly understood.

I did go to our national conference for the first time a few years ago, again not much representation (it's very expensive, I was lucky to get a scholarship to cover the conference fee but everything else was on me. The last two years I could not afford it so that's one last WOC face in the  crowd.) That said though, it was immensely helpful to be among hundreds of people going through the similar health struggles as me regardless of color. If it's the OI national conference, I would not hesitate to reach out and ask about young adult groups offered at the conference. The EDS national conference is I'm sure far smaller but we do have a young adult group (my issue was that I didn't think I fell in that age group because no where was it specified but come to find out....) Myself and one other person that I know of, regularly bring the lack of representation up to the EDS Society. Sometimes you gotta be that person and push for what you want to see. 

I would also reach out to Vilissa Thomson, she also has OI and the bulk of her work as a social worker is basically disability and race (specifically WOC). [Ramp Your Voice]( http://rampyourvoice.com/welcome-to-ramp-your-voice/)  Her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VilissaThompson?s=09)  

I'd also encourage her to check out the ""Cripple Punk"" movement on Tumblr. Unfortunately the founder just passed but their friends are keeping it alive. It was immensely helpful to me in learning not to give a shit about going out with my braces and crutches, feeling like I look like a pitiful disaster.

I definitely have my moments of grieving and processing what's happening to me. Sometimes it's a fleeting moment and sometimes it hangs a lot longer. I've lost school, I've lost work, I've lost hobbies, I've lost friends...It's a lot. Sometimes it feels like too much and like no one can really help... Some days it's hard to want the help. I get that. I get that it's hard for my family to watch and be rather helpless... I know the only way I get through is to push to make those connections, whether it's Facebook groups, Tumblr's chronically ill and disabled community, in person groups... I have 3 regular friends from my local EDS meeting that are my life line - I don't care for that meeting any more but those 3 people...!

I did go to our national conference for the first time a few years ago, again not much representation (it's very expensive, I was lucky to get a scholarship to cover the conference fee but everything else was on me. The last two years I could not afford it so that's one last WOC face in the  crowd.) That said though, it was immensely helpful to be among hundreds of people going through the similar health struggles as me regardless of color. If it's the OI national conference, I would not hesitate to reach out and ask about young adult groups offered at the conference. The EDS national conference is I'm sure far smaller but we do have a young adult group (my issue was that I didn't think I fell in that age group because no where was it specified but come to find out....) Myself and one other person that I know of, regularly bring the lack of representation up to the EDS Society. Sometimes you gotta be that person and push for what you want to see. 

I would also reach out to <PERSON>, she also has OI and the bulk of her work as a social worker is basically disability and race (specifically WOC). [Ramp Your Voice]( <URL>)  Her [Twitter](<URL>)  

I'd also encourage her to check out the ""Cripple Punk"" movement on Tumblr. Unfortunately the founder just passed but their friends are keeping it alive. It was immensely helpful to me in learning not to give a shit about going out with my braces and crutches, feeling like I look like a pitiful disaster.

I definitely have my moments of grieving and processing what's happening to me. Sometimes it's a fleeting moment and sometimes it hangs a lot longer. I've lost school, I've lost work, I've lost hobbies, I've lost <URL>'s a lot. Sometimes it feels like too much and like no one can really help... Some days it's hard to want the help. I get that. I get that it's hard for my family to watch and be rather helpless... I know the only way I get through is to push to make those connections, whether it's Facebook groups, Tumblr's chronically ill and disabled community, in person groups... I have 3 regular friends from my local EDS meeting that are my life line - I don't care for that meeting any more but those 3 people...! It's not easy and I've had to hit bottom a lot of times to get the motivation and courage to do those things for myself. 

And if she wants to talk to me, you know to a degree I get OI but I don't live it specifically so I don't know if she'd feel comfortable, but if she does I'm more than happy to chat.

Recently my sister told me that the reason she doesn't reach out to support groups is that her problems (physical pain, people staring, etc.) won't go away if she talks to other people about it, and she doesn't want to associate herself with disability at all (???). She seems really set in the idea that a support group won't help her?

If you don't mind me asking, how were you able to overcome others' opinions and condescension?

How did you cope with prejudice? Did you have to ""come to terms"" with accepting your disability?

I don't have the option of not using my walker or wheelchair. There's no way for me not to use it. 

I know people that do try to hide their disability like the ways you mentioned such as avoiding using their cane. However, it is extremely dangerous. As you get older you can't risk falls and injuries the way you could when you were a kid. It's not worth it ending up in the emergency room and racking up the insurance bills. 

Plus, when you spend as much time in the disability community as I have, you get to have a pretty good eye for spotting the people trying to pass. While I could never diagnosis somebody, I can usually tell when somebody has Autism or Asperger Syndrome. 

Honestly, the more open and honest you are about it the more people will leave you alone about it. If you're closed off about it, people will sense that's an issue and it's something that bullies will pick up on. 

That said, having a disability, unfortunately sucks and as hard as it is you truly just have to have thick skin. I've gotten flack for saying that, but it's true. Everything that makes someone different in this world is going to have to be a struggle because that's just the world we live in. Prejudice is everywhere and in every human being.

I don't really have brand recommendations - I buy shoes so rarely - but I'm sure there's ways to find out which might be best. Asking another sub, going to a store, Googling, etc. I just noticed a vast difference when I did buy shoes last time, because all the sole rubbed off on my old pair.

She also got my Medicare started so the two year waiting period could be underway.  This allowed me to fully focus on learning how to live in and operate my new, legless form.

  As much as me and her didn't work as a couple (very bad relationship actually), she worked harder than even my own family to help get things done while I was in a coma.  She actually had to be the one to decide to amputate, because my father wouldn't make the choice.  That decision is what ended up saving my life.  I was going to die.  With the amputation, I was given at least a 2% chance.  It worked clearly. 

  Just goes to show you that you never fully know some people.  I had a decent life insurance policy and I hadn't taken her off it yet.  Before the accident, I would have sworn to you that she would have let me die.  I'm glad I was wrong.

I had to switch from public school to cyber school due to my Extreme anxiety and panic attacks. When I was 18 I started looking for jobs. Applied everywhere. Then I broke down one night because I actually thought about what itd be like working those jobs. Previously for graduation I helped out at my local library. I had to run outside the one time because of my anxiety. Every day helping out there was hell. And it was only for 3 hours every other day. 

Then I got a job I thought I could do.. it was a work from home Apple tech support job. I was good with technology and thought working from home would be my best bet. I never even worried about the talking on the phone aspect. Even though my mom always called for my appointments because talking on the phone was a trigger for me.. I didn't care or think it'd be a problem at the time. Unfortunately it ended horribly. First phone call nothing happened but I broke down completely and had the longest worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was dying. 

After that. I tried going back but the same thing happened. I cried so hard. I thought what am I going to do if I can't work. Suicide was in mind. Then I found out about SSI, it was my only chance at living for me. If I hadn't gotten approved, I don't know if I'd still be here.

Be very honest on your app. Write about your suicide attempt (I was very honest about mine, and I think it helps to show the claims specialists the scope and severity of the issues). Contact all your doctors that you’ve worked with—Social Security will be getting a hold of them to have them complete paperwork and/or send in your file.

366,"Respectfully, I totally disagree that this doesn't apply to wheelchairs as well.  For example, I can absolutely tell the-company-formerly-known-as Ti-Lite my exact chairs specs. They have a welding/frame customization capability that matches up comparably to a sports bike company. And their manufacturer retail price is also comparable...except it's a wheelchair, so you can't order directly from the manufacturer. You're forced to order through distributors that adds (I literally just did this and this was the amount) a 15K fee onto a 3-4K chair. A consumer who, perhaps, doesn't dig through the paperwork to discern the MSRP from the added on fees might think the sports chair is a 15-20K chair. It's not. The price comes from the system that charges outrageously because it can.

At least manual wheelchairs have a *quality* that is comparable to sports bikes, if not a price. Generic power chairs--not even touching on the ones that need personalized customization--are insanely overpriced. We're talking 14K (before all those fees) for a device with a quality, endurance, battery life, speed, and maneuverability that would barely pass muster for a $500 leisure/sports device. 

TL;DR Wheelchairs are absolutely overpriced, and this is not at all coming from customization needs.

You don't need a medical bracelet, those don't save your life. If there are medications you can't have or conditions you want to warn others about, tape a sticky note to your desk and/or put something with your work badge and let others know where the list is... a bracelet is silly. It's a personal choice and poses no liability to the university if something were to happen to you. I think it's okay to tell your manager or whoever it is that your current desk actually works best for you and you'd prefer to stay there. I'd say say that you'd prefer to be treated like everyone else, but that you were also assured that telecommuting x number of days was a possibility when you accepted the position. 
I'd have these conversations with HR only and not your manager. When your permanent person gets settled in, sit down with them and talk about it... chances are good they'll work with you.

Most tenants healthy or otherwise are an endless headache.  He could have been polite with a nice tone, absolutely. He could have said ""Do you need any sort of accommodations I can help you with?"" or something.  I agree.

When dealing with a potential landlord, kill them with kindness, bite your tongue, and don't take much they say personally. They arent your friend, they are the landlord. Once you sign a lease (and ALWAYS sign a lease) you are in a position of power.... with rights. If he treats you like shit, wont fix things or plays fast and loose with the terms of the lease, beat him over the head (legally) with the lease. 

He knows what kind of power a smart tenant has... so most of them come off as bullies. Don't take it personally.  Pay the rent ahead of time, keep a meticulous paper trail, take 1001 dated photos the day you move in and the day you leave and of every problem in between.

And like everyone else in life, he can treat you like shit pretty much consequence free.

Unless he violates some line in the ADA. Then use it.

Then again, be aware that the kind of landlord you meet will be the kind of person youll have to deal with for the term.... so pick your poison.

No matter what kind of asshole he acts like, if you pay on time/ahead of time and don't mess up the rental.... you wont have any problems.  Make sure you are good with the lease before you sign it.  If its a good place and you can pay, I'd learn to ignore the landlord's attitude.

But I do have some advice since I am also disabled,  although it's only been a year and a half for myself.  Try to develop a thick skin and not care what others think it will help you in the long run.  90% or more of the general population can't even fathom or imagine how it is to be disabled so most of the time it's due to low empathy and ignorance.

520,"Yes, it is easier for me to read print than electronic media. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that it takes me a disproportionate amount of time to figure out what's even being asked of me, before I can even begin the assignment. This professor also tends to use questions that, to me, all seem to be asking the same thing. I tried to just say that a few times, but she got pissed so I started asking my socially-literate boyfriend to decode the questions for me. He's not in education, though, so he doesn't really have the context and just has to kinda guess based on his social knowledge. 

Yes, I am able to use reddit pretty well, but only for short bits of text. Huge walls of paragraphs, I just skip. If it's too long, I know I won't be able to focus and understand it. But I also have the advantage of text magnification here, where I don't always get that with the material given to me in the classes. Sometimes it's a blurry photocopy in a pdf that I can't use a screen reader on or really read the words well. Or the photocopy is tilted so all the words slant. 

And i will also admit that I have organization issues, and I tried my hardest to write down every assignment in multiple places and to manage my time so I got it all done, and I still failed. Sometimes an assignment would slip through the cracks. Sometimes I would think I've finished it when I haven't turned it in. Sometimes I'd forget to do replies on a discussion board. So part of the problem is executive function, as well as my eyes and my processing ability. 

I mean, for comparison: I got all A's and one B in all the rest of my classes this semester. Almost all of my education classes have been A's, with only a handful of B's. My online classes? D and F. When I did a year of online school in 10th grade, I made C's and D's for the first time in my life--I had been a straight-A student until then. Once I got back to my brick-and-mortar school, I made A's again.

Just like you don't have your assistant / friend / family hook you down/unhook you from a bus, you have the person who is trained in the specialty transport vehicle. Having a specialty person to handle things in an emergency seems more safe than a bunch of people who aren't as sure of protocol and may not be near by during an accident. They would never pass this sort of thing until there is a clearly defined safety procedure for it and having a person there to make sure it goes smoothly was an idea that's not all that far-fetched to ensure something happens safely.

543,"The whole point of this system is that the wheelchair goes in the place of a seat that would normally be there so I don't see how it would block an aisle or create chaos and havoc. Currently, there is no priority seating system on aircraft to situate wheelchair users near emergency exits so in order to get on/off the plane, a member of cabin crew had to get a narrow wheelchair out of a storage compartment, take it down the aisle, help the disabled person out of their seat and into the chair, strap them in, then go to an exit. Most wheelchair users that cannot transfer independently have someone with them to assist or the cabin crew will help them do I don't see why they would need to hire someone to do something they have to do already. Allowing someone to have their own wheelchair on board would reduce a lot of the current issues surrounding evacuation of disabled passengers. IMO it is easier to remove clamps from a wheelchair and let them get themselves to a door rather than having to go through the current process.

Then would there be chair standards/requirements for size and what not?

Potentially old work credits and special circumstance are worth looking into. It’s a phone call, why not? Something might apply and help.

The dad owns his own business, which has either inventory or equipment that almost certainly goes over the family limit. So she’s probably only eligible via divorce. Doesn’t change the property limits you stated, except to say her now-ex-husband doesn’t have to worry about them.

Work credits expire after 5 years. But more importantly, she did not work outside the home.

There is no special or minimum payment that you get if you don't qualify, like you infer in the 'Disability' paragraph.

577,"Sorry, just because I made a rather specific suggestion about looking into divorce I want to clarify a bit further: for a private home to be exempt, you have to be 1) Living in it, and 2) *have an ownership interest*. For most people the ownership interest is either the deed or by marriage.

Where OP could hit a snag here is that if Mom never worked, she might not be on the loan/deed. That’s fine under normal circumstances since they’re married, but, if they can’t qualify for SSI normally and decide to get divorced to qualify, it becomes an issue again as mom is now living in a home for free, without ownership interest, with someone who does own it. Now it becomes payment in kind and negatively affects her SSI payments.

It could actually be *great* for her if she is on the deed. In fact, I would suggest OP talk to a lawyer about making that happen before taking any steps toward the Divorce/SSI combo.

*e: I realized now that I used “friend” in my original response which may have caused the confusion. I chose “friend” because theoretically they’re divorced in this scenario, but you can still owe “rent” via payment in kind deductions to anyone you live with — even a former spouse, in the home where you used to live as a married couple — if the situation is right.*

579,"Sadly, I do not believe that she will be eligible for SSDI if she truly does not have any work credits. However, she should therefore qualify for SSI. Also, since she is under the age of 65 and at this point, not disabled, she needs to apply for whatever your State medical coverage is. I live in California and it is called ""Medi-Cal"" which is not Medicare because it is not for 65+ or disabled. So yea, I guess that is Medicaid (wasn't sure if that applied outside of Medicare though since our state also calls individuals dual Medi-Cal and Medicare eligibles and I was just trying to give an example of my state where it could perhaps have a slight variation to the name. This program should cover all of her medical expenses (assuming that the financial requirements are indeed at eligible levels as financially unstable may still be too high to meet the income thresholds). Sometimes one can get partial assistance with these programs too if the income is too high but I would check more at the state level at this juncture in time since she, from what you're telling us, is not eligible for ""full on disability"" and clearly needs medical coverage between now and when she turns 65.

Another possible way to get medical coverage quickly may be through applying for food stamps. Once again, this probably varies greatly from state to state but maybe is another avenue to look into.

580,"OK, take everything I say with a grain of salt and make sure to check up with the relevant sources, because some things vary from case-to-case.

Depending on how poorly off they are financially now, she might be able to apply for Medicaid. That’s the low/no income version of Medicare.

**Disability:**
The disability application takes a very long time. Be prepared for that. The condition that she has might fall under the “immediate accept” criteria, but even that will likely take six months. If she doesn’t qualify for immediate acceptance, then you’re looking at a 2.5 to 3 year wait time.

When applying for disability, make an appointment at the SSA, and have your mother go in to explain everything to the counselor there. You or your father can go with her to assist if need be, but do not fill the application out online. I’ve been repeatedly told that shows evidence of a work schedule, and can be a factor against you in the early stages of the application.

I also urge you to get an attorney when you begin the process. This is somewhat controversial, but I believe that it helps to have one the entire time. I know that my attorney’s connections help to get me over the hurdle to an early approval. I wound up getting disability 2.5 years before I expected to — 2.5 years faster than anyone I actually know in a similar situation. 

If she is approved for disability, then two years from the date that she became disabled she will be eligible for Medicare. This can be a bit tricky because you might say that she became disabled when she had the aneurysm, but the government might say that something happened between the aneurysm and now that reset her disable dates. Generally speaking, you become disabled on the last day that you worked. You can see how this might be a problem for someone who hasn’t worked, and has a major health issue like this. I’m not sure when they will set her disabled date, so be prepared to wait a year or more for Medicare to kick in. 

When she is approved, she will get back payments from the date she became disabled — the date they decide she became disabled — up to the day of approval. From that point on, she will also have a monthly payment come in.

All of this assumes that she would be approved. If she honestly has no work credits, I don’t remember all the rules for it — there are some exceptions in different cases — but she might not be approved at all. Even if she was, because she’s had no recent work she would receive only the minimum payment. That’s about $750 a month, give or take. Obviously that’s not enough to live on, but it includes Medicare, and paired with your father hopefully that’s enough to get by.

**SSI:**
I have much less familiarity  with SSI, but I can tell you that it is not going to be super conducive to their situation. If she does not have the work credits for disability, but is disabled, generally speaking she would qualify for SSI. However, because she is married, both her and her husband‘s assets — everything, car, house, savings accounts, stocks, etc. — have to be worth less than $3000 total. I have a feeling that with retirement accounts and everything else they probably only more than $3000. That’s why this is a bitch.

SSI comes with Medicaid, though, so it’s insurance if she needs it. Here is the point where I have to suggest the most horrible thing that has ever been suggested to me: if there is no other way to get insurance, and to have enough money to live on and take care of her health, they can always consider divorce. If they become divorced, she is judged solely on her income, and her assets without consideration for how much money your father has in the bank to help her out with so she would be eligible for the SSI income, again, about $750, as well as Medicaid. For their daily life, nothing would change, except that they would’ve had to go through the process to get a divorce.

In addition to SSI payments and Medicaid, Her new, incredibly low income, will also make her eligible for state programs. Most states will help you buy a wheelchair van if you can’t afford it. Hardware for in the house to help take care of her etc. is all excruciatingly expensive, but there are subsidies for people with little to no income. She *likely* won’t be eligible for any of that while they remain married.

I couldn’t do that. My wife and I stayed married and I have substantially less income that I would have if we’d separated. It just wasn’t for us, though. 

I found that, generally speaking, if that situation is applicable to your case, a worker will tell you about it at some point. Obviously, they should make sure to discuss it with an SSA employee, as well as with divorce attorney, before deciding to go through with it.

**Otherwise:**

The other solution is for your dad to get a job that has health insurance. That’s the only other way I can think of to do this, because the only two large programs offered at the time or Medicaid and Medicare: either disability or no income. If your father can’t work anymore, even part time at a job that would give benefits, then I’m not sure. If she is incapable of caring for herself,  Maybe it’s possible that you can claim her as a dependent on your insurance? I don’t know that I’ve ever seen that happen before. Talk to your HR rep.

*Edit: Just saw your dad owns his own business. Divorce + Sell the Business for retirement funds + part time work that provides healthcare until 65. His business will almost certainly put them over the saved-funds threshold, if not the income threshold. I don’t know that there is going to be another way, sadly. I doesn’t sound like his business is doing well, and even with good insurance the care she needs is going to to be cripplingly expensive.*

It is a mess, but this is America: if you can’t work, fuck you.

Here is the point where I have to suggest the most horrible thing that has ever been suggested to me: if there is no other way to get insurance, and to have enough money to live on and take care of her health, they can always consider divorce. If they become divorced, she is judged solely on her income, and her assets without consideration for how much money your father has in the bank to help her out with so she would be eligible for the SSI income, again, about $750, as well as Medicaid. For their daily life, nothing would change, except that they would’ve had to go through the process to get a divorce.

In addition to SSI payments and Medicaid, Her new, incredibly low income, will also make her eligible for state programs. Most states will help you buy a wheelchair van if you can’t afford it. Hardware for in the house to help take care of her etc. is all excruciatingly expensive, but there are subsidies for people with little to no income. She *likely* won’t be eligible for any of that while they remain married.

I couldn’t do that. My wife and I stayed married and I have substantially less income that I would have if we’d separated. It just wasn’t for us, though. 

I found that, generally speaking, if that situation is applicable to your case, a worker will tell you about it at some point. Obviously, they should make sure to discuss it with an SSA employee, as well as with divorce attorney, before deciding to go through with it.

**Otherwise:**

The other solution is for your dad to get a job that has health insurance. That’s the only other way I can think of to do this, because the only two large programs offered at the time or Medicaid and Medicare: either disability or no income. If your father can’t work anymore, even part time at a job that would give benefits, then I’m not sure. If she is incapable of caring for herself,  Maybe it’s possible that you can claim her as a dependent on your insurance? I don’t know that I’ve ever seen that happen before. Talk to your HR rep.

*Edit: Just saw your dad owns his own business. Divorce + Sell the Business for retirement funds + part time work that provides healthcare until 65. His business will almost certainly put them over the saved-funds threshold, if not the income threshold. I don’t know that there is going to be another way, sadly. I doesn’t sound like his business is doing well, and even with good insurance the care she needs is going to to be cripplingly expensive.*

It is a mess, but this is <LOCATION>: if you can’t work, fuck you. 

The final, nuclear option, which I think should be on the table for everyone, is immigrating to a country with better support options.

583,"I don't have any face to face experience, but the fetish scene can be very divided.

There will be those with a fetish for people with a disability/people who wear braces/Wheelchair users/etc and they have a very good balance between engaging in their fetish but also remaining completely respectful of your autonomy as the person with the disability. They fetishise the disability but they respect and connect with the person behind the disability too.

Then you have the devotees who forget the ""person"" in ""*person*s with a disability"" and they get so focused on the impairment they have make no effort to connect with the other aspects of the individual's identity. It can result in a relationship that feels very hollow and false, and can result in unfair expectations on the person with the disability, and be very objectifying for them.

For some people, the later is not a problem, everyone will have their own comfort level with when a disability fetish becomes a blindfold to the person with a disability. 

The same issues arises with fetishes for certain races/skin tones, the individual person gets ignored, and something physical about them is so focused on, the person becomes objectified. 

Now like I said I have never had face to face experience. I have received countless personal messages on various social media, and many messages on dating sites from devotees who very clearly fell into the later camp. Within the opening sentence of their messaging they were would use dehumanising language or simply start writing out role play in which they'll assign me a character who's basically a white bread and cardboard sandwich in a wheelchair with a vagina, that's not who I am, why would I hook up with someone who doesn't care if I have a personality as long as I've got physical dysfunction. 

Don't get me wrong, if you're into being objectified I'm not here to kink shame. I myself love a bit of humiliation and being used as furniture. But it's vital to me that my personhood comes first and my ability to fulfil a fetish is a bonus and that boundaries are discussed up front.

636,"Basically it's the story of: everyone is different. And some disabilities do cause pain/frustration/etc and people should not have to put up with that if there is a way out of it.

I have definitely found as someone who was born disabled that there is a difference in attitudes between people who have always been disabled and those with acquired disabilities. Part of it is that it is partially about loss, because acquired disabilities often mean a loss. Part of it is societal attitude and misinformation and lack of access to care as well.

There's also the part where most of my barriers/hurdles/problems stem from societal barriers/attitudes and not my physical being. And I like a lot of the things that being disabled has given me. 

But me not wanting to not be non-disabled doesn't mean I think all disabled people should also want that.

1) Look at the banking information listed on your SSA account and verify that it is correct and that you are checking the correct bank. Usually, my monthly amount is deposited right on time, according to their calendar but a lump sum of back pay is handled differently.

2) If it isn't there by Tuesday, then print out the statement showing the deposit from your SSA account and take it to the bank. 

3) Don't try to call the toll-free number because you will wait forever. Last time I called, it was a Thursday and I still waited an hour and 20 minutes. Instead, go to your local office as a walk-in and talk to someone real person.

671,"I think it would be beneficial if you could have a consultation with a disability lawyer about your personal dilemma of part-time work versus potential loss of critical supports (e.g. SSI and Medicaid). You *might* find a limited consultation via phone or in-office for free or something like $100. 

You *can* post to /r/legaladvice but be wary because armchair lawyers and conservatives on that sub tend to treat disabled SSI recipients brutally. 

For example, I was accused of having poor character and attempting to defraud the government because I inquired about my ability to keep my SSI and Medicaid after marriage due to unique and extenuating circumstances. 

In your quest for help, you’re going to meet people who believe that disabled people do not deserve a comfortable existence. There will be people who will judge you for either being too disabled (too needy) or not disabled enough (undeserving).

Please don't let this prevent you from trying - but if you do work *at all*, you need to report it promptly every single month. There is a mobile app that allows you to report wages, but I believe if you  Uber, you are self-employed which is more difficult, because you have to basically *guess* how much you're going to earn for the year, and they will deduct each month based on that estimate.

674,"Thanks. 

The problem is that my mom is one of those types that refuses to see a therapist or psychiatrist on an on-going basis. If you ask her if she's fine, then she says fine, even when she's really not. One week she's good, the next she doesn't get out of bed. She also doesn't believe in taking medication.

She had traumatic experiences (from speaking with relatives) early in her life. She married young to some psycho boyfriend who raped her and threatened to kill her if she left him. She fled the state and started over and had me ten years later with some guy that wasn't psycho, but still a loser (what an improvement). 

Well, the relatives say that she's never been 'right' since that first husband saga. And the problem is that all of these people don't really 'believe' in sitting down and talking about your problems. So they never advised her to seek help. 

And so it's now 30 years later, and my mom has 30 year old psychological wounds that never healed. She can't take care of herself, and ironically is too closed off to open about that stuff and try to get an SSI case going. I'm surprised she opened one for me. 

Sorry, this is getting very /r/advice in here. What to do about my mom is my secondary concern at this point. I just care about lifting my *own* living standards. I'd like to Uber for a couple hundred a month to get breathing room, but by all indications, SSA is cut throat.

680,"Thank you for your heartfelt reply. 

On the issue with my mom. I can't file for her. She's an adult - 55. She doesn't want to file under mental problems because she doesn't believe that she's actually bipolar... or has serious problems (despite docs strongly suggesting she is). I've seen a few of her after-visit summaries. She's in a bizarre state of denial despite clearing showing symptoms of bipolar, depression, and OCD. I may not have an M.D. or Ph.D., but I live with her. I just don't get it. And I don't know how I can help her. 

With regards to the Uber idea. I actually used the lump sum (took a while to get me approved) to buy a newer model Ford Escape. My insurance is basic though, and my MPG isn't great. But I'm so desperate for a few extra hundred a month. SSI says on paper that you can work up to 1100 without losing benefits. And of course, you can never keep more than 2000 in a bank (I guess I have to stuff money under the mattress). What stupid rules. 

My reservation about actually going through working is that they would look at it and use it as evidence to deny me at my first continuation review - next year.

Did I shoot myself in the foot by having liquid assets in my account over their dumb limits? Will they ask those questions in the packet? I'm scared, and it was an honest mistake.

I wouldn't hold my breath but its worth a shot to ask. Those pell grants might be exempt, due to what they are (read up what is and is not income ect) and a loan, IIRC is money you have to pay back and does not count as a kind of income at all.

You really need to set this all in front of an SSA worker at the local office and plead full ignorance and ask for help. If all those kinds of funds are in your SSI direct deposit account, it really needs sorted out by someone who can document it in the system.

I'm sure it will work out ok.  The SSA makes mistakes but as far as I've seen they do try to fairly help you when you screw up.  Just be painfully honest with them. If you think they did you wrong after, you can always file for an appeal.

687,"&gt;Every day past the day you hit 2k in the bank, you'll owe SSI money back for overpayment.

I'm assuming you meant 'every month past'. 

&gt;Once you report that now, you'll have to go back every month from that point and figure out how much you were over that 2000 limit, document it and SSI will do their magic and deduct it all for overpayment. 

The overpayment will equal however much you were paid for each month that you had excess resources. Whether you had $80,000 in the bank, or $5000, the amount you owe back would be the same. 

&gt;If I have read the regs right, I'm sorry to tell you that you are probably going to lose most of that 3k in benefit cuts. 

They cannot withhold more than 10% of the maximum monthly payment to recoup the overpaid funds - in 2018 that means a $75 per month reduction in benefits. Unless, of course, you are still over resource, in which case you are due nothing until you fall below the resource limits again. 

&gt;I'm not sure but they may let you spend 3k and avoid some of the headache, maybe go buy a car or something.

Spend the excess on something sensible that you need. I mean, you *can* blow it on booze and hookers, but you sound like you're trying to make smart decisions. Pre-pay some bills or rent, buy clothes or household items you need. If you don't have a vehicle already, you can use it toward that as well - as long as you don't have more than one vehicle, the value isn't considered a resource. This won't fix the overpayment that's coming, but you can move forward from there. Then look into the ABLE account for the future, so that you can save up legitimately.

703,"H.R. 620–ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017

&gt; The bill prohibits civil actions based on the failure to remove an architectural barrier to access into an existing public accommodation unless: (1) the aggrieved person has provided to the owners or operators a written notice specific enough to identify the barrier, and (2) the owners or operators fail to provide the person with a written description outlining improvements that will be made to improve the barrier or they fail to remove the barrier or make substantial progress after providing such a description. The aggrieved person's notice must specify: (1) the address of the property, (2) the specific ADA sections alleged to have been violated, (3) whether a request for assistance in removing an architectural barrier was made, and (4) whether the barrier was permanent or temporary.


So, instead of outright expecting businesses to be ADA complaint,  individuals with disabilities must deal with a series of escalating claims in order to convince the business to become accessible. So, this bill disincentives businesses to become ADA compliant and puts the burden on the disabled individuals instead, correct?

I applied for and was approved for SSDI pretty quickly.  It will take you time to adjust to your vision loss and learn new ways to do things.  SSDI will give you financial assistance during this process, and through the Ticket to Work program, you might get help with the cost of retraining to a new field and assistive technology to help you stay employed.  

Another factor is transportation.  If you live in an urban area, you’ll have a lot easier time due to more public transportation options/Uber/Lyft, etc.  I plan to go back to work somewhere at least part time (you can earn $1170 or a little over $1900 a month if you are legally blind while on SSDI). However, I live in a rural area with no public transportation, so Ill have to sell my house and uproot my family.  It takes time to do this and SSDI is a big help.

Best of luck to you.  It’s a tough thing to go through.  It’s a lot like grieving after losing a loved one, so be sure to take care of your mental health as well.  A great resource is your state's Department for the Blind.  They can provide orientation and mobility training and hook you up with other resources.",,,,B-dub31,Optic Nerve Atrophy,,1514322650,t5_2qhe8,t3_7m8k1r,t3_7m8k1r,7,1515119656,0,0,drsh9u5,disability,,,,,

798,"That's a lot of questions. I apologise in advance, I'm a rambler. I can't tell a short story to save my life. My answers are in 2 parts because I hit the comment character limit.

**PART 1**

&gt;1.Were you ever bullied in school? 

Nope, I went to a very small rural school for most of my schooling, My teachers were not experianced with students with disabilities, but they listened to my feedback, I only had very minor issues with facilities being sub-par due to poor funding.

Some kids from a neighbouring Private school who I never met used to yell out the windows of their bus ""Run Forrest Run"" and ""Can I get a lift!?"" when they saw me walking home with my leg braces or wheeling home in my chair. 

But my actual co-students were understanding and asked questions when they weren't sure if they were behaving kindly. 

&gt; 2.What kind of difficulties you had in past? 

What time frame? I wasn't diagnosed until I was 23 despite my illness being genetic and congenital. That caused some difficulties with accessing the right kind of care, For example we couldn't get a disability permit for mums car, so unloading my chair was always difficult. Most of my difficulties are occurring now, as a young adult with no real income and learning about all the ways my lack of treatment as a kid has accelerated the deterioration of my condition.

&gt;3.Do you work? If yes then how do your co workers treat u?
 
I used to work, I studied Nursing, I was hoping to be a clinic nurse, but you have to do 2 years Ward rotation in my country to graduate, I worked as a sex surrogate to save to pay for my rotations. I was unable to complete my second year due to my condition deteriorating faster than we all expected.

I then worked in a call centre for a while. Lots of other people had disabilities, and other than days I need my chair mine is quite invisible. It wasn't exactly a social environment, I couldn't even name the person in the cubicle opposite me. My condition eventually got bad enough that I could not commute to that office 5x a week as expected.

I now volunteer at a museum for 6 hours once a week, taking sales in the gift shop. I only started last month so I haven't really had a chance to meet all the other volunteers or for them to know I have a disability.

&gt;4.Who do you live with? 

I used to live in share-housing up until last year. I'd find ads in the local classifieds and rent a room for a few months if the house was accesible. I'm only on a temporary disability payment while I wait for my case to be reviewed (every 3 months my doctor has to send off a letter saying ""Yup, she still has her genetic and incurable illness"". It's been like this the last 5 years), so it was hard to get an official lease because I had no true income. But now I live with my partner (lease is in his name) in a small flat.

&gt;5.Are you single, in a relationship or married? 

De-facto with my partner of &gt;2 years. We can't get married because we couldn't afford my medication, treatment and home help on his single income, I need to stay legally single because I need to be able to access disability services like pharmaceutical benefits. We'd like to get married one day.

&gt;6.How many relationships u had? 

This is my second serious relationship.

&gt;7.Is it true that relationships r challenging? How? 

I think finding out I used to be a sex worker turns people off more than being disabled does.

My first partner struggled with my disability. He felt useless and helpless watching me in pain, knowing there was nothing either of us could do. 

It's also a lot of pressure on partners to take over from home-help. When I lived in share housing I had a professional carer come around once a week to help me around the house, My Aunt has a carer come around every day. Because I had Housemates I wasn't entitled to daily visits. Which meant I would have to call my boyfriend to come over to my house to help me shower, because I wasn't going to ask a housemate to help!

It really blurs the lines between lover and carer, and my current partner is only 22 (I'm 26) I don't want him to have to help me use the toilet. But what else can we do when I'm not eligible for a home nurse because I live with a partner? We can't afford a private nurse.

My symptoms limit the kinds of dates we can go on, the kind of quality time we can spend. Sometimes I am unable to provide touch or be touched because my skin is crawling or my nerve endings are on fire. My hips dislocate and my skin tears easily so sex is not always on the table. I can not have children.

These are all things that could easily and understandably be deal-breakers for a potential partner.

I'm also unable to contribute to household income, so we'll never own a home in the suburbs. I'll be renting and living in public disability housing most of my life in between respite centres.

&gt;8.How often do you travel. 

How far? My partner and I sometimes drive 80km to the Great Ocean Road (In Victoria Australia) for a day trip every 3 months.

My Mother lives 120km away and thrice a year (her birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas) she'll drive up, pick me up, then drive home and i'll stay with her for a few days.

Every 5 years I take the train 300km to see my Uncle and visit my hometown.

I've never left Victoria (unless Moama counts) let alone Australia.

Car rides are very painful for me, and I haven't yet been cleared to fly after my last stroke.

&gt;9.What are some of the challenges you have to face when u travel? 

Bumpy roads and tight turns will dislocate my hip, vertebrae and neck, so I have to take anti-inflammatory medication before the trip and my partner will have to pull over often, and reset my joint on the roadside so I don't get nerve damage. I always have to have a full med kit with me in case my symptoms flare up and I go into hypertensive shock or have a stroke. But otherwise, we can load up the car abs go just about anywhere. 

I've been in Physical Therapy for a few years now and I have a lot more good days when I don't need my wheelchair, so we avoid travelling to new places on bad days when I need my chair.

801,"1. I was bullied all throughout school until I reached college. There was always like-think where kids would try to, ""out run"" me since I was in a wheelchair and they could. In the 2nd grade this girl had me bleeding so I broke her nose. In the 4th grade, these kids were mad I was the teacher's pet so they threw rocks at me every time I went to recess so I had to stop going. In middle school, they were more personal insults like how, ""hideous"" I was and I'd never be attractive to a guy (mainly girls said this to me).
2. My whole childhood was spent in the hospital. Constantly it was doctors telling my mom that I would probably die prematurely because they didn't know how to treat me. I had 3 major operations. I was also helpless so I was molested by my father since I couldn't do anything.
3. I don't work because I can't drive and I don't near anywhere I could get to every day.
4. I live with my parents, they have to take care of me, however I'm currently in the works to live independently.
5. I'm in a long distance relationship. It's probably the best experience of my life!
6. I've been in 3 relationships so far, and I'm hoping this is the last.
7. I've only been in long distance relationships and so far, the guys I've dated have been REALLY accepting of my disability because it's not as bad as it was when I was younger, I've improved a lot so it doesn't necessarily get in the way anymore. I'm EXTREMELY lucky, honestly. But before that, not a single time up until I was 20 did a guy even compliment me (that's when I was improving, physically). So yes.
8. I've traveled plenty of times in my life ! It used to be a huge risk when I was younger, but these days, now that I'm not as limited, I can travel with ease.
9. Getting my ass through the airport because I can't manually push myself like most. With my disorder, my muscles give out easily so I can't rush through a huge ass airport. Luckily, they offer assistance if you tell them ahead of time and push me themselves.
10. I don't know. Not a single person has ever got back to me about interviews back when I was in college, ahaha!
11. N/A
12. My parents.
13. My SSI supports me as well as my parents. I can't get a job atm
14. AHAHAHA!! They stare ! My whole life, wherever I go, people like to stare, especially kids. They're so fascinated or horrified (depending on the age). I'll get dirty looks from teenagers, and parents hate me since their kids start asking so many questions and it embarrass them. Everyone likes to talk reeeeeally slow and like I'm a fuckin 4 year old. People like to automatically assume that since I'm in a wheelchair I must be mentally slow too.
15. Acceptance. It takes a long time for people to let go of the stigma they have in their head and see me as a person, not as a cripple in a chair. I hated myself for being crippled. I thought I'd never fall in love, no one would ever love me, and I'd die in a bed not able to move. I was soooo close to that, but luckily there was a breakthrough in my meds that turned that shit around. Still, I was seeing myself as the chair. Self fulfilling prophecy. I was always called the, ""anorexic gringo crippled bitch,"" and I believed it.
I overcame them when I was able to move for the first time in my life with those meds changing. I turned those insults into jokes, just owned up to them. Sure, I'm the skinny crippled bitch ; )
16. I plan to because I can't see myself doing too well if I didn't.
17. I'm FUCKING THANKFUL!! I see people without my benefits and it scares the shit out of me. Like...fuck me, I'm glad my mom was smart enough to get me all this shit...I'd be dead, literally.
18. I don't know. Pay for cannabis cards, that shit can help. I know they wouldn't because of pharmaceutical companies wanting the monopoly, but that'd be nice. I don't have that shit but I know of people that it's saved.
19. Treat me the way you want. I know who I am and I don't give a shit anymore.
20. Don't have any. Unless you count a teaching internship. Apparently I was the favorite in that school and they wanted me to be an art teacher. That school was really small, though, so it was hard to fit my chair in the small classrooms. But that's just how elementary schools are.

&gt;10.When u go to job interviews what do u expect the questions that would b asked to u as u r disabled? 

Legally the only question an employer can ask in Australia is ""Do you have a disability that could effect your work?"" But as I am not able to work right now I'm not sure how I would answer that in the future.

My job at the call centre was found by my disability employment provider, so my employer already had documentation and paperwork about my condition and no questions were asked.

&gt;11.do u get hired after the interview? 

Yes, I  worked at the call centre for 9 months.

I haven't interviewed anywhere else since my condition deteriorated in early 2016.

&gt;12.Who looks after u? 

Just a note, This question would be more polite if you said ""Do you need assistance with self care of activities of daily living?""  Because ""who looks after you"" immediately assumes someone is looking after us, and that is a form of assumed incompetence and some people might feel like it's a type of ableism/Limiting the disabled.

Who takes care of me? Physically, I do.


On good days I can do almost everything I need to regarding self care by myself. I'm pretty low maintenance. I can't style my hair, so I just keep it cut short. I can't hang laundry on a tall line, so I just use a short clothes horse. I can't lift heavy pots or pans, or full jugs of water, But I don't need to I can make salad.

I'd like to have long hair, and eat elaborate cassaroles. But to do that I would need help. And I enjoy independence. 

I have bad days where I would need help showering, teeth brushing, food prepping etc, But I leave wet wipes and nutritional formula in my bedside table so If It's a really bad day, I can just wait it out, and then catch up on self care on a good day.

My partner helps me a lot when I'm having a string of bad days, he'll help me shower and prepare food and he'll take on the mental labour of taking my vitals and adjusting my medication. 

Taking care of myself is a full time job. It requires all of my energy, pain tolerance, cognitive power, and focus right now. If I had home help I could probably save energy and work outside the home, But using home help too much would make me feel less independent. I like being able to truthfully say that I take care of myself.

&gt;13.Does anyone financially support u? 

Taxpayers. I'm on Temporary Disability until I see a specialist who works strictly with my condition. I was only diagnosed in 2015, up until then I was ineligible for a permanent pension because you need a diagnosis. Now i'm ineligible because I haven't seen a specialist who treats my diagnosis. The waiting list is 36 months long.

My partner and I split all household cost 50-50, If I wasn't able to co-house with him, I'd still be renting bedrooms month by month with strangers. But I have always gotten by independently on my temporary pension ($250 per week, plus ~$30-50 for medication, travel and rent benefits)

&gt;14.How do people treat you when you r visiting some new place? 

I've never had any major issues. Other than finding out the hard way that a building has an unexpected staircase, or the seats are dead uncomfortable. I prefer to sit on the floor sometimes because of my bad hips, so I often have people asking if I'm ok, if I fell, etc. They are very caring and compassionate in my corner of Australia.

I did have an awkward conversation at the cinema the other day when I asked a cleaner where the lift was and they pointed me to the escalator and I said ""Oh, it's not running, so it's stairs, where's the lift?"" and she said ""You can just walk down the escalator?"" and I wasn't quite sure if she herself had a disability, because I was clearly in a wheelchair and I had to bite my tongue to make sure my tone was polite and respectful when I replied ""Yes, I know it's safe to walk down, But I can't walk down stairs, I'm in a wheelchair, We came up via the casino, but it's locked now. where is the lift for the cinema?"" But we had a laugh about it when she apologised and took me to a service elevator to use.

Some people think i'm lazy when I use disabled parking spots, priority seats on buses etc, because when i'm not in my chair or using my crutches or walker my illness is invisible. But nobody says anything.

A few months ago, when I met new people they'd ask what I do for a living and I would say ""I'm a full time homemaker"" or ""Oh, I have a complex illness, right now i'm focusing on my health"" and they were always polite, we'd talk about them, or they'd respectfully ask questions about my health. But for some people having to admit to having a health problem is embarassing.

I like talking to people about it. My illness is kinda rare, so there's lots to educate people about. Staring Next year I will be doing Disability Advocacy talks in schools via skype through my old Disability employment provider.

&gt;15.What kind of difficulties u had? How did u overcome them? 

This is similar to question number 2. My difficulties have been with struggling to get an official diagnosis and yet having a barrage of objective, disabling symptoms. I have never had the capacity to earn a liveable wage, so I am at the whim of the public healthcare system. Before I had a diagnosis a lot of doors were closed even though my doctor knew I had to get through that door in order to cope better with my health. Now that I have a diagnosis, There is still lots of waiting around for approval processes and waiting lists. The longer I wait the more my health fades and the more disabled I get. It's emotionally frustrating. Now there is so much paperwork involved in getting treatment, pensions, permits, etc and i'm not always cognitively functional enough to do it. My Mother is helping me with some of the treatment plan paperwork, and my partner is helping with my pension paperwork. I have a therapist to help me cope with the frustration of losing my functionality.

&gt;16.As u r working. Do u think u would use the benefits that the government provides for disabled people? Why or why not? 

Do you mean financial benefits or service of kind benefits?

I only volunteer, but I do use disability insurance services, They have given my employer a new computer keyboard so that I do not injure my hands as I type, and the government helped pay for a new ramp for behind the giftshop as there was a step up to the counter. 

I can not earn a liable wage even if my gift shop job was paid. I'd make $120 a week, In Australia, that is not enough to pay rent and electricity, let alone groceries and bus fare, and I have additional costs like medication and Physical Therapy fees. I will always need help - either a service in kind (eg: disability housing) or a monetary pension as a supplement to my income.


&gt;17.How satisfied are u with the benefits that government provides? 

I am only on temporary payments ($250pw) the permanent rate is $600 per week. I think I will be much healthier and happier if I am approved, as I can afford to start Prolotherapy, and buy a new neck brace and a power-assist wheelchair (the public healthcare supplied one isn't what I need) and maybe that will help me manage my symptoms better and I could contribute more to my community as thanks, or even seek paid employment again.

But the government has provided a heavy discount on my wheelchair, and my Physical Therapy fees. They can also help refit my flat with essential accesibility changes (a ramp, a handrail in the bathroom) but my landlord is stuck in red tape limbo with body corporate so that's all on hold right now.

I think the government does a good job at making sure everyone gets the bare minimum for survival. We have an aging population, so our system is spread thin, I'm just grateful we have a support system.

&gt;18.What other benefits should government provide to disabled people? 

NDIS is a new service and our government is still ironing out the kinks, If it works as planned, it will be revolutionary and I could not ask for more. It's not available in my area but should be here by Jan 1st.

There are a lot of teething problems right now. so I can't really say for sure, But it's about setting people up with affordable preventative/management services and treatment now, before their condition gets bad enough that we need twice as much treatment to manage the worsening symptoms.


&gt;19.How do you expect people to treat u? 

Like a person, With respect. Keep an open mind and ear, and don't assume to fully understand and relate to a personal experience.

&gt;20.Describe your experience with employment?

Boom Bust.

I give my all, I burn out, My symptoms worsen, I am forced to leave and find a lower impact job. I give my all, My symptoms worsen. 

I'm doing as low impact a job as I can think of, I sit in a chair, get up and stretch as needed, and sell 2-3 key-chains on an average day. 6 hours, once a week.

2. This is such a broad question, it's difficult to answer. Assuming that you mean difficulties relating to my disability specifically, of course. I still have them to this day. I exist in a world which is hostile to my brain and my behavior. 

A few examples: I am often seen as antagonistic when I am trying to be kind (and thus have to put in 3x the effort the average person does to come off as polite); my food and sensory issues are seen as ""immoral"" or ""childish"" somehow; and I face a lack of support with specific symptoms of my disability, such as executive dysfunctioning.

5. I'm single. 

6. I haven't really had any formal relationships - a few things here and there have happened, but none were significant or long enough for me to consider them relationships.

7. Of course relationships are challenging. Relationships are challenging for all people, usually, as they require work and effort and sacrifices. Again, assuming that you mean specifically relating to my disability - yes, I suppose?

I have something called 'alexithymia', which is a common autistic trait. It means that I can have a hard time identifying and recognizing emotions that I am having. For that reason, it can be very difficult to tell if I have feelings for another person. 

In addition, there is societal stigma that says that (non-autistic) people only date autistic people out of pity or wealth-seeking, that autistic people are childlike and incapable of wanting sex or romance, that autistic people are undesirable partners, that autistic people don't date or fall in love or care about people. I have, as I have grown up, internalized a lot of these messages and thought they were true about me, which has made me scared to date.

8. Uh, broad question. Depends. I travel relatively frequently due to breaks during college, so I can go back home. Before college, it depended on how much money my family had at the time.

806,"You aren’t obligated to disclose your disability or illness  to anybody. But in situations with kids - I find taking 20 seconds out of my day and telling them why I use an aid stops them screaming stuff out loud in public and will hopefully help them grow up realising everybody is different and some of us have medical issues they can’t see. 

I find kids and drunk people are just frank and honest when questioning. They aren’t doubting there’s anything wrong with me.  It’s the SJWs in carparks and disabled toilets who seem to think we get issued with a card that says “DISABLED” and we have to show them to prove that we are entitled to slightly closer car park, or use of the disabled toilets. 

I had a drunk guy at a concert a few weeks ago ask me if I was doing a social experiment with my blind stick. After I got talking to him I understood where he was coming from - he was just hammered and it came out wrong.

807,"I would guess the mother didn't want to draw unwanted attention to you. She's probably mortified that her kid has asked what (to an adult) is a highly inappropriate question and wanted to answer her child with minimal intrusion on your life. It sounds like she did just fine from what you heard too. 

You are of course not obligated to disclose your disability to anyone. But kids are curious rather than nosy, and making it a teachable moment can be invaluable for the way they interact with others in life. I personally see it as a positive moment whenever a kid asks about my disability because it's a chance for them to hear it directly from someone with experience. 

I am a youth leader and the kids often ask about my wheelchair. I tell them about it, why my legs don't work, and let the more patient ones try my chair. Tell them to try and reach x item or try to go to the bathroom without using their feet. It gives them a real insight into things 'but Raargh that's so HARD, how do you do it?!'. Unlike adults they don't do the whole pity dance, they're more impressed that I can do wheelies and push myself around all day. I have then heard those same kids go on to explain to other kids why I use a wheelchair and they're very accurate.

808,"I don't want to come of as playing the devil's advocate here but perhaps the mother was feeling a little embarrassed by their kid and/or they didn't want to draw attention to you or to impose upon you?

I mean kids often say things which can be a bit outrageous or socially inappropriate and often parents just handle the situation because it's ""their problem"" rather than confronting the subject of their kid's curiosity and making a spectacle out of things. There's also the risk of unintentionally encouraging socially inappropriate behavior by feeding it with lots of social interaction and fuss when instead you can just address the question succinctly and brush it off quickly.

Next time, if you wanted to, you could always wave to the kid and say hi especially if they are that close.

The visit was for a testosterone check.  The doctor I saw, I think he didn't believe me when I told him I wasn't taking anything.  He thought I was doing steroids or something.  He asked me like 3 times.  It kind of pissed me off.  I had a few checks before which were in the normal but low range.  So I used some stuff you put under your arms.  It didn't work and seemed to lower my testosterone.  That's when I went to see him.  He did another test and it was back to the normal but low range, 270ish.  Figuring it was in the normal range, he'd just say to get exercise and eat right. He was kind of a jerk, so I didn't want to go back.

More and more, cross-Atlantic flights are getting “accessible” restrooms. This is an awesome development (since it was like purple unicorn just ten years ago), however there are limits to greatness. “Accessible” in this context means large enough to wheel an aisle chair into. And with a toilet approximately level with aisle chair—emphasis on approximately. 

There are two things to check if you want to use this: 1. Is there an onboard “accessible” restroom, and 2. (crucial) do they ACTUALLY have the onboard aisle chair ONBOARD. This chair is NOT the same as the one used to board the plane. That belongs to the airport and stays at the airport. The plane is supposed to have its own onboard aisle chair. “Supposed to.” It’s...not always there, even if they have the larger onboard restroom. (It’s often there!

An important feature to take into account is that, almost always, the rule is that the flight attendants WILL NOT lift you.

If you don’t have use of your arms, it will be more difficult. Everything from getting their attention (the call button is on the ceiling) to getting into the bathroom will be more complicated, but, again, they’ve always offered to help so I assume they have some training.

I just had an absurdly long flight to Japan this year. My advice would be to take every lay-over you can find (the flight from Toronto to Narita was so, so much worse than the flight from Narita to Calgary) so you have access to airport facilities.

869,"Okay, so this doesn't have *anything* to do with your medical condition, and benefit continuation as someone mentioned below does not apply; that is only for when they determine that you are no longer medically disabled. This is a non-medical issue - they will have to reschedule the redetermination (periodic non-medical reviews). 

They'll go over all of the non-medical eligibility issues since your last review: where you are living &amp; with whom, how much you pay in rent, etc., any other sources of income during that time (public assistance, part time work, family members giving you money to help pay your bills), resources owned during that time (like vehicles, properties, bank balances), marriage, etc. If *any* of these things have changed at all since your last review (or since you were originally approved, if this was your first review) be prepared to provide details and possibly proof. The faster you can provide any necessary evidence once they get the review scheduled, the faster you can get reinstated. 

How long it will take is going to be entirely dependent on the local SSA office - the level of staffing, workloads, etc. I sincerely hope you live in an area with a well-staffed office, because no matter how bad things are, you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. It is very  important that you get yourself heard - it is also true that the individual working on your case probably hasn't had time to check their voicemail or return calls, and those things are in direct contradiction to one another. Most of our day is dictated to us - we don't get to say, ""I have a shit-ton of [very important workload] that needs to be done - I'm going to work on that today."" We have appointments scheduled *for* us, to hell with the work that may be piling up on our desk.

It's a disgusting situation, which does nothing but hurt the public. The people in your local office are 99.9% likely very hard working people doing the best they can with a shitty situation - it's the politicians that put us all in this situation, that refuse to replace staff, and it hurts only those in need.

How can people possibly believe that helping these students thrive is any less valuable than any other student?? 

I am sad. I'm sad, and frustrated, and nauseous, and I kinda want to cry. I know what that woman's son is going through/went through. I have had teachers lock me in the bathroom (preschool) or put me in the hall (grade school) so I could ""cry myself out"" because I was overstimulated and scared. I've had teachers since kindergarten forget or ignore my 504 and place me in the back of the room or give me tiny print papers (bad vision). I got in trouble once for talking in the hall because I was asking another student to read my watch for me so I could know if it was time to take off the eye patch I often had to wear to school. Currently in college, I have had professors that refuse to let me take my test in the disability services building (where it's quiet and they print my tests bigger for me) or refuse/forget other accommodations on a regular basis. 

Sorry for the wall of text; this is heartbreaking and frustrating for me. I wish I could do something now for that student, but I guess I'll have to settle for being the best SPED teacher I can possibly be and kicking ableist ass at every turn.

So, yeah... I cried a lot on the way home from my appointment. 

I was seeking psychiatric treatment. You'd think that a mental health doctor refusing a patient suffering from depression and anxiety, for something out of their own control, would be the antithesis of what the doctor does and wants to be. 

I found someone else. But, I was lucky to have a good support system, like OP's son (linked post). Technically, we didn't have to sue. But my parents and I were concerned and wanted to set an example. 

What if it had been someone else being denied their rights, someone who didn't have a support net? Not a stretch to imagine such an episode to be the last nail, and the person going home that night and finally killing themselves. 

Sorry that this was long. That post struck a chord and it's scary seeing how many people were so ready to dismiss OP's and her son's pain because ""it doesn't work like that [where I live].""

Then we talk about our own stories.

I actually just finished being interviewed by a group of kids a couple months ago, where they came up with a Powerpoint presentation and wrote an essay about me.

I highly encourage you to look at the Rick Hansen site here https://www.rickhansen.com/Our-Work/School-Program/Ambassadors 
They have free lesson plans to fit Ambassador presentations into all levels of Canadian provincial curriculums. You can choose to book a presentation by an Ambassador if you're in Canada too. All of this is totally free. Even if you aren't in Canada, I'm sure you can find some useful things on the site you can adapt. 

Personally, I've been in severe chronic pain for the past 17 years, since I was 13 years old. This impacts every facet of my life, but I've still been able to do some pretty cool things.

Don't buy anything you don't need. I would stay as long as you can handle it, then you'll have a little nest egg if you move out. Any possible way you can find a room to rent? May be cheaper than low income? Just renting a room will give you flexibility to leave if it doesn't work out, not signing a lease with someone.

moving out wouldn't be a bad goal either if you want to do it, but i wouldn't do it just out of embarrassment. in many countries extended family lives together for economic reasons, there's nothing inherently wrong with it. if you do still want to move out and low income housing is actually that terrible where you live then there are probably cities with a lower cost of living where you would be able to scrape by and you could move to one of those.",,,,REAL_CONSENT_MATTERS,,,1514671014,t5_2qhe8,t3_7n19w2,t3_7n19w2,3,1515245408,0,0,dryx7f5,disability,,,,,

agreed. that's why i said don't do it just out of embarrassment, rather saying don't do it, and then made a suggestion about how to do it if they still wanted to. i have no way of knowing the full details of their living situation.

&gt;Most people can't just ""up and move"" to another city if they don't have support. i.e. friends to help move, money to move, etc.

they said they 'got an approval' and wanted to move out so i took that as saying they got government benefits and have a source of income now. it is entirely possible to move without friends helping you (at least in the abstract, again i don't know their full situation), but of course it's not possible without money.

927,"Oh, how I hate to reinforce what you're saying but sunshine and lollipops, and false hope I don't believe are of any use to anyone.

I'm 37, have a wife of 12 years and our relationship is okay but there is a lot of room for improvement and I don't feel like my efforts are ever reciprocated. Have a beautiful three-year-old daughter who is quickly becoming my only source of joy in life. I have financial stability and I currently have reliable personal care.

So, what in the world am I complaining about? I was meant for more. I am an intelligent man who cares about others, talented at photography and I have had opportunities to use it for the benefit of others. Occasionally earns a few dollars but that always puts my financial security at risk. Lately chronic pain and unreliable people have just made me want to give up. I want to focus on my family but I have already explained the circumstances of my significant other and obviously I'll give my daughter all of the effort and attention she needs but I'm keenly aware of friends that are older than I, also disabled, whose lives turned to mush once the kids moved out because they had nothing for themselves.

I don't want to give up photography or what I'm good at, but people just continually disappoint me and show their unreliability. That silent invisible stone wall, all the time! My best bet is to try to book shoots with people who do not know that I have a disability and then they are stuck with me. Obviously I chose to reveal my disability to my wife early when we were dating and that was the right decision. As for models and other people I photograph, they don't need to know. Give them the first 30 min. of dumbfounded look on their face then we can actually get down to work and make great images. Too often location accessibility is an issue unless I'm making the calls, and future shoots, even though they rave about my work, often don't come together because I'm that guy who uses a wheelchair and he might not be able to participate.

Now I am ranting on your post. I see myself doped up, in a home, lighting stupid little still life things with flashlights and photographing them with a phone in 20 years. I hate that idea but I think I'm trying to come to terms with it because it is what it is, I don't believe in reveling in the glory days and I feel like I will find greater peace with acceptance of what is to come then with struggling against my own mobility, pain and access instead of struggling to wrangle the light in just the right way to make a great image.

I'm going to agree with the post to which I am replying, try to get some sort of stability, backup plan and minimalist structure and routine so that when something happens you can get through it with the minimal amount of further damage to your well-being.
