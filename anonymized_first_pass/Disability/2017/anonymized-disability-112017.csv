10,"&gt;Maybe I just haven't built up enough upper-arm strength

This. Using a manual chair takes effort and full time users build considerable muscle using one. It's not just arm strength but also core muscles that help with chair use - as a part time user you're just not there yet. Work using your chair into your exercise routine and you should notice a difference quickly.

For carpet and other difficult surfaces you can learn to push in a rolling wheelie which is much easier but takes considerable strength and balance, so a longer term goal.

I would suggest you go back to your doctor or physio to talk about your chair. Using a chair without medical approval is not a good idea. Sometimes your doctors want you to stay mobile for whatever reason, or do not believe you have the balance or nervous capability to use a chair safely. If they are fine with you buying your own, you must get fitted properly to prevent postural issues and consequent long-term damage.",,,,Raargh,Wheelie,,1511020807,t5_2qhe8,t3_7dqt1b,t3_7dqt1b,1,1512774709,0,0,dq08pdt,disability,,,,,
11,"Hi, that’s so much for the insight. To shed some further light on it all, I got denied first attempt. Not much of a surprise, disappointing nonetheless. I spend almost a month on gathering every shred of detail I could on the reconsideration appeal. Medical records since initial filing, new diagnoses, multiple medication changes, doctor and therapist letters that state I am unable to sustain meaningful gainful activity, statement from a therapist I had three years ago, letters of observations from 2 family members, 2 former coworkers, 1 close friend. Very detailed description of decline in conditions and every day functions and abilities. I wrote letters to my congress rep, senators, governor. I spoke to the senators office who called right away and said if/when reconsideration is denied, they could assist because at that point it’s federal level. My congress rep office was amazing. The constituent services manager met with me and we’ve been in contact. He called local SS office to ask whether or not I should fax mail or drop off evidence. The examiner knew my case and said to drop off. I did last week. I got a request for reconsideration summary in the mail today. I feel no changes are needed so it says to leave it alone. I met a lawyer for a consult yesterday and he read my appeal and said it was excellent especially the doctors letters. Is this summary any indication of a good sign? I know it’s moved out of my local office back into DDS for medical review already. Any thoughts yet or am I still trying to read tea leaves?

There is help out there, and once you get your anxiety under control, you'll be so thankful that you took the leap. You deserve to feel ""normal.""

Responses that boil down to ""well you need to learn social conventions"" as if we're just lazy and don't have very differently wired brains, and as if that doesn't basically chuck the social model of disability out the window.

Furthermore, while I can't say for sure this app is irresponsible in how it teaches children to make ""eye contact"" since I haven't used it, this is really not something that should be taught through an app as a blanket skill.  The mother may feel like she's ""broken through a window,"" but autistic people don't just avoid eye contact because it's boring or something.  For many of us the primary reason is that it is an overwhelming amount of information to process *while* processing and producing language.  It can be literally painful, for me it can be nauseating.  And later in life, it can drain energy needed for more functional tasks.

Does that mean that there should be no therapy aimed towards establishing a socially acceptable amount of ""eye contact"" and orientation towards speakers?   No.  But it does mean that we need to work with the differences that come with having a brain which is wired differently.  Simple tricks like looking at a person's mouth, eyebrows, or nose have helped me SO MUCH in life.  And learning that I don't have to pass as NT to everyone in my life, and that I can choose when to just not look at a person's face at all &amp; that it isn't a requirement, has helped me save energy as well.    But all too often people get wrapped up in ideas about making children ""normal"" and narratives about ""BREAKING THROUGH THE WALL OF AUTISM"" to even think about these things.  The result is often teaching compensatory strategies that can be energy-draining, and may need to be untaught later in life as more stress is placed on the child growing up.

Please tell me I have egg on my face because it does teach and emphasize these things.

 Well I couldn't before!

The language used in this product sales pitch is both condescending and misleading.  

""People with disabilities can now drive with the help of these hand controls"" 

""people with disabilities"" - Good use of person first language, however this statement is *too* inclusive. Disabilities cover anything from blindness, to autism, to LIS, and none of these disabilities could be benefited by this product. 

""can now drive"" the use of the phrase *can now* implies that people with disabilities had no way of driving before the invention of thus product. And this is clearly untrue. 

A better title would be ""Affordable hand controls for cars make driving more accessible for people with certain disabilities""  because it emphasises that this product is unique because of its price and installation, and therefore it allows people who can't afford existing products to have more opportunities to drive. Specifying ""certain types of disabilities"" reminds readers that this *only* helps those for which hand controls would help anyway, the revolution here is its affordability, not its function.

So unfortunately being obese could potentially disqualify claims of having sought appropriate treatment depending on who assess your case. 

Start at the start, ask your local welfare office what their different payments and benefits are, then ask your doctor which you are likely eligible for, and begin collecting documents that detail your medical history and your dysfunction to take back to the welfare office to make a claim.

Definitely highlight to your doctor that you need to find effective treatment so you can hold down work, or you need support in lodging a successful disability claim, because you need financial support from either earned income or benefits.

Pimp your walker to look like the TARDIS !!  Or a Dalek!

To get a look at what others are doing go to google image search and search for 
disability cosplay
disabled cosplay
handicap cosplay
etc etc

I hate those labels but that's what will get search results.
Surely you can find some great ideas to dress up your walker in a way that you find fun and will get smiles and compliments from others!

Walkers aren't so awful.  I have to use one upstairs because I can't get my motorized chair up the stairs.  Walking with a cane is terribly painful because it makes me walk in an un-natural way but the walker lets me walk in a more natural way and it takes the weight off my spine so it's far less painful to walk.

When I first started using a walker I cried, it made me feel like an OLD lady (I'm already 57), it really made me feel like I'm a million years old and knocking on death's door.  I hated it and it made me cry every time but after about a week of using it I was like ""Hey, at least I can get around upstairs with far less pain!  

I never really thought about ""pimping"" my walker but you've inspired me to give it a go myself.  I've wanted to personalize my motorized wheelchair but so far the only thing I could think to do was put a silly pirate sticker on the back of it.  I would love to make it and my walker a little nicer.  At least my cane is covered in pink roses.

It's like a photosensitive epileptic going to a club then complaining when there are strobe lights. You have to take responsibility for your health and not purposefully do things that put you in danger. 

There are lots of other things you can do on Halloween.

* Plan a shorter walking route or take a wheelchair if it helps with the distance issue.

* Stay in and give out your own candy, that way you get to chill and still see all the cool costumes. I don't know if it's an American thing but 20 is really, really old to be trick or treating here in the UK. It stops as a teen, if a 20-year-old came knocking on my door I'd tell them to fuck off to Tescos and buy their own sweets. Stay in, buy lots of junk, and you can even put a sign on the door if you're concerned about kids jumping when you open it, personally I've never had a problem with this. You can dress up at home too, kids *love* to see people in costume when you open the door.

* Go to a party where you know the host. That way you know what kind of party it's going to be and that there will be no-one there going to jump out at you. It also removes the long distance walking issue. 

* Go to a night out, there are so many theatre/cinema/club/hobby nighs around Halloween that don't involve jump scares. 

* Throw your own party. Lots of options here. Have an old style kids party with party games. Have a standard party with costumes and alcohol. Have a few friends round to watch a film. Plan a murder mystery night. Lots of themed parties where you can still get dressed up and have fun but while staying in control of the situation and keeping yourself safe. 

Having a medical condition does not mean life has to stop, you just have to find something that's suitable for you to do. A neighbourhood with trick or treaters is going to have jump scares. It just is. You would be much better off accepting that and finding something fun you can do safely.

So the women here saying that not all women are gold-diggers are right. But the fact of the matter is that some women are; that's the kernel of truth beneath your mistaken belief that money is so much more important than it is.

So you gotta look at the silver lining of your situation brother. You've got a dedicated firewall for blocking out gold diggers. It's gonna save you time and heartache in the long run, so learn to love it.

As far as for when the question of what you do for a living comes up. Say something like ""I retired young; I'm not rich but I'm comfortable."" Then go on to talk about the things you do that you are passionate about, your hobbies and interests.

If she asks for more details just say it's a long story and you only share it with people close to you.

I get how it feels like emotional troubles can get in the way of confidence. ""Just be yourself"" is good advice but it's not the whole story. The trick is, you don't want to be some exaggerated characterization of confidence - because if that isn't who you naturally are then it's probably going to come across as fake. What you need to do is be who you are, be yourself, and have the confidence that it's okay to do that. That if anyone has a problem with you just being yourself then the issue is with them and not with you.

166,"My last very serious relationship I was in I was ashamed to be disabled and she knew it. Even though she knew I was going through a lot on top of waiting to hear from the SSA. She would constantly belittle me behind closed doors and say things like ""my relative had problems and he worked full time to support his wife and two children"" and other needless comparisons and insults.  I still carried my own weight in the relationship financially and emotionally, but I was frugal, because I couldn't afford much at all. She'd constantly go behind my back and get me job interviews at shitty jobs and then get mad when I would tell her I'm not going. Eventually, for many reasons, the relationship ended. Since then I've been very very hesitant about talking to significant long term partners about my disabilities, because they will be like her. 

I know not all women are her, but a lot of women want a successful, fully capable human being. Luckily after a lot of searching I'm currently dating someone who ""seems"" to understand and I'm taking it slow step by step hoping it turns out OK.

My personal advice is difficult. Mine was to always think positive and be optimistic to the best of my ability, but not truly expect a lot if anything. Don't talk about it like it defines you, but as it an issue in your life you cope with. I dated a lot of girl in the past few years and I actually never told a lot of them especially if there wasn't much going on in the relationship to begin to warrant disclosure of that magnitude. When they'd notice I'd have problems I'd brush it off and explain to them very lightly about my physical problems, never the mental ones, and hope they would just accept it and move on. Honestly, when some girls saw I was fighting as hard as I could against these ailments while belittling them, they'd start to give me a lot of credit while others would immediately get turned off  and lose interest. While a lot of people can be generally grouped into a ""type"" if you will each experience will be different and you may find someone who accepts it. Play it day by day sometimes. Honestly, I could give you pages of advice and ways to approach it, but in the end its what you are comfortable with however if you start to get serious and want to invest a lot into the relationship you have to find your own way to convey it.

Some people aren't cool with it, and that's fine. That's their choice. I'm also bisexual, so I have to get that out of the way too. It feels really similar, actually, in that I'm never sure how the person will react.

&gt;Of course girls want money and confidence in a man more than anything else it seems.

We're individuals. I don't give a shit about how much money a man has, and some women prefer submissive, quiet men. You can't generalize people like that.

&gt; Of course a guy on disability, especially for emotional issues, is lacking pretty severely in those areas.

And I'm a woman on disability. Confidence is something we all have to learn. You have to find a worldview that allows for your existence. You have to be comfortable in your own skin, or your life will be shit.

&gt;So, the question,""How are you doing?"" or ""What do you do?"" come up. Is it possible to answer this with minimal shock response? I just feel like I should completely end the conversation right there, funny as it is as that's basically the start of any conversation.

I am literally always in terrible pain, all over my body. If someone asks how I'm doing I usually say I'm fine. On heavy pain days I'll say I'm achy, but good overall. If someone asks what I do, I tell them about my hobbies.

173,"Sorry it took so long to say thanks. The endocrinologist is having nuclear medicine (in a different city) try ablation attempt #3 to kill thyroid; it hasn't gone well *and* has made me feel really sick. I think the lab results are too ""good"" to get treatment, but a ""second opinion specialist"" (whoever determines doses of radiology) is re-scanning Monday and Tuesday.

It seems like summer thyroid storm affected central nervous system so I might *always* feel like upper extremities skin is ""severely sunburned"". Sadly, only pain meds help. Worse, the side effects of pain meds are more painful than the ""on fire"" skin feeling.

Sorry to hear about your case. Honestly it's exactly why I feel guilty even applying for disability. Right now I'm sick (going through treatment attempts, special diet, special pills), but usually I can see ""normally"" with dark glasses with the bifocals. (Though I definitely found out I can't drive at night anymore; it's just not safe.)

If I ignore how bad I'm feeling now due to temporary treatment attempt, my ""abilities"" are very different than before thyroid storm this summer. I know I couldn't pull a full day of ""work"" again, even if that's just ""sitting in suit/skirt"". I get too uncomfortable. I have had doctor's ""note"" that I can't lift over 20 lbs due to ovarian thing (and then fibroid thing); that's been in my ""list of can't do's"" (profile?) from specialist for years. I used to be able to work my way around that, but now, I can't ""move"" (walk fast, do fast-paced things like I used to) without feeling dizzy. Suddenly. I'll feel fine rushing to get phone, then my heart starts racing and breathing gets difficult. I think they're going with COPD (?); they mentioned my organs being damaged from summer thyroid storm.

I honestly don't think I can ""do"" anything. It really sucks. My family is doing Thanksgiving out-of-state (I'm staying behind to finish treatments; if there's *any* possibility of improvement, I've got to try). Surprisingly, insurance is paying for my non-ambulance transportation now. I won't tell family, but I'm nervous about *feeding myself*. Am writing down lots of ""instant""-type foods (oatmeal, rice, cereals) so I don't have to cook.

But **I'm so glad I'll be alone for Thanksgiving!** That sounds diabolical, but I used to make Thanksgivings all the time, and it's hard work, but now? I would look twice my age trying to make even one dish! In years past, I would make two full Thanksgiving meals (one to take to some elderly family who would otherwise just get a ""plate"" instead of a whole layout). But last year, I needed help just lifting the bird and other ""big"" jobs. And this year? *There's no way I could cook one dish.*

I'm smiling right now, though: definitely not saying that to get pity. I'm just seriously glad I don't have to pretend to ""be peppy"" and out-of-pain for a whole week! I am happy knowing my family and friends will have fun and not have to fuss over me, plus with any luck I will be ""radioactive"" and dangerous to be around so perfect excuse with no guilt.

I have years' worth of medical documents and diagnoses. When retiring doc was going from paper to digital, he got snippy and said ""you're early 30s [at that time] and your file is thicker than most of my retired patients!""

I *did* for almost 2 weeks this summer, to fill in for people (it was very part-time job with very nice co-workers), but that's when I ended up in hospital this summer. I felt very guilty for saying ""yes I'll take your day"", and ended up ""full time"", and then ended up in hospital (and out of work since then).

Before Graves diagnosis, the heart rate thing (tachycardia) had already made 40 hr work week impossible. I'm 140bpm *at rest*; if moving, more like 180bpm. Propanolol helps knock that back to 100 or 110bpm, but *only if I'm not physically active.* Or ""stressed"". (That's why I get the Xanax; I'm not ever supposed to be ""stressed"".)

And nobody knows why (except ""Graves""). My heart tests come back fine (many times over the years). Only time I registered high bp was thyroid storm in hospital this summer. I know very little about heart stuff, except my heart is *apparently* good. Just active. Big time. I will say I wouldn't even TRY another test with the treadmill. Echocardiogram would be fine though.

Same with ""womb thing"": gynecologist says ovarian cysts and fibroid are due to Graves. That was ""retroactive"" diagnosis (they didn't know why I had cysts and fibroid; I was too young. But now they say it was Graves).

Also with ""anxiety"" and weight loss.

Once they diagnose ""Graves"", it seems all former diagnoses default (get changed to) ""Graves"". (And of course same with sudden bad vision requiring dark glasses/vision correction: TED because Graves.)

182,"To add to the above, in order to get the physics leverage needed to drive a shovel into the snow and move the snow from a seated position, you end up using your back, which is dangerous and painful.

People who are able to stand while shovelling snow pivot from the it hips in order to provide leverage to the shovel, this is a safe and efficient body mechanic that you simply can't do from a chair.

When shovelling from a chair *ALL* the momentum comes from the upper body (even if you do have some function in your legs, the position of being in a chair removes your legs from the action) which means you are very likely to injure your back or shoulder. Because you're having to lean out of your chair whilst trying to lift weight that is not close to your body and anchor point. 

Trying to shovel from the side, to reduce the damage to your back from leaning forward (picture a ""boat rowing"" position) means having to lift the shovel higher to clear your wheels and arm rest, and twisting, potentially causing injury to the back sideways.

Mechanically, it just does not work, the same reason you are told to lift with your knees, not your back.

Having a plough system attached too the chair would raise similar issues with momentum, the user now has to use upper body strength to propel their own weight, plus the weight of the snow, without being able to pivot from their hips.

It's difficult because moving in a wheelchair requires your hands (one if you are in a power chair, both if you are in a manual one like myself) and, obviously, shovelling requires use of your hands. Getting through snow (especially the amount that warrants shovelling the driveway) is hard enough as it is (and darn well impossible after a few CMs). Snow is also heavy and lifting it high enough to clear the snowbank can be hard if you get a lot of snow. 

Winter is also cold. For me and my disability, my joints and muscles tighten in the cold making every task harder. pushing yourself in a wheelchair requires arm mobility and hand dexterity - neither of which you get a whole lot of in winter coats and gloves. I personally also have other health conditions (I get pneumonia quite easily) so being outside in the cold and snow and doing heavy labour is just a recipe for a week in the hospital hooked up to oxygen for me.

200,"There are an immeasurable number of types of invisible disabilities, because almost every disability has the power to be invisible depending on the situation. 

You have mobility issues that may not be obvious because you're not expecting to see someone walk or run in the setting.

Blindness can be an invisible disability, as not everyone with visual impairment uses a cane, wears glasses or has a seeing eye dog.

Deafness is an invisible disability.

It depends on how how you want to categorise things as to how you count it, you can try and group things into body systems. Neurological, Gastrointestinal, respiratory, sensory, muscular, skeletal... etc

If you want to count individual conditions you'll be there for years, just look at the GI system, almost every illness starts off invisible, many remain invisible, and many can cause functional limitations that lead to disability. Crohns, UC, duodenitis, BAM, gastroparesis, achalasia, short colon, SIBO, IBS etc can all cause debilitating symptoms that effect daily life, yet it's mostly invisible to the public eye.

Likewise with skeletal problems. Even something you think would be obvious like an amputation can be invisible. If someone has long pants or long sleeves on, you may not notice a missing limb, their disability is invisible.

Mental health also falls under invisible illness and disability, and there are hundreds of mental illnesses that cause disability.

Developmental disorders are separate to mental illness and also often invisible.

Neurological dysfunction is also again different from mental illness, but often invisible, and has many potential causes including things like stroke, brain injury, tumours, connective tissue disorders, vascular disorders etc.

Chronic pain can be a condition in itself (like Chronic pain syndrome) but more often than not it's a symptom of something else, like degenerative disk disease, or cervical Instability, or abdominal adhesions, or whatever.

So chronic pain can be it's own type, but an individual who experiences chronic pain may associate their disability with the underlying condition, not the symptom of pain.

Like myself, my condition is a connective tissue disorder, it's invisible because you can't see how loose and fragile my tissues are from the outside, I consider my disability to be my loose tissues. Sometimes people bump into me in the street, and because my tissues are weak, the bump dislocates my shoulder or back, it's very painful, and can cause nerve dysfunction and other symptoms that are disabling. But I still consider the connective tissue disorder itself to be the disability, not the symptoms.

Yet some people are the exact opposite, they have the same connective tissue disorder and yet they choose to see the symptoms as the disability. So it can be very personal as to how we count and label invisible disabilities.

204,"So for me I have multiple invisible disabilities. 

The main one's I have are Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, POTS, Dysautonomia, Asthma, Scoliosis, Dyslexia and Dyspraxia.  

Ehlers Danlos and Scolosis are the only one's which really cause me pain, however Ehlers Danlos affects the whole body so I experience joint pain in most joints, severe stomach pain and bad back pain - all of which can be pretty debilitating. 

The other conditions like Pots (which make's me feel exhausted all of the time as not enough oxygenated blood get's to my brain) debilitates me by never allowing me enough energy to do what I want, and when I do expel energy, It is super easy to exhaust myself to the point of illness. After which I wont be able to do anything for a few days because I am so exhausted. 

The invisible aspect is most frustrating for me as I look like a healthy mid twenties man, but really my body barely functions and my capacity is probably 20% what other people can do but there expectation from me is that I can do 100%. 

Even when I explain to people they look at me weirdly because I look pretty normal and mostly don't use mobility aids in public (this is changing as my health has gotten so bad). I also want to appear as normal as possible so I do a pretty good job of not letting on I am in pain and pushing myself when I am around others. This however only get's me the reputation of seeming to manage well and all that stuff about my health kicking up a bit of a fuss, which of course It isn't but it seems very hard for people to trust what I am saying.

The learning difficulties just add's another level of problems as I can communicate well verbally but struggle translating it onto paper. So talking to me you'd assume Im relativly clever and can manage paperwork and admin but when I comes down to it I really struggle with essays etc for hours and hours but they read like Iv'e rushed it and not put any effort in.

233,"You should also go to the Social Security website and set up a MySSA account in your son’s name which you should be able to manage since you are his guardian and designated as his representative payee. Once you set that up, which only takes a few minutes, you will be able to view information about any benefits that he is receiving as well as print out a Proof Of Benefits Statement thet you can take to any bank where you plan on setting up the account that you will be using to receive his SSI payments via Direct Deposit. There are also links to help you set up Direct Deposit, update information, learn about what you need to report if anything and how to go about doing it if need be, contact the SSA etc. You will also have an inbox there which you can set to receive notifications from the SSA and oftentimes you will be able to view information concerning your case on the MySSA site first, before you have received an actual notice in the mail…  Also, the SSA has moved away from issuing paper checks as a set form for regular payments, they rarely send them out to anyone anymore except in certain cases when someone has recently been approved and they are sending out the backpay before the first regular payment is issued or oerhaps in a lump sum payment situation.. It is likely that if you do not do anything to set up your own Direct Deposit account for his checks (which should be used ONLY for that purpose and not for any other financial business you have that is unrelated to his SSI, as another user already mentioned in an earlier post) that the SSA will be mailing you a Direct Express card which is like a prepaid debit card that the government uses to send you your payments when you do not have your own regular banking account where they can send your deposits- you will get the card in the mail sometime before your first monthly payment date and it will be your responsibility to call the number on the card and have it activated before that payment date so that it will be ready to accept deposits when that time comes, Direct Express cards can only receive deposits via the government program you are receiving benefits payments from (SSI in your case) and do not allow for depositing additional money from any of your own personal sources or have any line of credit available- you can only use them when you have the funds available in the account. They can be used to make purchases online, pay bills, etc. and basically they work the same way as any prepaid debit card except you can not add your own funds. If your son was just recently approved and you have not yet been called in to your local SSA field office to complete a final financial eligibility interview yet then you can expect to be receiving a notice with instructions to either call or come in at a designated time to complete that final step in the process of initiating your son’s SSI benefits… Sometimes you can receive backpay checks before that has happened when there has been an approval and they want to get funds to you as soon as possible. If he was approved on an initial application and you completed it in-person at your local field office they might have already gone through the financial information with you then and in that case they might not even require you to come back in person again if the information has not changed and there are not months or years of time to cover when calculating the correct payment amounts, they might just conduct a brief phone interview to verify that all of the information is current in a case like that...

237,"I am actually going to disagree with /u/anotherjunkie.  I filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy last year, and my bank accounts were not seized.  Bank accounts can be included in ""exempt assets"" in your bankruptcy filings.  There are several categories of exempt assets, but the total can be up to $10,000, depending in which state you file.  Bank accounts are not automatically exempt, but can be included in a wildcard exemption.  Social Security is usually automatically exempt.

Trustees are more interested in larger assets, and usually go after the assets that are not essential to daily living first.  If you have a rental property, or other real estate which is not your primary residence, they'll go after that first.  If you have retirement accounts, they'll go after those next.  Any other non-essential assets like livestock, family businesses, or valuable art pieces like paintings or instruments (grand piano for example), can also be seized and sold.

If you have a home with equity, you can file a homestead exemption (which has a limit often under $150,000), but any equity in excess of the exemption will be seized.  If you have two cars, they'll want the one with the most equity, and the other can be ""reaffirmed,"" meaning you'll keep making the payments on it if you're able.

Having the bank accounts separate would certainly make the paperwork easier, but ultimately is of no consequence.  A bankruptcy attorney will review your checking account and do the bookkeeping with you.

239,"All I can say in response is that when we were investigating filing for bankruptcy, we were advised by four separate lawyers — my Fisability attorney, and three bankruptcy attorneys across two states and over the course of two years — to separate this account because it can be seized if it’s in your general assets.

Here is a [super basic, not super great](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-i-keep-my-disability-payments-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html) article that explains how confusing it can be to protect past payments, and how they are not always automatically exempted.

The problem with having a single checking account is that you have to prove the dollars remaining in the account are Disability Dollars, and not Work Dollars. If you deposit 5DD and then 5WD, when you spend $7 are you left with 3DD or 3WD? Different accounting systems handle that differently. Then the real world is more complicated, where you have hundreds of deposits over the years split between those two and a bunch of others. If you have a $7k bank balance, how can you reliably prove that those are *all* Disability Dollars, and *no* Work Dollars? For me, I just point to the fact that I never deposited Work Dollars in that account. Boom — exempted. If you don’t set up a separate account, you might be in for a fight.

Each person gets a personal exemption. There is some allowance for a vehicle exemption, but only a small amount of equity and generally only in one car unless you use some of your other exemptions to cover it. But if you’re a *family* who has maybe two cars, furniture, some stocks you held, a few thousand in the bank, and a *family’s* worth of debt, (maybe medical bills, a mortgage, etc.... I’m talking 30k, 50k+) they absolutely will take your disability money if it is in the main house account. It looks like normal cash to them, and they will take all of your cash that you can’t claim as an exemption. And it might be more important for you to use your wildcard to finish exempting your house, or your car, than your cash. If you’d set up a separate account, you wouldn’t have to make that decision.

So it’s a dangerous game. If you only have a tiny amount of debt, and a tiny amount of assets, you might get away with it. Prior risk doesn’t mean much here. One wreck with an uninsured driver and you’re suddenly out of income and filing bankruptcy. 

So, let me ask you this: what I’ve suggested is simply opening a second bank account. It’s free, it takes 5 minutes to open the account *and* change your direct deposit, and it could protect thousands of dollars you (your child, spouse, etc.) needs. Why in the world would you ever tell someone else *not* to protect themselves just because in your highly specific situation you didn’t need the protection? It seems irresponsible. You’re advocating someone risk their livelihood rather than open a checking account.

I love standing in a hotel hallway waiting for a nice person to pass by so they can help zip my dress before I meet friends for dinner... or friends having to come up to my apartment to zip my dress before we go out. Pass!

256,"I'm a man, so you can put these thoughts on the back burner for now:

1) Trouser lengths. Being sat down all the time, I find normal trouser lengths are too short, showing a lot of sock above the shoe, so I end up buying trousers that are too big for the waist but have longer legs. I'd say everyone has this problem. Possibly skirts might have a tendency to ride up too far when in a chair.

2) Hot ass. Being on a cushion in a chair means that my ass tends to get very hot, so fabrics that breathe around the middle regions would be a bonus.

3) With a manual chair, any long sleeves tend to rub against the rims and wheels and get very grubby, very quickly. Also, long sleeves that are loose/baggy tend to get caught up in the wheels or other parts of the chair.

4) Long tops. Most tops, coats, etc. are designed for people standing up. When sat down most tops tend to ride up at the bottom so you get a lot of fabric around the waist or, is the fabric is stiff, you end up with a high collar of fabric that's meant to be resting on your shoulders but it's around your ears instead.

5) Stretch and give. I do a lot of arm movements (what a surprise) and a fair amount of body twisting (putting stuff in my backpack), so a fabric that can twist and stretch to fit my body shapes would be a help.

6) Fastenings. My hand dexterity is OK but, when I'm out and about, I have to wear gloves and my dexterity goes to pot, so buttons, zips, laces, clasps, etc. are a pain. I'm a velcro man myself - shoes and gloves are both velcro fastened - and don't mind using velcro, but it could be made to look a lot better or hidden so that it doesn't scream ""handicapped"" from a great distance.

If you want to design for wheelchair users, test everything whilst sitting in a normal chair - one with arms - and wear chunky gloves and see how a garment looks and how easy it is to put on and take off. In particular, sit in a chair and pretend it's a toilet and you need to go NOW. How quickly can you get undressed without getting out of the chair? It's harder than it looks.",,,,BlueBear63,,,1509898098,t5_2qhe8,t3_7axwt4,t3_7axwt4,5,1512150147,0,0,dpdqas5,disability,,,,,

Luckily she is good with jogging pants. A slippy fabric is sooo nice. Wide legs are the best. Drawstring waist is a must. Matching slippers that can zip through the pants would not be a bad thing.

Underwear is also an issue for her... I think it goes without saying the easier to put on and take off the better. Also, nice to make it kind of decent/covering since she is in a home and is frequently assisted by nurses in dressing.

289,"Yeah, totally. I haven't experienced it as badly as you have, but I absolutely understand the frustration. Thankfully, most of the time I'm fairly agile with my crutch, so I don't give people much chance to stare, but I get the ""Oh, what have you done to yourself?"" question a LOT.

What has helped for me is switching from a stick to a crutch. Firstly, people tend to assume it's more of a temporary thing and don't seem to ask as much - there's the presumption that I had a skiing accident or fell down some stairs or something, because crutches are more linked to temporary incapacity. And secondly, I have a black polycarbon crutch, which doesn't look as ""medically"" as a standard, grey, metal one. For some reason, that seems to make people feel more at-ease with it. But finally, I find it useful because I can let go of the crutch and it doesn't immediately fall over! Very useful for when I need to use both hands for something.

So, overall, if you're able to, I'd advise getting a crutch rather than a stick. People also don't tend to confuse it with a cane, so there's not the worry of people presuming you're blind. As it sounds like you don't put your full weight on your stick all the time (like me), you might find a crutch more practical.

Since I've become more recluse and housebound over the last 5 years I have gently pushed away many of my old friends and I don't want them to know my health sucks. Especially because I've got fibromyalgia which of course is utterly invisible.

I used to walk about an hour or two a day. Before that I used to pushbike offroad and I do really miss being able to be outdoors. You've given me an idea and that is to maybe travel to a nearby town and hire a powerchair for the day. Then I could try it out and see if I like it.

Thanks for helping me work this out ;-)",,,,Tangled_Wires,,,1510568245,t5_2qhe8,t3_7bbrxo,t1_dpjtcc4,2,1512590402,0,0,dpqxmch,disability,,,,,

Try to think of it in terms of how it will improve your life to be able to get out of the house, see the sun shining, anything that you enjoy doing. It's so, so worth it.

If you're concerned about being perceived as drunk, you can use a cane or some other mobility aid so that it's obviously a disability.

334,"I get it that it's incredibly disappointing when you realize that you can't do what you want to do with your life. I have been there.

Had I known, I would have done so much more with that time.

But you seem like you're stuck feeling bad for yourself. If you shoot down every person who is trying to offer practical, realistic suggestions, people won't really want to help you. And it really feels like you don't even want help. 

I get it that sometimes you just need to vent. I had to let myself grieve everything I was losing - not just my career, but my independence. But at some point, I hope you realize that you have to go through that process -- grieving and acceptance -- so that you don't just feel sorry for yourself for the rest of your life. 

And if I were you, I'd take a break from college while figuring that out, because you might want to save your tuition dollars/financial aid for a field you can actually work in.

At 46 i have found the best opportunities that have come my way were all unexpected and sometimes were not things I even knew i wanted. I never saw them when planning for the future.  Keep moving, growing, doing what you enjoy and keep your eyes open opportunities, they will come. Try not to be too rigid and stay open to opportunities that are maybe a bit outside your perfect image of the future.

That you enjoy school is a nugget of sunshine, don’t lose it. Sometimes when you can’t see brightness in the future you have to look closer to the present. I am surprised you say you don’t want a desk job but yet enjoy school, which seems to have similar elements.  Not questioning your truth there, just maybe there is some wiggle room? Maybe not, just putting it out there.

That said, if school is costing you a lot of money and you don’t feel that it is a great investment, perhaps consider a cheaper or state school (i don’t know those details so please just ignore if that is not a element.

But if you stay stuck in that place for a very long time, you may eventually realize that it's no longer productive.

For me, all of those feelings didn't really get better until I got desperate to find a job that I can do, any job. I'm mostly homebound and need to work from home, part-time at most. Within about two months, I found a great freelance job that is interesting and fulfilling. The pay isn't great but it will definitely improve over time as I get more experience. 

It's not what I pictured doing with my life. It's not even a job that I really knew existed. But I love it almost as much as I loved science.

I was in a biochemistry lab. I actually did really enjoy grad school, I didn't mean to make it sound like I didn't like it. But I do still have some residual bitterness that I didn't do more of the things I wanted to do with my life, things I was putting off until after grad school.

I took a medical leave of absence in grad school. Your funding might permit that if you could get a doctor to support it. 

As for therapy, there are other ways to do emotional self-work. I found Buddhism to be useful for working on acceptance. I never got very deep into it, mostly just listening to some audio books and attending a Buddhist group a few times. 

There are also a lot of books out there about coping with chronic illness, like: 

* How to Live Well with Chronic Pain and Illness: A Mindful Guide 

* Life Disrupted: Getting Real About Chronic Illness in Your Twenties and Thirties 

But when you are in this stage, it helps to vent to a sympathetic ear. I hope you can find that, whether it's a therapist, a support group, or just a good friend.

It went something like, ""Total is $X. Are you paying with food stamps?"" This was unnecessary because the card reader automatically differentiates between an EBT card and credit or debit. All she had to do was approve my transaction.

385,"&gt;I wanted the world to swallow me whole. I felt like screaming my situation to the world to try and I don't know.... justify why I was on assistance. I felt utterly ashamed.

It's because people are shamed for struggling. You're shamed for not having a rich daddy to pay all your bills. You're hated for having to work harder than others. You're hated for not having a trust fund, for not exploiting the labor of others, for not sailing through life. You're taught to hate yourself, not just because you're poor, but because you're disabled.

Right wing politicians and their followers talk a big game about being compassionate, but they're full of shit. They constantly try to kill us. They constantly try to starve us, take our homes, and criminalize us. And they do treat us like criminals for taking less than what we really need and less than what we really deserve while they take far more. They stuff themselves and begrudge us a crumb.

Most of us have to deal with this. We are taught that we are bad for being disabled and, consequently, poor. They never come out and say we're bad, but it's a mountain of coded language and dog whistles covering up an ideology that is like a gun pointed at our faces. If you look at the history of the labor and disability movements in this country, you will see who has been opposed to them. You will see who preaches hate against us. You will see who wants to steal what little we have. These are the people trying to make you hate yourself.

391,"I remember I went to a Bi-Lo once, because they had my son's formula in stock in the huge amount that WIC coupons require you buy in one purchase. Like ten cans for the month, or something. 

I put it all on the conveyor belt and the cashier rolled her eyes and said, ""Lemme guess, is this WIC?""

I sheepishly looked down and mumbled, yes, it was WIC.

She then loudly complained about what a hassle it is to run ""those WIC checks,"" then, when she struggled to ring the formula up, she called a manager over to her station on the loudspeaker, ""Got a WIC issue on checkout three"" .... I wanted the world to swallow me whole. I felt like screaming my situation to the world to try and I don't know.... justify why I was on assistance. I felt utterly ashamed.

Anyway, my then-husband was in the car, waiting with our baby, and I got out there sobbing, as I burst into tears having been treated so callously (in my opinion).

Now, we didn't end up together, no one's fault, but he marched me and the baby right back into the store and went to the service desk and quietly asked to speak to the store manager in his office about a sensitive issue. He elbowed me a little to encourage me to speak up.

I told the manager I was sorry I was using WIC and I apologize about inconveniencing anyone, however it is profitable for the store and all that jazz, so therefore I'm a paying customer like any other. I am TERRIBLE at confrontation, even over a decade later, but my ex helped me properly articulate and describe how the event made me feel, and we requested perhaps the cashiers be advised to treat the issue sensitively since there absolutely IS a negative stigma attached, as if the ten cans of formula at once isn't already a glaring ""Hey look I'm poor!"" signal to the rest of the checkout line.

Well, the manager sat down at his desk and sighed, and mentioned that wasn't the first time the cashier had been singled out for being judgmental, and that ""appropriate action would be taken"" and said he welcomed all people in his store and all that, and essentially bought us off with a $100 gift card.

Not that that was exactly what I wanted or however it turned out, but I will say I never saw that cashier in that Bi-Lo again :( so I then felt bad that maybe I contributed to getting her fired because she was ignorant to others' struggles. I just wanted to share that I still to this day feel shame, in my disabled state, about using ""assistance"" and avoid the stores near my house when I use what food stamps/SNAP I *do* receive.

399,"I am in the same boat, and I totally understand where you're coming from. I'm in school as well, and I have chronic widespread pain and fatigue (currently diagnosed as fibromyalgia) but I can still walk, though with difficulty and pain. I typically use a cane or a rolling walker, depending on the day, but I have needed a wheelchair when I go to things like conventions and sometimes when I do my student teaching (because some of the schools I go to are enormous). 

I recently bought my own wheelchair odd Craigslist, and I struggle to feel okay with that decision. I don't use it much, partly out of fear of the social consequences and partly out of trying to ""tough it out."" But I found out recently that I have the opportunity to go to a teaching conference next year, and I know I won't be able to get around without it. 

My family makes a huge stink about it, because they don't understand what I'm going through at all, despite the fact that my mom also has chronic pain and has used a mobility scooter for years. They don't want me to use it because they feel like I don't need it and it's not appropriate if you're not paralyzed or something. (Which is bullshit; I read recently that something like 80% of *full-time* wheelchair users have at least some ability to walk/stand.) My boyfriend has been more supportive, but he worries that once I start using it, I'll stop trying to get places and walk around on my own. Again, it's kinda BS. From what I've read, most wheelchair users only use it as much as they need it, and most people choose to stay in a manual chair rather than electric so they can get that extra exercise. 

Bottom line: if you think this will help you get around with less pain and make it easier to experience your everyday life, do it! People will be shitty, and you'll have to educate folks that you'd rather ignore (or just give them the finger if you don't feel like it lol), but ultimately any decision about your health is up to you and you alone, regardless of shitty people who think they know better than you. As far as an accessible parking spot, I can't tell you how much that has saved my energy and pain this year. I wasn't able to get an official one through the state because my dr has some weird ideas about fibro, but my school allowed me to get a parking pass through the disability services office (and campus police) as long as I had a letter from my doctor. She did agree to that letter, and it has helped me immensely. 

Long story short: talk to your doctor and disability services, get a tag, and you do you when it comes to mobility aids--fuck everybody else. ",,,,dashestodashes,"chronic pain, visually impaired, SPD",,1510323022,t5_2qhe8,t3_7bv59d,t3_7bv59d,4,1512495853,0,0,dpmcguc,disability,,,,,
400,"I can walk, but I have peripheral neuropathy that makes standing and walking very painful. It got to the point where I became housebound. Then I got a wheelchair and life began again.

If walking is difficult, get a chair. It doesn't matter if you don't need it all the time. It's a tool, like a hammer or a drill, you use it when you need it. It'll allow you to save your energy for more important things than getting from A to B. You'll get to B and be able to do something really worthwhile for yourself, instead of sitting in a corner in agony wondering how you're going to get back to A again.

Not everyone in a chair is a para or tetraplegic, many of us can still walk (even if only short distances). The general public don't understand that, but then their opinion on the matter doesn't count for anything.

Plus, if you start using a chair, then you should get handicapped parking permits. Getting people to make allowances for ""hidden"" disabilities is a struggle; it's much easier with something visible. Yes, you'll probably face criticism from the ignorant public, and may have to prove to some idiots that you really do need the chair, but on the upside you're life is going to be so much better.

My only regret is that I waited so long before using a chair.",,,,BlueBear63,,,1510259960,t5_2qhe8,t3_7bv59d,t3_7bv59d,5,1512474332,0,0,dpl7mff,disability,,,,,

SSI and SSDI are run  by the federal government. 

If you're receiving any additional benefits, such as the supplemental help or Medicaid, those are run by the state and you'll have to re-apply with your new state.

If you're on SSDI and have Medicare, and you have a Part C or Part D plan, or a MediGap plan, you'll have to notify your insurance company.

504,"I hear it as a question all the time, but ""what are my chances"" is actually not an easy question to answer and therefore not helpful. When I look at a case (as a representative), I'm looking more at the relative strengths and weaknesses and whether I can do anything to improve the latter.

The weaknesses I'm seeing based just on this post, in no particular order:

- Your age. The standard of disability for someone under 50 is the inability to perform ANY fulltime work on a sustained basis. This is a very difficult standard to meet. In practice, when the client is very young (as opposed to close to 50), I've seen that some judges are more reluctant to award benefits; I'm guessing that their thoughts are ""You're so young, there has to be something you can adapt to.""

- Your treatment history. You say that this has been going on for 15 years but you've only been in consistent treatment for one year. I know there are many reasons why someone might not be in treatment, but it can still be a problem. Some judges see a lack of consistent treatment and think that either your condition must not be that bad, or you're not doing everything you can to try and get better. The treatment notes are also some of the strongest evidence in a case, so if there aren't many notes/the treatment isn't consistent, there's less to work with. 

- Related to treatment, the quality of the treatment notes. I have not seen your medical records, so I'm not saying 100% that this is a weakness in your case, but it's another very important factor. Basically, these notes need to show that you're not getting better even when you're doing everything you can. If you aren't taking your medications as prescribed or your doctors just write ""doing well"" in every visit and then refill your medications, then that's not very convincing of total disability. 

I don't know that these are helpful as tips, because they're largely focused on things beyond your control, like your age and what your doctors write. The best advice I can give is to do everything your doctors tell you to do and to honestly assess whether you think that you meet the standard of disability I mentioned. Also, since you're at the hearing level, it wouldn't hurt to talk to a lawyer - most offer free consultations.

I would not do that as it is not something that I need or feel entitled to in any way. Even if it were suggested it's not something I'd be comfortable accepting. 

Unfortunately at my school, first years in my program are not allowed to be granted a parking permit ""just like any other student,"" at all. We're specifically prohibited from holding student parking permits under normal circumstances. I am only seeking to be allowed a standard student permit (which I could be granted in August 2018) despite my status as a first year. 

All that being said, I kind of resent the tone of this comment in its minimization of mental health related disabilities. I also have chronic physical disabilities; I simply didn't mention them here because they are not nearly as disabling TO ME as my severe PTSD. I'm not talking about being sleepy; I am talking about being so physically exhausted that I am nauseated, have trouble seeing, and am delirious or suicidal (not to even mention being completely unable to concentrate in class.) It's not that parking will fix that exhaustion when it happens, it's that being able to park will add about an hour of sleep to my schedule which can help prevent me from reaching that level of exhaustion. I experience the sleep impacts of my PTSD as somewhat similar to many chronic physical disabilities in that, while it is often possible for me to take the bus, doing so zaps my sleep and energy to the point that I cannot be productive at school, which defeats the purpose of going at all. I am asking for an accommodation that will help me to show up to school on a playing field more level with my peers who do not have a disability.

Talk to them.

I know confrontation is awkward and nerve wracking, But many able people genuinely have *no idea* that they are making an area inaccessible to mobility aid users with their actions. They often just need someone to point it out to them.

Knock on the back window of the car and interrupt their make out session and very politely say ""Hi, I'm sorry, can you move your car, I need to access the crosswalk, There's no where else that's wheelchair accessible"" 


If they move, Fingers crossed they are mindful of the incident the next time they want to make out and they find somewhere else. If they park there again, Say something to them again, Interrupt their PDA and say firmly ""You can't keep blocking the path like this, isn't there somewhere else you can park?"" Then send an email to the school admin about the incident.

If they refuse to move, call campus security and explain ""There are people parked illegally in an access way, and I am a motorized scooter user and I am currently stuck because they have blocked the walkway with their car, I asked them to move but they are refusing"" and as soon as you can send a follow up email to the admin and cc in security if they have a separate email just to document what happened.",,,,DearyDairy,"Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, POTS, MCAS",,1510895826,t5_2qhe8,t3_7dedyg,t3_7dedyg,6,1512732232,0,0,dpy3a6j,disability,,,,,

590,"Hello fitzy798

Thank you so much for posting this. I *really* needed to read a success story.

I just phoned them (PIP peeps) today to start the entire process. Have been virtually bed bound for years while living off my life savings.

I've managed to get UC @ rent plus £73 pw but see after paying bills that leaves me with £47 per MONTH for food.

(And that includes me sleeping in the lounge so I only heat half my terribly insulated flat). Blah /pity

All these forms and weekly interviews just for UC has driven my flare to new heights.

I don't know how I will cope with PIP stuff... the reality is my decade of chronic pain has left me like a 2nd world war unexploded bomb ;-(

I went through the same thing in 2015-2016 and won my tribunal in Summer 2016. Some bad news for you; there's a very good chance that you'll have to go through the whole thing again next year. I've just had another medical assessment for PIP and I'm waiting to hear what happens next, even though I've been granted PIP until 2018.

598,"What is your ailment that is leaving you feeling this hopeless?

Here is my take on suicide, assisted or otherwise. It is acceptable only for people that are terminal and suffering. It is not an acceptable out for anyone else. 

Lost my kid brother last year to hanging. He suffered severe schizophrenia for 15 years prior to his death. He was truly suffering. I saw it in his eyes and heard it in his voice every time we spoke. I did not support his choice because he still had life, no matter how challenging it was. He was not terminal and it has left me with an emptiness and anger that will never be satisfied. The pain he caused to every one that loved him and stood by him throughout his illness is unmeasurable.

You need to speak to your family about your consideration of suicide, the reasons, and involve them in that decision if you are serious about this consideration. It’s a conversation you need to have with the people that you love.

Also, don’t do it in a way that requires innocent parities to do it. Death by cop is not acceptable. Why would you want to leave that officer with the knowledge that he killed someone? What did he or she do to deserve that weight? Don’t do it in a public way. Jumping off a high place is going to have innocent witnesses. Don’t do that.

I developed focal dystonia in my hands as a side effect of medication, lost my ability to draw but it’s not specifically writer’s cramp so other things can trigger it, like repetitive movements (e.g. finger tapping in mobile games), opening lids, or even sometimes using a computer mouse.

Cramping and muscle weakness is not nothing. Your condition needn’t be terminal to be serious.

I got a doctor’s note to use a laptop in college because some professors banned them from their classes.

My sister’s great about opening things for me without a fuss.

Standing or sitting for too long is unhealthy for anyone. I’m sick (pun intended!) of our work culture glorifying demonstrably damaging behavior like sleep deprivation. Try talking to your doctor about getting a note ordering sitting for whatever intervals and duration seem reasonable, you ARE entitled to breaks, though maybe you can see if there’s work on your job that can be done sitting.

644,"Oh my god.

Okay, look. Autistic people, out of ALL people, know it's a two way street. You don't need to explain it to me.

But we're already doing all of the work.

The effort is on you guys now.

Autistic people have been repeatedly accused of not empathizing, of not caring about other people, about not having a theory of mind.

But we do. Autistic people experience the world in a different way than non-autistic people. A VASTLY different way. People assume that, because we don't want to do things in the same way as non-autistic people (see: many of us don't like eye contact, may not like hugs or touches, don't express love or admiration in the same way as non-autistic people, struggle with expressing emotions or don't follow the same patterns of facial emoting or body language), we can not empathize. That we are *incapable* of feeling love, of understanding your views, of feeling your emotions.

And it's resulted in this massive dehumanization. It's resulted of hundreds of cases where parents of autistic kids murder them and get away with it, because it's a 'mercy killing'. It's resulted in the most popular ""therapy"" for autistic kids being conversion therapy for gay men, made by the same person with the same techniques, repurposed for Autistic kids, including a history of tying us to tables and shocking us, giving us bleach enemas, putting autistic kids in 40-hour-a-day therapy cycles that cause PTSD. It's resulted in massive unemployement rates, skyrocketing levels of suicide, average lifespans that are shorter than a non-autistic person's by 20 years because doctors don't know how to treat us and we're killing ourselves by the hundreds.

But the REALITY is *not* that we are incapable of these things. It's that we do things like emote, react, empathize, etc. in different ways, and non-autistic people don't know how to empathize with *that*. It's why the test shows that we are seen as less likeable, less personable, the type of person you wouldn't sit down next to, spark a conversation with, become friends with, share a room with, etc.

Because, while we're being forced as kids into hours that most adults have for their jobs to teach us how to understand *non-autistic* people, non-autistic people care so little about understanding us that we aren't even considered worthy of talking to. 

No, people didn't know we're autistic in that test, nor do they often know in reality, but that doesn't matter. Autistic behaviors, body languages, postures, etc. are so stigmatized and so villainized that people don't even have to know what they're hating.

We're told that people who don't make eye contact are liars. That they can't be trusted. We're told that everyone emotes in the same way - and if you don't, really, you're a sociopath. We live in a society where extroverted, highly social people are glorified to an extreme. 

And people don't put in effort to listen to us. It's hard to make my point and have a ""two way street"" if people won't even initiate conversations with me. 

So. Make it a two way street, damn it.

Like, we're trying to! We're all trying to! Because if we don't constantly empathize and understand non-autistic people *perfectly*, we don't have jobs or friends. We don't get promoted or married and we don't get access to resources.

But if you guys don't empathize with us, nothing happens. It doesn't matter.

653,"Of course, most other folks with different disabilities aren't inaccurately stereotyped as being unable to empathize with others themselves.

Even if their own empathy is minimal and they treat you like shit because they're unable to imagine what having sensory differences is like.

This is particularly important when discussing autism because a lot of treatment, if improperly applied, sets up neurotypical social behaviors as the gold-standard for empathy.  The discussion tears down a false preconception, that a neurotypical is going to be inherently more empathetic than an autistic person, which is one of the justifications that gets used to ignore a therapist or caregiver who is being abusive to warp therapy into attempts to produce NT children rather than autistic children with a better quality of life.",,,,EmeraldPen,"Dyspraxia, Autism, &amp; JHS(hEDS likely)",,1511499775,t5_2qhe8,t3_7e6ocy,t1_dq3ssty,2,1512951639,0,0,dq9k8zh,disability,,,,,

However, the simple fact is that, as a rule of how we are raised, autistic people are taught to bend over backwards to learn all about how non-autistic people emote, behave, react, etc. I have gone through hundreds of hours of patronizing and infantalizing “therapy” teaching me “proper” social interaction, and despite all my hard work to constantly make other people comfortable, I’m still seen as creepy/awkward/unfriendly.

On the other hand, non-autistic people see us doing something like not making eye contact and instantly, from that tiny factor, assume we are less likeable and dismiss our words. Instantly.

I have been forced to constantly “empathize” and be kind to people, even people who are legitimately ableist, manipulative, and have no interest in doing the same. I have gone through 8 years of compliance-based training to teach me to say yes to everything non-Autistic people want from me, to make myself uncomfortable and to put myself through actual pain so that non-autistic people can get their beloved eye contact, but they can not for a single minute not make shitty and baseless assumptions about me based on a few minutes of lapsed eye contact.

I would call that a lack of empathy.

I would call that a lack of theory of mind.

If you can’t even fathom that other people might have different sensory experiences than you, and punish them for that, that’s a lack of empathy.

672,"&gt;  Yes they will be expensive, but they will last 

This is what I thought too. Unfortunately I have found that they don't last and are just expensive. Motorbike gear is designed for a single, serious impact - you crash, skid, and replace your impacted gear. Wheelchair users need equipment that lasts with continual friction over a long period and motorbike gear just isn't designed for it. 

A lot of the protection is over the backs of your hands, your fingers and knuckles. We don't need that protection, it just impedes movement and is a pain in the ass. I've tried some very pricey motorbike gloves and although they are lovely and warm, they wear out just as fast as any random thick leather gloves which will be much cheaper.

Please apply for public/income based housing as well. Then you'll only pay 30% of your income for rent. If you don't have any income I think you pay $25 a month. Just look up your county's housing authority. You can also apply at others as long as they're willing to accept people outside of their county. 

Please hold on until you get into housing. Then SSI. Also, If you get denied initially (this is normal) please get a disability lawyer and appeal. They take a small percentage of your backpay but they increase your chances of getting approved tremendously.

I will set the stage for what happens: The Republican presidential candidates are debating what to do about health insurance. They all claim that the country just needs more personal accountability, which is their way of saying ""pay for it yourself or get fucked. No hand outs.""

Ron Paul, being a former doctor is asked about what we should do with someone who is young, feels invincible so they don't have health insurance, they end up in a coma and someone has to pay the hospital bill. Patient has no job or income or assets left, because they're in this coma in a hospital.

Ron Paul wants to answer. The crowd, on live national television during a presidential debate, start screaming ""LET HIM DIE! USA! LET HIM DIE! USA!""

The disgusted Ron Paul is so mortified he can't hide his emotions and goes ""Nooo, that isn't how it should be!"" but nobody seems to listen. 

It ends up being the last time he runs for the presidency.

Assuming they are inflated tired, the easiest is to carefully look at the tire sides and look for engravings. They may be on either side or both sides of the tires and may be hard to find.

Him: if you don't mind me asking, why do you use a wheelchair?
Me: I have EDS and POTS, and right now it's causing me or severe knee pain. 
Him: oh really? I'm autistic. I've never heard of those, can you tell me more about them?

We ended up talking good a long time and hung out later. We're still friends on FB and have learned a lot from each other. I ended up finding out I'm likely autistic (it's different in females) because of this random encounter.
Everyone is different, but I personally don't mind questions so long as they are respectful and the person is genuinely curious. Saying something like ""omg if I had to deal with that I'd lol myself"" is never appropriate, especially when many people with EDS really do commit suicide.

723,"Well hey look at it this way: You worked as long as possible. You worked and earned SSDI. So please don't feel bad. You paid in and earned it. Don't feel bad for something you deserve. I didn't earn SSI.. I was 12 before my social anxiety and depression became too much, then it was mental hospital, adolescent transitions, psychiatrist, meds til I was 15. Then High school I couldn't possibly do, so I switched to cyber school. Went to adolescent transitions again, psychiatrist, therapist, more meds since. My first job was one I honestly thought I could do. It was Apple tech support over the phone. I was great with phones (not anymore. My brain is mush from the pills now). But I couldn't even handle talking to people on the phone or interacting with others at all. It crushed me. So at 18 I applied. I thought I was going to start fresh out of high school above minimum wage at a stay at home job. I was so happy. Only for it to end in the worst panic attacks of my life. So I was only able to do 4 weeks of training (There was no talking to others during, except at the very end when i lost it.. ). So now I'm stuck on SSI for life (something I didn't 'earn'.). Maybe Ill get Adult Disabled Child Benefits once my parents retire. But I hope I'll get better.. Even though a part of me knows I wont.. 

So please don't feel bad. I think you did great and tried your best. If something isn't possible, it just isn't. Don't beat yourself up over it. 

Do you have any interests? Tv shows? Movies? Video Games? Drawing? Walking? Do you live on your own? Any family, friends or roommates that would take you places to get your mind off things?

I watch superhero Tv shows with my parents: like The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow. Some days I can barely get up to watch it but my parents force me so it's routine at least, and they are fun shows to watch. I watch horror movies when I'm so fatigued I can't get out of bed. I read manga online sometimes when I don't get anxiety from it. Play video games when I can actually get enough energy. 

You're still young so don't feel bad. I'll be there in about 20 years. There's more people than you think though in our position. So don't count yourself out. 

There are people that don't care about others limitations. Just very hard to find. A little different situation but: My neighbor doesn't work. And she went through a ton of surgery recently for a brain tumor. Her fiance stayed by her side and doesn't care that she doesn't work.  My aunt never worked, her husband took care of her. So not working isn't a huge deal to some. Disability money helps. As for health problems: there are some that are nice and would be willing to be with people with health issues. Again, just hard to find. These days people are more superficial and care about money and having as much as possible.

724,"No.  Misery loves company...well, maybe that doesn't completely apply as I don't really enjoy company that often.  I mean it's nice to know I'm not alone.  I'm on SSDI, just got on 3 years ago.  I never considered it.  I never considered I had a problem.  But job after job, not finding my thing, always working about a year then becoming overstressed with it and quitting, my mother said I could probably qualify for disability.  I didn't think so, but figured I'd try anyway.  I really did hit my wall with my last job.  I started in 2009 and knew I couldn't handle full time at that point, so I was lying to my employer saying I was going to school and couldn't work full time.  I wasn't, but I didn't want to be the 30 year old that wouldn't work full time.  It got worse and I couldn't work regularly.  I took a flex job just covering shifts for people.  That started to cause too much anxiety and I started calling people to cover the shifts I was covering for someone else.  When there was the chance for a transfer to another site (was working security), I requested to work alone as I had anxiety issues.  I used the wrong words and it scared my employer who let me go.  It was at that point I applied for disability.  When I qualified, I really thought I could relax and try to enjoy something in life.  I can't.  I sit around searching the internet for something interesting to keep me busy.  Nothing is interesting.

The hard part for a relationship is that even if someone would have me, I couldn't let them settle with me.  I'm not good enough for someone that is good enough for me.

There are more that would be understanding though. Have you thought about a dating profile? I would just put your disability right out there. If they message you it means they know and they don't care. And/or they're understanding. Also about age, some women are superficial. Some would dump anyone for someone with much more money,even if he is a lot older. I for one am just one of those people who don't care for age or money. But it's most likely because of my problems and how they made me see the world. In a non superficial light. There are women out there who see you as a person, not money, not looks. But attitude. If you do want to try to find someone I would suggest dating apps since that's the thing now.. But be open and honest on the profile. So it leaves out the superficial ones or ones that need something you cannot provide. 

I hope she'll be okay for a long time. That's sweet of your brother to let you move in! Hoping that's soon for your sake. Have you thought about Public/ income based housing? Or Section 8?

It's good that you're looking forward to something(moving out) it gives you a reason to live. It's my reason too right now. 

Hm, Have you thought about getting Netflix? They have movies and original shows on there. Stranger Things in my opinion is great. 

Do you have any gaming systems? Or do you do PC gaming? What type of games? Sports? Or fantasy games? 

You did earn it though, as you qualify! It's not your fault if your disability lasts forever. Think of all the people on SSI and others on SSDI that worked less than you. They still in my opinion deserve it if they cannot work. There's just no other option. 

I just look at it like this: I am grateful. Very very grateful. I probably wouldn't be here without it. I feel bad, but others are on it. Lots of others.

818,"Awesome! I’m glad to hear that you’ve thought through a lot of this, and that it may work out! One of the biggest things for me, in regards to keeping my sanity, was the fact that my group of friends *did not miss a beat*. They were solid and understanding when I needed something, but we also kept doing everything as normally as possible. It was huge for me, and I think it really helped my recovery. 

This is one of the few things in life that is *seriously* a crossroads. It seems like people only come through it as more empathetic, more patient, and generally happier, or they come out bitter and angry. I am a *firm* believer that accepting your limitations for what they are early on sets you on track to be in the former group, but the only way you can really do that is if you have friends/family there showing you everything that life has left. You’re helping to set your friend up for success!

General thoughts based on your reply:

* More on this at the bottom, but I think you’d be fine to meet him with a manual chair at the gate. There’s no guarantee he’d be able to use the rail-style lift. Those seats are generally narrow and without sides, which makes transferring problematic (balancing) when you have a bunch of dead weight on one side of your body.

* This is a different thing entirely, but have you considered maybe adding a porch/screened in area outside the basement door? The reason I thought of this is that if you could add a few additional feet of room outside the door you might be able to convert those last few steps into a ramp and solve all of these issues. It depends on how many steps there are, but pouring a 10:1 concrete ramp would be cheaper than any of the rest of this, and it also helps get heavy equipment in and out of the basement. (The screen porch would be just to cover the outside/additional few feet of ramp needed, but with a cafe table it could make a nice place to sit/smoke/whatever.)

* If he is paralyzed on one full side he’ll likely have a chair very similar to my powerchair. It depends on who his insurance works through (Permobile or Quantum), but FWIW here are the dimensions of my Quantum: Height: 54” (just _under_ five feet; my bad); Width: 27”-30” (depending on where controls are located); Length: ~56” (toes to rear casters).

* Chair Lift: just as a clarification, if you bought a lift from a lift company, any dedicated interior wheelchair lift you get should be able to handle his weight in the chair (meaning it’s not like you have to look for a super heavy duty one). Still, you’d be looking at $5,000 plus installation.

* Ability to transfer: this really depends on how he ends up. If he has full paralysis on one side or the other, and I mean foot through shoulder, it will be fairly difficult — but not impossible — to transfer seats on his own. Legs and arms are a lot of deadweight, and they tend to flop around when there’s no muscle control. If someone is there to hold the other seat study for him, he might be able to do it with one arm. He might just need help making sure that the other leg and other arm are tucked in, it all depends on his level of control.

* How soon can he transfer: again, this depends on his rate of recovery, and how complete his recovery will be. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that it may not be a quick recovery. The longer he spends in the hospital, or in bed at home, The more muscle tone he loses on the side that he will eventually have control over. Think about it this way: do you do push-ups every day? If so you would be able to handle yourself in a manual wheelchair for a couple hours – maybe a trip to the mall. If not, you’re going to have a lot of trouble learning to be in a manual chair. I mention that, because transferring is a similar motion to a push-up. Except that he will have to learn to support all of his weight on one arm so that he can push away with his leg. It’s a difficult balancing act, that requires a different type of strength than most adults have, and after spending a month or however long in bed or at the hospital losing muscle mass it can be very difficult. So even after he is “recovered“ it may take him a much longer time to be able to successfully transfer himself between chairs.(i’m sure his PT will take care of it, but he needs to be using a dumbbell and strap on waits for his leg when he’s at home, whenever he can. It does make a big difference.)

* Using a manual chair: if he has paralysis of one full side, he will likely not be in a manual chair, but rather a power chair. (He May have a manual chair for the first few months — getting fitted for a power chair and having it built takes time) You can’t push a manual chair without both arms – even though that sounds obvious. Because of that, switching to a manual chair when necessary is really strange at first. Imagine going over to a friends house, and when you reach the front door they sit you down in the dining room chair, tie your feet together, and then tie your hands together. Whatever you need you have to ask them for. If you have to go to the bathroom, you have to ask them to take you to the bathroom, and push you over until you’re directly by the toilet. Then you tell them to leave, but you have to holler for them to come back and get you when you’re done. If everything goes fine, it’s just a little bit strange. But if something goes wrong, you are completely at their mercy. If there’s a fire. Somebody does a drive-by shooting. Somebody breaks into the house. Whatever. Sure, these aren’t likely events, but being in a wheelchair, it’s something I think about. I am acutely aware anytime I’m in a building with an elevator that, if there is a fire, I’m relying on the strangers around me to get me out of that building.I have absolutely no doubt that you would risk your own life to get him out — because you sound like that type of person – and I imagine that he wouldn’t have any doubts about that either. But it’s a strange/difficult position to be in, especially in the first year or so after you start using a wheelchair. I hope that makes sense — it’s not a condemnation of you, just that it is _so_ easy to feel like a burden, and when you have to rely on someone else completely, it makes it that much easier to slip into that depression. He’ll probably fight this for the rest of his life, but after a few years it’s easier to beat those feelings into submission. Which brings me to:

* “Demeaning” things: Please don’t overthink this one. What i see as demeaning where I am is something totally different than what I saw as demeaning 10 years ago. The bulk of it is, that early in the recovery you still want to believe you can do everything you used to be able to do. You believe that you can get down those stairs if you just try hard enough. You hold on to your old life, and your old abilities. You still have that machismo that makes you want to handle things yourself/not rely on anyone else. You still have that overbearing pride about not wanting to look weak/silly, especially in front of friends. It’s a really weird time. Today, if someone wants to carry me down stairs so I can do something I thank them and let them. When I just got my wheelchair, though, I wouldn’t. Instead I would just go home and sulk about not being able to do what I wanted to.  The ability to handle things like this and I’ve on with a life that is more than your disability i’s something that comes with accepting your limits, and moving forward with your recovery. It happens at a different rate for everyone. The key here is to ask if you _can_ help (“Do you _need_ help” is generally less well received), and just back off if they say no. Let him learn about the environment and his limitations.

To sum it up: It doesn’t sound like there is a great way to get his power chair into the basement. Barring a solution to that problem, *I think that meeting him outside with a manual chair is a great idea*, as soon as he gets comfortable with it. You may have to do some back-and-fourth with him to get the support/padding right so that he’s comfortable for the whole session, but it sounds like an awesome way to keep doing what y’all love. 

Just don’t be surprised if he is a bit resistant to it *at first*, or if he gets frustrated or moody. You are being amazingly helpful, and it isn’t aimed at you at all. It’s part of the recovery process, and he’s just adjusting to it mentally. Every single first-encounter where you go to do something you used to do and discover that you can’t do it the same way any more it hurts badly. But once you can make that mental adjustment, you hardly think about it again.  There are also all sorts of cool attachments you can get for chairs! Things to hold microphones, adaptable switches if you use any voice modulation, etc. It is certainly workable!

A lot of this advice wouldn’t be necessary if you were starting a band with someone who’d always been paralyzed. It’s just that learning to deal with a sudden, life/future altering disability is really hard, but sometimes dealing with the minefield of emotions surrounding that person can be worse. Just ask my wife! Stick with it, though, and he will recover faster and be a happier person.

819,"These are great suggestions, thanks! There’s good access to the back door via the back gate and brick patio; with a little ramp at the back door over the threshold they should be able to get in the house easily. I’m building music wiring into the walls, so hopefully microphone wires can go to the nearest wall, rather than across the floor to the mixing console.  I’ll make sure the door to the restroom is wide enough.  I’ll maybe put railings on both sides of the stairs, with the hope that they recover enough functionality to be able to assist themselves as they ascend or descend.  I won’t have a wet bar down there, but maybe a beer fridge and a wine rack, so they can help themselves to drinks.

You must have better google skills than me, if your “quick google search on manual stairlifts” produced useful results. I’ll try again. My mental keyword cache has been refreshed so probably it will work this time, but if you have any specific links you found that would be swell :)

There is a big open space, a bathroom, and two bedrooms. 

For recording vocals, the ideas was that near the bottom of the stairs there will be some sort of sound attenuating door with glass in it. When we’re jamming out having fun we’ll close the door to avoid disturbing any upstairs occupants, but if we’re recording we’ll kick out any upstairs occupants and use the bottom stair landing as a vocal booth.

821,"This is wonderful information! Thank you so much.

I’ve already realized that providing access to the entire house, and around the stair corner at the back door landing, is not in my budget.  The idea is that they can come straight to the back door, which has a 1-2” high threshold, then go downstairs in a straight shot.  I’m renovating the basement, not the entire house, but fortunately the back door provides direct access to the stairs.

The expectation is paralysis on one side, but it’s early days, anything could happen.  I don’t know if a manual wheelchair is feasible with paralysis on one side, but I will google it now.

Instead of a lift huge and powerful enough for a 300lb very wide power chair, what about transferring from the power chair to a chairlift, and then having another simpler chair for use in the music room? Would that be demeaning? Or, if someone needs a powerchair, does that mean transferring between chairs is also really really hard? Really, once we’re down there, we’re singing and making music, and there’s little reason to move around except to get wine and go to the bathroom.  Maybe we could meet them at the back gate with a manual wheelchair I own, that’s designed to work with my lift system? What do you think?

I can’t predict how this will turn out.  I’ve been told brain injuries are unpredicatable.  I’m wanting to do what I can now, to encourage them, especially since I’m doing construction anyway. I agree that in the long term it may make more sense to pursue another option, such as:

1) renovate the singer’s house (which might also involve them moving to a new home that’s more suitable for such a renovation). We’ve actually been rehearsing in _their_ basement, so this may be more comforable in many ways, not just physically.  But, it would need a lot of renovation work if they stay in the house;

2) find a commercial music studio space that is accessible that can be rented; or

3) (my dream) buy a house with a garage, a warehouse, or a church building, and build a “proper” commercial music space that’s accessible, and rent it out to other musicians and put on shows on the weekends.

As I mentioned, all this advice is wonderful. I’m doing construction _anyway_. Making the staircase wider with more headroom was already in the budget, now I can just make it more wider with more headroom, and use more _pocket doors_ where possible.

The other thing that I’ve realized from all the reddit advice, is that I will also get old, and other musicians I know or meet will suffer from mobility problems.  So, some consideration of accessibility options now is probably a good idea even if our current vocalist never gets a chance to use my new space (or, better yet, recovers their full mobility!).

822,"Okay. First, thank you for the consideration you are showing. It will be very appreciated. I’m going to try to address as much as I can here, but please feel free to ask questions if you need to.

Second, and real talk: this is going to be a headache and very expensive. A stairway with a landing and a turn in it is a nightmare for a homeowner. I have two wheelchairs: a nice-ish Manual wheelchair for travel, and a fairly standard powerchair (with full back, which he’d likely have) for home and around town. My wife does accessible travel info. I’ll be basing this on my life, and our knowledge and travels.

To begin with: 32” width will not cut it. 48” should be your the minimum. My manual chair is 30” at the base (my power chair is 28”) and you need room to maneuver it. A lift/chair rail system is going to add 4-6” on both sides. Regarding headroom for the lift, without knowing what his permanent chair will be like you’ll need to ensure a fully grown adult can stand next to him. My powerchair, from Base to top of headrest, is over 5’ tall. Again, normal chairs — his will be very different from the hospital chairs most people are familiar with.

Here are some options:

Best option would be an exterior entrance — it’s the only way you get out for less than $10k, for sure. Lay a stone walkway to the rear door, and then build a ramp for whatever height change is needed. Remember, *especially for people new to being in a wherlchair* a ramp of 12” run to 1” rise is needed. So there is an 8” step? 8’ ramp. This seems extreme, and in some cases it is. But a new user in a manual wheelchair will find it nearly impossible to climb an 8:1 ramp. I couldn’t do a 6:1 in my chair after most of a decade. If he winds up in a powerchair, 8:1 is the most extreme it should be. There are also guidelines for how frequently there should be flat spots/landings in your ramp, but if you’re always there with him they’re less important.

If you don’t have an exterior entrance, or if the backyard is substantially lower than the front yard, it’s not going to be easy. First off, there are no manual options for lifts when dealing with a power chair. The weight is extreme — my powerchair alone weighs over 300lbs, and it’s a “normal” powerchair. With attachments his could weigh more. And that isn’t including my/his body weight. It’s just too much to put on a manual system; you’d never be able to lift him back up. Most electrical systems will have a manual backup, but after using it once you’ll understand why it is for emergencies only.

There are no viable power chairs that can climb stairs. There are *some*, but I can practically guarantee he won’t have one. They run $100,000+ and are not covered by any insurances, so he would have to pay out of pocket. There are some prototype manual chairs that climb stairs, but they are *dedicated* stair climbers, and require him to rely on y’all to make it happen (not a bad thing in itself, but has the same manly-pride issues I address below re:being carried. Dealing with this is not easy on someone’s psyche).

I should also address that you mentioned there will be several of y’all there. Regarding moving him and his chair down the existing stairs separately, it sort of depends on what type of chair he has.

* **Manual Wheelchair**: There is a chance that he might be okay with y’all carrying him and then bringing his manual chair down afterwards. Don’t expect him to be in this place immediately. Having to be carried is extremely disheartening, emasculating, and upsetting for a long while. It’s not an easy thing to deal with.

* **Power Chair:** Don’t even try it. It will be tempting, but please don’t. Like I said, they’re about 300lbs. You may think y’all can handle it, but let me add this. That chair is his lifeline. His only mobility. If one of y’all dropped it and it broke, he’s stuck in bed until it can be taken away, repaired, and sent back to him. It takes a long time and it sucks. Also, these are $40,000 and above, so it it’s a very expensive thing to drop.

So, now that we’ve come to the point of needing a modification there are basically three options, all requiring significant and permanent modifications.

1. If he is in a manual chair, you can have a chair rail attached to the wall of your house. It requires additional physical supports, and someone will have to help him transfer and bring the chair down after him, but he rides a little seat all the way down. It’s easy if he still controls most of his body.

2. If he is in a power chair, you can do a similar device that has a platform instead of a seat. Again, modifications to the structure to hold the weight, and a much more expensive rail system. 

3. If he is in a powerchair, my advice would be a full lift. You’ll need at least a 4’x4’ clear area that descends straight down to the floor, with access to similarly sized loading and unloading platforms. You can look up the specifics for various models online to get an idea of the cost and power requirements. 

All of those will run you $5,000 to $10,000 *plus installation* and *plus structural modifications*.

Now that we’ve dealt with the lift issue, a few other things:

* Space: Power chairs take up an ungodly amount of space, and need even more to move around. Just make sure that in your plans you include plenty of open floor and room for him to navigate.

* Doors: people tend to build doors (to bathrooms, hallways, etc) into tiny alcoves. He’ll need enough room to maneuver his powerchair around while opening the door to the bathroom, and that takes up a lot of space. **Solve this with pocket doors, which are awesome**. Also, doorways are frequently too narrow. Make sure yours are plenty wide, which is also easier to do if you’re installing pocket doors!

* Your House: Does he have to go through the house to get to your practice space? If so, remember all of those doors need to be adjusted, and you’ll need a ramp to get into the house as well. (Perspective, the curb on a street is about two times too tall for a wheelchair. Anything step/bump higher than 2” probably needs a ramp — or at least a plan to put one in.)

* Toilet: as you mentioned, this is another big issue. The room its self obviously needs to be much larger to accommodate the chair and any transfer. Beyond that, though, it’s probably worth it to just wait until he’s in stable situation, and ask him what he needs in the bathroom. There is a huge range of possibilities, and the last thing you want to do is spend money on something that he either doesn’t need or doesn’t work properly for him. Or worse, spend all your money and then find out he can’t use it without additional things. Mainly what you’ll want to focus on in building is making it really large. An 8’x8’ Square gives you plenty of room for the door (frequently overlooked) as well as a sink and toilet. You might get away with 6’x8’, or even 6’x6’, but layout will be much more important there. Also, during construction remember to leave room for the grab bars between the toilet and the wall.

* Electrical: doesn’t sound like this will be an issue, but make sure there are grounded plugs fairly frequently so he can charge his chair without stringing an extension cord around the room

* Transportation: this sucks, but if he isn’t fairly well off it may be years before he can get a van that will allow him to come over to your place again. A new but bottom-of-the-line, no-frills van is about $55,000. It sucks. I still can’t afford one. Busses help if you city has them. If not, it’s worth having a conversation about that can before you dive into this. Maybe it’s better for everyone to chip in and build a practice space at his house? Most people don’t understand how expensive it is to be disabled. I need a $60,000 van to be able to reliably leave the house on my own. I have for years, but I can’t afford it so I’m stuck at home. It blows, but it’s life. 

This is a huge, massive, off the charts undertaking. You’re a saint for considering it, but you should know that there is nothing wrong with not being able to do it. There are other practice spaces that may work out better, between accessibility, bus routes, etc. It’s completely reasonable that you might not have the cash to cover all of the renovations to your house, and no one *expects* you to. I’m sure he’ll be thrilled to have *any* way to continue making music, even if it isn’t in the same space it used to be.

Again, please reach out if you need to. Other people will have other perspectives, and I expect others might be more encouraging. I’m just trying to be upfront about the challenges.

Good luck! On the renovation, and to your friend.",,,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1511981917,t5_2qhe8,t3_7gdet6,t3_7gdet6,10,1513134470,0,0,dqip3m6,disability,,,,"Okay.

/u/anotherjunkie has some great points.  In my brother's case, transportation was and still is his biggest issue.  He uses a wheelchair accessible taxi service when he needs to go somewhere.  It's expensive, so he really only uses it for Doctor trips and a very few others.  If you can get your friend into a car and back out, there are aids you can put on a seat to help him swivel around from side-facing to front facing, and supports that attach to the door that he can hang onto with his good arm to help with balance, but you should take two people to help with weight support.  Transferring from one seated position to another chair is the trickiest part, and the most dangerous.  This is also true for the toilet.

Most of my brothers' friends have found it easier for all concerned to come to his place instead.  He has a regular gaming group that gets together weekly at his apartment.

2, post on social media about your situation and ask for help. it's a lousy solution, it feels awful, and it may not give you more than a few bucks a week, but it's something. set up a [paypal/me](<URL>) and look into a gofundme. the larger your social media network the better your chances of getting enough to cushion you.

831,"&gt; eventually it causes me to subconsciously slur my speech.

You train VTT to your own speech and mannerisms, so it can learn to cope with this. You can also use headphones on one side to cope with your uncooperative left ear and reduce this anyway. 

Have you looked at different mice? There are various adapted mice and I'm sure there will be one out there suitable for you. 'An employment level of function' is really a useless term as there are many jobs that require low levels of function and those can be lowered even further with adaptive technology.

I have a couple of quad friends who have lowered or no hand function and use a stylus on a touchpad to type. They move their upper arm and by extension forearm and hand rather than forearm and hand directly.

I would advise finding vocational rehab (or whatever it's called in your area) and making an appointment. They often have great suggestions that aren't commonly thought of. 

&gt;I don't have any social media outside of throwaway reddit accounts and accounts on various support boards.

Most social media accounts are free and compatible with the above technology. If you can manage a reddit account you can absolutely manage social media.",,,,Raargh,Wheelie,,1511981291,t5_2qhe8,t3_7geam4,t1_dqiignu,2,1513134093,0,0,dqiofk1,disability,,,,,

833,"Sorry this doesn't directly address your question but...  

I have hyperacussis too and have found ear plugs help a lot.  Or noise canceling head phones.  Also,  a lot of the anxiety and discomfort from things like hyperacusis can be managed.  Have you ever seen an OT or sensory informed health professional.  Im sure you've already tried many things.  I just had to post just in case I could offer anything new.  My best advice is to go after comprehensive diagnostics and treatment with ferocity because that can be easier than fighting for services.   When I work with my clients,  I try to help them get their health as good as it can be before we work on career goals.    

Also,  getting a formal diagnosis of autism could really help you have access to services when the time comes.   (At least in some places in the us.)  
    
Also also,  as others have already stated,  you should definitely try to get an OT, social worker,  vocational rehabilitation worker, and/or psychologist on your team when tackling issues like this.  I'm an OT and I still get help from other professionals with managing services for my disabilities.     
Regarding your actual question....  honestly I don't feel like I have enough informantion to give you specific suggestions.   In your job search, I'd start by thinking about what you enjoy and what you are good at.   A lot of times these can be made into jobs.

839,"Since you can wait, you might just wait until they call you to offer an apartment. Then explain the situation.  If you have to go to the bottom of the list, maybe wait again, but it seems strange to me that they can't accommodate requests like yours to wait for a particular building.

There might be some sort of ADA violation going on with failure to accommodate such a request.  I would look into pro bono legal resources and see if any lawyers can help.  Sometimes just a letter on law firm letterhead that explains why the system is not run right can work wonders in these situations.  Perhaps check that out first.  Usually you can call the state bar association and they can point you to any available resources like that.

840,"Yeah it seems like it. With the wording of 'telling the manager of building preference after you get a call', I'm not sure why'd they say that if they cant let you wait for the other building? I just wish they would've called back. But I know they don't even want me there in the first place.. both buildings are for those 62+ and disabled. Last year I tried applying but they actually picked up the phone and talked me out of applying. They had me crying because they kept insinuating I shouldn't be there since no one else my age would be there. I'm wondering if that's why they didn't call back..

 I technically can wait, I'm just hoping it doesn't take 4+ years if I have to move to the bottom of the list. My parents will never kick me out but they make my mental health much worse and I can barely take care of myself but they make me do everything for them. That's why I want to move out. I think at least my migraines would get better from not having all the stress and screaming in the house.
