2,"I know what you mean.  In four out of the last five years, one member of my family has hit its annual maximum out of pocket.  For our share of those medical bills, I could have bought a car or made some deferred repairs to our home.  I know the feeling of figuring out how best to pay bills like that and it makes me mad when somebody says that as long as you're paying something, they won't send you to collections.  That's not true.

Try calling the hospitals and explaining your financial situation.  That's what I did and a lot,of hospitals offer financial assistance, even if you have insurance.  You might have the hospital's part of the bill written off.  If your costs are really high, you might qualify for the Spend Down program that helps with your medical expenses.  Good luck and try to keep your head up.  There are plenty of people who understand your struggle

54,"When you go through a full medical review (called a CDR) it is **not** like the initial decision. When you were initially allowed, you were compared to SSA's disability standards. However, when you go through a medical review, your current condition is held up to *your* standards when you met disability. 

A CDR comes down to one question ""has the beneficiary had substantial medical improvement *related to work*"". So they first look at why you were allowed (lets assume it was the POTS), if that is not significantly better then they stop and continue your benefits. If your POTS is significantly better, then they start to consider all your other conditions and whether or not they would be disabling. 

In my definition I made sure to highlight the ""related to work"" part. Your improvement has to be enough that it would change what you would be able to do vocationally; just an improvement in your medical condition is not enough. 

A good example of this: imagine a person had a stroke and only retained 25% of their usage of their left arm and left leg. When their CDR comes around, they are now up to 40% usage. So in this case the person has made medical improvement, but we wouldn't consider this medical improvement *related to work*. That 40% is still no where near what would be required to work.  

If you are regularly seeking treatment and your condition(s) and health are more/less the same as your initial approval, your benefits will likely continue. The important thing at this point is to cooperate with SSA and the DDS. If you don't they will cease your benefits. 

Now, lets say that they *do* cease you at this CDR. It is vital that you appeal right away and elect for benefit continuation. That allows you to get paid while you appeal; you have to agree to pay it back but most people end up getting continued at the DDS hearing level, so it becomes moot.

55,"I understand how you feel at least about your health.  I've worked since I was 13, starting on my cousin's farm during the summer and fall.  Worked in a factory for 5 years.  Went to college full-time and worked full time.  Got an internship that turned into a full-time job.  We had a son, I was working full-time, and went finished grad school.  I was working in a career I loved.  Then I had a stroke.  Then I had a blood clot in my brain, treated with blood thinners, that nearly caused me to bleed to death.  Now I'm legally blind, not employed, and struggling with depression too.  

I can't imagine your physical pain.  I have some lower back pain from an injury, but nothing like what you are describing.  Depression is a self-feeding cycle.  The worse you feel, the more you withdraw, and you feel even worse.  I've heard depression can worsen physical pain too.  You mention going to the doctor.  Have you discussed your depression and anxiety with your family doctor?  He or she can prescribe antidepressants or other meds and refer you for counseling get or to see a psychiatrist.  Hopefully this will help you feel more like an active participant in your own life.

Counseling will help you set goals for yourself and help you come to terms with your unhealthy feeling of worthlessness.  It's easy to look at others and feel a little jealous of their success.  But it shouldn't be the measure you use to judge yourself.  Right after I got out of the hospital, I was feeling sorry for myself and was complaining about my circumstances.  My wife showed me the quote, ""I cried about having no shoes until I met a man with no feet.""  Quite frankly, it pissed me off.  Until I thought about it.  It's not even about there being someone worse of than you.  It's about being thankful for what we have.  It sounds like you have a sister who helps you, a stable, but not perfect living situation, and accessibility to healthcare.  Hopefully these resources can help you get the help you need.

Instead, you choose to share your experiences in a way that are meant to humanize your life, and the life of others who go through similar struggles.

Yes, it's possible to get approved for your combination of impairments and depression alone, and I can't speak to what the odds are, since it isn't about odds, but impairment severity. You're more likely to be approved by an ALJ, I can tell you that much.

As for the lawyer, they do not collect payment unless and until your case is approved, the  they get a portion of your back pay, with a maximum amount, I think, of $6000? I am not totally sure though, since that isn't my area of expertise. How long everything takes depends on your state. Yes you should bring witnesses to testify but don't bring 3 that are all going to say the same thing. If you can get your doctor or therapist to testify, that is ideal. As far as behaviors to avoid, just don't exaggerate or lie.

I'm sorry for all the SSDI/SSI rigmarole you went through, you shouldn't have had to provide all that information twice, the SSA offices are understaffed and overworked, with high turnover rates. I'm also sorry you were denied; with the new listing changes for mental health conditions, they are instructing us to focus on signs instead of symptoms. So you can talk about your feelings and symptoms, but if the doctor can't find signs of mental illness, such as poor eye contact, disheveled appearance, inability to concentrate or pay attention during the exam, slowed or hyper motor activity, observable nervousness, etc., they're going to call it nonsevere.

71,"Articles like this make me angry.  Of course the media is going to profile a family like this as the face of disability, especially focusing on the grandmother's fight for reinstatement of her grandsons' benefits.  Our nation is going to cut entitlement programs to free up money for defense and anti-terrorism efforts.  The writing is on the wall.  It's easier to influence voters when all they ever hear about disability programs are stories of ""pill poppers"" looking for a check.  I'm not judging the family featured in this story so much as I'm reading between the lines and extracting the narrative the piece is communicating.

Why not profile someone like my father-in-law, who worked 30 years in a coal mine until a piece of equipment crushed him, leaving him disabled?  What about an acquaintance of mine who worked as a logger for years until a falling tree maimed his leg?  Or a former deputy sheriff who had to quit a few years short of his full retirement due to a rare type of cancer?  I know two families with young children that have congenital heart and trisomy defects who will likely be on disability benefits for life.

76,"B 27 antigen means nothing in and of itself. It is associated with many diseases, but in and of itself, it's not a disability. Bulging discs in neck/spine and pinched nerves in neck/shoulders will depend on the severity and your age. The younger you are, the less likely you are to be allowed for these conditions. Not able to lift more than 5 pounds is an opinion; SSA will give you an evaluation on how much they think you can lift based on your medical records.

As for your mental health- a lot of that depends on your functioning. Not seeing a psychologist regularly is somewhat harmful to your case. Have you been hospitalized for your psychiatric condition at all? Otherwise, what are you basing your manic depression classification as ""severe"" on? Mental health impairment will depend on your functional limitations and the severity of your conditions.

92,"Don't try to do anything specific, it will probably come across as faking. Be honest and be as open and specific as you can. What we're looking to determine is how your impairment (physical or mental) affects your daily functioning. So don't exaggerate or lie of course- but don't downplay the way your condition affects you. Mention anything you think someone who knows nothing about you and your condition would need to know.    
Not sure what your psych issue is, but for example- Is your sleep affected? Do you ever stay home/ isolate due to symptoms? How are you with getting along with others? Have you ever had problems with prior work or school, bosses, co-workers etc? Any difficulty paying attention? Memory problems? Do you take medication? If so do you take it as directed? Do you follow your prescribed treatment? (And still have symptoms) These are just a few examples of things to bring up if they apply.    
The reason we order exams is because the medical records don't often tell how you function. It will give you a diagnosis which reasonably causes symptoms, but doesn't usually tell us about your day to day life. A diagnosis, ongoing care, or use of medication is not enough to show me you're disabled.

98,"Buddy, the first thing I learned about disability after having an accident that left me a C4 quadriplegic is that life is unfair. I was about to turn 17 years old, had just been picked to represent my country in trampoline gymnastics, and was well on my way to becoming a surgeon. That all changed on 6 June, 1990.

It took me two years to finish high school, I then spent six years at university, studying for two different degrees, neither of which I finished, or rather, wrote final exams for. There is not much you can tell me about disappointment, disillusionment, or depression. Been there, done that.

In 2011, I finally found a career I was not only good at but had a passion for. I've been doing online marketing ever since. I can't tell you how, or where, you will rediscover your joy. I can tell you, however, that it's a choice. I'm not saying it's easy, but at least you get the opportunity to decide for yourself. The question you need to ask yourself is, do I want my life to get better and, if so, how badly do I want it? No one is going to give you your old life back. The sooner you can make peace with that, the better. Living with a disability can be very rewarding if you channel your energy into things that you're not only good at, but for which you have a passion. You'll soon discover that you can make a big difference in the lives of others.

Want to make friends? I recently joined my local Toastmasters club. Not only am I learning leadership skills and overcoming any fear I may have had regarding public speaking, but I am meeting some really great people at the same time. Something else I learned along the way was that I would get as much out of life as I was prepared to put in. If there are changes you need to make, make them. Don't let anyone tell you you can't. Don't compromise your future because it's ""inconvenient"" for someone else. It's your life!

You need to know you are not alone. It took me over 20 years to start my career in earnest. I had hardly lived before my accident took my mobility from me. At times, I also wanted to end it all. Nobody asks for disability (unless, of course, your totally cooked in the head). Sadly, however, it happens to the best of us. I want to urge you to try and make the most of what you have left. Try and find one thing every day to be grateful for. Never place limits on what you're capable of, and above all, always be true to yourself! I promise you this; it does get better.

102,"There were changes made to the way this works at the start of this year. I'm going to suggest two things:

First, [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/02/04/people-disabilities-finally-get-way-save-money/97381332/) may help you out some. Definitely read it. 

Second, what you *really* need to do is find a disability lawyer that also handles trusts for the disabled. I used to have a really good contact in CT for this, but it's been a few years. What you need to look for is ideally a disability attorney that works with disabled people who have uncommon/infrequent income -- mine specialized in helping disabled artists, people who might sell a $2,000 painting one month, and then nothing else for a few months. 

I believe it can be handled through a trust, but I don't know the specifics of administrators. The alternative, which will always work if you can keep up with the paperwork, is setting up an LLC. The inheritance would, I believe, function as ownership interest that then reverts back to you (to avoid taxes). You can then pay yourself a monthly salary from the LLC (which you would have to pay taxes on, FYI), keeping it low enough to not trigger your SSI benefits. The downside is that you'd never have access to anything more in one month than that salary. The benefit is that 1) it is completely separate from you, so the company could be ""funded"" by anyone who wanted to give you money, and 2) it will be easier to find a lawyer who can set this up than the disability trust specialist I mentioned above, because basically any attorney or accountant can do it for you. (You can technically form an LLC yourself online, but don't do it without legal advice. You need to know the specifics of directors, funding, and paperwork before you get into any of it). 

Do not take any of the specifics I said above as truth. They are true to the best of my recollection from being involved with this previously, but don't act on anything I said other than my saying to get a lawyer. I'd hate to have been wrong and that screw up your benefits.

109,"If a fictional sky god (and I agree) doesn't make sense, then how does blaming yourself on something you had no control over?

I didn't really want to go into my ""disability"" because I don't see it that way anymore. But I have to add a bit of context. I wanted to fly as a commercial pilot. Then comes the day my eyesight starts to really fade suddenly and for no reason (at the time); I am already a very young adult at this time (18). Okay, so I can get glasses and fix the problem for short term and expect in my 40's to be vision impaired to the point that I can no longer fly. I focused my entire childhood on flying (actually started flying at 13). 

At the young age of 20, I started getting an enormous ringing in my ears. Didn't do anything about it until a bit later. That later showed that I am going deaf and the ringing is so bad that I would rather kill myself than to deal with that pain (and there is no resolve to this day). So not only am I now almost blind, I am almost deaf. 

Try living in a world closing your eyes all the time, or while plugging your ears. Then try it together. 

My point here is, this put a new perspective in my life. I never did the things I wanted to do, but I am doing much greater things. I didn't give up, and yes it ruined my life as far as a pilot, but it didn't ruin my life in general. I had no control over it, just like you. I can get mad and upset, but what good is it going to do? I got pissed off and said fuck it to the world; I set out to prove that no matter what challenges you face, it can provide great insight and you have the ability to make the world a better place.

There is an idea of the ""worn-out worker"" when a person has engaged in physically intensive labor and can no longer continue and likely don't have the skills to transition to a less physically demanding career.

126,"I'm really timid about responding to this. I know there are some people who prioritize physical disabilities over mental disabilities, but I do not have that luxury. I am able-bodied, but I have ADHD that predisposed me to PTSD. (Partially because ADHD makes you annoying even in situations where the stakes are really high and partially because ADHD predisposes you to ruminate.) It really makes my life unmanageable. 

Anyway, most of my training is in bench science, meaning work in the laboratory. At my level of education, I am a technician. (without the degree I am working on, I only have a bachelor's) Unfortunately, I'm also highly agoraphobic (lab space is open workspaces) and have a couple of unfortunate PTSD triggers for a laboratory space (some of the PPE gets me going). If I were in a senior technician position I would be able to set boundaries that keep my PTSD in check, but at the bottom of the hierarchy I will just keep getting fired repeatedly. I had an office job for the few months before I started grad school, but they were so relieved when I turned in my notice that I don't think they were too pleased with me. When I reflect back, I followed the metrics. I did my job very well and was more productive than my peers. But I was streaming movies off of Amazon the whole time to keep my mind from ""going there"", I didn't eat lunch with everyone else, I tried to push every communication to email or IM, I freaked out when people walked up to my cubicle, I was freaked out by phone calls, etc. 

Years ago, I used to have some luck working in food service (not good luck), but that was before my condition evolved into the state it is now. Unfortunately, one of the consequences of the longer denial of accommodations at my university is that it's put me in further traumatic situations that have reinforced my PTSD. 

It kind of sucks too. There are some treatments out there for PTSD, but a lot of them have high dropout rates than chemotherapy trials. But on top of that, the time between when I was first traumatized and when I finally sought treatment specifically for PTSD was very, very long, which reduces the efficacy of the known treatments. 

...but anyway, that's where I'm at. I guess it doesn't matter though because I get the impression that the fact that I was able to swing a few low-effort TAships over the past year will diminish my case with SSI.

However, communication is just the symptom of the real problem. The real, actual problem is that service providers have little incentive to treat their clients with the respect they deserve.

So then what perks do they get? Do they get to park in disabled parking spaces? Should we give them student loan relief because they are doing a public service by dating someone with a disability?

Someone is not going to date someone with a disability for the perks. Hell, that is not even going to be on the radar of the ""Pro"" column. They aren't going to think ""man, I really don't know if I like this person, but hell, I love getting half priced bus tickets, why not""

Been trying to get legal help with fighting discrimination stemming from implicit ostracism at my last job since 2013 and got absolutely nowhere.

Meanwhile these same employers who ""lose"" my applications would go out and offer jobs to homeless people and then put up signs shaming them for turning it down. There was a thread about this the other day. But no one wants to call me out on my bluff and offer ME a job. Not just because I'm disabled, but also because no one WANTS me to succeed and support myself. Our society (at least in the U.S.) have learned their lessons from Aktion T4:  instead of euthanizing us, they just simply force us to do it *for* them by setting up department of rehabilitation services that are intentionally designed to fail so that we may end up homeless and kill ourselves.

Again, no one *wants* to call me on my bluff and offer me a job just to gather material for an anti-disability post called ""Why I'll Never Hire The Disabled"" - because they know that I would do such an awesome job that they wouldn't even be able to say that I slacked off or skipped days or made excuses. That goes against the narrative of many employers.

But hey, isn't that why they call this ""social security""? Paying me to stay home and never bother anyone face-to-face ever again does sound like the government is providing security to the rest of society.

Been trying to get legal help with fighting discrimination stemming from implicit ostracism at my last job since 2013 and got absolutely nowhere.

Meanwhile these same employers who ""lose"" my applications would go out and offer jobs to homeless people and then put up signs shaming them for turning it down. There was a thread about this the other day. But no one wants to call me out on my bluff and offer ME a job. Not just because I'm disabled, but also because no one WANTS me to succeed and support myself. Our society (at least in the <LOCATION>) have learned their lessons from Aktion <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>:  instead of euthanizing us, they just simply force us to do it *for* them by setting up department of rehabilitation services that are intentionally designed to fail so that we may end up homeless and kill ourselves.

Again, no one *wants* to call me on my bluff and offer me a job just to gather material for an anti-disability post called ""Why I'll Never Hire The Disabled"" - because they know that I would do such an awesome job that they wouldn't even be able to say that I slacked off or skipped days or made excuses. That goes against the narrative of many employers.

But hey, isn't that why they call this ""social security""? Paying me to stay home and never bother anyone face-to-face ever again does sound like the government is providing security to the rest of society.

Sorry for the rant and please don't let my own experiences affect your own outlook. Not everyone deserves to have a strong and loving social support system, but some of you probably does.

I did have a car the first year I was going through this but I lost it when I quit my job almost two years ago.

I've always heard people say that getting approved is a crapshoot and luck of the draw.  I really believe that to be true, because I know someone who got approved on her first attempt when she was about 30.  She called up Social Security and said she suffered from depression, had a mental breakdown, and SS sent her to one of their psychologist (the only one she has ever been to) and she got approved.

224,"Thanks for your response.  That does help a little bit.  I suppose some of my uncertainty around those questions stems from the fact that I've never actually had a job so I wasn't certain as to what would qualify as framing it with respect to 'work activities'.  It sounds like, in my particular situation, I should focus heavily on the extreme emotional/cognitive/fatigue, since that's one of my primary disabling symptoms.

The examples you gave help clarify it for me somewhat.  I guess I'm still afraid that I'm not going to phrase things correctly or in the best way.

It makes me really nervous honestly that you don't even read the second question.  Mainly because, the way the 'detailed' questions are constructed they're mostly just checkboxes--just because I *can* do a lot of those things *on occasion* doesn't mean that I can do them consistently enough to function and maintain a work schedule.  I sort of figured the purpose of the second question was to illustrate average abilities.

Speaking of that, it's that question that still bedevils me though.  Like if I were just to say ""I get up at such-and-such time, take meds, make tea, don't make breakfast because I never have energy, brush teeth, get dressed but only sometimes, spend time online, make dinner with help, [etc.--listen to music, spend more time online, watch videos on my phone], take meds, get ready for bed, go to sleep"" is that even in the ballpark of an appropriate answer?

246,"Both, building up skin strength and grip strength.  Because gloves have that added grip to them, it means your hands have to work less to maintain a grip on the hand rims.  As for skin strength, I would assume each person is different with different needs, however, building up callouses and layers of tough skin needs to start somewhere. 

When I play different sports I find that some parts of my hands need to build up layers of tough skin to counteract their overuse. When I hold a racquet for tennis certain parts of my hands need to get tougher and I might form a callous, however when that skin breaks, the skin that replaces it comes back stronger and tougher.   Same goes for basketball. 
 
To me, skin tearing is a natural process of strengthening ones hands. If you have a condition where your skin tears at the slightest contact with any rough surface , then yes, I would not heed my advice, but if your skin tears after prolonged use of repeated ( hours and hours) action, then this to me is normal.",,,,Aedonr,,,1497450383,t5_2qhe8,t3_6g7mle,t1_dis3b3d,1,1499340478,0,0,diw4wun,disability,,,,,

If your company has 15 or more people, you are eligible for accommodations under the ADA. You will submit a formal request through your HR office which will include a letter from your physician. They need only accommodate you to the point that it is an undue burden.

That's very likely an unreasonable ask. They can alter your cube set up, maybe, but to provide a blanket statement no one may approach you from behind? Never going to happen.

This simple denial of social proof means that I would be referred to as ""oh, he doesn't work, he's *disabled*, his roommate helps him pay rent."", and quite honestly, that - even to me - wouldn't make for a captivating instagram / facebook / snapchat story for my partner to share to her friends and family.

258,"It sounds like you're looking at something like the Ergoair, where the user can alternate the cushion pads as they sit in it? I don't know much about them or know anyone who uses one because they are so expensive. I currently use a moulded foam cushion on a manual chair, I can look up the model if you need it but offhand it's one of the deeper Jay models. 

Cushion weight has never been a problem for me as foam isn't heavy, same with air or honeycomb. With a gel cushion or one with battery it is something I'd have to take into consideration. I have a light but not ultralight chair, mine is around 10kg total so I'm not scrimping on every gram. Those who have paid extra to shave off weight will likely be more fussy about weight. From what I know of the Ergoair it is heavy as it has to incorporate a battery, not a problem for electric users with a good battery but less helpful for manual users or those who already find themselves stretched for battery life.

Temperature is a huge problem and I live in the UK! Getting sweaty sitting on a cushion in the sun is just asking for chafing and broken skin. The covers that protect my cushion from sweat don't really absorb it away from the skin, so during the summer I put a light wicking fabric over my normal cushion cover to help. I would like to have a cushion cover that had this included (waterproof fabric on inside, wicking on out?) but then you have the problem of removing the cushion cover regularly to wash it which is a nuisance for those of us with lowered hand function. Similarly any cushion that requires regular maintenance is going to be a bit of a pain in the arse.

The best cushions I have heard of for airflow and therefore temperature control are the newer honeycomb style. A friend who has one loves its ability to keep cool and be easy to wash, but is less impressed with its shock absorbency as an active chair user. This is an important feature for me, I need to be able to curb hop and a cushion that doesn't hug me a little when I bump up and down is no good. 

Replacing it is also a problem. I would be willing to pay a higher upfront cost for a cushion that would be guaranteed to last a long period. The problem I have with my foam model is that as it compresses with age I slide forwards in the chair without really noticing. It is only when it starts to rub or I start to have pain in my back or shoulders that I notice my cushion needs replaced, and by then it's too late. It sounds like your model would solve this right off the bat. If you're looking at an air model I'd be concerned about the rubber thickness and longevity before leaks etc. If possible a 'smart' way to check for leaks would be a great feature, to save dunking the cushion in a bath to check for bubbles!

263,"Most hospitals have charity programs. Your fill out a rather extensive financial form demonstrating hardship, and they discount your bill or even write it off entirely. Your doctor can tell you more. Ultimately, even if you never payed the bill, it's nearly impossible to forcibly collect from someone with only disability income. Because of this, most hospitals (especially non-profit ones) are probably going to work with you and will use the free services as tax write offs or something. I collect medical debt for a living currently and once I see someone is on disability I pretty much give up on the bill being collected.

Your state also likely has a Disability Rights Center or a similarly named non profit that helps people with disabilities get the care they are guaranteed under federal and state laws. My state has a center that's funded with federal money, and I'm in a red, low population state. Our center fights unnecessary conservatorship, helps get people housing, inspects the state mental hospitals, and ensures compliance in the schools by bringing cases against schools who mistreat students with disabilities. You may also have (insert state name) Legal Services or legal aid, which are  non profit legal groups who may help or point you in the right direction. 

Often, there are resources that people aren't aware of, or that honestly they're too busy surviving to research etc. Legal aid, your closest law school (it will have a student law clinic that operates free of charge), an advocacy group, or even your local library's research librarian can help get you started.

I say this because there clearly ARE some things you can do, and it's more than enough to make a living if properly used. Unhindered persons are the same, but they are more limited by their own imagination, upbringing, education, or country economics.

Service Coordinator I've had for many years leaves. The way I find out is from a new service coordinator calling. This service coordinator is just temporary, but I don't see the sense of meeting with her because of that because everytime I ask her a question her answer is ""I don't deal with kids"". And I've had major issues with temporary service coordinator screwing up my child's file. She assures me that the new service coordinator is hired and starting the following week so I should hear from my new service coordinator quickly to set up nursing services for my child's upcoming surgery. 
One month later. No letter. No calls. Call them and now the temporary service coordinator is now my permanent one. When I speak to her, her comments is, you didn't want to talk to me. When I questioned her on the fact that she knew that I was requesting services for an upcoming surgery she now claims that she is only my temporary service coordinator. Tired of playing games. I call the main number again and talk to another woman who I was told is a supervisor. Tell her my story and she promises to help. After she promises me answers today, she tells me that she will have to clear it with her supervisor. Yep, she's just a worker, not a supervisor. 
A week later, no call back. No letter. Call again and told again that temporary service is coordinator is permanent. No supervisor is available and that's the way it is. Really? Call the Executive Director, who has a open door policy and finally got a call back from the supervisor, who apologized because she admitted that they screwed up. Now, I finally have a service coordinator but it shouldn't have taken this much time or work.

What **REALLY** pissed me off is that the woman who ""told on me"" came up and asked, ""What's wrong with your leg?"" I answered ""it's for my kidney to drain"". So she kind of knew what it was. Could've spent the time tattling on me to fucking Google what it is. Or could've asked if it was safe in the pool. The fact she ignored all of that and did what she did to start shit is what really made me mad. 

Unfortunately (as far as I know) there are 0 laws protecting people from having their picture/having videos taken of them without their permission, as long as they're in a public place. Even when it's regarding a disability or any medical condition. Which is ironic, considering my doctor's can't even confirm or deny any of my diagnoses to anyone I haven't given permission to. And it's not like my bag was positioned how it is in the photo. I had it up on my thigh, attempting to cover it with my shorts. Preventing my kidney from draining properly, causing hydronephrosis, my kidney to stretch out, scar, and irreversible damage.

Based on what you have written here, you do sound like a pretty angry, argumentative person. If we are picking that up in words, that tells me there is the possibility that people are picking up that and more in person.

You've alluded many times to privacy and HIPAA, yet seem stymied why people wouldn't walk right up to you and start asking invasive personal questions.

You can't know what someone's intent is talking with management. I understand that you feel very certain that in this case you do know, but as others have said, we only have your very biased account.

Anyway, that's my two cents. I would never think it appropriate for me to walk up to another patron of a place and start asking personal questions like this.

My older sister just kinda went ""what the fuck?"" Because somewhat shy little teenage girl damn near poked a straw through a table. That wouldn't have worked but it went through my cup.(i man I kinda wanted that root beer thoighb:() 

How's my brain incapable of processing it?

Not really. And my parents don't like most animals. Which me: I'm
Gonna go talk to FHE lizard.(that one time I convinced a wild lizard that my hand was a fun place to sit because I wanted to say hi... ) I feed the animals in my backyard. There's an alligator snapping turtle family that loves acknthere. They're pretty chill. Probably because I feed them I wouldn't touch one they're kinda capable of a lot of damage

Piano? Undone side of your body works then you can play the melody pretty easily possibly. Or singing

I guess. But what else is there? I mean I love horses. I think it scares my mother when i just went ""I rode him."" I think she thought I rode a stallion. Nope. I'm not crazy. Friend goes ""you should learn to jump"" like she's absolutely nuts not happening. Then again said that about riding in the first place and now it's more like ""when can we go riding again?"" 

But still animals. That's all I've ever cared about and it's being ruined. Surgery also took away my parents just letting it go about me not eating meat. I don't mind it now but there was that month or two where it made me physically sick with guilt. Which that's my own fault because I picked a really bad time to decide ""I'm vegan now."" Which that was interesting. Found out there's actually several restraints in our town you can get vegan food even though they're not meant for that. Was yummy. 

I just don't know hat in doing with my life anymore. I had things pretty well
Planned out. Had the option in my head that I was going to work with animals and then I had surgery and now I can't even start college because in my state apparently you get free community college provided you start right after you graduate high school. Umm I was in the hospital and then I recovering for MONTHS. Which by the way sucked. Because apparently I actually do a lot you can't do while recovering from nearr surgery. Doctor just goes ""you can't ride a horse for the next 6 months sorry."" But but... I can ride now. I don't think I ever really asked the doctor if I COUKD I just kinda went ""let's go"" when at a friend's house helping her with something.

315,"&gt; But she was not in the photos, how can she be the one to give consent? That's where I got confused as to how the whole thing works. 

Yeah, it may seem a little silly. However, she was able to see the equipment you had, which means that she would have memorized what it looks like. In a technical sense, what difference does it make for a person to take a picture to record the same thing?

Even if the above rationale doesn't make sense, that's just the law. If you don't like it, I encourage you to petition.

&gt; And medical issues are a private matter. I've been in court and the judge said if you have a medical reason as to why you weren't paying your fines, you can request that everyone leaves the court room.

That's a part of your ADA rights that is meant to prevent you being discriminated upon in the courtroom. Think of it as being like pleading the fifth. ""Medical issues are a private matter"" depends immensely upon the context. For example, if you need accommodations from a school or an employer for your disability, surely it's reasonable for them to know what your disability is so they can accommodate it. Medical issues aren't inherently a private matter in all cases. If it's legal for someone to take pictures of people in public, then why would that change just because you have medical equipment? You might not like it, but that person was completely within her rights.

318,"&gt;There are lots of things about the SSDI system that can use improvement, including wait times.

The thing that the SSDI system needs the most with regard to improvement is more funding from the federal budget.

The loans in question are federal funds, more of which SHOULD be allocated to help people survive in situations like this. It's politically and morally negligent to expect people to wait for years for SSDI, while demanding that they not make any income while waiting for approval. There's no safety net. 

Even websites like Disability Secrets says that you should prepare for the possibility of having to live on credit cards for a few years. That's hardly different. 

&gt;But no one, regardless of reason, should take out loans that they have no intention of paying back.

Not even for literal survival?

The morality you are applying to the situation is not employed by any of the corporations that currently rule the financial game and influence government through lobbyists. They run the show. It is purely legally acceptable for businesses to find every possible loophole and means to bend the system to their benefit in the name of profit. It's what they are expected to do.

Why not allow an individual who is at risk at becoming hungry and homeless (and more sick than before) that same ability?

On topic though... However rude their going behind your back might be, people have a right to know your procedure is safe for them in the pool... 

Its not discrimination to fear something they are ignorant of.  For example, if someone's face is covered in rashes and blisters and some parent tells them to stay away from their kid... That's not discrimination... They don't know what is wrong with them, they don't know if they are contagious... They have every right to protect their kid... 

Likewise someone walking up and getting in the pool with them while have a literal hole in their body and a bag of urine strapped to them... They don't know that is safe.

I've had to deal with some of what you're describing. I can relate to feeling exhausted, burnt out, and feeling like no one is listening.

352,"There is a nuanced difference between what the article is talking about and fraud. **Fraud** within SSI/SSDI is rare; that involves someone *knowingly* deceiving the agency and submitting false information. The family in the article is not attempting to defraud the government (they do believe the children are disabled. 

I think its a strawman argument that occurs often in the disability community/this sub. One can question certain aspects of the program without ""attacking"" those who are disabled. One of the reasons that the SSI/SSDI program is hemorrhaging money is because of issues like what has been raised in the 2 WaPo articles; that can have very real effects on everybody else. 

&gt; You could have a parent that should be getting benefits, but the amount is so low they have to get their kids in it.

If an adult is on SSI/SSDI and they have minor children they already get auxiliary benefits. Following your logic, it is ok for a parent to apply for SSI, even if their kid is not disabled, in order to try to get more money? If you want to have a discussion about the SSI amounts being low, that is completely valid, but I think its a misuse of the program for entire families to attempt to get on SSI to increase the family income.

353,"&gt; The director at Social Security that I talked to over the phone, when I tried to provide them, based on the phone number only, he was able to tell me that they ""do not accept"", them, as in somehow their phone number is not in their database, I am guessing.

Ok, yeah the problem was that you were trying to just give them the phone number. They need the doctor/clinic name, full address, and a phone number. That is the only way they can ensure that it gets where it needs to go. 

So did they request/receive those records eventually? If not you need to go to the clinic, get the records yourself, and fax them to the DDS (call the examiner first to find out the best way for that to happen).

&gt; they were interested that I have had a job since I got out and also I am enrolled currently in a university. Does that help/hurt my prospects? I was unsure if I wanted to tell them that information but decided to be honest in any scenario. 

Honesty is always the best policy. If your file is full of inconsistent statements it makes you less credible. Being currently enrolled in University *might* hurt, but not as much as losing your credibility. 

RE: the exam itself - what happened was fairly standard. Those cognitive questions occur for everyone. 

&gt; I kind of oscillate between ""this process is going nowhere and I am going to get denied"" and ""it seems like some progress is being made and I may get accepted"".

The process is going along for you slower than most, but it is moving. The best thing to do is stay optimistic, yet realistic. Only about 30% of initial claims are allowed, and that is skewed by people over 50 who have a much higher allowance rate.

359,"Missouri is one of what is called a ""prototype state"" in that you go from the initial decision straight to an ALJ hearing (skipping the reconsideration step).

I always suggest that a person seek a disability attorney for the ALJ level of appeal. Attorneys make no difference and the initial/reconsideration level but they *do* increase your chances at the ALJ level. You don't need an attorney to file the appeal, so appeal first and then find an attorney. You will have time, so interview a couple of different ones until you find one you like. Here are my two cents on what makes the best attorneys:

*  You want a local firm that specializes (or does a lot of) disability cases.  I would avoid the national firms (Allsup, Binder/Binder, etc), their business process is to take on a lot of clients, but then spend less time with them. They can have a lower win rate but still make a ton of money. As an examiner I can tell you smaller firms will do more work and are better advocates for their clients. 

*  Ask about any fees associated with them taking your case. Legally, they cannot charge you for their services; they get 25% (up to $6k) in back pay if you win. However, some can/will charge you for copy fees, make you pay to go see their doctors for an evaluation, charge you for obtaining medical records, etc. I would avoid these firms as those charges can add up quickly. 

*  If they tell you to abandon your appeal and re-file your claim (with them as the attorney) I would walk out the door. It is always better to appeal than re-file. The *only* exception to this would be if a brand new, very serious illness came up (like if you discovered you have metastatic cancer)

*  If they tell you *not* to talk to Social Security, or suggest that you not cooperate in any way don't sign with them. They will tell you not to talk to SSA because we are all just trying to ""trip"" you up with questions. That is such BS, SSA will go through them for everything, but you have every right to pick up the phone and call them if you want. Same thing for not cooperating. Some attorneys won't let their clients go to any consultative exams, and that never ends well.

376,"The wait for an initial decision is typically around three months, so the 90 day estimate is accurate.  Approximately 36 percent of initial applications are approved.

If you are denied and appeal the decision, in most (but not all) states you then have a reconsideration decision.  The average wait time for a reconsideration decision is also three months.  The approval rate at the reconsideration level is around 14 percent.

If you are denied on reconsideration, you can appeal again to the hearing level. This is where you will plead your case before an administrative law judge.  There is a huge backlog of cases at this level, and the wait time (which varies state to state) is typically in excess of one year.  In some states it can be two years or more.  The approval rate at the hearing level is around 60 percent.  This high approval rate is why many people say that initial claims are always denied, even though that is not the case.

The reason why hearing level cases are approved at a higher rate isn't arbitrary.  The SSA is not denying people at earlier stages to be mean.

First of all, the idea that you're ""letting"" your disability ruin your life is ableist bullshit. That little phrase is designed to blame you for the effects of your heart condition so that other people can distance themselves emotionally and still feel good about themselves. You don't have a consensual relationship with your heart condition and you're not ""letting"" any of this happen to you.

Saying that you had 19 years to get used to this is another way of blaming you for something that isn't your fault. You can't understand stuff like that as a kid. Your brain is literally incapable of processing it. There wasn't a way for you to get used to it.

You're allowed to be angry and upset that things were taken from you. It's not fair. Your situation sounds awful.

I have cerebral palsy on my left side and I wanted to major in music in college. I can't play a musical instrument and I'll never be able to. It hurt like hell when I was 16 and realized that I would never be able to make music the way I wanted. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. It still hurts sometimes.

The good news is that you're not alone. Other people have felt this way. Also, there's so much time in life for you to discover new things that you're passionate about. The idea that to be self-actualized you need to ""follow your dreams"" that you've had since childhood isn't true. Most people, in fact, find passions later in life, or choose something to do and then develop a passion for it. There are lots of things that you'll be able to do and love in your life.

If he is not currently drawing benefits himself/deceased, then you can only apply for SSI.

418,"Ssi won't let you preemptively apply. You have to be actively ill or disabled 24/7 and be judged by their doctors and work experts to be disabled enough to do no work in any way. It also takes a lawyer(who gets a % of your back pay if you win) and in my case YEARS of hearings,rejections,appeals and Dr appointments before you get it.

I'm in Texas myself. I'm 37 and been applying for ssi for 6+ years now and still stuck in appeals process. I have documented cerebral palsy,degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis and incurable leukemia and haven't worked in about a decade. I'm a licensed cosmetologist since 25 but being unable to do my profession doesn't matter. They look at any job anywhere. From assembly line sitting down to computer work part time at home. Really any job ever (including any job you've ever had) is what they look at. Full or part time, if it's a job on its way to not existing anymore(assembly job replaced by machines), if it's something you'd get fired in a week or two from having to call in, any job or employment any situation ever. 

The disability diagnosis by their doctors is hard too. Usually crappy doctors who know little or nothing about your conditions running you thru a standardized checklist. Same with shrinks. It's about finding you disabled according to that checklist. 

Even when actively undergoing chemo hardly able to walk wasn't enough. The reality that I'm gonna be ill and undergoing chemo on and off the rest of my life doesn't matter. My doctors writing letters confirming my condition isn't enough. Having cerebral palsy from birth with documented damage to my joints isn't enough. Also being under 50,male.single with no kids, and looking very gay and feminine (impossible to look butch or not sound gay. Even toned down me in a button down and tie is obviously gay before you even speak to me) are all factors that shouldn't matter but because it's Texas they matter very much and have probably kept a few judges from ruling in my favor.

Just telling you all this to let you know that applying for and getting SSI is a long process for most people. Even with a lawyer. 
Especially in Texas where the attitude towards any benefits even for the disabled is getting meaner and more punitive and the number of people approved and the amount of benefits is getting smaller. The criteria for getting so much as food stamps is getting purposely restrictive and hard for anyone to qualify for. And being disabled you have to provide documentation from your Dr saying you're too disabled to work at all Evey few months or anytime they ask for it. If you don't then you'll have to go to job training classes/volunteer work a certain number of hours a week or they'll cut your benefits off.

You have to be actively ill or disabled 24/7 and be judged by their doctors and work experts to be disabled enough to do no work in any way. It also takes a lawyer(who gets a % of your back pay if you win) and in my case YEARS of hearings,rejections,appeals and <PERSON> appointments before you get it.

I'm in <LOCATION> myself. I'm 37 and been applying for ssi for 6+ years now and still stuck in appeals process. I have documented cerebral palsy,degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis and incurable leukemia and haven't worked in about a decade. I'm a licensed cosmetologist since 25 but being unable to do my profession doesn't matter. They look at any job anywhere. From assembly line sitting down to computer work part time at home. Really any job ever (including any job you've ever had) is what they look at. Full or part time, if it's a job on its way to not existing anymore(assembly job replaced by machines), if it's something you'd get fired in a week or two from having to call in, any job or employment any situation ever. 

The disability diagnosis by their doctors is hard too. Usually crappy doctors who know little or nothing about your conditions running you thru a standardized checklist. Same with shrinks. It's about finding you disabled according to that checklist. 

Even when actively undergoing chemo hardly able to walk wasn't enough. The reality that I'm gonna be ill and undergoing chemo on and off the rest of my life doesn't matter. My doctors writing letters confirming my condition isn't enough. Having cerebral palsy from birth with documented damage to my joints isn't enough. Also being under 50,<URL>ngle with no kids, and looking very gay and feminine (impossible to look butch or not sound gay.

423,"Yes, I have had brief employment since I got out, around a month or so (30-ish hours per week)

As far as what I do now for the mental health treatment, I see a psychiatrist who gives me medication (only for the mental stuff, obviously) twice a month or more at a facility near me called PEMHS and then I see a psychologist/counselor (not sure her exact title) for one-on-one sessions twice a month or more at another facility that is a third party, but that is just more general and they do not do anything with/for my medication there.

The first facility (PEMHS) also has a pharmacy attached to it and I believe they have another segment that is for in-patient treatment. My care there is only out-patient, though. The director at Social Security that I talked to over the phone, when I tried to provide them, based on the phone number only, he was able to tell me that they ""do not accept"", them, as in somehow their phone number is not in their database, I am guessing.

The doctor Social Security just sent me to seemed only to be for mental, they were interested that I have had a job since I got out and also I am enrolled currently in a university. Does that help/hurt my prospects? I was unsure if I wanted to tell them that information but decided to be honest in any scenario. 

It really seemed to me as if the doctor that Social Security sent me to was focused primarily on the fact that I was depressed. They gave me some basic cognitive function test (spell a word, spell it backwards, etc.;) and I'm fairly certain I aced that, but the majority of the questions asked there seemed to be depression-related (sleep pattern, hygiene pattern, spent some time talking about deaths in my immediate family (both my brother and sister died), other basic stuff). 

Fortunately, I was able to provide that doctor with some of the records I personally have from the prison system and they *did* make a copy of those records. I'm unsure if that will help my case at all.

Not sure, really. I kind of oscillate between ""this process is going nowhere and I am going to get denied"" and ""it seems like some progress is being made and I may get accepted"".

First things first I guess, what's up with your SO? Is it something you are able or want to work out? Is it something you could work on if you could find free counselling in your area? Presumably if (big if, I won't pretend to know your circumstances) you and your SO could work things out this wouldn't be as major an issue. 

What housing options have you tried in your area? Have you looked into subsidised housing? Contacted your local social care services? You may also want to post your state as many times here I've seen someone suggest area-specific services. 

Have you discussed your issues with your consultant and/or surgical team? I have been kept in hospital longer than normal because I had no support network and was not fit to care for myself at home, this may be an option for you.

479,"My niece, Maria, has CP and her ortho recommended a double VDRO when she was 7 (2011). And if by ""lengthening"" you mean tendons, she had that too. We not only trust him as a doctor, he has twin sons with CP though I can't remember if they've had VDRO.

Here's one thing to understand: orthos will always recommend surgery and PTs will always recommend against it. I get both perspectives, but it's also a knee jerk reaction on both sides. My sister and I did our own research and decided to go ahead with it. We have mixed feelings about the result.

I'm assuming your son doesn't walk, or at least doesn't walk much, since those are the kids who get this. Walking/running/jumping is important for the formation of the hip joint while the bones are still ""soft"". By this age, the bone has hardened and if the hip joint hasn't formed right, it's never going to and that means the kid will suffer spontaneous hip dislocations ultimately resulting in serious complications and a lot of pain.

Maria is also severely developmentally disabled and non-verbal. That means we can't tell her what's going on, nor can she tell us how she feels. From her perspective we took her to the hospital and then she was in pain and immobilized in casts for a couple of months. To make it worse, she suffered a spontaneous femoral fracture about a week after the casts came off. It wasn't due to the surgery, it's just that kids who don't walk get crappy bones that kind of break for no reason. So one leg went back into a cast for another few weeks.

She got crushingly depressed. I mean I think she was literally clinically depressed. She was utterly miserable because she thought this was her life now. We showered her with as much affection as we could but it was an awful time. But it will get better, right?

Well, sort of. First of all, don't believe what they say about recovery time. It will take a year, maybe longer, to get back to normal. That was our experience, and we've heard the same from other parents. And her new ""normal"" is different than her old one.

Second, VDRO isn't so much about improvement. It's more about minimizing damage from shallow hips down the road. It's pretty much the lesser of two evils. Our bodies need to walk. When they don't, bad things happen. VDRO is an attempt to create a more stable structure for future weight bearing, even if only when strapped into a stander. A kid who doesn't improve after VDRO probably isn't going to without the surgery either.

Maria pretty much lost interest in standing and walking after the surgery. She used to work on both, but between the discomfort and the long period with casts and just the awful experience, she just won't even try anymore. We still put her in the stander, and once in a great while she'll try to stand with assistance, but that's about it.

We think she has pretty regular discomfort in her hips, and her ortho agrees. However I think it's less than if she hadn't gotten the surgery.

Are we glad we did it? Meh. I mean it was probably for the best but it's really hard to tell, and that's the problem. It's not like we have two of her, one with the surgery and one without, that we can compare.

Again, one reason we love her ortho is he can relate as a parent. We've talked to him a lot about the balance you talk about and he's dealt with it with his own kids. His position is you make the best decisions you can at the time, knowing you have the kid's best interest at heart. He's never tried to push us into anything. Honestly, sometimes there are no good choices, just an array of bad and less bad ones.

And if by ""lengthening"" you mean tendons, she had that too. We not only trust him as a doctor, he has twin sons with CP though I can't remember if they've had VDRO.

Here's one thing to understand: orthos will always recommend surgery and PTs will always recommend against it. I get both perspectives, but it's also a knee jerk reaction on both sides. My sister and I did our own research and decided to go ahead with it. We have mixed feelings about the result.

I'm assuming your son doesn't walk, or at least doesn't walk much, since those are the kids who get this. Walking/running/jumping is important for the formation of the hip joint while the bones are still ""soft"". By this age, the bone has hardened and if the hip joint hasn't formed right, it's never going to and that means the kid will suffer spontaneous hip dislocations ultimately resulting in serious complications and a lot of pain.

<PERSON> is also severely developmentally disabled and non-verbal. That means we can't tell her what's going on, nor can she tell us how she feels. From her perspective we took her to the hospital and then she was in pain and immobilized in casts for a couple of months. To make it worse, she suffered a spontaneous femoral fracture about a week after the casts came off. It wasn't due to the surgery, it's just that kids who don't walk get crappy bones that kind of break for no reason. So one leg went back into a cast for another few weeks.

She got crushingly depressed. I mean I think she was literally clinically depressed. She was utterly miserable because she thought this was her life now. We showered her with as much affection as we could but it was an awful time. But it will get better, right?

The only comment my husband made was that the pat down was ""very thorough""--which might be humiliating, depending on your point of view. But, for what it's worth, it's the same pat down they do for everyone (there's a video on the TSA website that shows what they do). The agent even explained what he was going to do before he did it.

510,"  I was somewhat hesitant to call, but decided the worst they could say was ""We'll consider it during reconsideration.""   I found it interesting that the doctor looked at my case in late May and the records were received afterwards (I went to the SSA on 5/31 with my newest records) but my CE from mid-June was listed.  I don't want anyone getting in trouble with their boss, because we're all human and make mistakes. However, I deserve to get a fair case evaluation.  Even if they deny me again, I know my case has been reviewed with a fine toothed comb.

Do you use any mobility aids, stick/crutch/manual or electric chair? I'm assuming no full time chair as you mentioned walking. Some people find disability sport helpful for mobility difficulties to meet people who have had the same or similar capabilities for a long time but who are still very active. I learned most things through trial and error myself, but some learn a lot about learning to live with a disability through others, particularly with practical physical tips. 

What do you mean by 'perks', can you give an example of some you've already found? I'm more empathetic personally, I put more effort into understanding about other people (although that may also be down to increasing age!). If you use mobility equipment you can pimp it out which I find a major perk. I love being able to go fast. It's great to always have a seat, and most people are happy to offer assistance with anything, though this can go the other way too. 

If you're meaning more financial/material there are things like (here in the UK) discounted travel, adapted parking, carer's discount. I think they've done away with or restricted queue jumps for days out after people started abusing them. There are guaranteed interviews for jobs which is great if you've been out due to illness. You get to board first on planes or be seated first at concerts.

Most of the 'perks' I get are for when I have a carer, normally a discount for them or sometimes free. Still not really a net gain because I'm paying to hire the carer, then paying for their discounted ticket as well. Here you must prove your eligibility for various concessions and that can be a pain in the arse, hopefully it is better in your area. It is also not unusual for a fee to be involved, I have a Blue Badge for example that allows me to park in more spots and for free but I had to pay a small fee (£30) to get it and have to renew it annually.  

I would still suggest you contact your local social work/vocab/community care department. If you're not sure who they are, ask your doctor or whatever medical professional is overseeing your care. I would also try your local library as they often hold application forms for disability-related-schemes here.

515,"1) States will have more authority to reimpose lifetime and annual benefit caps and eliminate essential health benefits. This may be the most insidious provision of the repeal bill, and certainly is the most deeply hidden.


2) Protection for people with preexisting conditions is destroyed.
If state’s allow insurers to offer plans without those essential health benefits, they’ll offer “skinny” plans that don’t serve the needs of those with serious conditions. Plans that don’t cover cancer drugs or hospitalization, perhaps. Those patients will have no choice but to opt for more comprehensive plans, which will end up with an overabundance of expensive enrollees and therefore much higher premiums.
3) Older Americans would get socked with much higher premiums and costs.


4) The biggest tax cut for the rich is retroactive.
the measure’s tax cuts taken together, valued at about $700 billion over 10 years, would be almost entirely paid for by the bill’s elimination of Medicaid expansion


5) The fight against opioid addiction is crippled.


6) Salaries for health insurance chief executives can go through the roof.


It removes a limit on the deductibility of CEO pay in the health insurance industry written into the ACA.

518,"Similar situation here. I started my own company when I was 30 and aside from a few bumps, did very well in my 30s. In my late thirties, I started getting worse and worse. I pulled my involvement with my company back to part-time and contracted out most of the work and went to work full-time for the benefits. That lasted 18 months before I was downsized, which we all knew was because I had been hospitalized twice for more than a week and had missed about 20 days in addition.

In the ten years since, I continued to deteriorate rapidly. I need a surgery that is only a stopgap, so they hoped to wait until I was in my sixties so that it could at least get me to my seventies. Things progressed faster and I need the surgery in my early fifties. I applied for disability as soon as I found out, and that is why I was in a panic that it could take four or five years to be approved and it might be too late for me.

Are you getting treatment other than through the federal system? You mention the court-mandated treatment, and those records do ""count"" so I'm not sure what that is about. perhaps some sort of misconception, is the court-ordered stuff group therapy or is it actually with a doctor?

Side question - have you tried to work since you were released from prison? One thing that SSA looks at is work attempts despite the condition.

520,"Hey! I fly a lot with a wheelchair, and I don't find it to be much of a hassle at all. 

Disclaimer: I do know that I'm in general someone not bothered much by personal space issues, so take that into account. And also I probably only overlap with half of what you'll experience, because I don't have any braces, which I imagine adds a bit to the process. 

But here's the gist of the process: 

Go to the airport. If you have any difficulty carrying your luggage, you can request special assistance. From the moment you enter the airport, one of the special assistance people can often be hunted down by either spotting them or inquiring with random employees. Or if you can trek to the check in desk, you can ask there too. If you don't really need help with your luggage, but you are super stressed about the security process, it might be worth pretending you do need help with luggage and requesting special assistance anyway. Because they'll guide you all the  way through security and it often streamlines the process.

If walking is difficult, they will provide you with a wheelchair. If this gives you the opportunity to take off your brace and that's easy for you (I don't know your situation), it's worth considering because the brace is maybe the only security hassle. But if not, I wouldn't sweat it too much--you absolutely have the right to keep your brace on. Heck I don't even take off my shoes. They ask me if I can, I say no, and that's that. When you get to security, if you're wearing brace, you tell them you have it and ask if that means you need a pat down rather than scan. I imagine it will, but I defer to actual brace-wearers for that detail. In a wheelchair, I always have to get a pat down. 

I know there are horror stories about such things, but honestly I have flown what has to be hundreds of times now--I fly for work, and I fly for fun, travel addict--and I have yet to have a bad experience. Again that disclaimer: I'm not made uncomfortable by people touching me. But that said, I've never once gotten a creeper. The genders are always matched--if you are a lady, you'll get a lady employee; male, male. They follow a rote script, back of the hands for sensitive spots, pat you all around by in the slightly  disinterested way of someone underpaid just doing their job, takes just a few minutes...I dunno...I've never found it to be that wild. Private rooms are your option if you feel uncomfortable doing that in public.

Academia is ableist.  And it's awful for EDS folks, because we can decline so suddenly -- then bam, something that was manageable before becomes impossible overnight.  That's been my life.  That's why I quit.  I couldn't take the stress of fighting for 3 semesters to have access to the damn library.  I literally wrote seminar papers based on what I could get online.  It was ridiculous.  I had a professor tell me to my face that my wheelchair and disability meant that I couldn't handle the rigors of her MA-level history class, and that she couldn't waive requirements to go to inaccessible buildings just for me.

539,"Just be honest with us as you fill out the form.  The examiners are correct that we have a lot of information to sift through every day, and limited time to do so, but we do (or at least I do) read everything.

There are no ""traps"" relating to what hobbies you can or cannot engage in, or the other questions on the form.  Giving us an honest answer and being truthful about your limitations (or lack of limitations in certain areas) is always best.  It comes across as much more credible to read someone saying something like ""yes, I enjoy reading as a hobby, but I do it at my own pace and with frequent breaks due to impaired concentration"" rather than ""I had no hobbies and I can't do anything ever.""  

Almost nobody wants to be disabled, and most people who are disabled want to be as functional as possible.  Reading obvious exaggerations (based on conflict with medical evidence) in the function report doesn't do the claimant any favors in the eyes of most examiners.  Personally, it makes me generally doubt their statements and assertions.  We see quite a few applicants who view disability as a form of welfare assistance, rather than as a means to help people who cannot work -it's easy to get jaded. 

Meanwhile, an individual who explains that they are trying their best to remain as functional as possible, but who is clearly limited by their impairments, is going to come across as much more credible in their statements. 

TL;DR: Just be as honest as possible in filling out the form.  Be as detailed as you feel you need to be, but also try to keep it as short as possible -we're very busy.

543,"Were you scheduled for a psych consultative exam? If not, you can speak to your contact at SSA/DDS and ask about whether that's possible given your long history of mental health treatment and difficulty recalling all past treatment dates. Is there someone that you could work through your past treatment periods with, say a partner or family member? All you would need are the names and telephone numbers of the facilities, and then you can call them and ask if they're still holding on to any of your medical documentation.

I'm afraid work history cannot be used as proof of a mental health condition given that there will be no signature by a mental health professional.

Think of it this way - you're in court with SSA and you have to prove to them, beyond a reasonable doubt, that your impairments prevent you from working for at least the next year or could reasonably result in death. What kind of documents will you submit as evidence of your impairment? If you only have one document from your current/recent doctor, chances of an allowance are very low. Some commenters suggest you get a lawyer which could be helpful to a degree, but again, if you do not have documentation of the longstanding and debilitating nature of your mental illness, you will more than likely be denied at the ALJ level regardless of whether you have a lawyer.

These can vary a lot in quality and there's no guarantee there will be someone with your specific disability there to empathise with, but they often know of further ways to access support. 

Honestly there's not all that much 'new world' about it. I'm the same person I was before my disability. I know there are some people who get heavily involved in activism, blogging, have all or a vast majority of disabled friends, consistently talk about their and others' disability.

They go to work/get social support, go to the pub, date, have hobbies, meet new people, eat a pint of icecream alone on a Saturday night and all that jazz.

There is room on the last page, the remarks page, for you to indicate that you deal with overwhelming emotions that limit your functionality. It is best to put what you literally do during the day- ex: get up, shower, eat breakfast, watch television, etc., then use the remarks page to indicate that your activities are limited by your emotions.

Thanks for this.  That makes sense and clears up part of what I was wondering.

&gt; I have to say that I do roll my eyes when I see responses that have filled all the lines and go off the page.

That makes me intensely nervous to know that.  As you might be able to tell from my posting style, I tend to be rather loquacious (I've been rather unkindly described as 'verbose' before) in writing--not because I go into too much minute detail per se, but I'm naturally thorough and it's just the way that I articulate myself.

I did also wonder about that 'hobbies and activities' question.  Perhaps I'm being really paranoid, but that honestly felt just like a trap.  I saw that and immediately imagined that if I really put anything there they'd automatically go ""HA!  SEE, YOU CAN'T BE REALLY DISABLED!"" so I'm not sure how to answer that.  I'm not sure what the purpose of that question is on this form, except to catch people out if they put several hobbies that require energy and claim they aren't able to work.  That's scary to think about.

&gt; 
The function report is used in conjunction with medical records as a supporting document. It is used to show how you are (or are not) able to actually go about your daily tasks. It will not alone make or break your claim.

I understand.  I'm just trying to do everything in this process the best that I can as my medical records are probably pretty sparse.

&gt; It is absolutely not true that everyone is denied the first time; it is one of the rumors I most hate. It stems from the physical rules- the older you are, the more likely you are to be allowed, so people are denied when they first apply at a younger age. For mental impairments especially, the rule of ""denied the first time"" is absolutely NOT a rule.

I never said or implied that *everyone* is denied the first time, just that I'm 99.9% certain that *I* will be.  My conditions are severely disabling but I am very young--23 in fact--and my records only go back to 2014, with only two (both were 5150 I'm pretty sure, after I voluntarily walked into a crisis center, based on what I said there) admissions into inpatient care for three days each time.  I don't have lengthy histories of hospitalizations, I don't have an employment history that illustrates my inability to keep a job, and I imagine that the conditions I'm applying on the basis of (see flair) are not widely or typically viewed as disabling.  So, sadly, everything in my particular case points strongly to denial.  I knew someone who was approved the first time through for both SSI and SSDI at 20 for psychiatric disabilities including BPD, but she was also bipolar (which I'm taken to understand has a much higher chance of approval), had records going back to childhood w/many hospitalizations and an extensive employment history (had this job, lost this job) even by that age.

The only thing I really have going for me in this regard (that is in my records) is the enormous list of meds I've been on and off and how they work inconsistently, the fact that I have genetic variations such that whole classes of meds aren't recommended for me, and that it's been treatment-resistant.

593,"&gt; It's politically and morally negligent to expect people to wait for years for SSDI, while demanding that they not make any income while waiting for approval. There's no safety net. 

Just to be technical, they can work and earn some money (as long as its under SGA) while they are going through the process. I am *not* saying that it is, in any way, close to enough to live on, but the possibility still exists. 

&gt; Even websites like Disability Secrets says that you should prepare for the possibility of having to live on credit cards for a few years. That's hardly different.

I think that there is a difference here. With a credit card you're borrowing against ""your"" money and that of a credit card company. If it becomes clear that you're not paying it back they can stop the line of credit and send you to collections. The thing with student loans is that they are often deferred; so it isn't until the government is $25k into it that it becomes apparent a person can't pay it back. I don't like the idea of someone using my tax dollars to go to school knowing they won't pay the bill.  

I see your overall point, and I think that when we are talking about ""survival"" things become morally grey. I don't think it is right when corporations do it either. 

I think that there are a lot of intermediate steps that one should take before getting to this situation. There are state-funded welfare programs a person should look into first.

What hasn't been brought up in the discussion is how the actions of this student will impact other students. They are taking a spot in classes that could otherwise go to an individual who plans on using their degree; that loan money (or scholarship money if they get anything from the school) could have gone to someone else. All things disability are going to become a hot-topic in the next few years, and its stories like this that will put the entire program in peril.

It was so hard for me to lose weight. I would think I was starving and stuff my face with whatever I could, but in reality the pain in my back was making my stomach hurt, it wasn't hunger. A good example for me, my mom was taking me to therapy and I explained how starved i was (despite eating breakfast earlier) so she bought me a large boba drink and I downed that as fast as I could. Once I got into therapy and began my exercises, I realized my pain was extremely high and I couldn't preform my exercises properly, and that what I was feeling was pain and not hunger. 

I also have a strict diet that makes this constant hungry feeling difficult, so I plan out snacks and meals ahead of time. I actually have binge-able snacks I keep around like baby carrots, wasabi-peas, or low calorie veggie chips (or something not detrimental to my health), that way I avoid things like French bread or ice cream even when it's in the house. Sometimes I can't cook my own food, making it rather difficult, but putting in the effort has helped me lose weight. Secondly, I started taking pain medication (with a small meal to keep my stomach from being upset) whenever I feel that unquenchable hunger. I find medication and thirty minutes lying down with an ice pack really keeps my hunger manageable. ",,,,VeryKite,,,1498156968,t5_2qhe8,t3_6ip0li,t3_6ip0li,2,1499572280,0,0,dj9dryg,disability,,,,,

603,"physical disabilities aren't prioritized over mental; they are just looked at a bit differently. 

One issue that comes up a lot when people are considering disability is the type of work that they want to do and were trained to do versus the type of work they are capable of doing. 

If laboratory set ups are triggering to your PTSD and agoraphobia then that is certainly a vocational hurdle to your chosen profession. But do you think that you would be capable of working in an environment where you didn't interact with a lot of people? that is something that SSI is going to look at. If its an environmental trigger (people and space) there are jobs where that wouldn't be as much of an issue. 

Are you currently in treatment now? Its not overly clear from your post. To be considered disabling the conditions have to be disabling despite treatment. There is some leeway with mental health disorders on this, but if you are not attempting to get treatment it lessens the credibility of your case. 

My best advice would be to explore some different career options. At your age you aren't going to qualify for SSDI (and even if you did it would be very small amount) so you're only looking at SSI which caps out at about $740/mo. You'd be better off long term if you can figure out what type of employment might fit you best.

However, clients must have some stability in their lives meaning their main barrier to employment must be the disability itself. If a person is in the grips of an addiction, while it is a disease, they are not considered work ready. The same would be said of unstable living situations and the like. They will take his past into consideration as it is an additional barrier, but they shouldn't deny him services based on that. If they do, I would appeal. But the more he can demonstrate his willingness to work, the better. That means keeping appts., returning calls, going through the steps. Please tell him to be patient with the process and open-minded, at the same time appropriately advocating for himself.

My disability is not visible &amp; really doesn't affect physical comfort on a bus (though i do get a bit panicked at times) , but I do know what a total drag is to take the bus. I am not sure how it is across the country, but in my southern metro area those who take the bus system are treated like second-class citizens. There are many pockets without bus stops, those that do often don't have shelters, and the routes are very limited. So, even the non-disabled, from my experience often feel put-out or are just plain cranky after having to take two buses to go a distance that would take less than 20 minutes in a car. Not to mention the times where they skip stops, the random belligerent passenger, etc that stresses everyone out.  For me going from having reliable transportation to having to use this sub-par public transportation was a wake-up call many levels. It was one of the first things I had to adjust to when it came to the point where my disability started affecting my ability to work &amp; becoming part of the system--going to get food stamps, etc. It was extremely humbling, but often I learned a few tips here &amp; from other passengers and I felt a bit less alone as I saw I was not the only having deal with the hassles of ""the man.""

704,"I'm in the process of my disability claim and the the first thing to keep in mind is that it is a lengthy process, even if you are approved initially.  She needs to have medical records detailing her disabling conditions.  Include every condition on the application.  SSA can go back a year or more, but often looks more closely at recent (90-120 days) records.  She should make sure she talks with her medical providers about her disabling conditions so they can be documented in their notes (reductions in hours due to disability, how the conditions affect her work and home functioning, etc.).  You can file online and she can even designate a representative like you to help.  My other suggestion is to be proactive.  Her case will be assigned to an examiner and you will receive his or her contact information.  Call and ask if there are any undelivered medical records, and if so, you can either contact that provider or pick them up yourself and submit them at your local SSA office.  Keep copies of everything you submit and document all the calls you make to the examiner.

708,"Hopefully I don't get downvoted into oblivion.....I have cmt disease and have had multiple surgeries, but even I see the glaring problems with the ACA. The problem is that healthcare has been monopolized, and various reliances on subsidies and IP laws as well as the practice of defensive medicine have caused us to forget about costs of HEALTHCARE and worry more about HEALTH INSURANCE covering our costs. In the past, it was possible to see a doctor, get prescriptions, and even get surgery and pay for it yourself simply because hospitals competed in a market and there was little to no government involvement in that sector. With the rise of Medicare and other great society programs, along with stricter regulation and the FDA basically granting monopolies to big pharma, everything related to medical care started to get expensive, and people started to rely on health insurance more significantly. With the insurance companies having to shell out much more money, they began to raise premiums, deductibles, and start listing those famous ""pre-existing conditions"" as ways to save money. This also, created monopolies in insurance. 

The quality of care in hospitals has gone up significantly, and now American hospitals are the most advanced and technology-packed in the world, however, costs are sky high. When the ACA passed, although it got more people on health insurance and ended most of the ""pre-existing conditions,"" the Act has basically increased the cost of premiums and deductibles heavily in most states, and actually caused many health insurance companies to either opt out or go out of business as a result of the new mandates. The situation is truly a mess, and a solution does need to be found. 

Trying to halt all ends to an extremely flawed system is only going to hurt us (disabled people) in the future. And although I'm not a fan of the Senate's replacement, protesting the end of the ACA will keep causing the prices to go up until there's a fundamental lack of health insurance quality, first for healthy people (as is already happening) and then for those who need it the most. If the cost of HEALTHCARE is logically evaluated and decreased to a point where it becomes affordable, and health insurance companies are allowed to complete, the cost will go down and the crisis will end",,,,Yellowdog727,Charcot Marie Tooth,,1498617053,t5_2qhe8,t3_6jsjvt,t3_6jsjvt,6,1499721095,0,0,djhs6ak,disability,,,,,

724,"Best advice is to allow extra time for security, especially if you're a woman, because they'll have to hunt down a spare female TSA agent to do your screening, and I always seem to get the new girl who hasn't encountered assistive devices before.

If you can get through the detector with just a cane, security is quicker. If you use a chair for the rest of the airport, they can roll your chair around and pat it while you're going through. 

If you have to stay in the chair the whole time, they can roll you through the detector, just know that it can end up taking an interminably long time, because they only allow one person in a wheelchair through at a time and try to space them out. 

They'll want to run your cane through the detector, but should have a wooden cane for you to borrow for getting through to the other side, if you need it.

They'll probably need to swab your brace, but I don't think they are allowed to ask you to take the brace off.

I started crying at security last summer because of all the extra attention. I was in my wheelchair and got someone very thorough and nearly missed my flight because of it.

For example, if your chronic pain worsens your depression, that can help your case.  Make sure that you are getting medical care for all of your conditions and that you talk to your providers about what's going on with you so it gets documented.  Your medical record is crucial.

I don't think that the author should have excluded the grandmother's motivation for disability payments for her grandsons. Obviously, disability payments are not meant for grandma to pay for her fourth divorce. Not everyone who tries to get disability should receive it. Of course, it would be nice for the author to also discuss a family who clearly is disabled and should receive disability. 
    
The article did not discuss food stamps or other welfare at all. I think that the article should have also included discussion of other support that is available and that the grandma should be using instead. Perhaps the family should be receiving food stamps. Perhaps there should be another social worker who focuses on financial planning. I think that it would have been good to discuss whether disability payments are generally sufficient for those who are disabled. It's not a perfect article by any means.

755,"There is room on the last page, the remarks page, for you to indicate that you deal with overwhelming emotions that limit your functionality. It is best to put what you literally do during the day- ex: get up, shower, eat breakfast, watch television, etc., then use the remarks page to indicate that your activities are limited by your emotions. 

In terms of how much detail is best, I have to say that I do roll my eyes when I see responses that have filled all the lines and go off the page. Be specific without giving minute details. If you enjoy reading- are you reading a book or a magazine? When it asks if you prepare meals- what kind of meals are you preparing (TV dinners, sandwiches, whole meals?), or are you ordering, bringing in foods? 

The function report is used in conjunction with medical records as a supporting document. It is used to show how you are (or are not) able to actually go about your daily tasks. It will not alone make or break your claim.

It is absolutely not true that everyone is denied the first time; it is one of the rumors I most hate. It stems from the physical rules- the older you are, the more likely you are to be allowed, so people are denied when they first apply at a younger age. For mental impairments especially, the rule of ""denied the first time"" is absolutely NOT a rule.

757,"You absolutely hit the nail right on the head.  I guess it comes down to people wanting more and be willing to seek it.  I'm sure there are other resources available to them--maybe not monetary benefits--that would help them over the long term.  Financial counseling would definitely help this family. There are programs to help low-income families weathering their homes to help reduce their electric bills.  Maybe bankruptcy would help erase the high interest deb that is crushing their budget.  I'm not saying this family could do it overnight, but I think there are some programs to help them stabilize their situation.  The entire time I was reading the story I was concerned about what would happen to the daughter and her children should the mother pass away.  

I also thought about the boys and the life they are being steered towards.  Being labeled with so many dire conditions can't be good for their self esteem.  Instead of encouragement to do their best, these boys hear about everything their ""disabilities"" prevent them from doing.  And this hits home to me because my 11 year old son was diagnosed with autism this year.  He is very high functioning  He talks in depth about politics, science, technology and other subjects, but he struggles to dress himself correctly or to eat without making a mess, and he is lacking in some social graces.  He wants to be a medical doctor, and I encourage him to work hard to pursue his dreams.  I tell him that he may want to steer towards medical research or something because of his spatial deficiencies, but I would never tell him he can't do something.  I wish those boys could have a strong role model in their life to encourage them rather than make them feel like they're just a diagnosis.

759,"Like almost any difference in society, to be disabled is to be other. 

When I was a teenager, limping, stuttering, spasming teenager with little social skills I wanted desperately to fit in. I had spent my entire life up until that point made to feel different: been bullied, had stuff yelled at me, beaten up and various segregation type educational experiences (the 'special' class, the 'slow' group) so I had really internalised this 'you're not the same, you're not even close'- but lacking the self confidence I am getting a hold of now my reaction to this was to try and be everything that wasn't me. 

Because the people who weren't me, well, they seemed happy.

They also weren't disabled. So, I tried my best to appear not to be. That drastically failed, but I didn't see that at the time. All I knew was that when I put in a lot of effort with my articulation, when I didn't use my crutches and when I stopped being authentic to myself, and to my experiences- I felt better. Self esteem wise. 

I could convince myself I was like them, the abled masses.

Stigma is a disgrace, and society treats disability like it is a disgrace. As a teenager I was aware of this, but not in a cohesive way. For me, it became /I/ was the disgrace.

Now, I guess I know that society is. 

TL:DR - Yes, there is a stigma. I internalised it as a teen, but now being a young adult I'm starting to unpick this and accept myself.

I don't know if other cruise companies have similar layouts or not, so worst case if you have any doubts you could always contact the company to ask.

While on the ship things went pretty well, a lot of the doors were automatic so they'd open on their own, and there weren't very many steps that I noticed outside of the obvious staircases if you didn't want to wait for the elevators. Some doors had slightly higher thresholds which made getting the wheelchair over the bump a little tricky at first. I have trouble with steps as well, but the few times I walked around a few steps I didn't have any problems. I was able to get to pretty much any of the things I wanted to get to, with the exception of their little jogging track and mini golf because it was up a few stairs. Everything else was perfectly accessible.

Off the ship might be a different story, though. Depending on where the cruise stops, it may or may not be very easy. They had a ramp to get off of the ship onto the port of wherever you dock, but sometimes the initial step from the ship to the ramp could be a little rocky.

2) on ramps. A general rule of thumb to ramp design is the ADA requirements of a 12:1 width:height ratio. As a  wheelchair user of both manual and power types, I've found this to be more practical than merely bureaucratic. It's shocking how much length a ramp needs to be safe. Even with power chair. It's not just a matter of strength to get up it--it's often more a matter of it not being so steep you can slip going down it.  12:1 is really necessary in most cases. 

That ratio means that there's a big difference between ramping one step versus even 2 steps. Ramps get long quick! And often this effect is reflected in local building code requirements as well. For a single step ramp, things are easy. But for multi step ramps you might be required to add bells and whistles, such as anti-slip, guard rails...they can get pricey. 

At bare minimum, make sure there's enough space for a 12:1 ramp, and make sure it won't block any pedestrian walkway (pretty much the only reason apartment could deny you building it).

3) rental listing accuracy. I've found this to be so so. The accessible marked ones basically just mean access with no steps, which hey good start. Sometimes complexes will just checkmark that though even if all ground floor ones are taken. By far the biggest error in using that option is that there are many, many perfectly good options *not* listed as accessible. So you're missing out more than being misled.

This is sort of a shitty answer, but it sounds like you need one of two things: either substantial chair maintenance (possibly including new batteries), or a new chair. Maintenance should be covered by your insurance, and insurance will buy you a new powerchair every ~5 years. It's stuff you need to keep up with, even if you're only on Medicare.

I know that this might as well be $5MM for most of us (myself included), but my point is that you might be able to get help to get a new chair if you can't do it through insurance. Some of the cheaper chairs (front drive, or more ""scooter-like"" chairs) are around $1K. It's just about money.

Alternatively, you can buy batteries yourself, but they're several hundred dollars.

Aside from that, sadly there isn't much. Paratransit, non-emergency ambulances, etc. are painfully expensive. You'd be lucky if there are any Uber or Lyft in your area that have a wheelchair ramp or lift. Maybe call all your taxi companies and ask if any of them can transport you with enough notice (it takes like two days here for them to get one of the limited accessible vans).

If none of that works, you'd have to go to your city or county. They will have a paratransit option available if there are any options (a bus in your city = paratransit van available). It's frustrating in that you often have to schedule them well in advance, and they often take forever to get where you're headed because they try to pick up other people at the same time. But you need to have an option there if you need to get to a doctor. 

The last thing I would say is don't cross your emergency services. If they've told you not to call again, I would not call again unless it's an emergency and you only option. They can and will send you a bill for their services if they get frustrated enough with you, and that's the last thing you need. 

I hope you can come up with a solution. It's an awful situation, and without insurance and willing doctors it can be near impossible to sort out. ",,,,anotherjunkie,EDS + Dysautonomia,,1496934724,t5_2qhe8,t3_6g0tbx,t3_6g0tbx,5,1499172607,0,0,dimo9th,disability,,,,,

She has a couple of hundred in the bank. Should she leave her bank account as is and have us make note of it within her SSI (under SOAR) filing? If I have learned things correctly from y'all, the answer would be yes. We basically want her to leave the money be (in the bank, I have now learned) for her eventual utility bill hook up charges and whatnot for when she transitions from the shelter.

My advice is to answer those detailed questions first, then go back and answer the broad ones. We want to know about your day to day functioning and how it relates to your ability to work. Keep that in mind THE WHOLE TIME. Think about work activities (concentrating, finishing tasks, relating with others, making it through the day without crying or walking off the job), that is what we want to know.

Also, if you write a ton of stuff, we won't read most of it (I read about 15 questionnaires a day, and we do have deadlines) and please don't write in cursive.

829,"My first question is that you say that your coworkers already have flexible schedules and can work from home as needed, why is that option not available to you? Are they ""higher up"" and so have more perks?

I don't necessarily think that any of your accommodations are unreasonable, depending on what you mean by 'decreased workload.' Having slightly less work is one thing, but having to have a significant portion of your work shifted to other people may not go over well. Unfortunately, accommodations for mental disorders is more difficult to deal with than physical (its more ""subjective""). 

Unsolicited advice? If your work environment is so bad that it is making you suicidal you need to find a new job. As an attorney you have a lot more options than most people. Having your own office or getting to work from home 1 day per week isn't going to solve your problems. And in that kind of field, getting accommodations for mental illness you will get treated differently and it will severely hamper your career with that company.
