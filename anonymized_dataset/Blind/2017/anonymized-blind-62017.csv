My father is also disabled and is unable to stand for long periods of time which add to his weight and over all mentality.  My hope is to find something that he can experience and hope that it triggers a new desire or want to engage.

There is almost no utility or need in your project, please don't waist your time on it. The following comment is not meant to beat anyone up, it's just my thoughts about a general phenomenon that is way to, common. It seems that bright developers assume they can decide what the blind community needs without ever consulting blind people. This results in a waist of time and effort, and it is also a little insulting. I think most of us would criticize outsiders who descended upon a village and started ""helping"" the locals without ever asking them what they needed. 

Once again, my frustration is not meant to be directed at any individual or group. My wife, who works in A T, recently helped judge a competition between dozens of college students who were creating technology to help blind people. Nearly every single offering came from a sighted persons idea of what blind people need. My wife tried to vote for the single project that she did not find totally pointless. However, most of the other judges were sighted, and they voted accordingly.

My recommendation would be for you to go back to the drawing board and ask blind people what we need. You could create a survey, and the members of this community, and many other blind people, will be happy to fill it out.

One final thought, if you find a useful project there is a good chance it will not sound super exciting or important to sighted people. Most of the things we need are not going to change the world, but they can help make ours better. ",,,2,0,0,

Over the years, the have been a number of attempts to using different sensing technology (ultrasound and laser being the common ones), but so far none have been sensitive enough and reliable enough to detect drop-offs. That is one of the reasons why most of those technologies end up being integrated into a cane itself (so the cane can still safely check for that). 

That being said, I'm sure there is a high potential for using a glove as a supplement for information. 

Depending on where you live, you should talk with your local agency and talk to an O&amp;M instructor or ILS instructor to see what technology is already available, and what hasn't worked (and why). Also, they may know some people who are interested in assisting with your project. I've assisted with a few high school projects similiar to this myself. ",,,6,0,0,

Not helpful, but what a terrible attitude.

My local theater doesn't have audio description either. I don't go there often enough to feel justified in asking them to provide it, but there are only two theaters in town and they tend to work together to each provide different movies, so it sucks when the non-descriptive one gets a popular movie and I just can never watch it in my city.

And I agree that my site has no significant value at the moment, which is why membership is free (and might remain so.)  I only launched it a few weeks ago.  But I intend to separate my site from the other free options in two key ways.  The first is to deliver content that isn't available on them, through exclusive deals with authors who are looking to gain exposure but can't afford the costs of modern narration services.  

The second is to deliver adult content.  While that is available on audible and to a tiny degree on others, the selection is abysmal.  Once I've produced about 100 books, scaling it to 100,000 will be trivial as the amount of training is reduced with every book.  I'm already down from a couple hours to about 30 minutes of modeling to produce lengthy novels.  In another 20 books I expect it will take only 5 minutes or less.  And at some point the production will be reliable enough that I can just publish wantonly, and full length books press in under 10 minutes.  I also wouldn't think of charging anything close to $200/yr.

c4f82a04-745f-4b72-b4ac-42a7c56532cb,1496374841,"Straight up, I live in Australia, so I can't provide US-specific advice. But hopefully my experience of buying might give you some idea how I went about it.

To give you a picture of my city, I live in [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide), South Australia. I have been here all my life. Adelaide is the smallest capital of the mainland states, and is also the most affordable. It consists of a ~2km square CBD, surrounded by a band of parkland about ~1km deep, then suburbs. The city sprawls north-south being flanked by ocean to the west and hills to the east. The thing about Adelaide is that while it is of modest size (~1.3m people), population density is low compared to what you'd be used to (Australian cities are all sprawling suburbs of detatched and semi-detached houses around small CBDs).

I've always considered rent money, dead money. My intention was to live with my parents (who are 1-1.5 hours outside the CBD by bus) till I got into the workforce. I saved up a deposit over the course of university from my pension, four years of part time work, and 10 months of PhD scholarship (I quit). I started working in 2013 and immediately started looking. 

I knew I wanted to be no more than 30 minutes by public transport from the city and I wanted shops (supermarket) within a 10 minute walk. I also wanted three bedrooms (space for hobbies and a place for my mates to crash). Checking public transport routes told me which suburbs to look in and adjacent to. I also narrowed down to specific streets I preferred over others (e.g. not main roads, closer to bus stop etc). The location of shops was something that was really considered after looking at the property (if something is within 30 minutes walk, I don't mind walking the distance. I'll even walk further on occasion). 

I very quickly found the property I would end up buying. It was the size I wanted, with access to different public transport routes (maximum 20 minutes into the city), shops (including a bottleo - i.e. liquor store - which is obviously the most important thing) all within 10 minutes walk, and it was a new build in a decent area (basically an area undergoing change. Old stuff gets knocked down, 2-3 are built on the subdivided block). 

I've gone in hard on paying off my mortgage. The property is very rentable, so once my mortgage is done I can easily purchase somewhere else - say if I met a girl, want to start a family, get a family home etc or even move interstate - and have an asset with a guaranteed income stream. 

So in terms of general advice:

* Know what you want (size, distance, location), have some level of flexibility, but don't comprise to the point you make your desires irrelevant (otherwise you'll buy something you don't want)

* Newer is better. The older the property, the more problems you're going to inherit (and that's more cost to you). If you can, nothing older than a decade or two. 

* Make sure you inspect it properly. Get someone to help if necessary. You should always have a full building inspection and report compiled before purchase (in South Australia this is done as part of the finalisation of the contract, so you can raise issue or back out if there are big problems).

* Know your price limit. I don't know how loans and the banking system in the US works (I understand there is a preference for fixed interest rates? That's insanity to an Australian), but make sure you've enough of a deposit to avoid loan insurance (if you don't know what that is, I can explain) and variable over fixed loans all day, every day.

* Know what you're getting into. If the property isn't Torrens Title (detached house, you own property and land), make sure you check the body corporates by laws and costs etc. Don't get into something that is going to screw you over.

* Also know local laws (i.e. council regulations) and rates. I don't know what the US is like, but they can vary vastly from council to council here, and some you just want to steer clear of (I can explain more if you're interested).

* Finally, when you do buy, PAY IT OFF ASAP. Seriously. Banks and financial advisors will tell you otherwise, but a loan is an expense. Get rid of the expense, you've got access to credit *and* better income, not just access to credit.

On potentially moving cities, the advantages of staying in the city you know are that you know the city, so you know how things work, where to get things etc. The people might also know you and help you out. For me, my parents live 15 minutes drive away (but 30-45 minutes by public transport), and I often ask my mum to take me shopping (e.g. for clothes or hardware, or if it's pouring with rain and I don't want to get wet going to the supermarket). It's also going to help you choose your suburb better (i.e. you know which ones to avoid so you don't get stabbed). 

On the other hand, if you're living in an expensive city, a more affordable city is going to give you a much better quality of life. For example, Adelaide's job market right now is the toughest in the country (I'm sweet, I'm a public servant with a job for life), but if you do have work here, your income goes further, you don't have to commute as much, and there is easy access to the beach, wine regions, etc. It also depends on what you do for a living (or what your partner if you have one does) and how easy it is for you to find something and make that move. 

And this comment got really long. Hope some of it is useful and if you have any further questions, just ask.

If you're getting to the point where you're seriously thinking about learning blindness skills such as screen reader use, home skills, job skills, cane travel, etc have you considered going to a training program? Many programs work with students who are not legally blind when there is a diagnosis that is likely to result in legal blindness.

She has explained she reads by focusing on the letter next to the one she wants to read, to be able to make out that other letter.)

The other eye went bad later.. I want to say a year or so (dont quote me on that), but then she had all the appropriate doctor contacts to get fast treatment and was able to preserve vision. That's why she's 'only' legally blind.

They can read out the next step, set timers, convert units, etc. Before my Google Home, I had to constantly touch my phone or computer to get that information, and risk getting them wet or dirty because they had to be close to the kitchen.

As for phones, I agree with you that Apple IPhones are generally better; that's what I have and use daily.  However, based on what Apple has said and the demo I heard during the keynote, I'm almost certain the HomePod is going to be a giant flop.  The only feature demoed was music.  I doubt it will have any way for developers to write apps for it. If it did, surely Apple would be showing it off at the World Wide *DEVELOPER* conference.  Also, it's called the HomePod, like iPod. Meaning the only use Apple sees for it is music.  I'd be shocked if it even has facetime support; it has no camera, and Apple pushes the video portion of facetime way harder than they push facetime audio.  

I want to be wrong; I really, really do.  I love Apple products, and I'd love a HomePod. But for $349 USD, I'm going to need a lot more convincing that it's worthwhile, and Apple doesn't really seem interested in doing that convincing. Heck, it's the same price as the cheapest Apple watch!  That's...that's crazy, when you compare it with the competition.  To justify that price, it would need to do more than they do, not less.  My prediction is that the HomePod will be like the first generation of the Apple TV: expensive, and it won't make any impact in the market.  In five years, apple will come out with an entirely new smart speaker, that will support apps, and just like the current Apple TV is today, it'll be better than anything else available.  But for now, the HomePod is going to be a massive dud.  ",,,3,0,0,

I learned braille in a training center, and we did use books that introduced new letters and symbols, than we would read simple children's books, and than we moved on to normal books. We also used Perkins braille machines, and a slate and Stylus to write the braille ourselves, in order to drill the symbols into our head. Your friend might want to see if there are any local services for the blind they can use; they might be qualified to receive training from the state for free.

As far as poor tactile sensitivity goes, I have known people with similar issues learn braille, but it does make things harder. I would recommend looking for something called a braille block for your friend to use to learn the symbols. Braille blocks are blocks of wood with holes and pegs which can be used to represent large versions of braille symbols. If you can't find something like a braille block that you could always use a milk carton and golf balls, just cut the carton in half so it only has six cups.

After a rollercoaster experience, we finally found a place that was A) affordable B) accessible/walkable for me C) close to Toronto for my husband to get to work (meaning, his commute will be under 1.5 hours each way haha). Something interesting I found was that lower income areas in various cities were sometimes the most accessible in terms of proximity to the highway/downtown area/major bus lines. So, while we started our search in the hopes of finding a fixer-upper in a “desirable” location, we ended up purchasing a home that had recently been flipped in a not-so-great neighbourhood. Of course, we did our research on things like perceived safeness and whatnot. Talking to local shopkeepers and anybody you know that lives close by is helpful in this regard.  Sometimes a city or neighbourhood’s reputation is more reflective of its past than its present. With that said, we were eager to get into the market and we kind of have our fingers crossed that we made a good investment. Guess we’ll find out in a few years when we go to sell!

I’m not sure if this is helpful in anyway, but just an observation I made through my own experience. I’m interested to read about the housing market in different cities throughout the U.S.!

You can't use them, so they might as well not exist for you. Just use keyboards you can use, which exist, and which, I'm sure, are fine. Or buy a drum.

I'm glad (in the context of this conversation, obviously) to hear that you've only been blind for three years. As time goes on, you start to forget what you're missing out on. I haven't read a book for so long, for example, that I've stopped thinking of books as things that can be read. Obviously, intellectually, I know that they're for reading, but my former feelings about them, and the impulse to pick one up and read, are gone. This sounds sad, but it's actually great. Seeing books around and not being able to read them used to make me sad, but I just don't have those associations anymore. 

Your comment hit home for me because I'm also a programmer, and I also like music. There's no reason for you not to program, and there's even less reason for you not to play music. There are probably other reasons you feel the way you feel--maybe you feel abandoned by people who valued you more when you had sight, or you have embarrassment or bad associations with being blind and doing things the blind way. You haven't been blind that long, and your feelings will change over time. But I ask you to be open to the idea that your thoughts on your own situation will change, that your capabilities will expand, and that you'll recapture some of the enjoyment you felt before. Try to do a little forgetting--forget how you used to code or play, embrace the shittiness of your new workflows and try to enjoy being the crappy coder and musician you currently are.

4108bbf6-4500-447e-b31a-227838a9e5ca,1498761751,"This is a great idea and I love the implementation. There are a few potential issues I see with braille legibility. 1) The font is not monospaced.  While the visual aesthetics are appealing, the irregular cell spacing would likely prove frustrating for anyone using the braille exclusively.  2) A couple of the letters (g and y) have an offset placement of dots 1 and 4 in the braille cells.  Again, the visual effect is pleasant, but the end result for a braille reader would be frustrating. 3) A sighted designer without knowledge of braille conventions might be tempted to use varying sizes of the font for visual effect.  Anything significantly outside of the standard size and spacing (i.e. a large headline or superscript) would become unreadable.  You might consider letting some sighted typesetters design a few pieces that could be tested by braille readers to make sure that the end result is both visually appealing and truly legible to all readers.

That having been said, I am really impressed with what you've done.  I've never seen anything that effectively bridges the gap between braille and print, much less as elegantly as you have managed to do it.  Kudos!",,,3,0,0,

As far as ways your dad can keep busy, it’s hard to give great recommendations without knowing his interests and background. First of all, is there any reason that work can’t be on the table? I assume, from your description, that your dad is not working right now. Did he work in the past, if so what did he do? He might be surprised about how many jobs you can do without sight. If he was a racecar driver, or did something else that requires eyeballs, and then has, he thought about looking into a new line of work. Of course, your dad would probably have a lot of things to learn if he is going to work as a blind person, and he might have trouble getting hired, but my point is without knowing more about his situation I can’t rule out work. Having a job is a great way to stay busy and have a purpose in life.

If your dad is interested in going back to work, or if he is simply interested in having the best options for filling his time, he needs to learn how to use a screen reader. As Amonwilde   mentioned, many new blind people find ios to be easy to learn; your dad could buy an iPod touch or ipad. If there is a windows computer in his house, you can download the free NVDA screen reader and your dad will have all the tools he needs to independently use a computer. Learning a program such as NVDA will also be very useful if your dad was to look for work.

A screen reader, such as NVDA, is very powerful, but also pretty complex and there can be a learning curve for new users. Unless your dad is proactive and good with computers he will probably need some help learning a desktop screen reader. He should look into what state services he qualifies for. A vocational rehabilitation counselor will sometimes pay for technology and training. When I lost my sight at 18, also due to glaucoma, the state paid for me to attend two different training centers and this training changed my life. I will say though, that I was more fortunate than many to receive so much training. I believe your dad might greatly benefit from spending time at a training center where he can meet other blind people, but he might also be able to receive training from home.

This is a random aside, but I would be interested in teaching your dad how to use a screen reader remotely, over Skype etc. I work in accessibility focused, technical support for a university, and I believe I would be more then capable of helping your dad learn how to use a computer, or ios device, as long as he is a willing student. Of course, I have a day job and a pretty busy schedule, so we would need to talk about compensation, but I would offer an affordable rate. You can PM me if you’re interested.

I’m sorry if my offer seems random or shady, I think you should definitely first look into what services the state would offer your dad for free. Now, to your actual question.

There are many hobbies your dad could get into as a blind person, and, once again, it’s hard to give great suggestions without knowing his interests. There are several online multi player game sites that are designed for blind people; he could look into these, although knowing how to use a computer would greatly help. Two free options are http://www.qcsalon.net/en/ and http://rsgames.org/. My favorite online gaming community is Blind Adrenaline, http://blindadrenaline.com/. This site has a great community with tournaments on every single day of the week. I play Texas Holdem Poker on the site and a lot of us take the game very seriously. Also, the apps for the service are very good and easy to use. There is a small cost you have to pay every six months to play on Blind Adrenaline, but I think its well worth it, especially if your dad is interested in any of their games.

Does your dad have any pets? I think a pet is a great way to keep from feeling lonely throughout the day; I work from home and my cat makes all of the difference.

Perhaps your dad could take up gardening. That would take some physical effort, but that might be good for him. He might also look into getting an exercise bike if that is not too bad for his back.

Does your dad have any musical interests; perhaps he could learn an instrument. Youtube is a great source for free lessons for everything, even if you can’t see the screen, and he might be able to find a local teacher too.

You can buy accessible board and card games for the family to play together. This won’t help when your dad’s all alone, but it is a fun thing to do; to play most card games your dad would need to learn a little braille.

You can check meetup.com for all kinds of gatherings in your father’s area; for example, my wife and I went to our monthly book club last night, and I have been looking into a local meditation center.

If your dad likes movies, but he can’t see the screen, you can download thousands of audio described movies for free at this site, https://www.blindmicemegamall.com/bmm/shop/Directory_Departments?storeid=82333; you have a create a free account, but then you can download as many movies as you want for free. One note about this site, the movies you are downloading have no video, your just getting the audio of the movie and the audio description, so this is not a great source for movies the whole family can watch together. Netflix is getting more and more described movies, and all of their original products have audio description, all you have to do is turn it on in the audio and language options, after you start a movie. Also you can use the Disney On the Go app to get audio description with any of their new movies, even in the theater.

Does your dad cook? I love cooking and that could be a very rewarding hobby that would help the whole family; also does your dad help do the cleaning etc. around the house. I know it can be hard to be motivated to do such things if he is experiencing depression, but it’s going to be hard for him to not feel depressed if he doesn’t find worthwhile ways to spend his day.

There are countless more hobbies of course, probably more than your dad would imagine. At one of the training centers I attended, we personally designed and crafted furniture and other projects in a wood shop. As totally blind people, we independently operated table saws, band saws, radial arm saws, drills, sanders, and many other power tools. The training center didn’t have us do this because it was important for us to gain wood shop skills, the idea was to show blind people that we can do things that sighted people would never think we are capable of doing. I’m not suggesting that your dad should go work in a wood shop, especially, without proper training; my point is that there really are an amazing amount of possibilities out there for blind people.

Feel free to ask me any more questions about anything at all. It’s understandable for your dad to feel depressed about such a major adjustment in his life. However, there is no reason that he can’t get over his sadness and live to his full potential.

Good luck,

For audio described movies you might look into this site, https://www.blindmicemegamall.com/bmm/shop/Home. If you create a free account you can download as many movies as you want from their free collection which has thousand of offerings. This site would probably not be practical for your grandad to use on an ios device, however, you or another family member could set up a Drop Box account, sink it with the app on his device, and then download movies for him that he can access through the app. The movie files on the site are large, but they are just audio, no video, so they are not super large.

If your Grandfather does learn how to use an ios device he can do so much more then just watch movies. He could keep up with his family on Facebook, look up things he is interested in online, and even play games. ",,,2,0,0,

I'm much more anti-Apple, because so many things can do the same job or better at a fraction of the price.  This is another one of their ""innovative"" products that is about 2 years behind similar technology and 5 times the price.

Pricing may be a little different, but I'd suggest trying out an Echo Dot- $50 US is a small investment to see if the technology is useful.  If it turns out that it's a good idea and you need something specific to the Apple device, you can invest in that and not go in completely blind.",,,2,0,0,

It's an app that uses your smartphones microphone to pick up where the movie is at, then play an audio description track to the user. I'm not sure how widespread audio description is in other parts of the world, but Australia is very behind. So I can see it being very good for people going to the movies here. It also eases the burden on cinemas and transfers the use of audio description to the individual. I consider that a positive because it reduces the complexities of operating a cinema (i.e. encourages business activity) and empowers the individual.",,,2,0,0,
6e2571d7-7e7c-4458-8ac7-e3eb28d7ef90,1497859182,"DRM, hands down. I understand why it exists, but it is a *huge* barrier to accessibility. Most epubs are 100% readable provided there isn't any weird formatting. Until recently, we couldn't even use our own screen-readers to read kindle books on Windows and Mac, which meant not having access to the text directly and thus, not being able to spell out words or see specific formatting or punctuation. This is now somewhat possible in the modern Kindle app, but only for specific books. Amazon takes baby steps toward full accessibility, so if you needed another reason not to use them exclusively, there it is. The good news is that it's getting better, and the Kindle app seems usable on iOS. People with slightly-more-than-basic computer skills can also use one of a few different options for stripping DRM from common book formats. Other than that, images with text in them are a bit of a pain since they have to be run through OCR. PDFs can often be formatted badly, especially if they have a duol-page layout. The good news is that you don't really even need to use text-to-speech to read a book and test it for accessibility. Just find a text converter, paste it into a plain-text editor like notepad, and make sure everything looks good and stays in the right order. If you can read it that way, we can read it. I specifically mention notepad because apps such as Microsoft Word support images, and notepad doesn't, so will completely strip out any text in them, which mimics what we hear.

This makes it sound like the situation is pretty terrible, but it isn't. I feel like I have fairly equal access to books, even if I have to look harder for them or do a few seconds of extra work to make them readable. It's 2017, and I no longer need to get frustrated because I can't find a book that my sighted friends are reading. ",,,2,0,0,

I run my own business these days, and have done freelance wordpress/drupal administration, and PHP programming.  So I suspect I have the prerequisite skills needed to develop for Alexa.

eaa0af7b-30f0-428b-928d-af4a5d3d24b9,1497358183,"I was a teacher in China for 3 years. Kids like games. The game can be simple and silly, just as long as they can keep score and there are teams. Watch the kids too. Some of the best games I came up with were inspired by the games they were playing during breaks. 

Role playing conversations and giving points to teams for better acting is a great game, but one you have to work up to. The kids have to trust you and each other enough to put themselves out there like that. Also kids need practice time to make their skit. Most of the time would be set aside for practice, which is great cause you are really capitalizing on student talk time when every student is talking.

Other simpler games can be variations on card games or mine sweeper or battleship. You have your target language set and to make a move, or try for points for their team, the students just have to use the target language. Make certain each student on the team participates before moving on. 

Use games as a reward. Start class by introducing what they need to know, give them time to practice in pairs or small groups. As a whole class check for understanding or clarify mistakes you heard (but never call anyone out for mistakes ever!). Then, play the game. 

Also realia is good for kids. Even older kids like it. Realia is just stuff you bring in from the real world. Realia is great for teaching vocabulary and propositions.

Good luck! If you have any other questions, just ask. I love China and teaching in China. I miss it. If you are there for a while I recommend applying for the Chinese government scholarship to learn Chinese. They pay you to do it, you can usually still teach evenings and weekends, and it is the only way to become literate.

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1497368533,"I think an interactive NVDA tutorial for beginners would be a great project. NVDA is a powerful, open source, free screen reader that many blind people, such as myself, use every day. A screen reader is the primary program that most blind people use to access a computer; NVDA is the second most popular screen reader for Windows, and it is growing in popularity. The fact that NVDA's biggest competitor cost almost one thousand dollars is one of many reasons for NVDA's popularity, and it makes the program an especially attractive option for people who have recently lost their sight. 

However, it can be very difficult for newly blind people to learn a program such as NVDA. This is why I believe an interactive tutorial for NVDA would be a very useful and powerful project for you to consider.

I'm pretty sure that it would be a reasonably manageable project; as I mentioned NVDA is open source, and people write extensions for it all of the time. Plus the founders are really cool and responsive, they might be able to give you feedback about the idea, and if you made something really cool, maybe they would add it to the official release version.

One possible idea I have for this kind of project would be an interactive tutorial  similar to what Apple has for it's mac OS screen reader, VoiceOver. This tutorial walks you through all of the basic concepts and methods you need to use the program. If you want to check out this tutorial you can pull it up on any mac by either hitting command,  f5, or triple tapping the finger print reader while holding down command, on touch bar macs.  

For my wife's job she recommends technology for blind students; she is always pushing for NVDA, but teacher's always say that the competing program that cost one thousand dollars has better training materials, so they would rather have the state buy that option. A well done,  user friendly, tutorial could be a major factor in allowing more people to go for NVDA, which would save the state, and individuals, countless amounts of money. Also, NVDA has become a life changer for thousands of people in third world countries, who would never be able to afford access to computers without this powerful screen reader.

Re: sunglasses. If it's someone I will probably interact with a lot I usually say I'm extremely light sensitive and they let it go. If the person is being rude I just deadpan ""I'm blind"" and they get super self conscious and leave me alone. I like mirrored glasses since I can close my eyes and people don't think I'm being rude or am bored with what they are saying. Hopefully your friends will get used to your wearing glasses, honestly it shouldn't be that big of a deal. It will be weird at first, but if it helps and makes you feel less pain/more comfortable I say go for it! I'm so used to wearing my sunglasses all the time that now I forget I have them on. 


Re: people and blindness. A lot of people are super uncomfortable learning someone is blind or going blind. It's not something people think about a lot and our prescence sometimes makes people confront fears they didn't know they had. Plus, it's entirely too easy to only think about the problems that come with losing your vision, and if they don't know about assistive technology they are probably imaging the worse life/future they can think of. But, the good news is that their fears do not need to shape your life! There is so much tech out there that helps, plus canes and guide dogs help with mobility. If you don't use a cane, don't be afraid to get training while you still have some vision. Blindness isn't all or nothing. 


Re: depression. Are you getting any therapy? It can make a huge difference to talk to someone, especially if they are familiar with vision loss and can provide you with examples of both people who are successful and ways to work around the new challenges. The biggest thing I've learned is that we need to adapt. It might look weird to someone who doesn't know why I'm holding my phone to my nose, but I am able to see it sometimes if I do and that's what matters in the long run.

So probably 6 months before she got her first laser treatment, and yes, it was the wet kind, and the laser burned the retina to stop the bleeding. She was blind in that eye (centrally) from that day on.  (It was all centrally located, and the outside of the eye kinda sorta stays usable. It prevents you from being able to focus properly.)

&gt; The other eye went bad later.. I want to say a year or so (dont quote me on that), but then she had all the appropriate doctor contacts to get fast treatment and was able to preserve vision. That's why she's 'only' legally blind.

&gt; Keep in mind, she's a senior citizen now, so this was many years ago - they didn't KNOW about macular degeneration.  Once they figured it out, she actually got studied by doctors, because she was otherwise young and healthy, so they could rule out other issues.

&gt;

8fd01324-2dfd-45de-9783-79bca3340315,1497052905,"Hello.

I tried OrCam when I went to sight village in London. 

Honestly it's not worth the price.

I got to walk outside with it. When I asked how a blind person is ment to know where signs are and all that, the answer was, wel i'm not actually completely sure I got an answer if i'm being honest. I do know they showed me that I can point at signs and have OrCam read them to me but there's a couple of problems with the system: 1. There is no way, what so ever to read word by word letter by letter and paragraph by paragraph.

2. There is no way to save the information. When I pointed that out to the demo guy, he told me that I was ""very smart with tech,"" (in other words, ""Oh crap, this guy knows what he's talking about..."") Then tried to tell me that it would help those blind people who are older and not as good at using tech as I am. I'm sorry but no, no it won't.

3. When reading websites outloud the machine forgets that there's a dot in w w w dot. For example; w w w dot google dot com would be read as, w w w, google, com. As you can tell this is not very useful at all. What was The persons answer to that? Well you know there's a dot there don't you? I do, but without any way to save onto the machine I would have to rely on my memory which is quite bad at the best of times.

I honestly do not see this as a useful piece of equipment what so ever. The IPhone can do this, and all the aps I have on my phone apart from KNFB reader are free.

I will admit that Orcams system is faster than KNFB reader or Tap tap see, but that in no way means i'd spend that amount of money on it.

I'd like to know how the people who came up with OrCam thought the blind person would 1. know where the signs are on their streat or where ever it is they are walking and 2. point at them in such a way that they would get great reading and not the wall or something like that instead. This system in my oppinion should be taken off the market as there are free apps for IPhone and Android.

I would not want a college to spend their money on this and if they offered it to me I'd not take it.",,,1,0,0,

The idea that braille and technology are at opposite ends and that braille has been ""made obsolete"" is an unfortunate myth.

My main worry, though, is that I don't think most people are watching the episodes that closely.  So the way the BBC has decided to represent blindness, for what you argue (and I think I agree) are totally valid plot reasons, will never-the-less do a lot of damage to the way the casual Dr Who viewer thinks about blindness.  Is avoiding that damage worth harming the overall plot of the show? Well, I don't know.  I could be convinced either way, really.  

Still, your post was a good read!  I find that for whatever reason, I can't analyse TV shows like that. I can with books and music, just not with TV. So when I'm listening to TV, I always seem to miss the deeper plot implications.  It's probably just because we didn't even have a TV in the house regularly when I was growing up, so I only really started listening to TV in my 20's.

I can confirm that signing up is no problem for a screen reader user or a VI user as all you must do is put your email address in the box, tick the checkbox and click on the sign up button, I think it was called.

I signed up and listened to a bit of Alice in wonderland. I honestly cannot hear a difference between if I read it using the hazel voice and gutenberg, for example, and your TTS engin.

From my limited understanding you want to make the voice self correct, is that right? So if it comes across a word that it says wrong it can go into a databass of sorts and correct it the next time? If that is the case, I'm sorry to tell you that all screen readers have this function already in the form of a dictionary. You add words  to the dictionary like this:

1. Add the word.

2. Tab to the box that will be labeled something like replacement.

3. Type in that replacement. For example, the word might be Foyer and instead of that I would want it to be pronounced foiyay.

4. Tab to the okay button and you're done. When ever the screen reader comes across that word it will say it how you sounded it out in the dictionary instead of the way it was said originally.


I have come across a spelling mistake on your webpage.

On the Library page within the adult section, there is this sentence; Keilly discovers and unusual plant with euphoric secretions. It should be Keilly discovers an unusual plant with euphoric secretions.

In terms of dealing with the loss gradually, it depends on many factors. The condition may progress very slowly so you don't notice the loss until one day, you can't do certain tasks (this happens often with visual field issues). How well does your family support you? Are they discouraging you from seeking assistance now, or do they help you? Another thing is, do they help you *TOO* much? I've had teens who can't tie their shoelaces because someone else always did them. 

You should talk to your doctor regarding a rough time frame (difficult for this kind of disease, but better than nothing) and to your family about any goals you want to accomplish before total loss of vision. One of my clients was a museum curator, and she made a list of the great museums and works of art she wanted to see before losing most of her vision. Depending on your own individual goal and financial resources, you would have to decide what you want to do. Keep in mind, though, that vision loss itself doesn't always preclude you from accomplishing a goal later. I had a client who wanted to run an ultramarathon on every continent, and he ended up doing that after he lost his vision (And yes, that includes Antartica. He was a dedicated guy). 

You may also want to consider learning skills such as O&amp;M and other daily living things while you have some vision. Having vision makes it easier to pick up some concepts, and then you can practice with blindfolds/occluders. That would also include using adaptive technologies as well, although depending on where you live, you may not be eligible for government coverage yet. 

In terms of available jobs, there is a wide range, although getting the education, experience and certification can be difficult. I've met blind lawyers, computer technicians, martial arts instructors, CPR instructors, teachers, musicians, chefs, receptionists, and teachers. I've met two active police officers (one that works in a warehouse and another that does translation work) and one guy who served in the military while blind (he was a special case, though. He spoke 8 languages and worked as a translator in a carrier of some sort). Computer programers, woodworkers and massage therapists. With adaptive technology, a lot more options have become available,

1. Machine learning that can analyze a GUI, pick out the buttons, and present them linearly to a screen reader. Many interfaces aren't accessible to screen readers, some logic that could intelligently parse onscreen elements would be welcome.
2. Consumer-quality laser rangefinder / sonar object detector. This is the kind of thing you can build with an arduino but something properly tested would be useful.
3. Going outside the box here, but an echolocation device that would send a sonar pulse into the nearby environment and return a sonification of that ping could potentially be useful. A few blind individuals have trained themselves to navigate with sound and have expressed an interest in this technology, and perhaps these soundscapes could open up this form of navigation to others.

I'll note that all of these might have commercial applications outside of accessibility. 2 and 3 would be useful in robotics, for example, and GUI detection could be used by developers in automatic testing of applications, to list just one use.",,,2,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1497104238,"&gt; Did you have any problems with comprehension? 

No. But then, I listen to TTS all day, every day, 12 hours a day.  I could have listened to that voice at least four times faster without losing anything.

&gt; ""top pick"" of commercial options?

[Neospeech Voiceware](http://neospeech.com/about), also sometimes sold under the brand ""voicetext"", is by far my number one option.  It's quick, sounds natural, and is easy to listen to.  

Second would be the [Nuance vocalizer](https://www.nuance.com/omni-channel-customer-engagement/voice-and-ivr/text-to-speech/vocalizer.html) stuff.  It's what Apple uses on IOS and mac. It's also quick and natural, though not quite as human sounding as neospeech.  

Then I guess would be the [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html) TTS.  It sounds pretty human. But for whatever reason, it just isn't enjoyable to listen to.  It sounds too stiff, somehow. Like a bad human actor, poorly reading lines.  The voice is good, but the intonation is just off somehow.  

Lastly are all the other natural TTS commercial solutions.  Your voice has all of these guys beat, for sure. But they are an option.  [Cepstral](http://www.cepstral.com) has been around forever, and they're pretty darn cheap.  But they're also state of the art for the year 1999.  [Cereproc](https://www.cereproc.com) are good if you happen to need strange British accents (Irish, Scottish, and a bunch I've never heard of).  Otherwise, don't bother.  [Acapela](http://www.acapela-group.com) are pretty OK voices. They must have a pretty good IOS API, or be cheap, because a lot of developers insist on using them.  They're fine for what they are.  [Innoetics](https://www.innoetics.com/eshop) are overpriced and over marketed. I mean, they're OK. But they're not ""the best voices for windows 10"" like they claim over and over and over again on their website. And they're not worth the money when so many better options exist.  

&gt; compared to (m)any of the open source options I've tried. 

Yes. Yours is better than all of the open source options.  If you made that voice open source, I'd start using it tomorrow.  If you wanted me to pay for it, though, I would be much less interested; I'd rather spend the money on neospeech or vocalizer.  I'm sorry if that sounds blunt. I'm not trying to be offensive, just give you an honest idea of how I think you're doing.

This is why i'd recommend taking down the persons email and then sending them an email with your name, number and any other things that business cards have on them.

One more thing; do you have someone who can check the card for you, if that is the road you choose to go down? I mean it's all well and good having braillle on your cards but if it's wrong in any way, that wouldn't help you or your customers, would it?

I hope this helps.",,,1,0,0,

My card was minimal to begin with so I thought it was best to integrate braille as it addressed most/if not all of the accessibility issues a business card creates. 

The card just has my name and my email and that's it. I went with a raised spot varnish for the dots. I made sure that the size and spacing were to standard for braille, the only variance would be the dot height, which admittedly I am worried about but the samples I researched seemed to be high enough to be within standards; I'm just not sure until I get the cards. I'm hoping they are still legible even if they are shallower than standard.

I also made sure my email was in Grade 1 braille as I read that was important.

My main goal was to be as inclusive as I could with my cards not only to for people who read braille but to heighten awareness for people who do not.",,,1,0,0,
a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1496978635,"I think there can be many answers to your question. Being emotionally supportive for your loved one, as they go through something difficult, is very important; you would probably know better than anyone else how to support your husband emotionally. 

 The psychological part of blindness is going to be difficult for him. However, blindness is not like the unexpected things in your life that you can’t do anything about. If a loved one dies, or if you are diagnosed with some terminal illness, all you can do is try and emotionally cope. Blindness is different, because there are many many things you can to do to cope when you lose your sight.

For example, is your husband’s sight loss effecting his daily life or work, if so is he learning the skills and accommodations he needs to live a normal life?  As blind people, we have to do things differently, and it takes time, effort, guidance, and the right attitude to learn these alternative techniques. You can be supportive, but if he can’t use a computer, get around on his own, read, or work, he is probably going to feel down.  Encouraging him to learn how to do these things should be empowering for him, and actually learning these skills will definitely be empowering for him.

Another factor that might make him sad is the fear of the unknown. Most sighted people know nothing about blindness. It’s understandable that facing the unknown would be scary for your husband. You need to be able to incur edge him, and let him know that he can overcome losing his sight. You can also help him learn about blindness, if it is less of a scary unknown that might help him cope. Do either of you know any blind people; do you know how blind people thrive in their lives?

Something that is going to be hard for him, and might remain hard, is his feeling of losing something. There are going to be some things that he is not going to be able to do; there might be a lot fewer of these things then you think, but he will be losing things. I have been blind for eight years now, and it’s no big deal to me. However, last year I lost hearing in one of my ears, and that has been the most difficult experience of my life. I have lost a lot because of my hearing issue. I had to change jobs, and I find it much harder to get around now. My wife could only do so much for me as I dealt with this. I became very depressed about my hearing, because of all I lost, and all she could really do is simply be there for me.

I am ordering these factors of blindness according to what I have found to be the hardest to deal with, and I have saved the hardest for last. The social/societal aspect of blindness can be very difficult. Your husband might be feeling alone. Of course, he has you, but he might feel as though he is going through his sight loss on his own. Meeting and talking to people who are going through the same thing might be very helpful for him. Also, it is very hard to deal with the ignorance and low expectations that society has towards blindness. For me, this is the hardest part of blindness and it can be a daily struggle. You two are going to have to put a lot of care and thought into making sure he feels supported as an equal. You have to make sure you do not do everything for him, and he needs to make sure you don’t have to do everything for him.

A few final thoughts. Remember that your husband is going to go through down periods, because he is human. Also, remember yourself through all of this. You are going through something too. I think my wife may have had a harder time getting through my hearing loss then I did. Just remember that you really can get through this.

The plan is to start with text to develop the NLP and context awareness components.  This will give the market some time to continue improving speech recognition - which is getting there.  I've run tests with Siri and Google which offer otherwise stellar voice recognition tech, but their error rate is still just too high.  And while I could develop code that corrects for the misinterpretations, I'd have to spend a significant amount of time making that work - it's *way* more complex than pronunciation and structuring of text.

So by focusing on the NLP component first, with a very simple chat window to get me going, by the time I'm finished with a well-rounded chat bot I'll be able to just plug-in an off the shelf component.

And flash cards, too.  One method that was suggested to me as a sighted learner was to use a six-cup muffin tin and tennis balls to learn the dot patterns.  Once you're ready to graduate to simple reading, there are some kids' books that don't use grade 2, and some on Amazon that are large print and grade 1 Braille. :)

Also, many sighted people learn to read Braille visually, and it can be very difficult to overcome the desire to check visually what you're feeling. But it's neither here nor there whether you learn to recognize it with your eyes or fingers. Just personal preference.

For the record, the book I used is now out of date with modern updates to the Braille system, but the title is Braille In Brief, and it contained both print and braille on opposite pages, in matching lines so you could check. It also came with a teacher's guide that had information about posture, and the importance of moving your fingers while reading. The movement helps to differentiate the shapes under your fingers. I can't read Braille without it- something in the movement is required for my fingers to tell which dots are raised.",,,2,0,0,

Some background information.... the system was designed by CRIM, or Computer Research Institute of Montreal. It uses a HTC Vive VR headset, powered by an MSI VR One backpack laptop. You use the Vive controller to move around in the virtual enviroment by pointing to where you want to go and pressing the button, and it teleports you there. They do have another computer where they can monitor where you are (and I assume load different scenarios). 

When you turn your head, your view moves with you. So you can look around to see the traffic, and hear it as well. The graphics themselves were not extremely high resolution, but they were good enough for a basic simulation (storefronts had simulated signs, and the leaves swayed with the wind). The headphones definitely did make it seem like traffic was coming from behind me or in front of me, but I did not have too much time to test it extensively. The scenario they had loaded up had fairly light traffic as well, so I would want to do more testing with more vehicles to see how accurate it is. 

I'm not sure when the Hub fully opens up and the public would have an opportunity to give it a try. If you follow the CNIB Ontario twitter (@CNIB_Ontario) or their Facebook, they would likely post the announcement there .

Theory soon incoming on why these at least make sense...

Would that be like someone saying 'oh, when a blind person uses the computer, they aren't blind any more because they've got a screen reader?' 

Despite the fact that, yes, they're still blind, they just use something to help them and tell them quite a lot of things about thier virtual environment to put them on a level field with other non-blind users. Maybe instead the approach could be 'This person is blind and they use screen readers (/insert futuristic tech/magic here) to interpret the world. These have thier advantages but also some disadvantages.'

For instance as Toph used her earthbending to feel where she was, she preferred to be on the ground where she could feel (so flying would be a disadvantage for her), and sand made everything 'fuzzy' because she's sensing coarse, rough and irritating sand grains.

EDIT: Sorry, one last thing I thought of as well. If you are a cane user, it can be difficult to use a cane and push a stroller. However, if you wear your kid in a harness, make sure you've brushed up on your cane skills as well. I had a parent who had their kid in a harness, and walked into TWO poles before calling for O&amp;M help.  :S

Alexa and Siri are better for sure (in fact Siri just got an update that is impressive), but I still think mine competes well with them compared to (m)any of the open source options I've tried.  So I chose the term ""on par."" The synthetic nature of Alexa also sines through in certain uses, for instance if you ask it to play ""Shake Shake Shake, Shake your booty."" And I suspect that is why they don't use Alexa to report the news.

My system is currently designed to operate in conjunction with and without commercial engine options.  I'm still evaluating which engine to work with next, perhaps you could suggest your ""top pick"" of commercial options?

Audio generation from my system is very fast, full length books are generated in just a few minutes.  And I've implemented a lot of NLP algorithms to correct for proper pronunciation of heteronyms, poorly written or formatted corpora, and for speaking words it has yet to be trained on.  Most commercial options require separate modules to speak foreign words for instance, while mine does not.  

As to the future, I'm definitely keeping my eye on tech like WaveNet.  And while I won't be able to compete with that using my current strategy, that's why I designed my system the way I did.  This will allow me to focus on building a more robust AI/NLP component in the meantime, which I'll be releasing in the form of a chat bot hopefully by the year's end.

Did you have any problems with comprehension?  My main goal with this phase of the project was to produce something that could easily be understood, and easily modified for new content.  But I've been listening to this voice for months on end.  And I know that I can understand what my toddler says when other adults cannot just from repetitive familiarity.  So it's hard for me to tell.

The public transit is generally accessible, but there are some occassional areas where the transit is frustatingly slow. All buses and subways are suppose to announce stops, but they also occassionally break down (So far, I've encounted only one bus this year with stop announcements broken, and I average 3-4 hours on the transit every day). 

Toronto is also installing Accessible Pedestrian Signals at all lighted intersections, but it is slow going. They've also started to install Detectable Warning Surfaces for street crossings as well, but mainly when they are doing repair/replacement work.

One factor you may have to consider as well is cost of living. In Toronto (and presumably most major cities), living near the subways would cost noticably more than further away. So you have to factor in convenience for cost. For some people, saving a few hundred bucks a month but taking an extra 30 to 45 minutes each way for transit is worth it.

Personally I like NVDA better and use it every day, but the question really isn't which screen reader is better. The thing you need to figure out is which option will be better for what you will be doing.  Thankfully, since NVDA is free and open source you can go ahead and download it to try it out. I would recommend doing that and then see if you run into any use cases where NVDA seems to be falling short. If you do run into something like that, do some research and find out if JAWS can handle the issue better. If it turns out that jaws handles the issue better, you will have to decide if that is worth the price. Because the keystrokes etc. are pretty similar between NVDA and jaws, I don't think you will have any major issues if you start out on NVDA and decide to change to jaws in the future. 

Personally I find that NVDA does 99 percent of what I need it to do, as good or better then jaws. Plus I like NVDA much much much much better on a philosophical level. If jaws works much better for something that is crucial for your job, then it's well worth the cost. However, I believe NVDA is the best option for the vast majority of people out there. I am really glad that we have options, I just know which option works best for me.

Seriously, there's a thread everyday on ""I'm/someone I know is blind, what do I/they do to keep themselves entertained?""

So, in no particular order:

* Video games (audio or mainstream, both are possible)

* Music (listening to or playing)

* Boardgames

* Tabletop RPGs

* Writing

* Plays, movies, TV shows (audio description may be necessary)

* Sport (or just exercise in general)

* Outdoor activities (e.g. hiking and fishing)

* Cooking (even totally blind people can cook)

* Audio books, podcasts, radio (wireless if you want to sound old school)

* Employment (I am assuming you meant free time, but figured I'd add this anyway)

* Volunteer

That's just a few things and you'll note there's a mix of solo and group activities (including things a sighted person might do solo, but a blind person would probably do with at least one other). So you see, the things blind people can do to keep themselves entertained are no different to those that sighted people might do. You just approach acitivites differently.",,,1,0,0,

Talk with your manager and HR department; if you have short or long-term disability coverage, you may want to talk to them as well.  At least in my case, we first explored what options were available under ADA accommodations so that employment continues.

I've had bad vision and one eye since a baby.  Within the past year or so, I've started developing issues with damage from the treatments when I was little, so my vision is deteriorating even more.  Even living a full life with some limitations, it's hard to adapt to the changes, especially when you don't know how far they'll go. 
 Unfortunately, I don't really have any real resources for extra support, other than recommending friends or family that will listen.  May even need or want to talk to a therapist to help deal with the changes and stay aware of how they affect you.

As otherwise mentioned, DVR and training to keep doing your job will be the biggest help.  However, getting on SSDI due to being legally blind usually skips the apply, deny, appeal, rinse, repeat process, so don't be too concerned with the income at the moment.  If things get bad enough where you're on short/long-term disability through your workplace, it will likely be a requirement to apply for SSDI anyway, since they would much rather supplement an SSDI payment than pay the full disability amount themselves.",,,2,0,0,

I don't know what vision you have to have to qualify for disability but you might want to start looking into that as soon as possible. It can sometimes take a long time for people to be approved so if you can get the ball rolling on that, you may want to start looking into it. There are limitations on how much money you can earn while receiving disability so if you can keep your current job, it might be better to not receive disability and keep working. There are screen reading programs that will allow you to keep being a computer programer. The state may be able to help you receive computer training on JAWS or other similar talking software.

Yes, if it's easy to mod.  I know some blind folks learned to program by making new maps for [Tactical Battle](https://blindgamers.com/Home/IanReedsGames).  You might want to have a poke at that game, as an example of a game written entirely by blind people, that inspired other blind people to start programming.

&gt; How often do you use a computer, tablet, or smart phone?

Daily. More like hourly.

&gt; What type of activity do you think you mostly use the computer, tablet, or smart phone for?

Business and Leisure about equally, then some creative. In more detail: email, calendaring, word processing, web browsing, Reddit, gaming (coffeemud.net being my current obsession), gps, accounting, programming. About in that order. 

&gt; Are you involved or would you like to be involved in software development?

I am involved. Sort of. Mostly I write scripts for my personal use, in either PHP5 or purebasic. Both of those are terrible languages, but I find them best for rapid development of small one-off projects, projects, to fill some personal need.  I'm not nearly a good enough programmer to be involved in anything open source, or meant for consumption by anyone who isn't me.  The entire reason I learned to program at all was because I needed a thing that didn't exist, and wasn't needed by enough other people to make it worthwhile for anyone else to program it.

&gt; Would knowing that an app was created by somebody with a visual impairment make you more or less likely to use it?

More likely. Depends on the app, though. [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org) is so successful because it's made by the blind, for the blind.  But for, say, a podcasting app, I really wouldn't care; I just want the one that works the best with the most features.  

&gt; Do you think that an app or website developed by somebody with a visual impairment would be better designed for your needs?

Depends on the app or website. Something like a screen reader, colour identifier, OCR app, or something else that's meant to solve problems that other blind people have, would be better if it's written by someone who is ""eating his own dogfood"", so to speak.  But a podcast app, music player, or anything else...maybe, maybe not.

Thanks for your interest in working on technology to improve the lives of people who are blind!

I love the inspiration behind your idea, but I think the project itself doesn't sound very useful.

It's true that in 1950, 50% of the U.S. blind population knew braille and now it's only 10%, but the reason isn't *only* a lack of braille education, it's also because of computers.

Prior to computers, braille was the *only* way a blind person could have independent access to printed materials.

But since the early 1980's, devices that produce synthesized speech have been commercially available, and along with that people developed *screen readers*, software that reads the computer screen to blind users.

In the 80's and 90's, screen readers cost hundreds of dollars, but now most computers, tablets, and phones come with a free screen reader built-in!

So what's happened is that over the last few decades blind people have been using computers and other technology via synthesized speech, and haven't had as much of a need for braille.

There are still some advantages to braille. Besides being silent, it also gives you spelling and punctuation. When you listen to someone reading (or when a computer reads to you), you don't learn how words are spelled or how punctuation is used correctly. Blind people who know braille are far more likely to be better at spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

Finally the last issue is that braille is really hard to find. Braille books are rare, only some signs are in braille, and electronic braille displays cost thousands of dollars so most blind people can't afford one.

So the point is that a device that converts braille to speech isn't useful for a few reasons:

* Blind people can already access everything they need on a computer, they don't need braille
* It's hard to find braille anyway, there's just not much out there
* Even if there was a lot of braille, converting it to speech removes one of the biggest advantages, which is giving you the correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

I think that one of the biggest things that could help give more blind people access to braille would be to make electronic braille displays (refreshable braille displays) more powerful and less expensive. Right now most of them cost more than $2,000 and only display 20 - 80 characters at a time.

There are a few companies trying to make cheaper ones. I think there's still a lot of room for research along those lines, though!

One last idea for you: if you want more ideas of what you could do to help make life better for people who are blind, find a blind person to talk to in person. Meet them and see how they use a computer and a phone. Learn what works well for them and what's still challenging. It might surprise you. And it might give you an idea for something nobody's ever thought of.

If you know of or can find a local Vocational Rehabilitation office, they can help work with you to find either these services or some alternatives.

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1496783668,"Before I say anything else, let me just say that you should not plan on going on any SSI disability  program; you should plan on getting the skills and resources you need to either keep your current job, or find a new one. There is no reason, what so ever, for you to stop working.

Like you, I spent most of my life living as a sighted person with one eye. Even though I had usable vision, and had a driving permit when I was 15, it was always going to be a matter of time before I lost all of my sight. As I was losing my sight, I did not receive the support I needed to transition to live as a productive blind person. I lost all of my sight when I was 18, right as I finished high school.

For nine months, I attended a training center for blind adults; the experience changed my life and gave me the skills and attitude I needed to thrive as a blind person. I learned how to use a computer as a blind person, how to travel and use a cane independently, how to read braille, cook clean and countless other things. Along with these skills, I learned that blind people can live successful lives and that most limitations come from the small expectations and ignorance of society. After my training, I went to college, got married, and now work in IT.

My point is, you’re not alone, and I and millions of other people have gone through some of what you’re experiencing right now. I have had the opportunity to know dozens of blind people, from my wife who was born blind, to senior citizens who lose their sight in their 70s; in my experience, any blind person can be well adjusted and successful, if they are open to accepting and adapting to their circumstances.

You are reaching out for help, and you sound open, so you are off to a good start. As people have already suggested, do some research about local blindness resources. I would second the NFB recommendation. The National Federation of the Blind has many great resources out there; the training center I went to was ran by the NFB. I believe they have a mailing list for blind coders, and blind parents.

Be careful with your options if you do choose to receive any kind of training. I wasted a lot of time at a terrible training center before I found the NFB center. A bad training center can, sometimes be worse than no training at all. I think one of the major decisions you need to make is if you want to attend a, hardcore, full time, training center, or if you want to try receiving part time training. You may be able to spend a few hours a week receiving some kind of local training, either at your home, or somewhere nearby. I think there are a lot of benefits to having the hardcore, immersive, training experience, but I’m not sure how that would fit in with your job, and other training options might work for you.

You can go ahead and do a lot without training. You should start looking into accessible technology that will allow you to continue  using a computer. Broadly speaking, there are two types of assistive technology categories blind people use  to access computers. One category allows low vision users to better use what vision they have, through magnification, contrast, etc. I don’t know much about such programs, but Windows and Mac OS have some basic built in options, and there are more powerful options, such as Zoom Text.

The other category is screen readers. A screen reader allows you to access a computer, no vision  necessary. Such a program takes the visual interface of a computer and presents it through an audio interface. I am accessing my computer with a screen reader called NVDA; NVDA is a free, open source, screen reader that you can download right now and start learning. Other screen readers are JAWS, and for the Mac voiceOver. These programs have a steep learning curb, due in part to the hot keys they depend on, but I’m sure you could teach yourself how to use a screen reader if you are open to the work and research. 

There are also options that combine low vision and screen reader features.

The take away is, All of the resources you need to transition are out there and waiting for you. It’s understandable for you to be scared, the unknowns you face are scary, but blindness itself does not have to be scary. There is a positive community of blind and visually impaired people out there, ready to help you and share their experiences. Fill free to PM me if you want to ask any questions, or just talk that way. 

Good luck

The actual glasses and battery unit were bulky and unremarkable. The recognition seemed fine. 

I have knfb reader on my iphone. It has fine navigation options, speech, braille, and large print access, the ability to save files, and works great.  Object recognition tasks (keep in mind orcam only works with up to 100 faces, and 150 items!) can also be done with my phone. Why would I pay $3500 for this system? 

You can say that it's more convenient with glasses. But I mean, how often am I going to be in a situation where someone I know well enough to have saved their face in my glasses isn't going to verbally greet me, and I'd decide to pull out my glasses and battery pack for a solution?

Editors Note: This is my first video transcription, I may have made mistakes. 

(0:00)

*[There is a high pitched, introduction noise.  ]*

*[There is a woman talking]* 

This video is brought to you by CuriosityStream. Ok, take a look at this optical illusion, are the lines parallel or not? 

*[A picture appears of alternating vertical and horizontal diagonals crossing through the parallel lines, the crossing lines give the appearance that the parallel lines are not parallel.]* 

What about this one? Is the black line a continuation of the red line, or the blue line?  Or if its misaligned, which direction does it have to move to be in line with the red one? 

*[There is a photo of a black line at the top, with a rectangle in the middle, there are two lines, pretty close together, one is red, and one is blue. Your eyes attempt to throw you off, by overestimating where the line will drop off.]*

(0:29)

These are examples of Geometrical Optical Illusions. Mainly the Zöllner and Poggendorff illusions.  The Zöllner illusion is made up of diagonal lines, they are parallel, but they are crossed with shorter lines that alternate between horizontal and vertical. The angles of these shorter lines, give the impression that the diagonal lines are not parallel. In the poggendorff illusion we have a tendency to misestimate the unknown angles hidden by the rectangle,  the acute angle have an effect of us over predicting the position of the line. Many of us are tricked by looking at these images, and for centuries we thought that perceptual illusions just involved the visuals system, but people who have been blind since birth can be tricked by these illusions too. 

(1:13)

In a classic 1938 study, an experimental psychologist mounted raised version of the Poggendorff, Zöllner, and Muller-Lyer illusions on the near ply board.

 *[Photos of the illusions from earlier appear]* 

When participants who were blind since Birth, touched the illusions and explored them haptically, almost all experienced the Poggendorff and Muller-Lyer illusions, and about half were tricked by the Zöllner illusion. 

*[A hand is shown feeling around the illusions]* 

*[A photo of a face, with a blind fold appears]* 

When sighted participants only touched the illusions, there was no effect, but when the sighted participants looked at the illusions, 

*[The blindfold on the face comes off]* 

they were tricked by them too. For people who were blind, they could feel the illusions, that other see, and still be tricked by them.

(1:52)

And over time, with more participants, and more accurate ways of running these experiments, researchers found that many visual illusions exist with a tactile mode. 

(2:02)

Take the Muller-Lyer illusion, do you think the lines are the same length, or are they different? 

*[A photo of 3 lines appear, The arrows are pointed in different ways, which tends to throw people off, The lines, when measured away from the arrows, are the exact same size]*

 For sighted people, some suggest this illusion prompts perceptual differences in depth, and in people who are blind, many have difficulty in separating  where the straight line ends, and where the arrows begin. Leading to a over estimate, or under estimate of the straight line. 

(2:25)

In many studies, this illusion has tricked participants who were both blind, and sighted. There are perceptual processes common in both vision and touch. But there are some differences too. 

(2:38)

Take a look at this image, are the yellow lines the same length or difference? 

*[There is a train track, one yellow line is placed in the background, and one is placed right in the middle of the photo. The difference in linear perspective makes it seem as if the line in front of the viewer is smaller than the one in the background]* 

Mario Ponzo an Italian psychologist suggested that our minds judge an object size based on its background. That is when you can see an object. In numerous studies, the Ponzo illusion has not been found in touch, in those who are blind. Which means a different perceptual process is underlying the illusion. It's thought that the Ponzo illusion is dependent on our perception of linear perspective. Which isn't universally  present in those blind since birth. Of course, people who are blind can learn about these principles of perspective just as sighted people do. But research suggests, they may not spontaneously use these ques in interpreting raised line drawings. 

(3:26)

Studying haptic perception in blind, vision impaired, and sighted people, can help us better understand the sense of touch, and improve the design of things like raised maps, and accessible money, and even haptic feedback on our phones. And in addition to that, you can see there's more to the humble illusion than first meets the eye. 

(4:16)

There was one interesting thing, that I couldn't fit in, because it was going to be too long, but when people touching the illusion, and experiencing the haptic illusions, and the magnitude of the effect changes depending on how much of their hands they use, if you just use the face of your finger, your index finder, it's greater, and if you use your whole hands, or you are feeling everywhere, it's not as great, I couldn't find a way to include that without this being really long, but now it's just really long anyway, and I'm monologuing, thanks for watching.

It can.  Or I can set it to pass punctuation on to the synthesizer unmodified, and the synthesizer (the program that actually generates the speech) will generally change the tone of the speech to represent different punctuation.  If I'm reading things like Reddit comments, I want the tone of speech to change as a result of punctuation.  If I'm programming, I just want every single symbol read out. So I have different configuration profiles set up, that I switch between depending on what I'm doing.

With 15% vision in one eye your father could be mobile even without (much) additional training, and he should be learning to use a screen reader so that he can use his computer. (Voiceover on iOS is the easiest to learn, in my experience, but he should also learn JAWS or NVDA).

It sounds to me like your father's issues have less to do with vision loss and more to do with motivation. He's relatively young, and if he took charge of his health and stayed involved in the world, could live a very long and productive life. From your position, however, you may only have limited influence.

When you visit your father, introduce him to Voiceover. Buy him an iPad if he doesn't have an iPhone. Have an app lined up that will pique and old or a current interest (Spotify for music, etc.) if you can think of one. Chances are, encouraging him to do exercise or physical therapy won't be productive, but you can try that if you think there's hope for change as long as you don't damage your relationship.

For the glaucoma, it's critical that your father take any prescribed medication to prevent further loss. This can best be done by making sure it's maximally easy for him to keep pills organized, etc., so perhaps you can work on that workflow or set up phone reminders. There also is some evidence that marijuana can alleviate glaucoma symptoms for short periods of time, which can improve quality of life but isn't really a long-term solution.

1. Navigation in applications that don't have good tab ordering or where controls are unreachable by the keyboard is easier with JAWS, with the invisible or JAWS cursor. It is possible with NVDA but object navigation (and even flat review) is a little more confusing and complicated.

2. NVDA has ESpeak as its default voice. Many people don't like it. I am not so bothered by it particularly, but it's a consideration, especially if one is used to another voice like Eloquence.

3. I'd say JAWS is a little better in some contexts. For example, console use. But NVDA is better in some others.

Thanks for the links too.  While I didn't implement ARIA tags, I feel like I have a good grasp of making the content screen reader friendly and the interface accessible.  The problems I'm concerned with are how to make user accounts and pay-walls friendly, not just the markup.  I'm sure some services are easier than others to deal with in terms of account creation, email management and settings/profile data.  So I'm looking more for an example of a service that does it really well.  But I've added ARIA to my list of todos.",,,1,0,0,

I think you should decide what you want to hear from people, whether it's sympathy, advice, or just listening, and just tell people how you want them to react when you talk about your sight. Unfortunately I've usually regretted it when I talk to people about my vision, the reactions are inappropriately sad like it's literally the worst thing that could happen, which is by no means the case. When I do talk about it now, I use a practical and down to earth tone that encourages people not to treat it like a big deal. In your life, people will need to know about your VI for practical reasons, and you're the one who has to set the tone in those interactions. With time, it becomes easier to tell people about it in a practical, non-emotional way, but you need to do some work on yourself to accept your circumstances. The recommendation to do therapy to talk out some of the emotional elements is a great idea, since these conversations can take a huge toll on your loved ones, who may actually be taking these changes harder than you in some ways.",,,2,0,0,

That's fine. I can spend some time on this; depending on if/how a published article comes out of it, I'd just want some sort of credit in the article text.  However, I should be clear up front that time is all I've got.  If there are any associated costs with developing an Alexa Skill, I can't afford to put any money down right now.  To get an app in the Apple app store, for example, it's $99 a year, plus server hosting etc.  I have no idea if Amazon has similar associated costs.  But I don't have extra server space or extra money.  Sorry if I come off as a bit of a jerk, but I've been involved in enough ""free"" projects that somehow expand into costing money, that I always feel the need to be up front.  

The only other hold up, as I've said, is that Amazon may only allow US citizens to develop skills.  I'm traveling over the weekend, but I can dive in on Monday morning and research the account requirements, and requirements for developing a skill (servers? money? etc) if you like.

 - Live music ( could see if a local school's jazz band or something wanted to come out, donate to charity, and gain practice before competitions?)
 - Bingo ( you'd need Braille bingo cards, and to find out one how many would want to, and two, if everyone can read braille)
 - murder mystery dinner theater ( there is a boxed game version of this, fairly cheap online, and if everyone is into improv doing this along with dinner could work well, they wouldn't need to read a lot or at all depending on how it was organized)
 - dance off? ( dance marathon, winners, and runners up get prizes)
 - card game night ( or other games, look and ask around, there are games with braille or large enough print for those who are partially visually impaired
 - ask for help from the American Foundation for the Blind, they may come up with other ideas, or know where you can get more resources than 200 dollars

The trouble is, because racism is always talked about to children as entirely about skin colour, I find some blind people I know don't really internalize that they, to, can be racist.  We don't judge people by skin colour, so we're fine, right?  Wrong!  

The problem is, it really is quite easy to convince yourself that judging people by voice is a perfectly OK thing to do.  For example, a Chinese baby who was adopted by white Canadian parents, and entirely raised by them, will sound completely ""white"".  Someone raised in inner-city detroit will probably ""sound black"", even if they're white, or Korean, or anything else.  So we're not actually racist, the argument goes, because we're judging people by culture.  Apparently, and I've heard this said, ""someone who sounds black will act black, so it doesn't matter.""  So yes, unfortunately, blind people can and will judge you to be whatever race you sound most like.  And unfortunately, a few of us have decided that we're totally justified, and not racist at all.  

I feel like I shouldn't even need to add this. But: accents and culture, and how they relate, are complicated.  Stereotyping people by accent, or by culture, is no more OK than stereotyping them by skin colour.  I hope these views aren't wide spread in the blind community, and I don't think they are.  But I've heard the argument above twice so far this year, and I really don't want to hear it again.  It could just be because I'm talking to more and different blind folks, or it could just be Coincidence that I'm hearing that crap more often. I hope so.",,,9,0,0,

That would be convenient for those who suddenly find themselves blind, but could lead to a dependency on the tech - what if it shorts out, or they lose it, and the user never bothered to learn to actually read Braille? 

A cane replacement would be harder, as others have mentioned. My dad, for example, is working on a type of sonar that gets louder the closer you get to an object, but it has no bearing on the levelness of the ground. So using his device, I can avoid walking into people and walls, but will fall down stairs (eventually...I'm still sighted enough to notice stairs and avoid a tumble). You would need to develop something that not only monitors for objects on the transverse plane, but also the saggital, which the cane does.

Both Google Home and Alexa can play podcasts and radio stations from tunein.  Alexa can play books from audible.com, and she can read any Kindle book outloud.  Google works with Google Music or Spotify. Alexa works with Amazon Music or Spotify.  Alexa can order products from Amazon by voice. Google can do the same, but only with Google Express, and that's not available in most cities yet.  Alexa and Google Home both allow developers to create third party skills to work on the speaker.  Both Google Home and Amazon Alexa are less than half the price of a HomePod, and they're available right now!  The only features the Homepod promises are Siri and Apple Music; no news or podcasts, no third party app support, nothing else.

A lot of visually impaired people do have some sight though.  I'm not bad at long distance or mid range, but closer up I struggle a lot due to my narrow visual field, especially with writing on food packets or following a recipe book on my kitchen bench.  

Having to stop, wash my hands (if I'm handling raw meat or something), then pick up the book and magnifier, find my place in the text and read along 1 word at a time is a major pain in the arse and very time consuming.  It takes a lot of the fund out of cooking, something I previously loved doing.

That Orcam sounds quite useful to me.  Can't hold a phone or tablet in one hand, a recipe book in the other hand, a food item in the third hand and a knife in a fourth hand.

Different people have different levels / types of visual impairment.

I don't know if you were born blind or grew up visually impaired, but for someone who experiences sight loss later in life like myself (40s) it was incredibly hard to adjust.

&gt;we already have everything we need

I'd have to disagree.  Technology can always benefit from being improved and expanded upon.

A simpler &amp; cheaper version of the Orcam would be good.  Instead of a processing unit you have to carry around, a home use version that uses wifi or bluetooth to communicate with software running on your phone, tablet or PC would negate the need for expensive hardware, needing only the small unit that attached to your glasses.
