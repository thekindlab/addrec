I think having two sites, one for blind and one for sighted users, that need to be maintained separately isn't a good idea. It violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), makes it hard to maintain your site, and often results in the accessible version getting short shrift. If you want this to be a model for other devs, they won't want to separate concerns like that either.

Screen readers have navigation options. That's not something you should worry about. You seem really serious about this, so you might want to download NVDA on Windows and try to learn a little about how it works, which might give you a better mental model.

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1505408258,"I have a slightly different perspective then those who have responded thus far. Normally I am very negative about wiz bang specialized hard ware that sighted people make for blind people; however, being able to identify people more easily would really be amazing for me.

I have a very terrible memory when it comes to people’s names. I have actually gotten to know people pretty well, spending a lot of time hanging out with them, while not being able to remember their name. This happened a lot in college; brief encounters were especially annoying, people would come up to me and greet me with my name, and I would not be able to respond with their name. Of course, sometimes I would simply ask them to remind me of their name, but you can only do that so many times. Places like churches are especially bad for me. I have gotten to know people well at churches that I have attended for years, seeing them every week, but not knowing their names. There are so many people that you meet all at once at a church, and it’s just so awkward to ask someone what their name is after you have known them for three months. 

Of course, my issue is not entirely realized to being blind. I was sighted for most of my life, and I had this problem to a lesser extent as a sighted person. Just because I was able to see people’s faces did not mean I was able to remember their names. What is more, my wife, who is also blind, has a much easier time with people’s names; she actually helps me a lot now. Never the less, blindness does make the problem harder for me. Without visual info, you just have less to help you remember names. 

With all of that said, I’m not sure how feasible this sunglasses idea would be. I would not wear anything that looked obvious, such as Google glass. Blind people are stared at enough without camera’s sticking out of our faces. Also, it seems like it would be pretty hard for a camera to randomly pick up someone’s face as they walked by. I do make some effort to try and make eye contact with people I hear walk by, but I do not do that with everyone, and the face is a pretty small target.

For me, I believe the only tech concept that could help would be voice based. I’m not sure if it’s even possible to have accurate voice id, but I think a phone app that could listen in real time and whisper someone’s name to me, through an earpiece, would be amazing. As people greet me in church, the app could id their voice, give me the name, and I could respond accordingly. As the app runs, it could flag voices that it does not yet know, and record the audio of these new voices, in order to later bring up a list of profiles for identification. That way, when someone introduces themselves to you, you could go back, find the flagged new voice, hear the recording of the person’s name, and enter it in your personal database. Once the app could id someone’s voice, there would be no point in it saving recordings of that person’s voice.

I’m sure this voice id concept is science fiction, and perhaps it would only fix an issue that is unique to me. However, I believe there are millions of people in the world, blind and sighted a like, who could benefit from an app that helps you remember names. Besides, I’m not much for sunglasses.

PS, I know you are looking at the issue from a hardware perspective and that my audio idea is a software  solution. Your project might be worth pursuing; I have heard a lot of school projects for ""helping the blind"" that have less utility then your idea. I would focus on making the product look as normal as possible. You might want to check out the Microsoft seeing AI app. It has a face ID mode, although I find all the other features of the app much more useful, and you have to teach the app each new face, which would be awkward to make all of your friends do.",,,1,0,0,
3c0a5c2d-4532-404e-81c7-9fbd7a356ef0,1504579628,"I think the advice to always carry your ID cane may be right. But it's not as obvious a decision as it might seem. There are advantages to ""passing"" as a sighted person, and for you, depending on your personal situation, those advantages might outweigh the advantages of carrying your ID cane. It's a personal decision, and you have to make it for yourself.

With that said, if you want to start carrying your cane, you may want to consider carrying it all the time. It's puzzling to people who see you with it sometimes and not others, even if it makes sense to you. If you carry it all the time, you'll get used to it, and the people around you will too. You may want to get a retractible or folding cane and carry it folded most of the time to signal that you don't need help and only extend in a situation where you're having trouble navigating or where it would help people understand your situation.

In any case, this is from someone who is about 20/700 and I don't carry a cane. Might be a bad idea, but I get around fine (so far) and have gotten used to explaining or defusing the occasional odd situations with relative ease. I will eventually need an ID case (actually, probably sooner rather than later), but am worried about how my family and partner will react day to day, not to mention my friends and co-workers.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1505784911,"&gt; 1. What are the current challenges that you face while using a white cane and what improvements can be made?

Some challenges: deep snow, and overhanging objects.  In Canada, of course, we get a lot of snow and ice.  I feel like the cane is not as good as it could be in that sort of environment. Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure how it could be improved.  But as it is, I find I often miss ice when it's hidden under snow, I find large snow banks more challenging to move in/through/around than I'd like them to be, and my tip will sometimes catch on some textures of snow.  As for the second problem: I often have to move around a building that has signs and displays mounted on the walls at head height, sticking out from the wall anywhere from 6 inches to a foot.  If I'm closer to the wall than I thought I was, the cane will do nothing to detect these.  Of course, when I'm expecting them, I put my hand up in front of my face, so I don't run into them. But it does sometimes happen that I'm hurrying along, and I think I'm far enough out from the wall to miss them completely, and I'm really not.  It's a nasty surprise.

&gt; 2. How much would you be willing to pay for a white cane?

Depends on the features, durability, etc. Right now a cane lasts me from 1 to 2 years. So if you invented a cane that would last me five years, or even forever, I'd obviously be willing to pay more.  The thing that destroys my canes most often is accidents: a door slams on them, someone trips on them, a car runs over the end of them, someone steals them (yes, this has happened, and no, I don't know who steals canes or why), etc.  But if an accident doesn't take them early, within a couple years, the reflective paint starts to rub off.  And I really don't feel safe using a white cane that isn't properly white, and thus visible to cars.

&gt; Which sense do you use the most 

Touch is the most important for the cane itself.  But I use all my senses when traveling.  But I feel like if I switched to a dog, I wouldn't use touch the same active way I do with a cane.  Even with a dog I'd still use all my other senses though.

&gt; 4. Are there certain situations where you feel like using the white cane isn't helpful?

Running or jogging.  Working out with a cane is kind of horrible!  I either work out in the gym, or go with a friend.  I don't feel like I could use the cane fast enough or well enough to go running or jogging on the sidewalk or trail with it.  

&gt; 5. What situations give you the most anxiety when using the white cane?

Crowded areas.  On one hand, I don't want to be constantly knocking people with my cane.  On the other hand, I don't want to just walk into them either.  On the third hand, all that focus I'm spending not knocking people or running into people takes away the attention I need to devote to my travel, and after avoiding all the people, I can sometimes end up vaguely lost and going the wrong way.",,,4,0,0,

Try really, really hard not to do this.  Even though you have the best of intentions, some day you'll update the main site, and forget to update the ""alternative"" site. Or another developer will take it over, who doesn't care as much as you do, and leave the alternative site to languish.  Also, what happens if someone shares with me a link to somewhere deep in the website? Now that page might not be accessible, so I have to click for the alternative site, and then try and guess my way back to whatever content someone was trying to share with me.  

Even companies as large and smart as Google have made this ""alternative site"" mistake. For about 10 years, there was a special screen-reader interface for gmail. It was released once, and then never, ever updated. No bugs were fixed, no new features were added, and it got wildly out of sync with regular gmail.  Eventually Google made the regular gmail accessible, and killed the screen-reader interface.  

&gt; How do ads affect the browsing experience? 

Ads are so huge a problem that the vast majority of blind folks run ad blockers.  However, affiliate links aren't really ads in the classic sense. In theory, they're useful and related to the main article.  So long as you're not running ad network banners flashing and vibrating and playing music and demanding that your visitors spank the monkey, you're fine.  You might consider reading about [landmarks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page). The first example on that page is the correct way to do it: mark your article content as main, and your affiliate links as complementary. They're not really ads in the classic sense after all. If the article is a how-to guide, the links to purchase the required tools could actually be quite important. Also, using landmarks to mark other parts of the page (search, navigation, etc) would help provide the easy to use experience you're seeking.  

&gt; become PHP templates 

Look at the default Drupal and Wordpress themes. They both do a really, really good job at accessability.  And that's a huge win for blind people, because a lot of sites using Wordpress or Drupal get accessibility by default, as long as the developers don't do something to mess it up.

The next major issue is using vibrations to tell someone precisely enough that there is an obstacle in the way with enough reaction time to stop/avoid it. I'll give you an example... the average walking speed of most people is 1.4 meters per second, although pedestrian lights are generally set to 1 meter per second. Ignoring the drop-off issue I mentioned earlier and assuming your device scans a distance of 3 meters out (which is almost three times the scanning distance you suggested), that would give you a reaction time of just over a second. You might think it would give you two seconds, but that doesn't take into account that objects outside may also be moving in relation to the user.

This design suffers less from stiction, probably because there is less surface / contact area and the conical profile means the surfaces don't slide over each other as they are pulled apart. The shorter joints also need less extension of the elastic cord before you can fold. The joints when closed are still strong and don't open up in use.

However a cane that is around a year old has become harder to fold, possibly because the plating at a joint has become corroded or worn .

The application of petroleum jelly to the joints helps but this can collect dirt and needs regular re-application.

Stiff joints in the cane makes folding difficult when wearing gloves, or you have greasy hands, or any condition that makes the hands weak or painful.

Why not address the reasons why able blind adults are not taught braille or lack sufficient access to it instead?

There's also key omissions in the article: 

&gt; “The other day, my wife was expressing how she missed writing me a note,” he says. “That’s difficult with braille.” With ELIA, he says, she wouldn’t even need to learn it, she could just type it in the ELIA font on a computer and print it out""

Yes, with a $3000 tactile printer they're developing (not sure how different it would be to something like the picture in a flash system?) and special paper. Braille embossers start at around $2000 new (but you can buy refurbished ones much cheaper) and do not require braille knowledge to use. 

&gt; ""betting instead on visually impaired individuals using audio books or text-to-speech to read full-length books. “In general, sighted or not, we’re moving toward the fully digital book,” he says.""

So ELIA is an essential tool for literacy, but also not likely to be used for reading longer text. Okay! And thankfully, we have refreshable braille displays. 

&gt; ""increased audio book production and text-to-speech initiatives have made it easier for visually impaired individuals to have access to all types of literature. Audible.com has a large readership, both sighted and not, and the Library of Congress offers books in audio, available through both free digital player or iPhone app.""

The NLS also offers downloadable electronic braille files, and Bookshare exists with hundreds of thousands of texts for a braille user. 

I briefly checked out their website, which was no more promising. I find the following quote especially offensive: 

&gt; ""The National Federation of the Blind rightly put it: “Literacy is the ability to read and write. While using speech output and recorded books is a way for students to gain information, it does not teach them reading and writing skills. Students who rely solely on listening as a means of learning find themselves deficient in areas like spelling and composition.”

The NFB is a champion for braille literacy. It is misleading and inappropriate to use this quote out of context.

I am certain that their product can be of substantial value to those who cannot learn to read braille for short reading and labeling tasks if they are able to market it better than older raised letter systems. There is no reason to make unnecessary claims about “redesigning braille” to accomplish this. 

Editing to add: my relevant credential is having learned some braille as a teenager, and having substantially improved my reading skills as an adult. My reading speed is still growing with time, especially after I was finally able to replace my extremely dated notetaker with a slightly more modern one that can easily connect to my phone or computer.

My mother had me and my three other siblings tested because she knew she was losing her eyesight to a hereditary condition.  Knowing in advance changed the way I planned my life, which made my life better but it came at the cost of severe adolescent depression.  

I'm in my late 40's and still have roughly 15 degrees of visual field left.  Also have cataracts, a severe astigmatism, retinal edema (swelling which makes my low visual acuity practically incorrectable with glasses), and zero night vision.  

My mother has been completely blind for 25 years, yet she managed to get two master's degrees with zero eyesight and became a teacher and counselor for disabled middle school children.  My brother has retinitis pigmentosa as well, and also Usher's syndrome, which means he has very little hearing.  My mother has one sister who has RP as well.  

Life doesn't end with the loss of eyesight, it just changes.  That's what I have learned from my mother's experience.  It doesn't change the fact that it is terrifying though, but the terror passes.  Like everything else in life that is difficult, it requires training and adaptation.  I don't know if I'll go completely blind, but living with the knowledge that it can happen at any time is the hard part.  My mother said the dread it causes can be worse than the blindness itself.

I've discovered that I definitely don't want certain devices after getting a chance to try them at home. (Like the focus blue, 4th gen I think. First one I was sent didn't work at all. Second did. Overall build felt cheap, the braille cells weren't quite smooth with irregularities, and the nav rocker was very clicky and required an unacceptable amount of force to use)

I currently use a braillenote apex qt 32 cell as my braille display. I primarily use it as a bluetooth display with my iphone or computer. The main reason I bought it versus a different display or notetaker was that I got a very good deal on it secondhand. I definitely wouldn't have paid anywhere near full retail for it. I've previously owned two different braillenote mpowers. 32 cells is a great size for me personally, especially since I tend to read with only my right hand. 

I've tried a few different braille displays and physically, I've liked HIMS displays the most. The braille and buttons are the nicest I've personally tried (although I did like the braille on the varioultra as well.) I didn't like the notetaker software on the U2 at all when I helped a friend set their U2 up, but that's probably not an issue if you're going for purely a display.

&gt; my impairment isn't obvious, so they just think I'm a lazy teenager, and not VI.

I've seen this problem where someone still has the body language of a sighted person because they had normal sight as a youngster.

You can carry a symbol cane, or you can deliberately act blind (look past people not at them) or better you can tell them straight up ""I have a visual impairment."" or ""My eyes aren't good"", ""Can you help me please"" whilst thinking ""I've done my bit explaining my disability now treat me with respect like everyone else gets."" You are only asking for a little extra help, just enough for you to get by. (expletive deleted) if they don't show normal courtesy and respect.

&gt; Should I take my cane to a rock concert? 

Discuss this with your friend you're going to the concert with. They'll probably be surprised or even shocked at first but should quickly understand. They might be happy to keep an eye on you so you don't have the hassle of carrying a cane. The most awkward thing in a dark venue might be if they need to guide you to the toilets. Mention this beforehand and let them know you just might need watching while you find your own way there and back.

I don't know how people respond to canes in the US or how rowdy the concert will be, but consider that a cane might stop other people knocking into you or even get you escorted to the disabled viewing area or the front row. Or it could just be a hassle carrying it around when you should be having fun.

&gt; Disney trip

Try the same approach as with the rock concert. If the teachers are competent professionals they will do a bit of research or get advice themselves. Make clear the limits of the help you need so they don't overcompensate.

This  is a learning experience for them as well as for you. Tell the teachers ""learning is fun"" /s 

&gt; My mom hates my cane    
&gt; hates that the cane makes me ""look blind"".

Ouch! Try [Family Connect: For parents of children with visual impairments.](https://www.familyconnect.org/parentsitehome.aspx)

But a good cane with the right training will give you that little bit of help and equalisation that makes you just as capable and independent as anyone else. In principle, it's no different than wearing spectacles, just less common.

&gt; it's an [NFB 50/50 cane](https://ecommerce.nfb.org/asp/prodtype.asp?prodtype=1&amp;ph=cat&amp;keywords=&amp;recor=&amp;SearchFor=&amp;PT_ID=) that goes up to my nose

That sounds like it is too long, but I'm no expert. There are shorter canes which can fold compactly, I see ID / symbol canes that are waist high and mobility canes that come to your sternum and have a variety of tips depending on your needs and navigation technique. Training is essential to use these effectively.   [Ambutech](https://ambutech.com/) have an extensive range. Get advice so you can get on with your life.

&gt; how do I stop people from ""babysitting"" me? 

You will have to hone your political and diplomatic skills to the degree that you may end up as the first VI POTUS. As someone who has helped and guided various blind people, I have to consciously take care that I am not overcompensating or being overprotective.   You will have to get used to being clear about what help you need and don't need because your helpers can't read your mind. You will have to be assertive about protecting your independence and personal space. E.g. don't let people take you by the arm, insist that they offer their arm and you hold onto them. They can *give* you help but they must not *take* control.

&gt; my friends because they don't think I'm getting around as effectively as they are.

Either they adapt and take a more team oriented approach to activities or you will need to find activities where your visual impairment doesn't matter, e.g. [tandem cycling](http://bicyclingblind.org/).

I feel like this is already happening, without anyone doing anything intentionally.  Several people in my immediate and extended family are blind, so I get the opportunity to really notice the rapid generational shift that has happened thanks to technology.  Today, thanks to audible and kindle, I can get any book I want, on the day of release.  Previously, only a tiny number of books could be converted to audio or Braille.  And it wasn't the blind readers who got to decide what books those were. Instead, it was the groups funding the libraries, and the people in charge of the libraries for the blind themselves who decided what information blind people got to have.  Also, laws like the ADA have required accessibility to be something universal, rather than something only done in some places by some groups.  That means that blind people get to take charge of our medical information like never before because hospitals have an access requirement, be part of current popular culture because of audio described TV, or shop for whatever we want in complete privacy because of websites like Amazon.  Also, access laws are meaning blind schools are becoming less and less important. Instead, blind people are being educated in mainstream classes with sighted students.  Sure, this has flaws; things like sex education still need work.  But at least we're no longer kept isolated.  Similarly, if a blind child wants to attend a summer camp with sighted peers, the camp needs to accommodate her.  That means specialty camps for the blind are just one choice, rather than the only option.  

However, things aren't perfect yet. They're just changing extremely quickly, and headed in the right direction.  A lot of blindness fundraising organizations are still religious, and/or still have strong political or moral views.  And employment in the blind community is still a massive problem, meaning we often unfortunately find ourselves depending on charities.  Also, I am a straight white male, and I arrived at my Christian beliefs without external pressure.  So I'm not likely to encounter or notice the modern pressure to fit a mold I already slot into pretty well.  So my cries of ""Bad things happened before, but it's all better now!"" should be taken with however many grains of salt you feel are appropriate.

* My vision's the same now as it's ever been, so why start using one at 38 yrs old? - Falling down and twisting an ankle is a lot worse to recover from at 38 than it was at 18!
* I'm not blind enough! - You only have one eye, poor visual acuity, and no peripheral vision in it.
* Most of the time I can see to get around alright. - Ok, so just use it for the times you can't. Just because you use a mobility cane it doesn't mean you have to use it 24/7.
* It feels like I'm admitting defeat and letting my blindness ""win."" - You wouldn't say that about someone using a wheelchair. You're not letting your blindness ""win"" anything. You're defeating it with a tool that lets you keep on doing the things you want to do.

If I had gone to the conference and sucked away at my savings to make it happen I would have maybe postponed the inevitable.

Thank you /u/257fea64-6079-41b7-8826-baf481c3b350 and /u/ef2be27e-e10a-4d6b-8c35-d49273946ed9 for your thoughtful response.  I hope I find some people, probably unaffiliated who I can relate with.

It would be ok within reason. I would say having difficulties articulating, not being able to pronounce certain sounds or speaking in a blurry way that is hard to understand would be more of an obstacle for me than stutter.

&gt; Conversely are people who regularly practice speaking (singers, voice actors, etc) in general more attractive?

No, but it's true some people have very pleasant voices. But the way it works for me it's something I can appreciate about a person but it doesn't condition if I'm attracted to them or not. Anyone I like I will find something to like about them.

&gt; Also you seemed to be avoiding using gendered terminology, does gender not play much of a roll in attraction for you or am I just making a false connection?

Yes, you are correct. My attraction is not strongly gendered. Anyone whom I feel strongly attached to by close friendship is someone I could be drawn into physical intimacy with, though of course this doesn't always materialise due to lack of mutual interest.

Are there people advocating for nonreligious-based schooling, camps and wider services for the blind? And yes, someone should do some research on the sexuality of blind people. I'm going to guess it would not get much funding, because probably what it will highlight ultimately, is not so much that blind people are inherently more X than Y, but that ALL of us are far more fluid than we'd imagine.

Personally, I consider myself fluid, bisexual, even pansexual. Though I do have a distinct preference for masculinity. (I'm female.). Given the current state of popular culture, there would need to be some distinct reasoning for the research, with very useful hypotheses in play, since even gender is fluid, and semantics and terminology (i.e. masculine/feminine) are political. Though I imagine in 20 years we can re-up on using blanket terms, since their meanings will encompass a broader meaning implicitly. I hope.

Other posts have gone into some of the reasons, like insularity and being allowed things that shouldn't be allowed. I remember when I went to school guys used to joke with me how I could just ""accidentally"" bump into girls' breasts, but it would never come to my mind to actually do this.

The issues with dating drama and so on... I find a little easier to understand. The community is usually small and people know each other and their entire past. Many blind people find it difficult to date outside the blind community, so there is not a lot of chances and what chances arise are often taken. People can also feel desperate for human contact and do things they shouldn't, be too pushy, etc.

I think women maybe get the worst of this, in that they often get judged by people for their promiscuity, but at the same time that's how many of them manage to get attention.

I'm not particularly into monogamy myself, but I believe in being open and honest about things like this. I add this part because some of it sounds like a complaint about people having many dating or sex partners, which I don't think is a problem as such. The problem is when there are other expectations or norms and people have to lie about it and so on.

Echolocation can be a great tool to help people with vision loss travel around, but one major concern is reliability. If the tool you use cannot consistently keep you safe, then that is a big issue. All you need is one major misstep that can lead to disastrous consequences. In the case of echolocation, it is the ability to detect drops offs (specifically, things such as holes or unexpected rises in the ground). Echolocation has never consistently been able to locate something that low (and according to studies, height differences as little as 3 mm are enough to trip many people). Not only that, but many times, drop-offs have hazards on the other side (traffic, stairs, etc). A white cane provides a much more definite tactile sensation when it locates a drof-off.

Echolocation also does help children learn more about their enviroment, and it also gives them a greater sense of larger areas. There are two ""variations"" (not exactly sure how to describe that) of echolocation, active and passive. Active is the version where you make a noise (often with their mouths, but some people are use their cane) and listen to the response, while the passive is just listening to echos around you. The active one gives you significantly more information, but as you mentioned, is usually less socially acceptable. For most O&amp;M training, we usually deal more with passive echolocation, where the client just listens to the enviroment for sound cues such as hallways (we don't normally refer to that as echolocation, although it is). 

Another big reason why echolocation isn't taught more often is the 1) the lack of people who are proficient in it, 2) a lack of people who can teach the skill (just because someone can do it doesn't mean they can teach others) and 3), not that many clients want to (or have the ability to) learn that skill. 90% of my clients are over 60 years old, and at least half of them have hearing loss, balance issues or other health concerns. One client (before O&amp;M training) had tripped on a crack in the sidewalk (roughly 2 mm high), fell, and broke NINE bones. The cane was able to provide more sensory feedback to inform her when there were imperfections in the road.

Considering all that, I do think there is a place for echolocation training, but I believe it should be to supplement cane training. I've spoken to Mr Kish before (I doubt he would remember) and have suggested to one client to contact him for training (that was a highly unusual case, when we weren't sure if that client was able to use a cane).

I am legally blind in my right eye; all I have left is a very small visual field that varies quite a bit. Although the vision in my left eye is still excellent, it obviously can't fill in the right side of the field.

Here's where I feel I have an unfair advantage: I have synesthesia. I taste colors; I also have color-phoneme associations. For example, if I see red-navy blue-forest green and taste licorice, I know that is the number 467 written in black ink.

The antisocial thing is actually kind of a big issue and a reason it's not more widely adopted. Many sighted people find the clicking annoying or disruptive. Yes, I agree, that's petty and kind of shocking, but it's a serious impediment to adoption. Not so much for adult echolocators but for kids who often might naturally echolocate but who are told to stop clicking by parents and so never learn.

As for safety, there's nothing inherently unsafe about echolocation, but it emboldens the blind to move around and do things that the sighted often feel like blind people shouldn't be able to do. Yes, sounds like a feature rather than a bug, right? But once your blind kid is biking around or running around and getting cuts and bruises, many parents might discourage echolocation, either subtly or overtly. The sighted often have a pretty set idea of what blind people should and shouldn't do, and the stuff you might get up to with echolocation kind of doesn't fit that model.

Finally, for the teaching and learning, you have to understand that there's a long history and a sort of parochial culture around teaching mobility to the blind. It's kind of a little industry and like many industries once a set of customs are established they tend to stick around. Dog training is kind of the pinnacle of modern day mobility training and echolocation is just not something most mobility trainers are familiar with. 

So the reason echolocation isn't more widely adopted has less to  with its practicality and more to do with the wider culture and expectations of what blind people are supposed to be and do. That's my take on it.",,,1,0,0,

I'm an identical twin, and we had to be delivered early because of twin to twin tranfusion syndrome, where my sister was getting all the nutrients ect, and I was starving in the womb.

With the steroid injections, they put tons of numbing cream ect, so you don't feel the initial penetration of the needle, but the pain kicks in once the drugs wear off, and have a swollen eye lid for a day.

Retinal detachment, I feel like such an idiot that I didn't realise how bad things were getting. I worked in a library, and started noticing tons of floaters, a few as you age is normal, so I kept ignoring it as more and more appeared. Then had flashing lights in my side vision. One day at work I realised I couldn't read, thought ""Well I better go get glasses."" and the poor optomertrist basically said ""TAKE THIS REFERRAL AND GO TO THE EYE HOSPITAL NOW.""
Scored a ""How have you left it this long????"" from the eye doctor.

Uveitis is the 3rd leading cause of blindness, and has no cure, but treatment to slow it down/put it in remission, but for me because I left it so long the damage was done, and the needles would make it go away then it would come back a month later, and now reached the stage that they do nothing, and have to do the hardcore chemo drugs.

I try and be positive sometimes and tell self just because there is no cure today, doesn't mean there won't ever be.

For any type of surgery, there are risks  versus gains. For example, cataract surgery. Generally considered one of the safest surgeries in the world (98% success rate), it has restored vision to millions of people. Howevere, some underlying conditions make that surgery significantly more dangerous. If someone has glaucoma, cataract surgery can make it much worse, which would cause more vision loss in the long term.

As a general rule, when someone loses their vision, they don't need to learn a new language. They can continue using the language they know. That is one of the biggest differences between vision loss and hearing loss.... Vision loss disconnects you from the world, but hearing loss disconnects you from people. 

As for why the deaf use Sign language, give this a try.... when you speak, don't say each word, say each letter. And see how long that takes. Sign language replaces spelling out individual words with a sign so that conversations can be held within a more reasonable time span.

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1504974535,"I know this anger all too well. I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma and after a 2 year battle with it using radiation and cryotherapy, I eventually had to get my left eye removed. They saved my right eye and I went on monocular until I was 15. I developed a radiation cataract and had to have cataract surgery at the enth of middle school. My last year of 9th grade was marred with having to use a CCTV in the library, carrying around a stupidly large tape deck to play back books and record notes, and having to run to the office  to blow up all my test pages to 11x17 size so I could read them. 

My vision was perfect after cataract surgery, and I went on to study and become an animator and VFX artist, working hard and making my way up through the industry for 10 years after graduating college. I worked on national ad campaigns, movies, and was on my way to becoming a character animator at Pixar whe my vision began to fail.

Turns out that all the kids who had radiation in the 80's were beginning to get radiation retinopathy, and in my case it was a cystoid macular edema. I couldn't read, make out people's faces' and it became very difficult to do my work. A new doctor started treating me, but kept going after the symptoms and never sought how to fix the cause. Many eyedrops and injections later, they messed up one eye injection and caused an internal infection. 

Went in for surgery which fixed the issue and brought back all my vision. Was able to read again, see people, make out the puck when at a hockey game, all was well until my retina detached a month later. The emergency surgery didn't work, and I had a tractional detachment for a year while I changed doctors and kept it under observation. Was able to get back to work, but with diminished vision. Finally, it grew too close to my fovea, so I wenwith in for more surgery. Came out with my retina fixed but with a complication. More surgery to fix the complication, and had 4 more surgeries each with its own complication. Finally, after being low vision and working with the DOR to figure out how to work again, my eye just gave out one day and threw a retinal arterial occlusion, a stroke in the retina that destroyed all the rest of my vision, all in about 30 minutes. My career and the job I absolutely loved and my future as an animator was completely destroyed in that time. 

That was over 3 years ago, and I'm still working my way through the loss. I've dived into  becoming an accessibility engineer and am currently working as an accessibility specialist for a pink ridesharing company, but I will always miss my animation skills and work. I was 29 when all this went down,  and have to completely reinvent life moving forward. Dealing with the immediate loss of independence was hard but is getting better, I'm pushing back and fighting my way back into  the workforce and am advocating on disability rights while trying to shape the world back to a form that lets me enjoy things again that I used to love with vision. It's all still hard, and I will be forever angry at how this all happened, especially as the initial issue was simply fixed with a small laser treatment from the new doctor after the failed detachment surgery; this all could have been avoided had we known more and had a better initial doctor. 

I know I just really want my vision back. ",,,5,0,0,

5a72deae-105e-43e3-8e70-d5a1765ea7b6,1505410391,"&gt; its just that I was born with rop and from all my research and consultation with doctors I've learned that having cataract surgery could cause retinal tearing/detachment. Its a difficult choice to make. Go blind slowly or possibly go blind quickly. Its scary.

I went through this exact same thing when I was 34; ROP, only one eye, cataract getting worse, slowly losing what was left of my vision from it, and yes, it was terrifying.  I put it off as long as possible in case things did take a turn for the worse. 

In the end, everything worked out OK. I had to have an anterior capsulotomy about 8mo post-op because some of the anterior capsule tissue tried to regrow (can happen when you get cataract surgery at a young age) and about 2 years later, a posterior capsulotomy due to posterior capsule opacification, but I've had no retina issues as a result of any of that, thankfully (almost 40 now).

That said, I don't regret waiting, because if I had lost my vision at that point, well, at least I'd had some for a few months longer than I otherwise would have and I'd gotten used to having basically no functional vision by the time I had the surgery so the adjustment might have been easier?

You can't put it off _too_ long, though, because as the cataract gets worse it gets more difficult to operate on, which can increase the risk of complications even more.

My recommendation would be to find the best cataract surgeon you can find and talk to them about it. You have to find the balance between ""waiting in case I go blind"" and ""have the surgery before the risks of complications increase even more.""

My cataract surgeon and my retinologist coordinated on all of my pre-screenings and follow-up. Also, mine was done under general anesthesia, due to the increased risk and the surgeon wanting to take extra precautions.

I knew a male client in their 20s who has a tendency to be very gropy with females (part of the reason why I had been assigned to work with him).

Is it something he's brought up in conversation?  If so, offering him help would be totally acceptable.  But if it's just an assumption you've made about what's losing him the jobs, perhaps less so.  

Speaking personally, I've had similar mannerisms when feeling any strong emotion (excitement, fear, whatever) since I was a child (nothing hand related, but OMG the rocking!), and tried dozens and dozens of things to stop it when I was a teenager.  Absolutely nothing worked.  Not even a little.  At this point, if someone told me they knew I had mannerisms, I'd just nod and move on. I've totally given up on getting rid of them completely.  These days, I just try to mitigate the problem: pull in close if I'm sitting at a desk so the desk will stop me from rocking, try and lean against something if I'm standing up, try not to experience strong emotions in public (mindfulness to calm myself before an interview or similar stressful situation often helps), etc.  At least as I've aged, I've noticed the emotion that triggers it needs to be much stronger now than it did when I was a teenager.  

So I wouldn't be surprised if your friend just isn't doing anything about his mannerisms because he doesn't believe anything can be done.  Then again, if you offer training, I wouldn't think he'd be offended. But he may well brush off anything you offer with ""tried that already.""  ",,,2,0,0,

It's a fantastic tool that i'd really recommend using for things like the concert and regular ole everyday life. But that being said here are some drawbacks to the cane that i've encountered that you might want to mentally prepare for-

1 If you are high partial, when it comes to interacting with strangers you're kind of in a lose-lose situation. If you don't use it you're at risk of tripping, looking lazy/rude, and sacrificing independence. If you do use it, some asshats will think that you're faking (yes, this actually happens)

2. Some people will underestimate your capabilities. God forbid you atand alone in one spot for a couple of minutes, some people will treat you like a lost toddler. These people are usually well intentioned and sometimes very helpful, but you just kind of have to get used to it. 

Here are some ways to combat these issues- Look and act like you're doing everything intentionally. When you ask for help, try to appear to have an ""objective"" (if that makes any sense). Sure, some people might not understand your exact needs or your level of vision, but they'll tend to treat you how you treat you. So, if you use your cane with confidence, people will usually treat you with the same resoect that they'd treat other peopls and they'll normally be pretty darn helpful when you need assistance. 

I was a tour guide for my school over the summer, and i surprisingly had very little issues with the students that i dealt with. Sure, some of them didn't get that i can't see clearly, but when the students did get it, they were very respectful and understanding. 

Another thing that's helpful is to have ""elevator-pitch-like"" responses planned for questions that the sighted folk might ask like ""why are you using a cane?"" Or ""how much can you see?"" Etc. When in doubt, usually a ""i'm partially blind and this lets people know that i can't see clearly"" is more than enough. And remember, you don't have to tell people anything you don't feel comfortable sharing like you medical history. You can always decline to answer people who start to pry. 

As far as your mom goes- its just something that she'll have to get used to. There's nothing wrong with being visually impaired and there's nothing wring with using a cane, so she's going to have to learn to be comfortable with you using it. Perhaps try introducing her to some positive representations for VI peeps online like molly burke's videos. My dad used to feel so uncomfortable talking about anything VI related, but he's slowly but surely coming around. Persistance and patience is key. Hopefully your mom will come to appreciate the cane someday.

Depending on where you live, your medical plan should cover for that. In Canada, OHIP covers the cost to see an eye doctor every year if you have an eye condition.

Do they know the underlying cause? Optic atrophy can be caused be a number of issues, and those can cause other issues over time. It would be good to see the doctor to monitor to make sure there are no changes, because sometimes those changes may not be very noticable.

Also, depending on your age and other health considerations, you may want to see your eye doctor more often. Just because someone has one eye condition, doesn't mean they can't get other conditions as well (for example, the drops for glaucoma sometimes causes cataracts, and macular degneration happens to many people as they get older).

Generally speaking, once a year should be good, unless your doctor suggests otherwise. Or if you have a sudden change in your vision, you should see them ASAP. ",,,2,0,0,

It folds into 7 sections so it can be pocketed or put in your bag. Shoulder-high should be more than enough if you are sometimes using it for a little mobility, and sometimes just using it as an ID (although you will probably develop a personal preference as you learn to use a cane and get training.) The NFB folding cane is also good, but only offers the NFB metal tip, and takes up a little more space. That way you have the option to pull out the cane when you want to use it. Eventually you might decide to go for a full mobility cane regularly and might want something sturdier than the slimline, but it's a good choice for on and off use. I would personally skip the pure ID canes (that have no handle and no mobility tip) as they are far less useful (and harder for sighted people to identify when they are very short and not being used in the expected way) but not much more portable anyways. 

Disney and concerts are excellent examples of places where a cane as ID is very helpful. Big crowds, visibility can be challenging, unfamiliar environment, and so on. You can avoid a lot of accidents and mishaps by using a cane in situations like that. 

Using a cane in front of people for the first time is definitely scary. There's not a lot I can tell you except that it gets easier with practice and as you gain confidence. You might tell the friend you're going to the concert with that you're concerned about how well you'll be able to see there, for example, and ""want to see if the cane will help."" 

As far as your mom goes, that's tough. It sucks to be told things like ""you don't really need that thing"" and it's SO common when you are on the high partial end of blindness. The suggestion of having your TVI talk with her is a great example, as is talking to her about the sorts of issues you're having compared to your friends who use mobility canes. If she's not willing to budge, you might just have to not use it around her and secretly use it the rest of the time until it's time for college. 

Try to get training! Sit on vocational rehab until they get you an o&amp;m instructor. Call and send letters regularly. See if your local or state NFB or ACB can help you kick rehab into action. Aside from local o&amp;m training, you can also look at getting funding for some of the great summer training programs that exist for highschoolers or those about to enter college, like the one at the Colorado Center for the Blind. https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr15/issue1/f1501tc2.html is an excellent introduction to the ideas of cane travel, but does not come close to competent in-person instruction which you absolutely should receive.

3. Will they be making a printer that the blind can use? i know they will be making a 4000 dolllar printer, but will we be able to use it?

The reason braille is used is because it is quick to read, once you get used to it, and it is small so can fit onto a bottle or box or sign. I don't know how big eatch letter is but will they be able to fit onto these types of items.

5a72deae-105e-43e3-8e70-d5a1765ea7b6,1505410391,"&gt; its just that I was born with rop and from all my research and consultation with doctors I've learned that having cataract surgery could cause retinal tearing/detachment. Its a difficult choice to make. Go blind slowly or possibly go blind quickly. Its scary.

I went through this exact same thing when I was 34; ROP, only one eye, cataract getting worse, slowly losing what was left of my vision from it, and yes, it was terrifying.  I put it off as long as possible in case things did take a turn for the worse. 

In the end, everything worked out OK. I had to have an anterior capsulotomy about 8mo post-op because some of the anterior capsule tissue tried to regrow (can happen when you get cataract surgery at a young age) and about 2 years later, a posterior capsulotomy due to posterior capsule opacification, but I've had no retina issues as a result of any of that, thankfully (almost 40 now).

That said, I don't regret waiting, because if I had lost my vision at that point, well, at least I'd had some for a few months longer than I otherwise would have and I'd gotten used to having basically no functional vision by the time I had the surgery so the adjustment might have been easier?

You can't put it off _too_ long, though, because as the cataract gets worse it gets more difficult to operate on, which can increase the risk of complications even more.

My recommendation would be to find the best cataract surgeon you can find and talk to them about it. You have to find the balance between ""waiting in case I go blind"" and ""have the surgery before the risks of complications increase even more.""

My cataract surgeon and my retinologist coordinated on all of my pre-screenings and follow-up. Also, mine was done under general anesthesia, due to the increased risk and the surgeon wanting to take extra precautions.

It also  worries me a little that there doesn't seem to be any blind people featured on their development team. There is a clear difference in philosophy between products designed by/with the blind, as compared to those designed for us.

I think this is what I do.  For example, I couldn't date a smoker.  Just the thought of kissing someone who smokes grosses me out. They could be the nicest person in the world, with every other quality I look for in a life partner. But the smell of smoke on there clothes, belongings, breath, etc, would just put me completely off.  

I also find myself frequently judging people by what accent they have, how there voice sounds, and how they speak.  Based on how you sound, I'll make assumptions about your skin colour, ethnicity, intelligence level, gender, sexual orientation, and more.  And these judgements are frequently wrong.  When I was younger, I didn't realize just how wrong I could be, and made no effort not to make these judgements. It left me with a set of strange, slightly racist ideas about the world for a while.  I still find myself judging people this way, but at least these days I attach a mental ""first guess, probably wrong"" disclaimer to the labels I assign people.  I have no idea how to actually stop judging people this way...it's a matter of reflex at this point.

The hamburger icon was something I was trying to avoid using at all costs. 

I like the skip-nav-links idea a lot, but what do you think about offering an alternative site with less links?

I could easily implement a site mirror that removes them all and put that as a hidden link that only screen readers can see.  I could then set it to the first item that loads so the reader would say something like ""Visually Impaired Friendly"" version or something along those lines. 

Once the person gets there how do you suggest they navigate?
Would Back and Next buttons work well or would a search box be sufficient?

I plan on coding this out and then using it as a template for quite a few sites, so hopefully some of the stuff I build can help others to make sites more accessible as well.  A lot of this will become PHP templates that are generated by a python script, so the more I know to add, the better I can make this.  I don't want a heavy site, I want it to be very easy to navigate and very simple.

How do ads affect the browsing experience?  I plan on using affiliate links for revenue (you can buy something on Amazon, then I get a cut for example).  On the visual side, I have the section colored slightly golden and moved off in a column on the right of the article content so it's obvious these are ads.

What's the least frustrating way to handle this?  Should I implement a ""skip ads"" button that takes the reader to the article like you suggest with the skip-nav-links idea?

Again, thanks for your answers.  I asked you folks a while back about this sort of thing and it helped me talk my boss at work into making sure all of our product information online was accessible, so these comments really do make a difference!

I may move into video content.  Have you any suggestions on sites I could read about that describe how to properly annotate video?

Other than that, the only generic advice I can think of is to make sure to verbally say the total at checkout, if a signature is needed offer help finding the line and ask how to point it out if they say yes, and identify cash bills quietly as you hand them back so they can be sorted right. 

In terms of trouble finding the credit reader, a verbal description is usually fine if it's a fixed system. ""about 8 inches ahead of your right hand at 2o'clock."" If it's movable like those little corded readers, might just be easier to put it right ahead of their hand and let them know. If someone needs more help beyond that point they'll probably ask.

I am 28 and have had vision loss since birth and was unable to read at 18, I came from a small town where I was called lazy because I was so slow writing notes/reading out loud. The rods and cones are killing each other and am currently 2% central vision and 20% peripheral left. My mother was always scared to get in depth of what was going on, instead I had things to do like everyone else. At age 7 I had to get cataract surgery on both eyes and even then I still had chores. She wasn't a hard ass and would give me passes if I really had issues or if it was unsafe. I am not sure of your parents thoughts but have you ever considered they were fearful/depressed they couldn't help? I had to tell my mother to stop wishing she could trade me eyes or I wouldn't give her updates. You stated when you confronted them they said nothing? It sounds like thay were fearful. Life goes on and you can still do many things!

I also reject the assertion that audio books are going to completely surplant physical books. Current evidence does not support that theory, rather it shows that audio book consumption has grown while physical book consumption has also grown, just at a slower pace (I could be mistaken, but this was the case last I knew).

ID cane. Yes. Wherever and whenever you think you need it, having a cane is a good idea. NFB canes can be in the way, but they get the message out that you do not see the world the same way as other people. Your teachers and classmates will get used to it. If you explain it to them in a simple way, they will accept it. Say something like ""it helps me when it's dark"" or ""it lets other people/drivers know to have patience with me."" 

As for your mom, this is where things get tricky. A lot of times, parents have a lot of guilt about their children's visual impairment. It's not her fault, but she's going to feel like it is. And every time the cane comes out, it's a symbol of her guilt. She is going to have a more difficult time adjusting to it than your friends. Try to explain all the benefits of the cane and have a real discussion about it. Your TVI can probably help you out there too. 

If the NFB cane is too bulky, ambutech and Advantage canes carry ID canes as well that fold to about 12 inches and are super light weight. 

Best of luck. ",,,2,0,0,

Chris Park recently came out with a new set of NFB canes that have a nice form factor and rubber joint protectors, but the grip is over an inch shorter than previous models which sucks for those of us with large hands. Would love to be able to easily swap or customize grips for comfort and easier manipulation. 

2. No more than $70.

3. Both senses are important when using a cane. Hearing the tip is needed for spatial perception and echolocation, and of course feeling the ground surface through the cane is paramount. I don't use canes or tips that sacrifice one over the other, and always look for canes that are equal with tip loudness and sensitiity. 

4. Crowded situations can make cane use difficult, but it is necessary to be able to quickly and visually show others around you that you are blind. Folding canes are my preference when going out and about, as stowing it is much easier than a rigid cane on public transport or in a car, along with ease of storage when sitting or at an event. 

5. No real anxiety with my cane use. Worrying about it breaking when out and about is always a concern, as sometimes the material flexes quite a bit when getting the cane stuck in an obstacle while walking at speed. I've had a car run over my cane when it moved while my cane was in the wheelwell; it shattered and I suddenly had no safe way to navigate around. Material strength is key while still making the cane light for ease of use.  ",,,2,0,0,

My preferred method is to not introduce my vision impairment. It's obvious I have vision impairment, if they want to know about it, they should ask. Of course most able bodied people are very nervous about making enquiries into a person's disability. This leads to Fun. Feel free to go ahead and ask them for any assistance you might need and so forth too. Don't explain why unless they ask, it'll spoil the Fun otherwise. (I suspect most on here would disapprove of this approach. I'm happy to elaborate more extensively why I'm fond of it though if you'd like to know more).

The other way is to state very promptly, ""my eyes are shot so..."". The ""so..."" part is where you follow up with something like ""so when I ask for some information from [somewhere], you need to read it to me"", or ""so I might find it difficult to do [thing you've assembled to do] in these conditions"". The most recent example I have is session zero for a new D&amp;D group where I set out that when I ask for some information on say a spell etc, I need them to read it from the Player's Handbook for me (I'm not incapable of doing it myself, it's just harder and more time consuming, so better they do it).

For alt text, try to think about the function of the entity, not a literal description of its look or position. It doesn't really matter that it's a big bold banner or whatever, just make the alt text the name of the site and tagline, or text like ""Welcome to Widgets Incorproated."" That's the function of the banner, to welcome people to the site and to tell them the name of the site or organization.

You don't need alt text for links. The link text is generally fine for blind as well as sighted users. If you're talking about buttons, then yes, you need alt text. For example, the hamburger icon often found on responsive sites (three horizontal lines stacked on top of one another) needs to be labelled something like ""navigation menu"" or ""open navigation menu.""

You may want to include a ""skip navigation"" link on your site, as per this site: http://a11yproject.com/posts/skip-nav-links/

The most commonly used screen readers are JAWS and NVDA on Windows and Voiceover on iOS. The blind tend to use Windows for the desktop and IPhones for their mobile device, though of course that's not universal. If your site works well with NVDA and Voiceover you're good. If you don't have an iPHone, I'd test with NVDA, as JAWS is incredibly expensive.

Finally, you can absolutely use Bootstrap to create an accessible site. Though coding sites from scratch can be quite rewarding.

I don't pretend to have my shit completely together but I know this at least. Some people are really weird about touching, folks.

There are many reasons, some silly, they just don't like it (which is perfectly valid, and should still be respected), right up to they've had bad things happen (I' being euphemistic here on purpose) to them and it makes the m remember such things (not a great feeling, I imagine).

On the subject of bad touch:

I've had someone just randomly decide I needed help across the street. I had heard the signal go off, and was making my way across fine, and then this person just grabs me out of nowhere and ""helps"" me out. I knew what they were trying to do, and I knew they meant well, but sweet Jesus it creeped me out. 


I still have some degree of useful vision (I'm legally blind, but I have enough to generally be able to have at least some idea where I'm going, though it's often the case that I have close calls in terms of collisions at times.


Anyway, in the sighted world, touch is a much, much more personal thing. It's in many ways an intimate act, especially anywhere other than the arms (the back is usually also at least somewhat okay, but don't go below the waist. On women, the front of the torso is definitely a nope. It's kinda weird with guys as well, soo probably best to just avoid this.Another one that's also forgotten... hair is actually really personal for some as well. In fact, best to avoid the face too. It's generally considered a pretty intimate place to touch. Ditto below the waist and to the knees. Below the knees are a little less so, but it's still kinda odd. With a friend or someone you know though, feet are usually okay, if, again, rather weird, at least in Western cultures.The feet are actually considered impure by many middle eastern, and eastern cultures, so that's worth being aware of. So if you have reason to suspect somebody is from there, or part of Africa, it's best not to touch the feet, as it can be an unholy act in many religions and can cause much offense.",,,2,0,0,

I can imagine almost everything without sight since I'm legally blind without my glasses and not being able to see EVER is something I find myself thinking about a lot, but like, how do you know if somebody is fat or not if you can't see them? How do you know if they shave, or if they have weird growths or something? I imagine that texture has to be huge but you can't predict texture if you can't see it so how do you know what texture somebody's skin is gonna be? If they are super wrinkled or whatever.

I think this is going to be similar then.

It can also be disruptive as well. For example, I don't see any issues using echolocation at home to get around.... but what about during a meeting at the office? Or during a class? 

Echolocation is a useful tool, but one major drawback is reliablility.  If the tool you use cannot consistently keep you safe, then that is a big issue. All you need is one major misstep that can lead to disastrous consequences. In the case of echolocation, it is the ability to detect drops offs (specifically, things such as holes or unexpected rises in the ground). Echolocation has never consistently been able to locate something that low (and according to studies, height differences as little as 3 mm are enough to trip many people). Not only that, but many times, drop-offs have hazards on the other side (traffic, stairs, etc). A white cane provides a much more definite tactile sensation when it locates a drof-off.

There are two versions of echolocation, active and passive. Active is the one you are thinking of, where you create a noise and listen to the echo. Passive is listening to the ambient noise reflecting off the walls to get a sense of your surroundings. During regular O&amp;M training, we normally teach how to use the passive version (although we don't call it echolocation, we usually just say listening to sound cues and such). 

There have been a number of tools that were created that use echolocation to help people, but the vast majority ended up failling. The Mowat sensor and the Russell Pathsounder were some of the first, which were handheld devices that sent out an ultrasonic signal, and would indicate distance via vibrations (Pathsounder had sound as well). More recently, there was the K Sonar and Ultracane, which is much the same thing but attached to a white cane. 

https://www.engadget.com/2005/04/07/bat-k-sonar-cane/

https://www.ultracane.com/

I've used the Ultracane before, and it is pretty useful, but the cost makes it very difficult to get. And in those cases, the device itself is using echolocation and interpreting the results. 

In a non-cane form, there are iGlasses (https://ambutech.com/shop-online/iglasses%E2%84%A2-ultrasonic-mobility-aid) which is the same set-up but in glasses.

my back recovered pretty well and the only thing i can't do now is manual labor jobs, but my girlfriend, who i met a few years after injuring my back, also just used to complain about my injury and tell me that women told her she shouldn't date a man with a back injury. she used to tell me that i wouldn't be a good father, and that it held her back in life because she didn't think i could travel the world with her because i had the injury. even though my injury was mostly healed at that point besides not being able to stand for more than four hours or so, or lift heavy things.

A refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electro-mechanical device for displaying braille characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface. Blind computer users who cannot use a computer monitor can use it to read text output. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the same task, and a blind user may switch between the two systems or use both at the same time depending on circumstances. Deafblind computer users may also use refreshable braille displays.

* My vision's the same now as it's ever been, so why start using one at 38 yrs old? - Falling down and twisting an ankle is a lot worse to recover from at 38 than it was at 18!
* I'm not blind enough! - You only have one eye, poor visual acuity, and no peripheral vision in it.
* Most of the time I can see to get around alright. - Ok, so just use it for the times you can't. Just because you use a mobility cane it doesn't mean you have to use it 24/7.
* It feels like I'm admitting defeat and letting my blindness ""win."" - You wouldn't say that about someone using a wheelchair. You're not letting your blindness ""win"" anything. You're defeating it with a tool that lets you keep on doing the things you want to do.

In the end, not falling down is nice. Not getting stares and strange looks and feeling silently judged when I stumble, or when I have to ask someone for something that's obvious to a person with better vision, or when I'm standing 3in from a sign in order to read it is nice, too.",,,3,0,0,

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1505408258,"I have a slightly different perspective then those who have responded thus far. Normally I am very negative about wiz bang specialized hard ware that sighted people make for blind people; however, being able to identify people more easily would really be amazing for me.

I have a very terrible memory when it comes to people’s names. I have actually gotten to know people pretty well, spending a lot of time hanging out with them, while not being able to remember their name. This happened a lot in college; brief encounters were especially annoying, people would come up to me and greet me with my name, and I would not be able to respond with their name. Of course, sometimes I would simply ask them to remind me of their name, but you can only do that so many times. Places like churches are especially bad for me. I have gotten to know people well at churches that I have attended for years, seeing them every week, but not knowing their names. There are so many people that you meet all at once at a church, and it’s just so awkward to ask someone what their name is after you have known them for three months. 

Of course, my issue is not entirely realized to being blind. I was sighted for most of my life, and I had this problem to a lesser extent as a sighted person. Just because I was able to see people’s faces did not mean I was able to remember their names. What is more, my wife, who is also blind, has a much easier time with people’s names; she actually helps me a lot now. Never the less, blindness does make the problem harder for me. Without visual info, you just have less to help you remember names. 

With all of that said, I’m not sure how feasible this sunglasses idea would be. I would not wear anything that looked obvious, such as Google glass. Blind people are stared at enough without camera’s sticking out of our faces. Also, it seems like it would be pretty hard for a camera to randomly pick up someone’s face as they walked by. I do make some effort to try and make eye contact with people I hear walk by, but I do not do that with everyone, and the face is a pretty small target.

For me, I believe the only tech concept that could help would be voice based. I’m not sure if it’s even possible to have accurate voice id, but I think a phone app that could listen in real time and whisper someone’s name to me, through an earpiece, would be amazing. As people greet me in church, the app could id their voice, give me the name, and I could respond accordingly. As the app runs, it could flag voices that it does not yet know, and record the audio of these new voices, in order to later bring up a list of profiles for identification. That way, when someone introduces themselves to you, you could go back, find the flagged new voice, hear the recording of the person’s name, and enter it in your personal database. Once the app could id someone’s voice, there would be no point in it saving recordings of that person’s voice.

I’m sure this voice id concept is science fiction, and perhaps it would only fix an issue that is unique to me. However, I believe there are millions of people in the world, blind and sighted a like, who could benefit from an app that helps you remember names. Besides, I’m not much for sunglasses.

PS, I know you are looking at the issue from a hardware perspective and that my audio idea is a software  solution. Your project might be worth pursuing; I have heard a lot of school projects for ""helping the blind"" that have less utility then your idea. I would focus on making the product look as normal as possible. You might want to check out the Microsoft seeing AI app. It has a face ID mode, although I find all the other features of the app much more useful, and you have to teach the app each new face, which would be awkward to make all of your friends do.",,,1,0,0,

My issues at least on that front surround the obvious infidelity that I experienced in my ex's case but which seems to be rampant in my local community with other community members in particular.  I don't have an issue with people for whom monogamy isn't their thing, but sucking people in for whom it does matter such as myself, particularly right after we had moved in is a bit of an issue for me.

My other issue is older men preying on younger vulnerable women which I have seen a lot of (I am aware of at least 5 cases in my local community alone regarding the chapter president).  I'm sure it can also go the other way around.

That is one facet, the facet that caused me to leave my chapter and never to speak to them again.  But that does not preclude my main issue which is the fucking incessant, non-stop drama.  I heard stories about the new years party which I missed for fucking months and it was all such childish bullshit.  Texts and emails were flying at everyone and I was the second youngest member of the chapter next to my now ex.

A good percentage of blind people are unaffiliated to avoid this kind of toxicity, drama and dysfunction. It is certainly not NFB specific; we have heard much the same about ACB at various times. NFB does though seem to have a larger cadre of ""lifers"" who trudge on and tolerate or ignore the poisonous elements of their community. In doing so they are effectively enabling them. It is unbelievably unlikely that your ex is the chapter presidents only victim. If you know or suspect any of it was criminal you should at minimum encourage those affected to report it. Many blind people consider the political/advocacy organizations to be their safest community and it is sad that this is frequently false. For lack of any other social connections or community they cling to them in spite of the frequently horrible behaviour going on.

It is important that everyone have peers that share similar life experiences. It is better if you are able to choose those peers from the entire blind population. Not every blind person is your peer; you should still be selective and use good judgement about who you want to be around, who makes you happy, and who makes you a better person. There are good blind people out there! To be a whole person you are going to have to also find peers outside of the blindness community among professionals and the legal community you are planning to join. You may want to look for mentors and peers from organizations like the disability bar association.

I prefer the ability to switch quickly and have the command as close to the video card as possible, so that it will work in all applications and menus universally.  The iPhone invert does this pretty well, there's nothing it doesnn't invert and it's quick to switch between them. The only annoying part is that I also want to switch between voiceover and no voiceover, but if you add that to the triple tap you get a menu popup which is really slow and fiddly. So I kind of have to choose between voiceovering and inverting.

I was just told a couple of days ago that due to my extreme near-sightedness, I have a chance of retinal tears or holes and that I've been doing poorly in my visual field tests and that I may get glaucoma and I anticipate eventually becoming blind. I am currently applying for a Master's and plan to eventually do a PhD in Neuroscience and one of the first thoughts was whether I could ever be a researcher and whether all this effort was then worth it. I decided to search for any blind scientists and Peter Torpey came up. Here's one link about him: http://www.afb.org/info/mentees/scientist-mentor-mentee-profile/45
I was also shocked to find out that there are blind photographers, one of them being Pete Eckert. It really does take creativity to overcome what seems at first to be a limitation.

c4f82a04-745f-4b72-b4ac-42a7c56532cb,1504671744,"I used an identification cane in uni, but I eventually stopped because I felt awkward about having a cane out (even if it wasn't overly functional) and still always using sight. Only in the past few years have I started using a full length cane and I wish I'd done so sooner and hadn't been so iffy about it. One of the guys I play cricket with is the same too. He held off even longer, but as soon as he could lay his pride to rest, he was so pleased.

A cane makes your life much easier. Don't worry about what others think, go for it.

As for telling others about your cane beforehand, why? Say you had a friend that always rode a bike to your house, then one day they drive a car around instead. They provide no heads up they now drive a car. How would you respond? Would you care? Personally I like to just show up to things. Say it's a totally new group of people (e.g. meetup, job interview) I give no forewarning. I then proceed like there is no cane. Like I'm completely sighted (even though clearly I'm not). If necessary, I'll ask for assistance or point out a difficulty doing something. I never act like it's out the ordinary from anything any reasonable person would do.

For example, I've been to a couple of meetups past few weeks. Rocked up to a pub, bloke on the street helped me with the door (it was after dark), got the staff to help me find the group. Then I interact like any other normal human being. We shifted spots, and I ask the bloke I'm talking to to lend me his shoulder. 

At another meetup, a boardgames night, I was somewhat anxious about lighting, but whatever. First to arrive, few others come, just general conversation host asks me about my condition (turns out Glaucoma is a Thing in his family). Lighting was pretty bad for me, but the host marked his components for The Resistance with sticky tape so it was easier for me without me even asking. Later he had a table lamp I could use to help me with some other games. 

So some people will seek to help you without prompting, but they won't if they don't know, so bring the cane. And other times you just ask and you receive, in which cases the cane does all the explaining.

Regarding the rock show: I saw Anti-Falg last year and I had my cane (also the only bloke in a suit. I'm so much more non-conforming than the rest of the crowd!). That bloke I mentioned before I play cricket with? He went and saw Alestorm last year and he had his cane then. There really is no reason not to have it with you everywhere. 

It does sound like you need something of a more appropriate size though. My understanding is full length canes should come up to your sternum. Other sorts of canes are more compact (and less durable) though. Such canes are likely to be more suitable for you anyway because it's not critical to your mobility.

As for your mum, you're suggesting she would physically prevent you from taking a cane when you leave the house? That's really not on, frankly. Sounds like she's got an issue with people with disability, so you'll have to work to set her straight and that won't be easy, but she'll have to come to terms with it.

Best of luck and enjoy the show and your trip!",,,1,0,0,

With vision loss, people often go through the 5 stages of grief. They may even go through it more than once, as they come to accept low vision and then lose more.

Statistically, people are actually more afraid to go blind than to die. A good deal of that is because of the fear of the unknown, and not knowing what they will do with their lives. Support from family and friends helps a great deal with someone getting through this. 

One thing they should definitely consider is getting training for their vision loss now. It isn't the optimal time (especially if they haven't accepted it yet), but the earlier the training, the better.

Depending on where you live (country and state), there are different agencies to help. Ask your doctor to make a referral to one of those agencies, although sometimes they can also self-refer (although many will also require an eye report). 

Orientation and Mobility training (O&amp;M) is learning how to get around safely. Indoors, outdoors, and eventually using public transit (and guide dogs if that is their interest). That is a fairly important skill, as everyone has to travel at some point in time, even if it is just going from the bedroom to the bathroom.

Independent Living Skills (ILS) is learning more day to day living stuff (although that one has different names, depending on where you are from). That can include things like cooking, cleaning, money ID, getting dressed, and even Braille if they are interested. Also rather important, as these are things people do on a day by day basis.

In terms of technology, there is a lot nowadays to make things more accessible. Does your SO use an iPhone? If they do, it already has the acessibility technology built in. Search for how to active VoiceOver and watch some videos on YouTube to get the basics.

If you have any other questions, feel free to post on here or you can message me directly. 

EDIT: One important thing I forgot to mention.... they may feel their life is over and they are useless, because they need to ask for help for simple tasks. That is very common, especially early in the process when they haven't gotten any training yet on how to do things with vision loss. Assure them that they can learn new skills and continue living their life. I always tell my clients that they can still often do what they used to do, it's just learning how to do it differently. A few years ago, my coworkers went with a group of young adults and did a Obstacle Course Race with them to show them (and others) that vision loss isn't necessarily a barrier to doing things.

13ff2ddd-a7cd-42ec-a7a7-07a7eff76eb5,1505232197,"I have a congenital glaucoma and lost vision in my left eye when I was 4.  When I was 12 I was told that by my early 20s I would go blind, but since my vision lasted longer than that I just assumed that it would last forever.  At 29 I started losing contrast perception and the pressure in my right eye started to increase, so I had surgery to implant a glaucoma valve which solved the problem and allowed me to get rid of medication  for a while.  Unfortunately pressure in my eye started to build up again so I had to resume taking medication and ultimately having a laser surgery which reduced my eye pressure but not enough to avoid optic nerve damage, so I ended up going  fully blind.

Being blind ended up proving much harder than I expected.  I placed a lot of hope in the rehabilitation process but in the end found out that the way to go is to be adventurous and willing to get out of my comfort zone a lot, which I hate, so I avoid all the tasks that make me feel uncomfortable, which leaves me with nothing to do all day.  Even coding, which used to be my main form of entertainment, feels extremely uncomfortable due to the way I have to use computers now, so I don't do it anymore.",,,2,0,0,

Not quite. They don't replace words they are distinct natural languages that evolved with similar mechanisms as spoken languages. They even have language families. The biggest is French Sign which includes languages such as American Sign Language.

The grammar is different from spoken languages as signed languages present different opportunities. For instance spoken languages are strictly linear, one word after the others but you have two hands and your face is often part of signs too so sign languages can differ there.

There are also tactile signed languages for the deaf-blind.",,,3,0,0,

I had some random thoughts about using animatronics to safely teach echolocation and wanted to verify some details (like how small are the objects you can see, does it work indoors etc) to see if it could be viable or even already in use. I had no idea echolocation is controversial.

Anyway, thanks for the link, I'll send Daniel an email and he should be able to answer my echolocation specific questions.

If possible I'd like some more feedback, now that I do know the topic is controversial, particularly why people think it *doesn't* work (I doubt Daniel will be very helpful with that). 

&gt;it's perceived by the sighted as being antisocial, unsafe, or too complicated to teach and learn.

I hope you are wrong on the antisocial remark (and even if it's true, I'm just going to dismiss that out of hand, that's not something I can address). 

Does anyone know why it's unsafe? Is it unreliable under some circumstances? Is the distance you can see with it too short for practical use or inferior to other methods?

Regarding complicated to teach/learn, I'm pretty sure that if you take a four year old of normal intelligence, you should be able to teach them something like this, considering the immense plasticity of the human brain. I don't care if it's hard to teach, that's simply something that can be solved through experimentation and research. Anything specific that makes it hard to teach/learn?

Is there only a very small subset of blind people that have the ability to do this? I already rely to some degree on using the bounce back of sounds to orientate myself in some circumstances, that almost has to be common, but maybe its usability is capped and only a very small group of people can improve past that?

I don't know what you are going through, and my opinion is only my opinion with no real experience to back it up.  With that being said, 
1. I try hard to think about what it might be like to be like you every day.  I don't think blindness should define what people do,  the limits people place on themselves,  or how society treats you.  Unfortunately blindness puts up barriers everywhere in society because many people aren't informed.  Like it or not,  you are now an ambassador for people like you everywhere.  You may be the first person with a visual impairment that someone ever meets, so make sure you leave an impression! 
2. Blindness is not a death sentence.  It might feel like it now,  but when you are ready, try to push yourself to do things you thought you couldn't do.  You are and will be capable of a lot!
3. Technology needs to become your best friend.  If you don't have an iPhone, get one and learn how to use Voiceover and the magnifier.  These things are difficult and confusing at first,  but will be amazing aids in the future.  Additional products like screen magnifiers, screen readers,  canes,  optical character recognition,  GPS devices etc. Will have a major impact on you as well.  Learn to use the computer without sight using shortcut keys.  You will be better for it!
4. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't a great mom.  That little one needs you to be strong and to be an excellent role model.  Be there!
5. I have a student with your same condition and he's on the struggle bus too... major depression and identity issues. I hope I can help give him the skills he needs to be successful.  Find someone like that in your life.  If you can't find  someone, message me.  You can do this.  You need to know that you can do this. ",,,4,0,0,
