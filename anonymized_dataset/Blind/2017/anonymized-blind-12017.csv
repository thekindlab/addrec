Physical hobbies:
Bowling, Beeper Baseball, Goal Ball, Tandem Cycling, Hiking, Swimming, running, wrestling, even archery. 

Not-so physical hobbies
Playing instruments, listening to music, gaming, reading/listening to books, writing, sculpture, soap making, photography, competing for points in social media sights like Reddit :-). 

In short, virtually any hobby that a sighted person enjoys can be enjoyed by a blind person with a few exceptions: racing cars, and piloting aircraft being the only two that come to mind at present.

As a gay man who lives in a small town in the Scottish Borders. It is difficult to date whilst blind. There are other factors involved. The gay scene is more geared towards a younger age group. Plus there are no gay places close by. This also limits my options. Edinburgh would be the nearest gay scene and that is around 40 miles away. When in gay spaces it's all about the eye contact therefore I am at a disadvantage. 
Online dating is another ball game. In my profiles on gay sites I put in my profile that I am blind and get very little response.

I did have to put in my profile that I can manage fine and don't need anyone to look after me or need assistance as I was getting asked that question a lot.

Snow and ice isn't something I really have experience with, but it also isn't a huge problem where I am, but grass and other smooth surfaces.. Yeah, point taken, I two-point touch is definitely something I should still make sure I'm proficient at.

Might help a bit here that I do have some vision, so tripping folks up is something I can see to avoid, but I'm probably not caning properly in those situations, simply to avoid tripping people. 

As for someone to practice with, yeah, both my husband and daughter are pretty awesome at making sure I don't accidentally kill myself walking and would gladly do it. Honestly, it's my own reservations that prevent me from practicing more than I do. I'm still in the phase of feeling self-conscious about it (which is dumb, I know).

I was born 2mo premature and developed severe ROP. I've been completely blind in my left eye since birth (had it removed when I was 17) and my vision in my right's extremely myopic; around 20/200, and I have a very narrow visual field. I also have severe nystagmus.

My ROP has been stable since birth, but I did develop angle closure glaucoma back in 2008 and had to have a surgical iridectomy for that after two failed laser iridotomies. This caused a small cataract I'd had since birth to start getting worse, and in December of 2011 I had cataract surgery, followed by an anterior capsulotomy in August 2012 (it started to re-grow!) and a posterior capsulotomy in November of 2015. Somewhere along the line in treating the cataracts and the glaucoma, I also developed posterior vitreous detachment, but it hasn't affected anything, just another tic mark on the list of things that already put me at a high risk of retina detachment. - So far, so good, though!

I wish my TVI had also been a kung-fu instructer. 

I wish my TVI had been able to give me more adaptive resources like sticker bumps or information on where to get them. 

I wish my school taught me not to put up with sighted peoples' bullshit, instead of accepting my place as a disabled, ""second-class"" citizen with special needs.

However, some people can have low vision, which means they still have poor vision but not necessarily legal blindness. The ""after correction"" part is important. People can have very poor vision, but if glasses correct most of it, then that doesn't really count (my own vision without glasses is Counting Fingers, or roughly 20/1600-20/2000, but with glasses, it is 20/25).

It is hard to tell what eye condition you may have with something like that. It potentially be a few things, you should ask your doctor more about that. The brain shutting off the right eye may be amblyopia, but you should check with your medical professionals.

There are three parts to your visual system. The eyeball, which recieves the light. The optic nerve, which transmits the information. And the brain, which processes the information. Damage to any of those systems can cause vision issues. From the description, it likely sounds like an issue with the eyeball, possibly some sort of retina degeneration. Also possibly cataracts. Once again, best to talk to your doctor.

First, I'll start off with the good stuff.  I loved all my TVIs, and had a strong, close relationship with each one.  While there were several TVIs working in that school system who weren't trained in Braille, I never worked with any of them.  In fact, I only learned about the problems with some TVIs because all blind/VI students got to attend a 2 night camp together every year, and so all the blind students in that school system got to know and work with each other quite well.  That yearly camp, even though it took us out of school for two days a year, was a hugely important experience for us students.  Swapping tips, information, experiences, and just plain old gossip meant a lot.  Even if it did sometimes result in the blind students banding together to try and get school board policies changed.  Also, when you're a teenager, knowing that you're not alone, and that there are other blind students having the same struggles you are is a huge comfort.  I made my best blind friends at that yearly camp, and still talk to some of them daily ten years later.  

Now I'll give some examples of the bad stuff.  Even though all of my TVIs were wonderful, there were problems that I don't think they had the power to change, and that left me with an overall negative impression of the mainstream educational experience.  First off, in Canada, French is a required class.  Unfortunately, my school had one French teacher for grades 5 to 8, and she was awful.  Once she actually said directly to me, in front of the entire class, ""You should be going to a school for the blind, so I don't have to deal with you.""  As far as I can recall, this was in response to my asking if a picture she was showing could be described.  Obviously, that teacher had absolutely zero interest in working with my TVI to make sure lessons were accessible, or that any of the material was in Braille.  My TVI did her best, but thanks, I believe, to a strong union, she didn't have the power to get teachers fired, or do much of anything other than complain ineffectively about how terrible my French teacher was. In fact, there was work to rule going on in the school system off and on during my time there, and the French teacher would actually complain about other teachers who took extra time to help me, for undermining the work to rule position.  I was eventually just exempted from the French requirement entirely, and allowed to graduate high school without it.  By the time I hit high school and got better teachers, I was so far behind from 4 years of bad instruction, that it was decided I couldn't catch up.  What could a TVI have done differently, here?  I really don't know.  But to this day, I don't speak a word of French.  

Another big problem I had was math.  I wanted to take computer science in university, and in order to do that, I needed to take advanced math in high school.  In this case, though, I actually liked my math teacher, and I really do think he did his best.  However, the advanced math curriculum he had to teach was just awful.  It focused heavily on graphing, visual learning, and use of the school supplied graphing calculators.  I was given an accessible graphing calculator, of course.  However, it worked in a completely different way from the ones the rest of the students were using, had some features they didn't have, and was missing some features they had.  My TVI hadn't taken advanced math during his school days, so was really at a loss helping me through the curriculum.  Also, neither me nor my TVI got any training on the accessible graphing calculator I was using, and had to figure out how I could draw graphs to complete the assignments that required them.  It got to the point where I was spending 3 or 4 hours a night on my math homework, plus daily meetings with my math teacher, just to try and figure out the point of the assignment, and then come up with some way I could complete it.  But I was passing the course!  The downside, of course, was that I was putting all of my time and energy exclusively into that class, and failing almost everything else.  It got to the point where I had no choice but to drop the advanced math.  I went on to attend university in journalism, largely because I had good English marks and enjoyed writing, rather than because I had any interest at all in Journalism.  Today I work with computers every day, and sure wish I had that comp-sci degree.  What could have been done differently here? I don't know.  Everyone did there best to help me, but the teachers don't get to change the curriculum, and didn't have the resources or training they'd have needed to make it easier for me.

I have a few tips for folk that like playing JRPG's or just RPG's in general.  These days quite a few games have very simple high contrast mini-maps.  So if you get stuck in an area you can just navigate with the mini-map.  

For example, Dragon Age II had a very simple mini-map that showed you where stairs and doors are, but it was not overly detailed, which made it very easy to play.  Also, the PC version allowed you to have your main character search for loot and items in their general vicinity by pressing r.

I see playing Pokemon is a common thing around these parts.  So, if you have low vision and you prefer high contrast text like white on black, I or, if you want to play Pokemon with Generation VI Pokemon in it on your PC with the GBA/BW era of gameplay, you should let me know.

I have found Pokemon games that have all the Pokemon from Gen I to VI that are in the GBA style and are very moddable, so you can change the menu colours and text box colours.  I have put a lot of work into modding my games and I can write easy to follow guides if anyone is interested. These are all PC games and do not require emulators or illegal ROMs either.  They are very large and expansive and are growing more popular by the day.  They are also free and fan made, but they stay true to the original stats and stuff. They are basically GBA games with slightly better graphics and more pokemon.  

What I really want in a video game discussion board is lists of games that are accessible in certain ways.  For example, games with high contrast maps/mini-maps, or games with block based movement like pokemon.  Even though I don't use that, I am sure a great deal of people would find it useful.

Audiobooks for anything you can find, Bookshare for anything there isn't an available audiobook (speak with your special ed case manager about Bookshare, it's a government program allowing you access to free audio and braille books). If there isn't a version out already, ask for everything you can in electronic format and use a screenreader like Jaws or NVDA, or if you're on Mac then VoiceOver. If it isn't available electronically, ask someone to read it to you. This will help reduce stress on your eyes but give you time to transition to braille, which is becoming less useful with time since we have all these great electronic resources for auditory learning.

Have you had a learning media assessment, also called LMA? It should most likely have been done when you qualified for special education services, and again if your vision changed significantly since then. It may list your primary learning media as auditory at this time, and if it does then that goes a long way toward getting the above accommodations officially listed on your IEP. Visual impairments are so uncommon that unless you're in a specialized program you're probably one of the only students with VI that your special ed teacher and case manager will ever have. Asking them about this is a great way to start self-advocating! You are in high school now and you have a right and responsibility to know what goes into your IEP, including the assessment that determined whether you'd be learning visually, nonvisually/braille, or aurally (if you're using a screen reader, that's a u aurally, not o r orally, aka learning by sound). Good luck and let me know if there's anything I can do to help! I'm a special ed teacher so I'm pretty knowledgeable about the system and your options.",,,2,0,0,
b573f939-c413-48e1-a92c-302fc5cd67b1,1483549219,"A softphone is basically an application that sits on your computer desktop and emulates a phone through the PC. So if you want to dial a number to ring out, you use the mouse to press the buttons on screen or you use your keyboards number pad. Incoming calls are presented on the screen and you interact with the call (Answer, put on hold, transfer, etc) via the screen, mostly using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. The audio is routed via the PC using the PC's sound card and a PC headset.

Examples of two of the best ones are [Zoiper](http://www.zoiper.com/en) and [Bria](http://www.counterpath.com/bria/).

The benefits of a softphone are that they are generally cheaper, are useful for saving space as extra wires and physical hardware is not needed and can be incorporated into other applications and user network rights.

The problem with softphones is that they present a level of abstraction from the phones functionality that while seemingly fine initially, gets annoying at times. I've never really met an office worker who was happy using one over a real desk phone.

Because the softphone has to be visible on the computer screen for the most part to be useful, it tends to take up valuable screen estate which some people find annoying as well.

I will give you an example. You get a call incoming so it appears on screen. You click to answer and it's someone who wants some information. You then have to hide the softphone to use the browser on your computer to look the information up so that involves a few clicks of the mouse to put the caller on hold, hide the softphone window, use the browser, click to bring the softphone back and unhold the call.

It's really hard to describe why using a softphone over a regular phone is a pain when your blustering around the office in the flow of work but it's very easy to appreciate in action. As I said, I've never met an office worker who preferred a softphone over a real phone. I've even had a few companies install them thinking they can keep their costs down and then have me come back a few months down the line and replace them with real phones.

The people who make the best use of softphones are call center workers who have limited interactivity with the phone and generally have a fixed platform of software on their computers.",,,1,0,0,

I am however not really sure what would be the best approach for a person who is completely blind. The problem with ground-fighting and using locks to pacify an attacker is that it it makes you defenceless against any other attacker. While you use hands and legs to control an attacker on the ground his friend is free to kick you in the face or use a weapon. 
Using these techniques were a big ""no-no"" in our training. 

I do think that a powerfull peberspray would be a useful tool. It takes the eyesight away from the opponent, but more importantly, if sprayed wildly in an arch would create a nasty ""buffer zone"" hopefully making most casual attackers decide that its more trouble than its worth.

It was embarrassing, but after trying out an ID cane for a week or two and noticing the immediate difference in the way I was able to get around areas when being guided, it open my mind a bit more to actually using the cane, especially when my vision failed me completely.

My cane now signifies independence, it is and immediate tool that I use as my eyes when navigating around. I don't personally think much needs to be changed about the canes; the materials available are strong and light, perhaps the grips could be looked at for ergonomic issues especially when dealing with long periods of use, The colors should not be changed as the color it self identifies exactly what the cane is being used for and keeps it as a high visibility tool when navigating at night, and all of the various materials for the tips that I have used have worked wonderfully well.

Rather than focusing on the canes, focus should be shifted to making sidewalks universal and even, making a concerted effort to fix them when they are broken or improperly designed, making sure major intersections have street crossing beacons, curb cuts having tactile mats, having tactile markers installed to help guide independent Cain Travellers through locations such as train stations or around buildings.

I'm mostly blind and am slowly losing more sight every day and I used to really enjoy sports. Because I'm going blind it is difficult for me to play most sports and impossible to be competitive with fully sighted people. One thing I have found that I enjoy and can feel like my sight is not holding me back too much is jiu jitsu. Obviously I struggle with takedowns and takedown defense but once me and my opponent are grappling, vision isn't very important, most of the information you get is the feel of your opponent and how they are moving. I feel like most physical combat that involves mostly grappling like jiu jitsu or wrestling is at least realistic for visually impaired and blind people. 

Again, I'm not fully blind yet and can't say for certain that I will be able to do jiu jitsu once I am, but my impression is that I will still be able to at least enjoy it.

So like I said, I can't answer your question directly and I know a grappling style of self defense means nothing if a person you can't see is coming at you with a weapon or even just a sucker punch but it's something.

Clear conveyance of information is what's important, not trying to expose how things look visually and how they are visually arranged in the context of the screen. This also would not work in conjunction with the screen reader considering that CSS will pull information out of order visually, and the screen reader would still be able to read everything in a linear fashion, even when text is off screen, thus making the haptic engine fight with what the screen reader is presenting making the whole experience very confusing.",,,1,0,0,

(Of course if you can get a Perkins brailler it also works for this, and is an excellent faster tool, but costly.)

But honestly if you are interested in becoming a braille reader, see if you can get your school, department of rehab, etc to spring for a braille display or braille notetaker for you. Being able to access books, online content, etc readily in braille makes it much more portable and practical to use.

The book will teach you grade 1 and grade 2 american braille, so there are some additional things you would have to unlearn (or relearn) with UEB but not a lot. (And a lot of existing braille material out there is still grade 2.)

http://accessible.uebonline.org/ is a great resource for learning UEB. It starts with the alphabet and works you up from there.

I consider myself a pretty hardcore gamer and believe I am quite good at playing them, even compared to people with normal sight. As long as the games arent too bright and text is light on a dark background I can manage quite well. Also text shouldnt be too small ofcourse. Actually, I prefer games where text isnt a very important part of the gameplay.

The games I mostly play are racing sims and challenging action RPGs like Bloodborne, Dark Souls. In almost every proper racing game there is a driving line that can be a helpful tool to fall back on. 

Games I have the most trouble with are first person shooters and sports games where you have to follow a ball and at the same time look for open teammates like FIFA, NBA, etc. 

Workarounds that work for me are having good (positional) audio feedback from a good surround system or headset. Makes all the difference. 

Changing TV/display options/colors helps alot too. Turning off some graphical eyecandy is also pretty useful sometimes. I mean... Those sunflares look nice and all but they're no good if I have to pause the game until the blinding effect wears off.

Then there's the obvious ingame tricks too: Having headlights on in cars, night vision goggles in military games, torches in the left hand in dungeons etc.

Now obviously I'm not blind and can still play atleast some games without too much of a problem. Maybe that's my most important tip: Find out what kind of games work for you. Don't play games you can't play. It will only make you feel miserable, whereas games should be fun!

The main reason I upgraded was because I saw the Apex as a dead-end since it was running a 15-year-old operating system and wasn't going to be updated. I was getting frustrated with the unit locking up while I was writing a document and with it not being able to open many PDF and ePub files. The Touch has a lot of issues and is underwhelming in some areas but what it is able to do is pretty impressive. I would consider it to be the first true Braille tablet for the blind with a notetaker built on top of it. The notetaking functions work pretty well although the device is very slow. I mostly use it for taking notes, reading books, browsing the web and checking email. Having an Android foundation allows it to work with modern technology such as supporting most common types of email accounts, syncing calendar and contacts in the cloud and being able to use most accessible modern websites with Firefox 47. These were things that I pretty much couldn't do with the Apex anymore or stopped doing because it was impractical using the older technology and OS. I pretty much stopped using the Apex on the Internet altogether because it was so limited in what it could do. Because they rewrote KeySoft for the Touch and ported it to Android, some of their apps are missing features or have bugs in them. Also a lot of people have had hardware issues and have had to send their units in multiple times, sometimes twice in the same week. I've had to reset the device several times and I had to get the internal storage replaced because it got corrupted during a software upgrade. TouchBraille works pretty well but it has its challenges of typing on a glass screen. Braille input and output otherwise is the high quality that you come to expect from HumanWare. It is great to be able to use first-letter navigation anywhere within the system to quickly jump to a desired item. Third-party app support works pretty well for some apps but I suspect not as well as they had hoped. As I mentioned before, the Touch is very slow and sometimes focus jumps around in third-party apps and it can be difficult to navigate apps using Braille instead of the touchscreen. Also in most cases third-party apps containing web views don't work very well on the Touch because it is running Android 4.4. I think the older version of Android and hardware are a concern for long-term viability. I would say that if you don't depend on the device and intend to use it primarily for reading, writing and math it will get the job done in most cases. There are new devices coming on the market this year including the Blitab, NeoBraille and ElBraille so you might want to see if another company comes out with a better solution. Also HIMS has a session at CSUN this year announcing a notetaker that provides access to mainstream apps so it will be interesting to see what they release and if they do anything better than HumanWare.",,,3,0,0,

Phantom Touch!

Make sure your audience of one feels confident you are alone or  at least 20 feet or more away from other people

Ask them to close eyelids

Touch eyelids gently on a slow three count with pointer fingers of both hands for about three seconds

Ask them to touch your hands and make the hands feel and squeeze the tips of your fingers

Ask if they felt being tapped or anything strange anywhere else on their body. 

Do it again same way ask them to just squeeze your finger tips after you touch their eyelids

Ask them if the felt anything else

Ask to try one more time

This time use one hand to gently touch the eyelids with your pinkie and pointer finger making the contact and allowing them to just touch the finger tips 

Your free hand can now graze the ear or hair or tap the shoulder. 

You can keep this up for a while as long as you don't touch the nose with the other fingers or let them touch more of than your finger tips

Attribute it to psychic energy or  whatever

On sighted people you don't even need them to touch your fingers for the reaction just quickly return your hands to both finger tips pointing at the eyes after the phantom touch is done

Just realized that a blind person could do this to a sighted person very well with a little practice. 

Never tested it on a blind person to be honest though.

Staying positive can be tough. So many elements of a young person's social life unfold in dim places: bars, concerts, restaurants. I miss out on a lot, so my best tip for staying positive is to live near your loved ones, and live where you can WALK everywhere. Otherwise, you may spend many nights stuck in your home. Big cities are better (light pollution and public transportation infrastructure). 

Also, keep a pulse on ongoing RP research and potential treatments. There are many reasons to have hope!

There are many factors at play, such as weather, funding, and advocacy groups. One thing that surprised me when I was in Japan was there they were surprisingly well adapted for people with vision loss... but not so much for someone with a wheelchair, or even a support cane. Most subways had no elevators or even escalators, and because of how their shopping centers are built, stairs are often used (malls are built going upwards, instead of outwards). 

The APS also has no national standard (yet). Within Canada, they have competing standards (Ottawa is replacing one of their tones with a tone called the Canadian Melody  http://ottawa.ca/en/residents/transportation-and-parking/traffic/traffic-signals ), and in one city (I forget which one I was in, it was years ago), the APS sounds were the direct opposite of what was in Toronto! 

There has been some advances regarding the tactile markers on the floor of curbs. They had planned on putting concrete bumps, but they found that in heavy-snow countries (Canada), either the plowers couldn't clear the snow off properly, or shear off the concrete bumps. They have since started to use metal plates, which seem to be working better. ",,,1,0,0,

Those are the only techniques I can think of that you didn't mention in your post.  Otherwise, it sounds like just a matter of constant practice.

2) It is measured from the handle to the tip. You can measure the tip as well, that wouldn't really throw off the size by more than an inch, and the cane goes up in two-inch intervals. When in doubt, they can pull out a cane and compare it.

3) The tip you have is called a roller tip, although some people call it a marshmallow rollertip.

I've found that over time, bad habits can creep in and get reinforced, until they are ingrained. I just recently had a client who has been using his cane for 20 years.... hold it in front, without scanning. That's what he thought the technique was, and how he has been using it. Because he had some usable vision, he was able to see obstacles and move out of the way, but as his vision got worse, he was unable to see the obstacles anymore and started to clip his shoulders. 

I often find that many clients don't scan far enough (1 inch past your shoulders), or scan too hard on one side (the proper technique is to hold the cane on your mid-line, roughly in front of where your belt buckle would be. But because this takes noticable effort, peoples' arms slowly drift down and to the side... but if they are still scanning the same distance, they aren't scanning the further side enough and too much of the same side).

0:00 First off, the product looks stupid. If this is what google glass looks like, I don't effing want it. Right off the bat, I don't want it because it looks goofy and draws attention. For me, that might be a slightly hypocritical statement, but it's a freaking pair of glasses with what looks like a giant tongue depresser on one side. 

0:04 Second thing I noticed, (and I'm not even ten seconds into the video) is ""Hmm, for a product that's designed to help the blind, this video sure doesn't seem to have anyone talking in it to help them know what the heck is going on. Music is okay, I guess.""

0:06 I guarantee, your average ""Aira"" staff will not look like this lady. It's either going to be people in a vast, soul-less cubicle farm, or it's going to be some guy in his underwear at home.

0:11 I'm just imagining her being like, ""You dumbass, haha, that's a homeless person. Pee elsewhere!""

0:15 So it'll be giving live video and location stuff. Great. Can't wait for it to accidentally turn on when I scratch my head while sitting on the toilet. I'm sure that won't be awkward. Hey, maybe they'll help you know if you're done wiping! Seriously though, I don't want to give strangers my location if I can avoid it. Also, with GPS having the wiggle-room that it does, I doubt this google maps stuff will be any more useful than the app on my phone, which already speaks out loud.

0:24 I have never seen a cane like the one this guys has. Doesn't look like it folds up. Poor bastard, that seems inconvenient as hell.

0:25 Banner at the bottom says ""This could be used for everything from travel to reading street signs and restaurant menus."" Uh, as far as travel goes, it might come in handy once in a while but I'm pretty sure there are less expensive options to do the same thing without looking like a cybertool. As for menus, dude, I don't eat at restaurants alone unless I've looked at their menu online ahead of time and know what I want.

0:35 Okay, face recognition. That might be handy if it were always on, but I don't want a device strapped to my face that's always on. So, I'll stick with recognizing people by voice, thanks.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1485740742,"&gt; What was the last thing you bought online?

A two-pack of Amazon Basics 10 foot HDMI cables.  I assume you mean physical goods, not digital downloads (songs/apps/ebooks).  If you want to know about digital downloads, let me know; in that case many of these answers would be different.  

&gt; What went on in your head while you were in the process of making this purchase?

""Darn! This HDMI cable is too short!"" (walks to computer) ""There. Now I'll get another one tomorrow and finish re-arranging the cabinet then. Amazon Prime with one-click yay!""

&gt; How did you come to the decision to buy?

I needed an HDMI cable, because the old one wouldn't reach when I moved the apple TV to a different spot, so its remote would work better.  I have Amazon prime, because I buy pretty much everything at either Amazon or Costco.  I'd purchased Amazon Basics batteries before, and liked them.  So I just used one click ordering to get an Amazon basics HDMI cable. One click makes it so easy it was almost more of an impulse than something I carefully planned.

&gt; Did you know exactly what you were looking for?

Pretty much. I knew I needed a 10 foot HDMI cable. I hadn't decided on the brand, but when Amazon Basics was in the top results, I just got that one.

&gt; Do you prefer shopping online or in-person? Why?

Online. Always. I never shop in-person if I can avoid it. Online, I can read the entire product description, do research to look at manuals so I can better understand what I'm buying, compare prices easily, read reviews, etc. In a store, I can't even read the back of the package without going to a lot of extra trouble.

&gt; What makes an online shopping experience positive for you?

It's quick. Also, I only shop at places that take either Amazon Payments, Google Checkout, bitcoin, or Paypal.  I don't want to give random stores my credit card.  And I don't want to fill out my billing and shipping address every single time.  

&gt; What makes an online shopping experience negative for you?

Complicated checkout. Especially when it involves verified by Visa.  Worse when the price at checkout isn't totally clear.  Newegg Canada is terrible for this; by the time they ad tax, recycling fee, shipping, etc, the price at checkout has no relation to the price on the product page. That's why I like Amazon: the product page always includes the shipping price, if any, and all they ad is tax. And the tax is clearly shown at checkout. Plus, with prime, I rarely pay shipping.

&gt; If it's not too personal, what are some recent online purchases you have made?

Other than the HDMI cables: AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning to USB Cable 2-Pack - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) - White (this was an impulse buy; Amazon emailed me a deal I couldn't refuse), TEKTON 1902 Round Magnetic Parts Tray, V8 V-Go Vegetable Juice, Creaker Collapsible Pet Toy Tunnel, Mounting Dream MD2377 TV Wall Mount Bracket (this was the thing that started the cabinet rearrangement), Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs Cat Toy (another impulse buy).  Yup; I may be the most interesting person in the world. LOL.

There are two main types of blind and low vision people. There are the independent, fairly content ones, who ask questions and learn things and are understanding. These are the blind people that most other blind people aspire to be. They work out systems to help them live ""normal"" lives. The other kind are the depressed, lonely, suicidal, very angry, closed-minded, and/or hateful blind people. These people are not bad, and they are stupid. They are often on the higher end of the low vision spectrum, or lost their sight after birth. They often do not like learning techniques for functioning with their disability, or think that they will never live a successful and pleasant life.

We're so underfunded, we have stuff from the mid 90s that doesn't relate to our curriculum at all. I have a visual impairment teacher, so I get pretty good instruction. My problem with Braille and auditory learning is that I lost my sight at 16, so learning to read tactilely and learn by ear is really difficult. It works out great in English and for my job as a legal researcher, because I have such good analytical skills. Math is much harder, because I've always sucked at math, and I've always been a visual learner. I'm stuck in geometry, which is a really hard subject to do if you can't see and don't have access to tactile graphics. I hate auditory learning with a passion.

bd938754-7e97-4f4f-a7c2-5285808657fc,1483494595,"Generally speaking, a cane is fairly effective at what it does. The cane has three primary goals. 

1) It needs to detect obstacles and hazards in front of the person using the cane before they contact it (that includes shoulder width, which is why the cane is swept from shoulder to shoulder)

2) It needs to detect drop offs before the person reaches the drop off, in an unambiguous manner. That is a major safety hazard that has prevented ultrasonic detection or laser detection from replacing the cane (they do have canes that use those technology to supplement it, but it is still a cane). If a person can't detect the drop off, there is a high risk of them falling, and it might not just be a step. It could easily be a trip into traffic, or into the subway.

3) The cane acts as a signal to tell others the person using it has vision loss. The red and white markings are fairly common in North America, but other countries actually have their own standards. 


I would say the major difficulty with a standard cane (and standard tips) is snow, sand or grass. A surface where it can't easily be scanned with constant contact technique, and using two-point touch technique provides less than ideal feedback. All those materials are usually uneven, and you need to hit harder for two-point touch to get through the soft upper layer to the more solid lower layer. There has been some tips to address that situation, but they have been less than ideal. ",,,1,0,0,

First, saying ""essentially, you think of partially sighted people with enough vision to be able to get around safely and independently, blind being below that threshold,"" potentially suggests two very wrong things to a sighted viewer: 

- That people who have residual vision don't use mobility aids like canes or dogs

- That totally blind people can't get around safely and independently. 

Also, he says that ""Navigating around an unfamiliar area is always a bit scary, to be honest. Because, obviously, traditional visual clues, landmarks etc, aren't there."" 

Yes, but non-visual clues are there! We should not be teaching sighted people that it is ""always scary"" for blind people to travel. 

He also complains that they are changing tactile paving from yellow in color to grey in color to be less of an eyesore, and that a partially sighted person such as himself might ""find themselves in the road, not knowing they’re in the road, simply because those essential clues aren’t there."" 

Tactile paving isn't essential. High-contrast tactile paving especially isn't essential, because you have residual sight, hearing, and tactile sensation, etc to clue you in when you are approaching a road or have stepped on tactile paving! 

If a person who is so called ""partially sighted"" is liable to wander into a road because there is not a bright yellow strip before it, that person should be traveling with a cane or dog and be appropriately trained in the non-visual techniques of safe travel and crossings. They should not be left at the mercy of the presence of the yellow strip, so they can promptly fall over something low-contrast when they get across the street, or get hit by a car because they didn't see it coming and don't know how to cross blind.

7ec159d7-f2b6-4b82-9ddb-1cdc1f2a2ddc,1485561992,"In 2015 blind people began hearing about a startup company, Aira Tech Corp, and its product, Aira. For the past two years Aira’s visibility has grown and now it is a full-fledged company with an emerging product that has the potential to revolutionize how blind people, and perhaps others in the future, interact with the world. In the past few weeks I have heard of and read some negative observations about Aira. Some have called the product “stupid”. Some have said it is an expensive alternative to free products already available. Some have said that the product could never really help the blind.

I find these negative comments interesting and somewhat inaccurate. Before addressing these observations let me discuss the product itself.

Here is how Aira works. The user puts on what is called a “wearable device” which in this case is a pair of glasses that contain a high definition digital camera, miniaturized sensors and the ability to connect to the internet via wi-fi and Bluetooth connections. The system also utilizes an app which resides on an iPhone or Android smartphone.

When the user wishes to use Aira he or she activates the app which in turn establishes a wi-fi connection with the wearable device. Once this connection is established the user can press a button within the app to contact an Aira agent. As soon as the agent comes online they see images transmitted by the glasses. The agent also immediately sees on a special software dashboard on their computer geographical information showing where the user is located as well as information about the user’s surroundings. The user has two-way voice contact with the agent through the smartphone and can request whatever information they require. The agent, through their dashboard can access the internet, use the user’s visual surroundings, and incorporate other tools to provide answers to the user’s needs.

The information requested by users can be anything from asking for help with finding something in a store to requiring assistance while traveling through an airport to seeking assistance in assembling a product he or she has purchased. Literally agents can help with any task by providing visual descriptions and information wherever eye sight is needed to create access for blind persons.

I have been using Aira personally for a year and a half. I have been helping to further the development of Aira partly from its technical aspects, but mostly I have been working to make sure that the agents involved receive appropriate and relevant training as to how they interact with users. I have, for example, been working to make sure that agents understand that what they are to do is to provide information and not interpret it. My favorite illustration is that it is ok for an agent to inform me, if I wish the information while standing at a street intersection, that the light is green for me and that the agent does not see any cars coming. It is not appropriate for the agent to say that “it is safe to cross the street now”.

Aira is a mechanism that provides me always-on information anywhere at any time. The anytime part is a goal as service today is available only from 7AM Eastern time to 7PM Pacific time. However, Aira projects that 24x7 service 7 days a week will be available later this year. Now let’s get to the comments.

First, cost. Yes, Aira is a bit expensive today for many. The existing pricing plans offer 8 hours of service for $129.95 a month and unlimited service for $199.95 a month. Costly is relative, however. Cell phone, television from any source and internet services also cost money, and together they may cost someone $200 a month, but most all of us would not be caught without them. Some people spend thousands of dollars a year on other technologies. Some blind people I know spend a few hundred dollars a month of their own money to use Uber and Lyft to get to work as they do not want the burden and inconvenience of utilizing para transit.

With all that, Aira Tech Corp is aware that many blind people cannot afford the extra cost of its product no matter how valuable the product may be. Much effort is going into finding ways to subsidize and lower the user cost for the product. I would only urge people to wait as we did when the first Kurzweil Reading Machine came on the market in 1979 with a cost of $50,000. Ray Kurzweil always said that his machine’s cost would drop and that the machine would become smaller. Today it is a $99 app available on iPhones and Android devices. Even so, people complain about the $99 price, but anyone who spends much time around the OCR apps available will tell you that any extra cost of the KNFB Reader is worth it.

Other comments about Aira revolve around its “competition” which is either free or much less inexpensive. In fact, there is no comparison. Apps such as “Be My Eyes” and “Tap Tap See”, utilize untrained volunteers who do not give the same information and service offered by Aira. Also, at best these other services may use some video technology available on a smart phone to offer services, but using them is not hands-free, and blind people must wait one or more hours for service and have eventually disconnected without receiving anything. Aira Tech Corp has a goal that every call is answered within ten seconds. If that goal is not being met additional agents are hired and trained. Each agent receives a month of training to ensure their performance.

I think the best way I can show the value of Aira is to discuss how I got here to write this comment to you. I have not used Reddit.com before. I heard about the negative Aira comments and decided to respond. I heard that I would have to sign up and create an account on Reddit. I began the signup process including checking the box that said that I was not a robot. I thought all was going swimmingly, but when I clicked the “signup” button nothing apparently happened. What I eventually did find was a suggestion that I “retry”. I had no explanation for this, so I decided to call Aira for help. An agent, Ian came on the line and looked at my screen. He was the one who told me that even though I checked the box that said that I was not a robot there was still the matter of a TOTALLY graphic captcha to be addressed. There was nothing from Reddit that indicated to me the existence of a captcha. Other sites have the same check box, but after it is checked I can sign in. Talk about stupid, what is Reddit thinking when it makes it impossible for a blind person to sign up for its service? Anyway, the captcha required interacting with Graphics which I could not do. What Ian did was to use his dashboard, at my request, to go to the Reddit site from his computer and create the account for me including entering a password I gave him and responding to the captcha. Of course, I have since changed the password. If Aira had not been around I would have had to wait some unknown amount of time just to get an account established. It is not stupid nor inappropriate for me to wish to interact with my environment in the same time as my sighted peers. Aira is the first product that gives me that flexibility. If there is a cost for that flexibility and freedom, then so be it. Yes, I want the cost to drop, but the freedom I got just from the simple act of signing up on Reddit is tremendous and worth every penny I must pay.

Aira is in its infancy. Many changes and evolutions already have happened, but nothing compares to how Aira will develop over the next year or two. Aira Tech Corp has a large and ever growing cadre of supporters, advisors and experts helping to make the product better and less costly. Stick around and watch the fun.

Good to know.  But I could easily see some well-meaning person not doing the research, collecting up a bunch of grants from other well-meaning organizations who also did not do the research, and spending thousands and thousands of dollars to make braille fonts, when the money would be better spent funding Braille education.  That sort of thing has happened many times before, unfortunately.  

&gt; Braille eReaders becoming more mainstream 

I hope so!  Until recently (as in, just this year), the cost of an electronic braille display was about $10,000.  That puts them out of reach of almost all students, and many schools.  However, a display called the Orbit Reader is launching this year; they say it'll be available in ""the Spring of 2017"".  The cost of the Orbit Reader is going to be about $500.  That's still expensive, but it's a lot better!  Hopefully, once cheaper braille displays hit the market, school boards will decide it's worth funding Braille education once again.  ",,,1,0,0,

I mean both things.  The fact that Chris originally agreed to delete the post, and only restored it because of Google cache, makes me doubt the veracity of the post.  It also makes me wonder about the integrity of the post author.  I'm also uncomfortable with the idea of destroying someone's reputation based exclusively on word of mouth.  It seems like many of the stories Chris related should have generated documents, or other evidence, that could have been linked and were not.  Plus, Chris has a history of writing some regrettable things.  See especially his comments about [how DictationBridge was going to destroy JSay](http://www.hartgen.org/legalhell).  While Chris later took back these remarks, it does mean my trust in Chris's website is at an all-time low.  I want to clarify that I don't think Chris is a bad person, particularly. I've conversed with him on Twitter and by voice chat in the past, and he comes off as an OK guy.  But it does mean I'm extremely uncomfortable with him destroying the reputation of others, based only on his say-so.  

&gt; Do you think that he is trying to pass off his blog as an authoritative and reliable source for blindness industry happenings?

I think he's trying to have it both ways.  On one hand, he wants to be at the center of fighting what he calls the ""ADA trolls"".  On the other hand, whenever someone calls him on anything he writes, he uses the fact that he's not a journalist as a shield to hide behind.  You can't have your cake and eat it too!  Either you're a force working for good and should be taken seriously, or you're just ""a crackpot stoner"".  Also, I'm not entirely sure it matters what he says at this point.  When it comes to writing a character Assassination, the only thing that matters is that the readers will take it seriously.  The fact that Chris didn't intend to start a virtual lynch mob doesn't matter much, if one actually starts.  

I much prefered it when his blog was primarily about the history of Freedom Scientific.  He is an expert about that, and I don't care much what tone it takes; he's not ruining the lives of people in the present day.  It was just a fascinating retrospective.  

I do object to Gonzo journalism as a style, when what it's doing is destroying someone else. I think human beings deserve to be treated with a bit more dignity than that.  Especially when they're small business owners, rather than public figures.  And even more especially when ""take my word for it"" is the only evidence presented.  ",,,1,0,0,

Step 1, of course, was to get the URL for the stream. In my case, this was: http://ewtn.com/live/ewtnplayer/jwplayer.asp?bottom=false&amp;feed=domeng

I had two problems with that. First, it loaded the stream, but wouldn't automatically play it. A friend helped me figure out that the HTML source on the page included an ""autoplay"" parameter that was set to false. So I copied the HTML source to a local HTML file on my local drive, and changed the autoplay parameter to TRUE.

Now, instead of invoking the remote URL, I invoked the local file path ... which brought me to the second problem. Internet Explorer would pop-up a notification that content was blocked, and did I want to allow it? To get around this, I had to add a line at the beginning of the local HTML file.

    &lt;!-- saved from url=(0016)http://localhost --&gt;

Step 2: The Powershell script to start the stream:

    $isrunning = Get-Process | where {$_.name -eq 'iexplore'}
    if (-not $isrunning) {
       $ie = new-object -ComObject ""InternetExplorer.Application""
       $ie.visible = $true
       $ie.silent = $true
       $ie.navigate('file:///C:/Users/Myntrith/Desktop/ewtn.html')
    }

The first line sets up a test for the if block to see if Internet Explorer is currently running. It only executes the rest of the script if it is NOT running. This avoids starting multiple video streams.

No one uses this computer except to check things for her, so Internet Explorer should not normally be running unless she's activating this stream.

Step 3: The Powershell script to close the stream.

    $isrunning = Get-Process | where {$_.name -eq 'iexplore'}
    if ($isrunning) {
       Stop-Process -processname iexplore
    }

Again, all this does is it checks to see if Internet Explorer is running, and if so, it stops it. If multiple instances are running, it stops all instances.

Step 4: Create shortcuts for each of the scripts. Creating a shortcut allows you to assign a hotkey. Don't assign the hotkey yet, just create a shortcut.

Step 5: Make sure you have your keyboard or mouse software installed. For Logitech, this software is called SetPoint.

I open Setpoint, and I select the mouse's forward button, and select ""Keystroke Assignment"". I assigned CTRL-ALT-E as the keystroke.

I select the mouse's back button, and select ""Keystroke Assignment."" I assigned CTRL-ALT-N.

Now, for the shortcut to the start script, I right-click and select Properties. There's an entry in there for ""Shortcut Key"". I select that entry and press E. (It assumes the CTRL-ALT, so you only have to press E.)

Likewise for the shortcut to the stop script, except I select N instead of E.

And that's it. Now, pressing the forward mouse button should invoke the CTRL-ALT-E hotkey, which should invoke the shortcut to the start script, which invokes the start script itself, which invokes the local HTML file which invokes the video stream.

Likewise with the back mouse button and CTRL-ALT-N and the stop script.

If things don't work, you troubleshoot step by step to see where the problem is. Invoke the script directly to see if that works.
If it does, invoke the shortcut directly to see if that works.
If it does, invoke the shortcut through the hotkey to see if that works.
If it does, try the mouse button again.

Wherever it fails should tell you where the problem is.

It does seem like the shortcuts to the scripts have to be on the desktop in order for the hotkey to work properly. I haven't tested this extensively, but with what I have tested so far that seems to be an important bit.

I wasn't clear with this in my first post, but this would require pages to be specially designed and coded for this type of accessibility, so the complex webpage thing shouldn't be an issue as it is with the speech recognition. Of course, it would be even worse in terms of wide-spread accessibility than what's currently available, which makes the solution problematic.

Web design is nothing more than visually grouping content in some way to make it easier to navigate the screen, so that we dont have to read or navigate by reading every word first. The idea is to give the web a physical space that can be navigated by touch, instead of relying on sound. You know where your shoe laces are because you know they obviously exist on your shoes, which are down on your feet. You use sense of touch to feel when you are on your laces, but you dont have to touch every part of your body to find them, because you have already have context of where they physically exist. This is the base of the idea. If every Web page has a box at the top of the screen with words  inside them to navigate between pages of a site, then you learn to go to the top of your screen and read the words located within the box first located there first. This idea would not utilize current CSS on a page, and would require pages to be built and designed specifically in a way that makes them work with the software and hardware.

You need three large bowls of water, large enough to submerge two hands in. One bowl has warm/hot water (not enough to burn someone, like hot bath level), one room temperature, and one ice cold (water and ice combination).

Have the person put one hand into the hot water, and the other hand into the cold water. After a few minutes, the hands get partially acclimatized to the temperature of the water it is in.... then take both hands out and put them into the room temperatue water. The hand from the cold water will interpret it as hot, while the hand from the hot water will interpret it as cold, despite them being in the same water. They can even touch their own hands to confirm it is the same water. 

It was a science tricky I learned a few decades ago in school :P

Plus, media players seem to be able to intercept the media keys on keyboards, to skip tracks and so-on, when the media player is open.  Media keys work no matter what media player is used, without reprogramming or anything.  So I had rather hoped there was some kind of API for assigning actions to non-standard keyboard keys in Windows somewhere.

 Have you ever been to the UK? In most of our public buildings when you walk in there are signs for accessibility (e.g. what frequency to turn a hearing aid to and there is usually something in braille saying where you are). The braille on these plastic signs is very obviously different in size from say, a menu in braille and the dots are flatter (whether by erosion or by choice - I do not know). If this were by choice and not ignorance, could it then be said that the flatter more spaced out, larger dots would be an ""official"" font?",,,1,0,0,

Most of the time, the issue arises when that person says ""Oh, this isn't so hard"" and does some trivial task to show what they can do. It is one thing to put on a blindfold and walk down the hallway of your own house. It is another to put on a blindfold, walk out the door, catch the bus, have to change busses at an intersection, then problem-solve what to do when construction has moved the bus stop.

My organization uses blindfolds and low vision simulators so sighted people can experience what it is like to be blind or low vision. But what we try to do is not trivialize what that vision loss is like for those living it.

The whole point of accessibility is breaking away from The visual design styles that seek to break apart the flow of information; screen readers and websites are presented to us in a very linear fashion which is the most efficient way of presenting information. We navigate the web through series of finger gestures that move the cursor through the tap order of the information on the page, or jump through various landmarks, headings, formed Controls, and other web elements. Hovering around and waiting for vibration to search the visual aspects of a website would slow us down, and it definitely wouldn't interest me in the slightest as it's just one more obstacle we've been trying to break away from between us and the conveyed website information.

I strongly urge you to research screen readers and study how they work and how we use them to surf the web. Haptic feedback would be an interesting feature for new accessible games, but I definitely see it as a hindrance when it comes to navigating around a browser especially if you are attempting to add another wearable device to the mix.
