If I say I'm blind, then they immediately get the mental image of someone with no sight at all - which is incorrect.

If I say I'm visually impaired, or even severely visually impaired, I get the inevitable ""Oh, me too without my glasses"" and they assume that being visually impaired is a thing that can be fixed. ""Low vision"" suffers the same fate.

If I say I'm legally blind, then it feels like I'm saying something along the lines of ""well, I'm not _reeeeally_ blind but I'm going to take advantage of the government's definition to get stuff that it entitles me to.""

""Partially sighted"" just confuses people and sounds weird.

Over the past couple of years I have (mostly) just taken to saying ""I'm blind"" and then correcting (or not) people's inevitably wrong assumptions, because people need to understand that blindness is a spectrum.",,,5,0,0,

I am usually (but not always, RIP the first 10 minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy for me last week) successful if I repeatedly and strongly emphasize the need for the device to be set to audio description (or ""descriptive narration"") for blind people. I mention this when I ask for the device and repeat it when they hand it to me and ask them to confirm. 

It is also within policy to ask them to come into the theater until the description begins and verify the unit is working, and bring you a new one if it is not.  

Note that if you have issues with your movie, AMC's policy per the recent settlement is a [full refund AND a guest pass for another visit.]
(https://www.amctheatres.com/assistive-moviegoing/guest-guide) Don't let them try to just give you a guest pass (or only refund you and not others affected in your party,) because that's what they usually offer in my experience. 

Beyond that, the contact options for AMC are: speaking with the manager of the theater, phoning the theater, or using the ""contact"" form on the above link (which is supposed to become the way to reach their ""ADA coordinator"" although I don't know if that exists yet.)

The main reason is that it can read books from Kindle, and books from Audible.  So an audible subscription and a Kindle Unlimited subscription mean he can read nearly any book ever written.  Plus, shopping from the Echo is easier than shopping on Google Home.  Oh, and if people he knows also have Echo's, now it can do Echo to Echo hands-free phone calls.  No need to bother with Amazon Prime when he's just starting out; Amazon Music is crap and not worth it.  Amazon video has no titles with audio description, so he won't use it.  Amazon just lowered the free shipping minimum to $25, so prime is even less worth it unless he buys lots of small items.  If he does, he can always get prime later.  He's much better to spend that money on Audible and Kindle Unlimited.  

However, if he's Canadian, or outside the US, go for Google Home; it's easier to use outside of the US, and all the services actually work internationally.  But Google Home can't read books.  For Google Home, the only sub he should get is Google Music.  Plus if he has an existing stereo system, connect a Google Cast Audio up to it.

He has had friends that he has met through online gaming actually meet him in real life.  The owner of the Chinese restaurant he gets lunch at knows him by name when he walks in, and other things of that nature.  My entire family is very introverted, and he is no different.  The trouble is getting him out of the house.  He lives in a walkable area of a larger city with great public transportation.  Whenever I visit we will walk to a restaurant or something, and the last time what should've been a 5 minute walk took about 20 minutes and it really worried me.  

When we were growing up we were very close, and my father and I took the approach of treating him as though he did not have a disability to counteract what we perceived as coddling and enabling him by mother, and I'm afraid I did more harm than good to his psyche.  I know I'm rambling and venting, but I really would like to actively engage him and motivate him to be healthier and contribute to society because he has a lot to offer and partly because I carry guilt for how I treated him as a teenager.

I will do my own research about opportunities in his area that he may enjoy, but if you have any tips or resources for creating an income that he can do or other ways I can approach him about being more physically active, I'm all ears.

Look into some audio podcasts that he might be interested in; there is a podcast about literally everything, and some of them are well done. Also if he creates a free account at www.blindmicemart.com he can download thousands of free audio described movies from their database. These movies are just the audio of the film and the description of what is going on, so no video.

If he likes games there are several accessible online game platforms where he could play with other blind people. Three such platforms are RS games, QuentinC's playroom, and Blind adrenaline. RS games and QuentinC's playroom are free, Blind adrenaline has a fee you pay every six months, but it is worth it if he is really into any of their games, because their interface is super great and they have a pretty dedicated community for several of the games. I had to quit playing Texas Holdem poker on there because I played too often. There are poker tournaments three times a week that normally get about thirty people. 

Since he is into playing music he might be interested in getting into audio recording etc. although this takes a lot of time to get good at, and might be difficult for him to get into if he does not have great computer skills. He could also look up youtube videos to learn new songs or techniques on his guitar; there are videos out there for learning just about anything.

You might try the meat up web site to see what is going on around him. There can be lots of things to do, if he has a way of getting to them.

If he does not have great blindness skills he might think about attending an adult training center, such as the Louisiana Center for the blind or the Colorado center for the blind. I attended LCB and there were students of all ages. They kept us super busy from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM with training, and there was lots of stuff going on outside of those times. It could be a good community to make friends and learn from other blind people; it’s where I met my wife.

In most cases, I think you're right.  Unfortunately, the decline of desktops doesn't seem to be happening in the workplace.

This would make it more expensive to employ blind people, and thus be yet another contributor to the desperate lack of employment in our community.

The feeling of not knowing what is going to happen with your vision and when is terrifying. If your doctor thinks your vision will continue to deteriorate I suggest you get in contact with a low vision specialist who can help you with day to day tasks. 
The biggest help for me has been Zoom Text for my work computer. I'm not sure how that would work with programming. But I use it all day at work (it's a magnification program that also corrects the resolution) without this I would have retired years ago.  

You can continue to work and provide for your family even as you lose your sight.  Get ahead of your disease and learn to work with the vision you have. 
You'll learn to look around/through the blind spot. 
I also suggest the BigFont app for your smart phone, I know it works on android. Not sure about iPhone.

For all of the questions about attractions, I encourage all of you to [read the good dates on my blog](https://gaychicagodating.wordpress.com/) and that will answer a lot of your questions.

In all other aspects, this question is stupid to be honest. It's almost like people have never masturbated or had sexual daydreams before. That's how I knew what sex I was attracted to because I found the idea of a male body, male voice, male hair, sexually arousing. I can’t tell you anything other than, well, when I hear a man’s voice I like, I get an erection. I don't know how else to explain it other than that.

When I was legally blind I liked the build of men and the touch of a man’s body and hands. I like muscles on a man and I liked, when I could see some, men with tans because they also were easier to see, but that's beside the point.

I just knew I never found women sexually attractive, like at all. When listening to porn, watching porn when I was legally blind, or the like. I've always been attracted to men but I figured it out a bit late into my teen years because I grew up in a part of FL where I wasn't around a lot of gay people and my school for the blind didn't have a lot of open and out gay students or staff who I felt like I could confide in, but, as a teenager, I always had sexual fantasies about men and I pretty much just knew that I was gay.

For me, voice and hands are very much my defining basis. There's little things I evaluate like how hairy a guy is or how tall he is, I like men who are taller than I am, by the way, if his face has a nice shape, and yes, I do feel faces but it's when I know them a bit longer and when I want to learn more about this very hot sounding man I am attracted to. I don't go about feeling dudes faces randomly and every time I meet a person.

This is true for me now, but it was also true when I was legally blind. Since I can't look at pictures anymore, I have to depend on solely how they execute their thoughts in an email or text message or anywhere online. Written communication is a huge factor in my dating decisions. If you can't hold my interest with sentences and paragraphs and you'd rather just write one worded replies to my messages, chances are, you won’t go out with me. I won’t ask you to go out with me. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but I am firm when it comes to my tastes. If you can't articulate a complete thought or an idea in an email or Facebook post, chances are I will lose interest in you very quickly.

But basically, my attractions hinge on the voice, the body build and how that appears to my touch, and how well you can verbally and textually communicate. I also like taller men but that's a preference.

Obviously, smell is a huge factor as well but I am not as picky about that as I am other factors but there are certain men smells that instantly give me an erection. There are exceptions to every rule.

One rule nobody can break though, is smokers. I don't like them. Never have, never will. I hate the smell and the taste of kissing a smoker. Period. Smokers won’t get to date me if I can help it.",,,16,0,0,

As a large lass myself, we are taught that we have very little societal worth. This comes from the media, our peers, and sometimes even our own families (I have been told on more than one occasion that I will never have a proper relationship because I am too grotesque to love). The life of a woman is very appearance based, an attractive woman is more likely to attract a man from a higher class and thus improve her own social standing, the same is true for men to a degree but to nowhere near the same extent - men have a greater propensity to be witty and charming which sometimes can make women look past exteriors. 

In online dating, the major fear for polled women online was that they would meet a serial killer on a date, the main fear for men was that they would meet someone fat. 

We convince ourselves that anyone who could possibly love us as we are must have something wrong with them - because that's not what normal men want. I have talked myself out of dates before on the premise that this bloke was probably playing some sick joke with his friends and I'll show up and either be laughed at or be alone. 

What your lass is saying makes sense in my head too, it comes from a place of ""fear of deception"" almost like we a tricking you into settling for something lower than what you are worth because of your impairment. That one day you might wake up look over at her and be repulsed by what is in front of you - hence she ends up alone and most of the people in her life turned out to be correct.

I want a legally blind character that still has some functional vision so badly! Unfortunately, because so many people get all of their ""information"" about disability from the media, many people are unaware that partial blindness is an option (and not just ""hee hee i can't see without my glasses""). I'd also like to see more young visually impaired character because most people associate poor sight with old age. Perhaps sighted people's misconceptions could become a humorous conflict for the characters, because that often is an annoying thing we have to deal with. 

As a different commenter pointed out, it would be great to have a wide range of personality types (lazy, helpful, slutty, smart, rude, evil, funny, etc) portrayed. I just don't like seeing character's who's personality is the just direct result of their visual impairment. Some features can be directly connected to it, but give 'em some separate backstory too! Do they have a love interest? A dream job? A pet peeve? A deep rooted fear?

Personally, i feel toph from avatar is a great example. Her sight did impact her in some negative ways- her parents kept her sheltered. But she still had ambitions that weren't because of or in spite of her blindness. She wanted to become an awesome earthbender because she wanted to become an awesome earthbender dammit. She had a unique and witty personality too. 

If a story is more realistic and set in modern times, i'd love to see actual assitive tech and canes being used. I'm not sure how well this would work out in a sci fi or fantasy piece, as you pointed out earlier, but it would be great if they could be incorporated into the narrative. In addition to being partially blind myself, i also work with a lot of visually impaired children. Sometimes, they're reluctant to use alternative techniques to approaching tasks because they think it's not cool, but perhaps they'd feel more comfortable if they saw normal characters using the same devices/tools in the media. 

A blind villian/morally confused character can totally work! Btw, thanks for actually considering asking people for their thoughts before writing about us. It'd much aopreciated!

From birth- maybe someone is a direct victim of her though.) 

Morally grey as she doesn't want to outright *kill* anyone, but after becoming undead just wants to see again, and maybe has a particular person she wants to look upon again... (perhaph's she also used by the evil hidden in plain sight...)

c4f82a04-745f-4b72-b4ac-42a7c56532cb,1494728085,"I'll start with your last two questions first, because they're quicker to answer.

I still have central vision in my left eye, so I don't need to use audio description at the moment.

The only time I can recall seeing blindness portrayed in film or theatre is an episode of CSI perhaps 15 years ago. I’m not big on film and haven’t been to the theatre in 15 years. I wouldn't mind going to theatre shows, I just don’t have anyone to go with. So I'm afraid on both those questions I'm not much help.

As for employment for people with disability, people with disability have a lower employment rate than the general population. I'm in Australia, so I'll be using rough figures from here, but the labour force participation rate (so the percentage of adults in or looking for work) is a little under 70%. When we look at people with disability, it’s about: 60% for vision impairment; 50-55% for hearing impairment; 40-45% for physical disability; and intellectual disability is the lowest. 

We should also consider that a little more than 14% of Australians associated with having a disability. Yet, when you look at various employers, they are overwhelmingly underrepresented in the workforce. For example, the Department of Social Services (Federal Government department that deals with welfare etc) workforce comprises about 10% people with disability. My current department, the Department for Communities and Social Inclusion (South Australian state government department, deals with disability services, social housing, etc) only has 4.5% of its workforce associating with having disability. This pattern repeats in the private and non-government sectors.

So why does this under-representation exist? I would argue there are three factors: inaccessible career pathways; inaccessible careers; community perception.

Inaccessible career pathways is probably the most complex issue. We're talking about failures to: identify suitable career pathways; connect people with disability with those pathways; support people with disability through those pathways (e.g. providing accessible materials etc). 

For example, in the 80s or 90s the university I later attended considered the issue of wheelchair users attending the uni. They found there weren't many wheelchair users attending the uni, so it didn't warrant the funds to put in an additional lift (elevator). Thing is, the campus is on a hillside and there are lots of stairs. So t wheelchair users weren't attending the university not because they weren't getting in, but because they couldn't physically access the campus. 

Another example, relating to putting children/younger people with disability in contact with suitable career pathways: I am on the board of a not-for-profit blindness organisation. Our manager attends the graduation ceremonies for the blindness (primary) school here. He was reporting to us how all the kids were talking about what they wanted to be when they grew up. Pretty much all of them were saying careers that just weren't going to happen e.g. firefighter, policeman, etc. 

Those are just a couple of examples. Connecting people with disability to suitable career pathways needs to start young, and be frank. Then, when possible pathways are lined up, those pathways need to be accessible to people with disability. This accessibility isn't just the responsibility of the organisation responsible for the education/training like my ramps and lifts in my uni example. There needs to be accessible and adequate public transport, there needs to be funding support (most uni students work part time in retail or hospitality, those industries aren't necessarily suitable for people with disability), etc. 

The second point, accessible careers, is a bit more straight forward. Again though, it is wider than just the employer. Transportation is a pretty big deal. For example, here in Adelaide go North-South or East-West, not problem. But public transport converges on the CBD, so heading South-East, or West-North, etc is very difficult.

Then, in the workplace, you need employers that provide an accessible way to apply for a position, and proactively make adjustments to the workplace and work tasks so they are suitable for the candidate. For example, many jobs advertise they require a driver's licence when in fact they don't, so people unable to drive are excluded.

The third point ties into this latter part of the second, because community perceptions could see a candidate struck out because the employer doesn't think they can do the job as adequately as others because of their disability. For example, I've a friend with cerebral palsy. He was employed for a time with the disability employment service provider (i.e. organisation that helps you find work) doing data entry and admin type tasks. When he started everyone was very iffy because they thought he wouldn't manage the tasks. This perception led to them always commenting ""wow, I'm really surprised you managed that so well"" and the like. The guy has an honours degree and was putting numbers in cells in a spreadsheet and paper in files then into filing cabinets. 

An employer might consider their work tasks, consider ""ok, this is how I'd do them"", and so when a person with disability shows up for an interview they're thinking ""ok, to the do the tasks you need to do X, but this person would be impaired because of Y, so I don't see how it will work out"". When, in reality, the person with disability will adapt alternate strategies to complete the task or utilise different tools and technology. 

Overcoming this issue is the most difficult, because it is not just a case of throwing money at a problem and putting in tangible solutions. The best way to address the issue is having organisations employ people with disability. The story is the same with any organisation that employs someone through the Disability Employment Service program here in Australia (the program that funds the disability employment service providers to find work for people with disability): those organisations that employ people with disability do not look back. People with disability work harder, are more reliable, and are far more enthusiastic at work.

My favourite success story goes as follows: a factory is looking for a new work health safety officer. All the previous hires haven't stuck around and haven't been very good at getting people to follow proper work health safety procedures (e.g. wearing ear and eye protection etc). So they go to the local disability service provider and they come up with this guy with a moderate intellectual disability. They're hesitant, but they put him on and he turns out to be the best work health safety officer they've ever had. Why? Because he's always super cheerful and friendly and no one can say no to him. So a bloke isn't wearing his ears? He comes up, tells him to put on his ears, and the way he conveys it is so jovial and amusing the guy can't say no. 

So where does this leave us for the acting industry? I have no doubts the interest and ability is out there for potential actors with disability. Next, they needs to be connected to the career pathway of acting. E.g. the teacher at school notes they like drama, they note that desire down. That identification needs to lead to an accessible education or training opportunity. Perhaps a theatre has a program specific to encourage people with disability into the industry with one on one case management to identify challenges that person with disability might have in completing education/training tasks and support them to develop solutions. There might also be a philanthropic contribution for the person, or government providing a pension. 

Once that education is complete, there needs to be an accessible application process for roles. Perhaps a talent agency that has a specialty in people with disability. They might identify suitable roles and put their talent in contact with the theatre/ studio. They might also go further, and advocate for suitable roles. E.g they get a script, read it, and say ""hey, have you considered that this character might be enhanced if they had disability?"" Consider the representation of non-heterosexual characters in film and theatre. It's like every bloody show has to have one or more! The same thing happens with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) groups. Why not disability? And why not have those characters with disability actually played by people with disability? The final step is making sure the theatre/studio etc, is accessible for people with disability and supports exist to case manage that and put solutions in place.

I don't consider it an impossible task, but it's not going to be done overnight. I also strongly oppose the use of quotas. You should select someone because they are the best person/fit for the role, not ""just because"". Regarding pension payments, it might be unique to Australia (?), but disability pensions for people with sensory, physical, and intellectual disability should *not* be means tested. 

This may sound crazy, but they encourage ""min-maxxing"". For example, the person with disability could take that entry level trainee job, but they'd lose their pension. Problem: they'd lose part of their pension payments which mean they'll earn less overall. So to advance, they have to take a risk and lower their standard of living (hopefully only temporarily). The only type disability pension in Australia not means tested is the blind pension. Now, there are historical reasons for that, but when you see that the engagement of vision impaired people in the workforce is the *highest* of groups with disability, that clearly shows not means testing is not a disincentive for work. Basically, not means testing reduces uncertainty and encourages economic participation. 

I do hope that was interesting and that you read it all. The TLDR really is that it is a complex issue that won't be resolved overnight.

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1496003189,"First things first. You are right to want to prepare yourself for if you lose more vision. You’re facing a lot of uncertainty and that’s scary, but you are reaching out and you realize you have a lot you don’t know, which is a good first step. I’m both sad and happy to tell you that you might have even more to learn then you realize right now. You say, “I feel guilty that I feel this way because so many people (especially on this subreddit) have it worse.” I don’t want to be preachy, I know this is all new to you, but this kind of attitude can hurt you far more than whatever happens to your eyeballs.

Quick background about myself. I’m 25 years old. I slowly lost my sight, starting at an early age, until I lost all of it when I was 18. Once I became blind I went to two different training centers for blind adults to learn how to use computers, a cane, how to clean, etc. Thanks to my time at these training centers, and also some time later on teaching blind middle schoolers at a summer camp, I have had the opportunity to get to know dozens of blind people. Most of these people have been happy, successful, well-educated, well-adjusted individuals; however, this is not always the case of course. In my experience, the primary factor in whether or not blind people succeed and flourish is not how well their eyeballs work. I know people, like my wife, who were born blind and have more degrees and make more money than most of us, can ever hope to. I also know people with lots of vision, even 20-20 vision who are miserable, scared, and do not succeed. The main difference between such people is often attitude. Some people try and rely on their diminishing vision, long after this is no longer practical. Instead of adapting and proactively facing the challenges of blindness, they fearfully hold on to their vision, hoping it does not get “worst”.

This has become very long and rambling. My point is simply, your vision, or lack thereof, does not have to be the master of your life. You ask what can you expect? I know this question might have just been about the possible deterioration of your eyeballs, but you can expect whatever you can imagine and whatever you are willing to work for. If your sight does not get worst that’s great, you don’t have to learn anything new and you don’t have to make any adjustments in your life. If it does get worst, you can expect blindness to be annoying some of the time. That is unavoidable. Even if you learn everything, you need to learn you will have some extra limitations. You won’t be able to drive, until Google finishes its self-driving car. But you can also expect blindness to not be a great tragedy. You can expect to still be the breadwinner for your family; there are blind programmers. My wife and I both work in IT and as two blind adults, we make more money than my sighted parents ever made. You can still expect to be a great parent for your children; there are lots of great blind parents. You can expect to live a full life with rich and rewarding experiences, even if some of those experiences will be different for you because you have lost vision, they will probably not be as different for you as you might expect. When I think of the memories I created as a sighted person, and the memories I created as a blind person, I cannot tell those memories apart by how well my eyeballs were working when I made them.

Now that I have gotten past that rant, let me end with a few specifics, if I have not already lost you.

1. Check out the national federation of the Blind. https://nfb.org/ they have more resources then you can imagine, and they express the same attitude towards blindness that I have been carrying on about. Don’t have misgivings about the word “blind” in their name; the NFB is for people with all levels of vision. Like me, they use the term blind as a catch all liable, because sometimes in the visually impaired community there can be an unhealthy hierarchy of sight. The NFB has mailing lists for all kinds of groups, full of people ready to answer your questions. I believe there is a blind programmers list; I know there is a blind parent list. It also has a lot of resources that you might find educational, encouraging, and empowering.

2. Look into training if your sight gets worst. Such training could be the most difficult factor to deal with, for you and your family. You might be able to receive relatively quick and targeted training from state agencies, and such options might be adequate, and your best bet, since you are the breadwinner of your family. For example, a trainer might be able to come to your house, or there might be a nearby training facility, where you can learn how to use soft where that will allow you to continue to do your job. You might also be able to receive such training for orientation and mobility. However, I have had bad experiences with such training, and if possible, I would recommend attending something like the Louisiana Center for the Blind or the Colorado Center for the blind. These are residential centers where you would have a hard-core, comprehensive experience that teaches you all the skills you need to be blind. Such an experience, however, normally takes between six and nine months, so that might not be an option for you. Both of the centers I just mentioned are NFB centers, so you can find out more through their web site, and there are other great training centers to consider.

3. Move to a city with public transportation if you lose your license. I know this is not possible for everyone, but strongly consider it if you can no longer drive. Such a move could be another hard thing for your family, but if your wife does not have a job, and you work from home, it sounds like moving could be possible. My wife and I live in Hartford Connecticut, and having public busses makes all of the difference. We can also walk to most of the things we need, which is even better. Trust me; you don’t want to be trapped at home, dependent on your family for transportation.

4. be proactive. This is key. If your sight has a good chance of getting worst, do not wait for that to happen. You are obviously a smart young guy, and you have so many resources at your fingertips. I don’t think you would have too much trouble teaching yourself assistive technology programs that will allow you to use your computer with reduced sight, or no sight. I’m accessing my computer right now with a program called NVDA. This is a free screen reader, which you could download today and use to code, no vision needed. As someone else already mentioned, there are also lots of magnifying programs out there.

My biggest regret, when it comes to blindness, is that I was not taught the skills I was needed from a young age, even though everyone knew there was a strong chance I would lose all of my sight someday. Instead of facing reality and teaching me braille and cane travel skills, everyone pretended blindness was not in my future. I had over twenty eye surgeries by the time I was eighteen, in an attempt to make a fantasy a reality. All of that denial got me nowhere. So when I was eighteen I got the training I needed. I got busy living, went to college, met my soul mate, got married and got a job. I’m not sure if any of those things would have happened if I had not lost my sight. In other words, I can’t tell you what you can expect, that’s up to you, but I hope you can expect a lot. 

If you have made it through all of this mess and you have any questions, or would just like to talk, send me a PM and we can email or Skype. I’m sorry that this has been so long. 

Good luck.

As to blind characters, I've written one and I'm writing another. The one I have written is a sort of assassin/spy in a science-fiction universe, he has artificial eyes that allow him to see better than most people do. So he's really only blind in a very technical sense, because of his very technical senses. Sorry had to do it.
The other ,the one I'm working on now, is a mage in a fantasy world. He started out life as a mercenary, but was blinded in battle, once he became blind he realized that all the lines and colors that he always thought were part of the regular world, were actually something else and he realized that he always had the ability to see the flows of magic, he just never knew what they were. He can use these lines these flows to control and direct his magic, but it is acknowledged that while this is a very rare gift and one that, were they to have discovered it while he could still see would have made him one of the greatest mages who ever lived, instead it simply allows him to be a mage at all.  
It is that last point, that was so important to me. I wanted to write a character who had to overcome a disability, a disability that did in fact limit them, not just something that got overcome or cured, not something that turned out to be a blessing in disguise, or something that just made them stronger. 
He is  not necessarily a nice person, he is not inspirational, he's kind of an asshole at times, because that's who he is. I genuinely feel it's important that blind people are represented as many different ways as possible, as good, as bad, as strong, as weak, as nice, as not nice as powerful, and as not so powerful. Because it is only when people are exposed to  varied  and nuanced portrayals of blind people will they realize that blind people are, exactly that, people. 
As to the question of ""should only blind people be allowed to write blind people"" absolutely not, that being said yeah it's probably a good idea to actually talk to blind people before you do it. I mean, you wouldn't write a book set in Harlem without actually spending a little time researching it, you wouldn't write a Chicano character without having talk to a few, why would you think you could write a blind person without having spent time with one?",,,2,0,0,

Invert colours, increase contrast, make everything yellow on black, grayscale, inverted grayscale.

(00:00)
[Photograph of a small village in the desert, calm music playing, female voice speaks calmly]

I call Kay, my best friend I've never met.

(00:08)
[Female wearing glasses types on a laptop]

She's half way around the world and neither of us travler very often, but I talk her more than people I've know for years who live right down the street

(00:15)
[Same female in bed, typing next to a yorkshire terrier]

A year ago I started posting videos to YouTube discussing some of my experiences as a young, chronically ill person. I didn't think anyone would watch them, but Kay's mother sent me a message I couldn't ignore.

(00:26)
[Text appears on screen reading as follows]

""My 26 year-old daughter has EDS and has never met anyone else with it in person. She loves your videos and they mean a lot to her. I would love for her to be able to talk to you. Google me. I'm a legit person and a concerned mom. I'm afraid she feels hopeless right now and fear the worst.

(00:46)

I didn't have to Google her to know that Kay wasn't in a good place. I've been low before. My mother has been a concerned mother before. I think its all part of having a rare genetic condition that no one's ever heard of, and declining health. Some times you feel hopeless. A lot of the time, you feel like an alien. It's isolating.

(01:04)
[Timelapse footage of driving on a desert road. Imagery of ramshackled homes.]

Life is different with the condition Kay and I have. Expectations have to shift. Old dreams slowly fade.

(01:14)
[Female sleeping in bed]

A lot of the time is spent resting in bed, mourning what life should have been, or could have been. Sometimes I miss the naivety of thinking that life could just go back to normal, but I realize that it never really was anyway, and I just try to shrug it off.

(01:32)
[Female upright in bed drinking from a coffee mug and playing with her dog]

I called Kay on the phone that night and we talked for a couple of hours. Laughing, crying, relating. It was both comforting and frightening.

(01:42)
[Panning footage of a desert scene]

Kay is struggling with a lot of the same things I am having difficulty with, but she is also loosing her vision. While I knew that loss-of-vision was a complication of EDS, I'd never really thought about it before.

(01:55)
[Female playing with dog in bed]

I usually try not to think about all the hardships that I might have to deal with in the future. There's a seemingly never-ending list. It's daunting.

(02:05)
[Female walking in desert toward small shack, slow fade to black]

Kay made me confront vision loss as a possibility in my near future. I appear to have similar symptoms that she had when she first started experiencing vision loss.

(02:17)
[Old black-and-white footage of seamstresses and dancers]

I still worry a lot about whether or not there's a place for people like me in a world where we tend to value the ones, who work their way from the bottom to the top. We're told to push ourselves until we break. My body is already broken.

(02:33)
[Female standing near and walking around desert shack]

I want to be able to think that I could handle blindness, but the loss of vision would make things more difficult. I live in a visual world.

(02:43)
[Female sitting in bed, using a laptop]

I started watching more films while I was on bed-rest. Film was there when my life had to stop due to illness; a refuge; a silver lining.

(02:53)
[Female holding a Canon camera]

I struggle imagining a world where film would no longer be a visual experience.

(02:58)
[Female sitting in the desert, the breeze in her hair]

Someone somewhere once said that ""It's easier to imagine the end of a world than the start of a new one"", but I confide in knowing that another world already exists.

(03:08)
[Female in bed with terrier]

I will continue onward, like I always have.

(03:11)
[Footage from a pedestrian through a city]

I am one of the fortunate few with access to trial-medications, experimental treatments and mobility aids.

(03:17)
[Female on an electric mobility scooter, driving through a city on the sidewalk]

Kay is as well. While I struggle to think of this as a blessing, I know that we are amongst the fortunate few with the opportunity imagine another world.

(03:26)
[Female sits on mobility scooter in front of a large, black and white street mural featuring a large pair of wings]

A world where we do not have to prove ourselves in order to be valued.

(03:30)
[Female in bed playing with her dog]

A world where we will experience love and joy. A world where blindness is not approached with fear. A world where disabled people exist and live unapologetically

(03:43)
[Footage of a female walking on a dirt road in the desert that flashes to black]

A world where we belong.

(03:46)
[White on screen text with black background]

Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS)

A genetic condition that affects the connective tissues in the body.
Connective tissue is responsible for supporting and structuring the skin, blood vessels, bones, and organs.

It is made up of cells, fibrous material, and protein called *collagen.*

*EDS is not rare,*

6f2db2c8-8683-4638-9994-4f11ee8ae081,1496051476,"While I understand your argument, and to be honest naively thinking the blind community would like these episodes...  I theorise that this won't be the end of the Doctor's blindness. 

Why, you may ask? One example is that there is precedence for the Doctor trying to get his sight back, and it going horribly wrong. In the Veritas episode, as you mentioned, he tries to get his sight back - in order to read the otherwise inaccessible paper-based diary, and not the computer (at least that was my impression, anyway) - And this goes wrong because the very same monks as in 'Pyramid' appear to attack him. I thought the the fact he had to blow out the candle and kill the lights so that they were -all- blind in a sense, was his way of accepting that he was much better at being blind than they were, and could use this to escape (Same thing was done in the young adult short story She Is Not Invisible but that's a different story) 
TL;DR - The doctor realises once that when he tries to regain his sight, it fails. Why should this time be any different?

The second point is that we must not forget it was the Monks restored his sight. Yes, they could sense that Bill asked them to out of love, and not out of fear, nor out of strategy - like the other soldiers (though an argument could be made for it being a mix of all three). However there is a reason they want love to consent - through love, the consentor doesn't want to resist. Notice that the Monks definitely do not have the doctor's best interest at heart. As the episode closes, they whisper something along the lines of 'You have your sight back, Doctor. Now watch the end of the world' - paraphrase -  which I think betrays their true motives.

&gt;Could you elaborate a little more on why you can't stand the legal field?

It's kind of hard to explain, really. I had to take a couple intro to law courses (both civil and criminal) for my degree and really didn't enjoy either. Something about law here in the US seems very...sleazy, at least it feels like that a lot of the time. I know that's not the case all the time, but I can't shake that feeling. Plus I'm most definitely not smart enough/rich enough for law school, haha. 

&gt;The area in criminal justice that I haven't seen anyone mention here yet that might interest you, and I believe is accessible, is criminal intelligence.

I've considered this as well, and it's definitely interesting. Unfortunately here in the US (obviously I can't speak for AUS) many of these positions require very specialized degrees outside of CJ. I did some research into it and many want people with degrees in fields like computer science, statistics, research, etc etc. Not saying it's impossible or anything for me to go back at a later date and get one of those degrees, but it wouldn't be for a long time, and I'm also pretty shit at things like math and science to be honest.

Also, and I know this is going to sound idiotic, but the idea of just sitting behind a desk all day staring at a computer screen or signing paperwork scares me. My dad did that for almost 30 years after he got out of the Navy and HATED it. I'm very aware that all ""office"" jobs are different, and I'm sure there's a lot of very interesting ones out there, but after seeing him hating his job for all that time it made me a bit leery of doing something similar, even though I know his experience was only a fraction of what's out there.

I'd give anything to be able to actually get out there and do ""field"" work, so to speak, but I know that's just not possible with my disability. Right now I'm just trying to accept that fact and move on, but it's difficult when it's all I've ever wanted to do.

So most ""web page reading"" services generally go out of business, because people aren't willing to pay the actual cost to have a quality reading.

9f7fbd78-9ef2-422e-8e15-bfce552d43e4,1495669932,"Hey, i'm sorry to hear about that man. I have some type of juvenile macular dystrophy as well (most likely stargardts). My condition seems to be a bit different, but i do have a few pieces of advice that might be helpful. Also, are you in the US? 

First, i'd like to recommend getting assistance from a state vocational assistence agency (i'm a client of the Department of Rehab). In case your vision gets worse, i'd really recommend learning how to use assistive tech (either from some place like DOR or nonprofits like the National Federation of the Blind or the Braille Institute). A few other people mentioned assistive tech options already on here. If you need a short term solution and you have a fairly new PC, you should be able to magnify by pressing the window key and the plus key. If you have an iPhone (or any other apple product), you can change the font size in the settings and enable the zoom feature (located in the in ""general"" under ""accessibility""). It also wouldn't hurt to learn text to speech programs as a ""just-in-caser.""

Depending on how much your vision deteriorates, it might be helpful to get orientation and mobility training. O &amp; M training will help you navigate the world independently and confidently (taking the bus, crossing streets, and navigating buildings,etc.). If you do get past that 20/200 acuity mark, don't be afraid to use a cane. I know that when i was newer to vision loss, i was really reluctant to use mine. But now, i've realized that identifying as a blind person out in public  just makes life easier. Plus, it can be really helpful when its too sunny outside! 

As far as the emotional side goes, just keep a couple things in mind- if you do lose a significant amount of vision, it'll suck for a while, but it'll be okay. It might be scary, but you'll see that life goes on and that there are still so many more beautiful things to this world. Even if you go legally blind, you can still live a totally awesome and productive life. Sometimes, you'll get frustrated by having to repeatedly explain what you can see or what you need to other people, but it'll eventually just become another part of life.

I raised a puppy and am very good friends with the man who handles him now.

You can watch people cringe when he corrects Bentley. Still, my friend isn't doing anything wrong. He loves Bentley very much and they are a great working team. Bentley doesn't act fearful or skittish and is in decent physical shape. If I were you in this situation, calling the school would be my first step. Guide dog schools are very protective over the dogs they train and will voice concerns if they agree. It seems like this has been done many times already though. Perhaps it's time to talk to your friend about safety and what kind of job F is doing for him if he needs to be corrected all the time. Maybe encourage him to take his cane with him to work and practice certain parts of the route with his dog at heel using his cane.

I do have 2 or so blind spots in each eye (for me my vision is flsashy there, and id i stare at something long enough it will partially disappear).  Like I said in my first post, this started for me really when I was 13 (even though I've had glasses since age 3), I lost my license in 2010 (26) and I was declared legally blind when I was 27. My sister has a similar issue, she lost her license at a slightly later age then me (28, I think) but she was declared blind before me, her issues started mid teens too. So it does differ even in families. 
I can still walk around streets, and everything without assistance (no cane), I don't recognize faces easily, normally it takes a few meetings for me to recognize someone. I've learned to memorize people's body outlines, and how they walk, helps distinguish them from far away. 

So, to get to where I am took about 20 years total.  I thinking had more decline in the past 10 years or so. Computer usage probably hasn't helped this, but that's not easy to avoid. 
My decline has been slow and steady, each time I go to the retina specialist the scans are slightly worse. But he normally says it's steady and that's the best we can hope for right now.

So my suggestion on the job front is to look for jobs he won't hate (vs. jobs he'll enjoy). I know you mentioned online jobs, but it would be healthier for him to get a physical job somewhere, if at all possible to find one.

If he's interested in writing fiction for the sake of writing, though, I'd encourage it. As long as he enjoys reading and is creative, this would be a decent outlet for him. He can head on over to /r/writing and AbsoluteWrite.com and get involved with the forum/communities there. You'd have to support him all the way though, including reading his sucky drafts. ;)

Anyway, I know he's so limited in what he can do, and his introversion also makes things difficult for him, but you might also consider suggesting that he volunteer somewhere. I know old folk's homes/hospices are always looking for people to simply come in and talk to their residents (some resident's families visit only a few times a year, if that). He doesn't need to be outgoing to do this. He can simply take a book to read aloud to someone, especially someone who's lost their own eyesight. I know many residents who are stuck in bed all day, every day, and would simply love having a book read to them. I'm sure he'd learn something from these old folks too, so it'd be a great pressure-free social environment for him to help break him out of his introversion. It's not easy and it may not even be fun, but I think it's something you should definitely nudge him to try once or twice. You might have to get the help of a staff member to keep him involved and maybe give him a ride sometimes, but all the hard work would be worth it. Again, multiple wins here: getting him social, getting him involved with his community, making someone else's life better, making his own life better.",,,2,0,0,
7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1494508855,"Voice control is still pretty new.  As I said in a thread I posted a few days ago, I'm really enjoying the Google Home.  I think the biggest thing going for it is the design decision not to include a screen.  Siri on IOS, or the assistant on Android phones, often just fall back on using the screen to display complex information.  The Google Home doesn't have that luxury, so developers have had to think much more carefully about the best way to deliver spoken information.  This is going to be a huge win for blind folks overall.  Up until now, even when sighted developers have made apps accessible, they've never really thought about the best way to deliver information through voice.  It's a completely different UI, with different advantages and disadvantages.  

The biggest thing I want the Google Home to do is keep working on how to deliver more complex information by voice.  For example, when I type some questions into google search, it will return a table of information.  When I ask Google Home the exact same question, she just can't answer.  The developers need to do more thinking about how best to distill the information from that table into spoken output.  

Similarly, I want the Google Home to get better and better at more complex questions.  The other day, for example, I wanted to know what two rivers intersected in a particular town. Google Home could tell me about the town from Wikipedia, could give me the population, but just couldn't pull out the information I wanted.  So I had to go to my computer, pull up the Wikipedia article, and do a search for the word river.  Google had this information, both from Google Maps, and from Wikipedia.  I think it's just a matter of time before it can answer more complicated questions like this.  And when it can, that's going to be a huge savings.  No more searching through long articles to get the information I need; just ask the question, and get a quick, short, spoken answer.  For the first time, this will give us something similar to a sighted person's ability to skim a website for information.  

The last thing that would be nice is a ""pause"" or ""slow down"" feature.  After getting the Google Home to give me the address to a business, I'd like to be able to say something like ""OK Google, I want to note that address down.""  When a human gives you an address, phone number, etc, they naturally pause, and give you a minute to write each part down, and confirm you've got it. Google Home still just spits the address out in a long string.  When she knows I'm taking notes, she could say something like ""OK, that's 21 Main Street,"" and then start listening for me to say things like ""OK, Yes, Uh-huh"" or whatever before continuing with the city, then the zip code, etc.  She could also respond to ""How do you spell that?"" for streets, cities, etc.  This would make dealing with her a bit more like dealing with a real human, who understands the context of what you're doing with the information, and that the context matters in how fast they should give you the info, if they should spell unfamiliar names, etc.

For example, when going out to eat, my wife will ask where I want to sit; she usually has an idea (I usually sit with my bad side against the wall), but may change if there's a bad glare I'd be staring into or something.

Similarly, I usually prefer people walking on my good side and a few friends tend to move there automatically.  However, again, when out with my wife and kids, it may change if I'm taking my older son's hand (I'll walk behind her instead and have him on my good side) vs. carrying my younger son.

If I'm meeting someone new (like when I started a new job), I'll generally let people know ""this is my good side"" as I shift to where it's comfortable for me.

You all seem to be forgetting the emergence of narrator as a viable option for accessing windows, too. Microsoft's renewed commitment to making things accessible has brought vast changes to narrator, and if you haven't checked it out recently, Features such as Braille support, and access to speech while installing windows, are  welcomed enhancements to the screen reader. It thrills me to no end, to see Technology Titans such as Microsoft and Amazon following apples lead, and endeavoring to make all of their products more accessible to people with disabilities.

It'll run you a few hundred dollars, but there are ones that can go from standing to sitting with the push of a button or with a tiny bit of manual effort. He doesn't seem to have a lot of options, so this will also be worth it for him. (It's actually worth it for everybody . . . but I digress.)

Even if he just stands for 5 minutes a day, it will make a marked difference for him. My suggestion would be either to (1) prescribe it to him or (2) use the buddy system. With (1), you make him promise to do it a few minutes a day (2-5 minutes) and you increase it by a few minutes every year. With (2), you get a standing desk for yourself and say that this is what you're doing to stay fit; and tell him he should try it, too. Get him energized about it. Talk about it, talk it up, make it a competition, like: ""man, I stood for a whole 30-minute stretch yesterday!""

Although the above doesn't seem like much, studies have shown that standing/moving every 20 minutes is better for your health than 2-3 hours of exercise a week. A lot of people are simply exercising to ""look good"" vs. to ""be healthy."" If you're interested in the latter, moving around every 20 minutes, or fidgeting (throw away your fidget spinners!), or getting a standing desk can help you, along with eating well.

W.r.t. diet, newer studies reproducibly show that sugar is the devil, carb-rich foods should be eaten in moderation, and good fats can help you lose weight. Come to think of it, cooking is another activity he might actually enjoy. He can do it in his own home and, these days, have most things delivered if he doesn't feel like going shopping. Again, this is something that will have multiple benefits down the line, from saving money to eating healthier to being more independent.

All of the above I suggest from my own experience. I don't have his disability or his interests, but I do all of the above, enjoyably and without much effort these days.

The only issue that self-hosted wordpress has, that wordpress.com does not, is that not all third party plugins are carefully checked for security.  So long as you're using popular plugins (the wordpress plugin site will tell you how popular a plugin is) you should be fine. It's probably been well written and reviewed, and if an exploit is found, if it's actively maintained a fix will be out in days or hours.  However, if you're using extremely specialized, unpopular, poorly maintained plugins, your Wordpress site could be hacked.  So unless you really need that function, and can't find a more popular/maintained plugin that does the same thing, skip installing it.  

If you have enough space on your dropbox, a Wordpress plugin exists that will back up your entire website to dropbox automatically every night.  So even if the worst happens, and you do get hacked, you could just restore from the backup.  If you don't want to use Dropbox for that, there are other backup plugins that do similar things.

My suggestion would be to map out all the parks in and out of your city. When you're in town, visit these with him. Do a walk around the whole park. It may be a slog for you (and possibly for him, too), but it'll make a world of difference for him. The good thing about parks is that they're generally empty on weekdays during the day, so he'll have freedom to walk around without running into many people. If he's introverted, he'll like that--as opposed to a mall, let's say.

The objective for you is to find him an accessible park (or parks) that he likes. Don't worry about forcing him to go when you're not in town; the want needs to come from himself, if he enjoys it enough. But when you are in town, you take him out exploring. The best parks are the ones that are huge, huge, huge.

I'm introverted and I visit my local parks on weekdays, during the specific times when nobody's around. I take a book with me. I don't always read, but it's good to have it in case I feel like reading. Sometimes I take two books. I'm fortunate that I have multiple miles-long parks around me.

That difference, I would argue, leads to the stereotyping in portrayal because the sighted individual (for example) cannot conceive of doing things in a particular way without sight.

I was checking out about why the writers of Doctor Who made him blind. Did they know someone who was? Or did they just think its a gimmick for a story?

Ok, from reading a bit around, I think it's the 'idea for a story' one - *that said* they know that they need to be accurate in other ways with what they're doing - see [this interview with Steven Moffat](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-20/doctor-who-exclusive-steven-moffat-reveals-the-secrets-of-extremis-2)...
from what I can tell, Moffat wanted... a twist, a shock, but he didn't come up with the Doctor being blind. He says someone called 'Jamie' wrote that in, but had that Nardole fixed his sight after. Moffat *liked* the Doctor going blind, and though this idea of removing it right after cheapened it, so kept that the doctor was still blind. 

I think it's unlikely he'd think only 2 episodes is long enough. My two cents though.

As a legally blind and ex-shy person--used to be so damned shy I was practically mute during high school--I think your best bet is to maybe nudging him towards finding people with similar interests. I don't mean getting on him about playing computer games and reading all day, but more like ""Hey, bro, you know there are lots of other folks out there who like the same stuff you do..."" Maybe suggest things like Meetup.

Secondly, don't assume his lack of socialization is mostly directly because of his disability. Some of it is due to the economic results of it, yes (I know about SSDI), but some of it may also be that he just plain doesn't feel like he's in the same world as a lot of people.

Last but not least...I don't know your brother, but I have a close friend who's a partial albino, and he got a bunch of shit about it when he was younger which effected him socially for awhile.

Have you thought about trying to get in with someone like [Project Wonderful](https://www.projectwonderful.com)? They run ads on a lot of blogs, and unlike Google or any of the major players, the ads always seem high quality and targeted to the readers.  As for paid social media promotion, I'd advise against it.  It turns people off, can be against the TOS in some places (like Reddit), and seems to be more trouble than it's worth.  Another good thing to do might be to try and get some of your articles/posts sponsored, and then just put something like ""This post is brought to you buy so-and-so"" at the top, followed by a paragraph of ad copy.  Ads like that aren't blocked by ad blockers, and don't seem to bother people the way social media ""promoted posts"" or ad banners do.  And to do that, you don't need a website form; instead, you need to do direct outreach.  However, the fact that you're not on self-hosted wordpress means you're going to have massive analytics problems.  There are wordpress plugins that will let you dig into your posts, and get data about number of impressions, unique viewers, post reach, etc. Advertisers are going to want all of that stuff. And as far as I know, wordpress.com won't give you any of it.  Instead, they keep all that info to sell to advertisers themselves.  Plus, they tend to take a dim view of blogs selling there own ads, because wordpress wants to sell that ad space themselves.  If you wanna make money, you really do need to control the hosting yourself.  You can go somewhere like Dreamhost and get a decent starter hosting package for less than $10.  A single advertiser would pay for a year's hosting!  And self-hosted wordpress is really easy to set up.  Plus, having your own domain looks much more professional.  ",,,1,0,0,

Also, did it try and explain what the Doctor was 'seeing' with the 'green lines'?-  At the veritas episode, I thought it was because he was detecting the game underneath all the visuals (just like screen reader software tells you quite a bit about the HTML of the website that a user not using screen readers wouldn't notice.) So it was green and stencilly game-like because the building blocks of the game world were like this... (while it showed 'stats' such as someone's height, age ect... IIRC...) 

 However, now with it in 'The Pyramid at the End of the World', I believe are these 'green lines' are only colour-coded for a sighted audience's convenience. No way he's 'seeing' anything. It's... info he can hear perhaps... 

It seems able to pick up 'info on humans' and outlines of 'solid objects' but not computer screens - as shown when a sergeant offers him a tablet, in which he can't see anything - or - *dramatic music*... combination locks :)

1c102198-3e55-46bd-b772-d49db771c001,1495504590,"Hi there.

When I was around 22 I had doctors telling me I had macular degeneration, but that couldn't be the problem because it's supposed to be aged related.

Last year I took an extra effort to figure out what exactly is going on. It was getting worse, and now I've got kids. It's not about just me anymore, it's about knowing what I have to do to best prepare for taking care of my family.

I've been seeing a retina specialist and he's feeling confident in diagnosing me with X linked retinoschisis. I don't drive at night anymore, and last month I failed my license renewal. Luckily, I have an eye exam from my doctor from the last 6 months the that has my better eye at 20/30 so I got a pass, but I'm pretty sure I won't get away with it in 5 years.

Most things are pretty normal, but there are some frustrating changes. When I watch my sons play sports I often lose track of them, even watching the wrong kid for a while before my wife points him out for me. Driving is a pain, even in daylight I can't clearly see most signs until I'm about to pass them. I feel like I miss a lot of small details too, which can lead to weird problems. 

You start to learn to triple check your work, because while we all make typos, some of us are less likely to notice than others. Most computers I use are zoomed in. I have to ask my wife to read subtitles for shows.

Like I said earlier, it can be frustrating at times, but it is definitely a manageable condition. ",,,2,0,0,

(OK, ok, sorry for the plug. Won't do it again.)

 I agree- can't think of any book/film with a visually impaired *but not blind person* in it. I reasoned because 'we weren't interesting enough' (^although ^ihmo ^we ^are...).... hmm... What about a story *about* a visually impaired fan theorist (more v.i than me)... 

I really like how they portrayed Toph. Haven't watched the Last Airbender in a long while (and completely missed the new series, Legend of Korra - where I found Toph runs a metal-bending dojo...) But yeah, Toph *knows* she's independent and wants to prove it, while her parents want to protect her and even stop her from travelling with Aang, Katara and the gang, as they think she can't. (I think sometimes, even in that sort of relationship realistically there's times when its the other way around. irl can confirm.) I just now watched a short compilation of funny Toph moments - and realised what an awesome character they made... I want to link it but for some reason all youtube thing just disappeared, and it wants me to log in to my google acount. Wierd. 

edit: [here are some cool Toph moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7E-D1KvXxE) - i guess some of them may have been bad taste, but Toph appears like she doesn't care.

And [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyg_HLyXxgo) is a compilation of when she beats the Boulder - when she's teaching Aang (I forgot how tough a teacher she was) and... seems she, like Anakin, doesn't like sand.... for both there is a character reason, but for her waaay more of a reason.

Like they at least mentioned in Doctor Who as of late (sonic sunglasses can do echolocation Ihmo - they are sonic after all, hence the 'green lines' that sighted audiences see)... but I agree with the guys here in that they **SHOULD HAVE** called that 'thing on the computer that reads to you' - screen readers by name. I also think his sonic screwdriver, while short, could work as a 'white cane' in a way...

 Still, I have a theory on why the Doctor doesn't have such things - most of it is because he doesn't WANT anyone to know he's blind at the start because he's the one thinking of it as a weakness, and not the writers. (More like Kaanan... the Doctor became blind due to a space complication while protecting his new companion Bill, while Kaanan was injured by Maul while protecting his apprentice Ezra.) (The metaphor extends! - except Kanaan *told* his friends.) 

If I work at it, I could post said theory today. :) 

&gt; Btw, thanks for actually considering asking people for their thoughts before writing about us. 

Aw, shucks. Thanks... Wait, I don't have a story in mind if that's what you mean... yet.... (fanfic on the other hand.......) 

I'm sure the kids you help appreciate you doing your job. :) I'm using JAWS at the moment to test what it can read on reddit, but I don't rely on it... I have another theory some screen readers can help with learning HTML to an extent ... (lists, headings, graphics with alt text - &lt;alt =""text""&gt; and so on are all picked up by such software...but yeah, it's hard to get to grips with if you (think you) don't need it...)

If you're up front, your profile will state you are blind. You want to do so in a creative way though. I had a line once that was something like ""I'm legally blind, so you know I'll always consider you more than just an aesthetically pleasing accessory"" or something like that. So yes, being up front like that is a good idea.

The other way that was brought up in discussion the other week was being more subtle. Include pictures where you've got your cane out when you're out at the pub or something. Include activities or involvement in the blindness sector, e.g. I might say that I play blind cricket. 

Either way you go, when you're chatting online with someone, you should try work in your blindness as soon as you can. For example, girl asks what I'm up to on the weekend ""Oh Saturday I'm doing whatever, Sunday I've got our first (blind) cricket match for the season."" The conversation that follows is ""Wow, blind cricket? How does that work?"" I'm sure you can come up with a way to do it that fits your situation. If it hasn't come up before and you're organising a date, should definitely state it plain.

2. Do you blind players use programs that convert text to speech to play that? if so, is proper text on screen enough for you to play?

3. About the deaf players, it seems most did not had acess to proper education, and due their life complications, they often use Sign language. Some have not the same text interpretation or language that we have, sign language is a completely different language. While they can know more than one language just like us, its not a guarantee, for that I must use a system that converts the good quality text narrative, to a visual world, that they can see and understand with maybe a bit of help of sign language avatars.

It took me a few years of fumbling around with jobs and dropping out after a semester of college and bumming around a bit before figuring out what I wanted to do long-term, going back to school, and getting my degree. 

FWIW, I have a good friend who's a paraplegic - we've been friends since we were kids. For as long as I can remember, he's been obsessed with firefighting. Yeah, sure, most boys go through the ""I want to be a fireman"" phase at some point, but he's lived and breathed it since he was 5. 

He's in his mid 30's now and for the past 10 years or so he's worked as an instructor at the state fire school and volunteers with his local volunteer fire department, helping with training, cleaning and organizing equipment, taking care of things around the fire house, etc. I'm sure it's not the same as going out and fighting fires like he dreamed of as a kid, but he's found a way to be immersed in that world and to make a difference in it. 

I would say if you're really passionate about it, don't give up yet. Keep digging. There may be something out there for you that's related, or you may find a job that's willing to pair you up with another person who can drive, etc ",,,4,0,0,

Sure, if a blind actor was available, I'd hope he would be considered.  But I suspect that in most plays, that isn't even the case.  I can only think of two working blind actors; I would be really surprised to find out there were anymore than 20, total, world wide.  Yeah, that's a problem that could use a solution.  But I don't think stopping ""blindface"" is the answer.  Before we can even try that, we first need more up and coming blind actors.  And we need to allow blind actors to play not only blind people, but sighted people as well.  

However, one thing I do hate is plays/movies/comics about blind people, that are not accessible to the blind.  If you're doing a movie/play/TV show/whatever, and you don't provide audio description, you're effectively talking about us behind our backs.  And that's never OK.  Netflix tried it, but were eventually forced to provide audio description not only for Daredevil, but for almost all of the original shows they produce, thanks to the massive public outcry.  If the play has a blind character, try and make sure that at least one showing is [available with audio description](http://www.acb.org/adp/theatres.html).  ",,,9,0,0,

What you need to do is look at the career as a whole and identify the roles that are suitable - just like you did checking out dispatching. Wasn't your thing, that's cool, still other options.

My first suggestion would be law, but you've ruled that out. Could you elaborate a little more on why you can't stand the legal field? There's quite a lot to it and you might find an area that does interest you - although it might take you away from criminal justice.

The area in criminal justice that I haven't seen anyone mention here yet that might interest you, and I believe is accessible, is criminal intelligence. The various state police departments in Australia, as well as the Australian Federal Police, all have intelligence sections. The roles are civilian (possibly a mix of civilian and sworn, I'm not 100%) and examine data, trends, evidence etc to assist in crime prevention. My understanding is they tend to focus on organized or serial crime. 

At the federal level you'll also have another set of opportunities with the intelligence units that people are more familiar with. In the US that would be the CIA and NSA, here in Australia we have organisations like ASIO and DSD. Intelligence roles in these organisations are looking at threats to national security (which could include anything from terrorism to smuggling rings), but also cover battlefield intelligence (I'm not sure the set up in the US, but that's what DSD covers in Australia). 

Then you've also got the options in the private sector, particularly around cybercrime. Police departments, national intelligence agencies, and defence also run cybercrime/cyberintelligence units, but I suspect the private sector has more of an investment in this type of intelligence than any other. 

So I'd encourage you to consider that aspect of criminal justice. If you'd like to know any more, I can answer questions as best I can.

Oh, and I'm a paper pushing bureaucrat. I work in a state government department coordinating our Parliamentary Briefing Notes (things Minister reads in Parliament when asked questions). A lot of a reading and writing, a head for politics is very usful (I'm as close to the political frontline as a public servant gets basically).

I think this is only how The Doctor is treating his blindness at some points. He doesn't want to tell Bill, because he doesn't want 'to make it real', but I was so glad he told Nardole because he can't hide it forever, and there's no reason why he should. But he is.

Remember he only became blind a few episodes ago. Those who weren't born blind (ie u/Nighthawk321, though you don't need to answer this, Nighthawk, by any means) - what was it like in the first few days? Did you have moments of weakness or doubting yourself before you realised 'stuff hating my disability, I'm going to accept it and get on with my life'? Well, I think that's what the Doctor's going through.  (Myself having not experienced this being born mildly visually impaired, I can't imagine what it must be like being able to do something like seeing or walking, and then just - not. So that's why I ask other redditors.) 

And I think he was at the end of that process by only two episodes, which IHMO shows the Doctor's strength. Knowing that disguising his blindness is something he wants to do, not anyone else's choice, he was finally trying to tell Bill at two points in this week's episode - yet both times the Monks stopped him indirectly. He disguises asking for help in the lab 'Hello?' by saying 'I'm the Doctor. Saving the world with my eyes shut.' which I thought was a great line but hey, it may be corny for some. 

 He doesn't accept it fully himself, and -this- is why he gets into trouble by 'The Pyramid at End of World.' Because he hasn't told anyone, the 'secret' of his blindness is 'leaked out at the one time he most need people to help him. (Yes, they could've may it different rather than a simple combination lock stopping the Doctor- but let's keep with that idea for now) Bill, who remember, has been led to believe that the Doctor's blindness has been 'cured', has just been hit with the news that - it isn't. Given that she's just discovered the Doctor is blind, she believes she's doing the best for him. She goes to the Monks, pleading with them to save the Doctor's sight, thinking this will help. Will it? Maybe.

The responses are primarily geared toward ""I do/don't like group work"", but one response is angled at ""I like group with others with sensory disability (i.e. like me)"". The issue of liking/not liking group work is separate to the issue of liking/not liking working with others with sensory disability.

3. Question 5 is difficult because it is unclear what information you are looking for. ""Describe the experience"" is very broad. I think what you're looking for is for people to describe their experience from the perspective of how sensory disability impacted/was accommodated/elicited particular reactions from peers/colleagues. You probably should include a short example of the sorts of things you're looking for.

* Puff paint and adhesive dots from a craft store were her friend (and way cheaper than the stuff in accessibility catalogs).  For ingredients like spice containers, she'd puff-paint right on the container- IS for Italian seasoning, Cay for cayenne pepper, RP for red pepper, etc.  For measuring these spices, she had a measuring spoon that would expand/collapse to each setting in the spoon (for example, push the handle all the way in for 1/8 cup, pull handle out one click for 1/4 cup, etc.)  I think this was found in any kitchen retail store.
* Older microwave had dial for timer and other settings, again with touch dots for times.  Newer microwave that replaced that, she used a touch dot on the 5 so she knew where that was and each number around it, plus a bigger dot on start.
* Similar for stoves; set a dot for a typical temperature (350) on the dial itself and a line on the stove.  When she went to a flat top with an electronic interface, she put puff paint over the temp up/down buttons and the cancel button so if something wasn't responding right, she would know.  She'd listen to the beeps to know she'd pushed it from 350 to 355, 360, etc. and just count.
* She had a talking thermometer that was also a kitchen timer; unfortunately, I don't remember the brand/model.  Some newer thermometers use Bluetooth and can connect to PC or phone with text-to-speech.

I don't know where you're at and what's available, but when I was starting to deal with more vision loss, I went to a center for the blind and had a vision assessment.

But when I got to college, I found that I was unable to use the compound microscopes (the ones with 2 eyepieces) because I have monocular vision. We tried setting up a computer relay to a microscope, but the picture was so bad and so slow that I was missing everything I needed to find. After learning that I would have to use this skill in several more classes and likely in my field as well, I had to switch majors.

Now I'm in special education, which is working out pretty well as far as my vision goes, but there are other challenges due to my newly-acquired physical disablity. I get a lot of negativity and discouragement from family and some of my colleagues and professors, who say I should maybe do something else. Unfortunately there is nothing else I can do at this point and I'll be damned if I give up the three years I've put into this degree because some people think you can't teach if you aren't standing and moving around the class all day. There are plenty of options for my field, even if I work with an online school or students in a nontraditional environment (hospitals, homebound, etc). 

My point is: I feel you. And there will be people who give you grief no matter what you choose, so do your best to ignore it. My suggestion would be to work with career services and disability services at your school to see what they would suggest. If you do want to pursue a job that might not be a perfect fit, try to get in with your local vocational rehabilitation office or the commission for the blind (can't remember the name exactly).

&gt;Your much-lauded image description software—you know, that feature that meant we blind people would be able to “see” pictures—thinks dogs are cats and cats are dogs and any woman wearing white is a bride. It invents children that aren’t there and sometimes throws in an extra person, just to keep us all on our toes.

&gt;(“You got married? Again?”

&gt;“No no, I’m just wearing a white shirt. As you were.”)

2. It messes up THAT badly? Hhaha.... :) 

EDIT: Actually that's not funny. Love that hilarious example you gave u/fastfinge (any woman wearing white is a bride... but how do they know who is a woman?) Still, this is Facebook that supposedly says its facial recognition software is one of the most important things.

We've noticed three factors that seems to help people adjust a bit faster. Family support, the level of training/rehabilitation they get, and if they have a goal or target to aim for. All of those help people adjust to the vision loss faster, it seems.

1.  This isn't the first time buzzfeed has treated blind people as a sideshow to be exploited for ad dollars.  This is an organizational issue at Buzzfeed, rather than just a single reporter who should have known better.  You can find a thread about the most recent previous example here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/62fhg2/buzzfeed_continues_to_be_terrible_people_are/

2.  Buzzfeed put multiple photos in the article.  None of the photos they used had alt-text.  First off, this means they're not even willing to go to the bother of making articles about blind people accessible enough for blind people to know how we're being presented.  Second off, it's more proof, if you really needed it, that buzzfeed doesn't care about blind people as a community.  They just want to use us.

#**A touchable tablet to guide the visually impaired** | [1:43]

**Video by École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**

*The scene changes to show the device:*

*The tablet is 2 inches thick, with a face roughly the size of an iPad. It's face appears to be made of a white material similar to plastic, with a matrix of 16 by 12 round metal dots that raise and lower from the surface while in use.*

*It is very barebones and utilitarian, with exposed electronic parts and a visible interior.*

We've developed a configurable, portable, wireless tablet that can quickly provide graphical information to blind users. This new device can be used for gaming, for education, and, for instance, for navigations. for navigation applications, we raise and lower pins so the user can explore with the sense of fine touch a map of his surroundings. The user can thus identify doors, exits, free seats at a table, streets, and navigate in an autonomous fashion. 


[00:30]

*scene cuts to a blind man exiting a train; he is speaking French*

[English subtitles]:Visually impaired people currently use audio GPS to move about. 

*Man navigates stairs, then is seen walking down a sidewalk*

For example, the GPS tells you to ""turn right after 300 meters,"" like in a car. 

[00:38]

*Cut to man facing the camera, titled as Denis Maret, Volunteer*

But we have no spatial reference to confirm this; we can only follow the indication. With the tablet, we could get additional information. If I hear that there is a roundabout on my right, I could check this information on the tablet to make sure I am at the right place.

*Scene cuts to view the tablet device again, and shows the pins raised in the center and around the edges, to show a sort of roundabout* [transcriber's note] the pins are laid out in a grid, so the roundabout looks somewhat square. 

I think that would be really helpful. 

[00:59]

Each pin is connected to a tiny magnet, and the magnet is pushed up and down by sending pulses of current through coils. The magnets latch in the up and down position allowing any configuration to be held indefinitely with no power consumption. In the future we're extending the concept to normally sighted users by making the device flexible, this allows us to make gloves and sleeves for virtual reality and augmented reality applications, allowing the users to feel what they're interacting with.

Communicate with your professors.  I would email my profs prior to class starting to give them a general overview of my limitations and what was on the form.  Before or after first day in class, I'd show them the form and talk out basics; we'd talk again as something new would come up (group work, how to do certain homework, how to take tests, etc).
