Firstly, you already know this but your husband is a grade A twat.

You'll be surprised how quickly you will learn to adapt to the sight loss and can still do almost everything you did before your sight loss.

&gt;I am afraid to be a burden to friends

That's what friends are for, also any family that is near you.  I'm sure you would be there for them if they needed you, let them do the same for you.  Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it while you learn to adjust to your new situation.

/u/2f38d979-2b07-4f62-a39d-616ceee93175 has listed some great resources if you are in the US.  If you're not in the US, which country are you in?  We can try and point you in the right direction of localised resources that may be able to help.  If you're in the UK I can help you there.

If you're in the UK then most supermarkets do home delivery and big chain pharmacies like Boots will do free home delivery.

You'll probably need a white cane - depending on your type of sight loss it will be either a long cane (the type normally associated with the blind where you tap the ground in front of you) or a guide cane, which is shorter and held at an angle in front of you to detect any obstacles.

Your local or national blind charity organisations will be able to help you, probably for free and also supply training.

You could ask any coworkers who live near you if they can give you a lift to work until you sort out alternate arrangements.

&gt;I'm terrified. I am not thinking clearly.

This is perfectly normal after such a huge life changing event, I was the same when it happened to me.  The important thing to remember is that you will learn to adapt and there's no reason you can't enjoy life again.

For about the first six months, I was suicidal. I know exactly what you are going through. I remember the day so clearly when I could not longer pick up a book and read it and I wanted to die. I went to bed and cried for days. 

It wasn't until I got plugged into my local center, that I started to feel better. They had group support meetings and activities, all with people who are going through the exact same thing. Right now, you feel alone and I get that. You aren't, I assure you.

And for your mobility and orientation training, they usually come to *you* first, because you need to know how to get around your own neighborhood and it's already familiar. It's important for you to learn to get around and stay safe. 

&gt; I don't know how I will get groceries or meds or get to work. I am afraid to be a burden to friends and am already lonely because of the isolation of not being able to get out.

A lot of municipal rapid transit systems have travel training that costs nothing to you and will make you more secure with accessing rapid transit systems. Usually they give you free passes for a long period afterwards, as well. 

&gt;I am concerned about losing my job.

This is less of a worry for you than it should be. There are laws about that kind of thing. As long as your job is a job where reasonable accommodations can be made so that you can adapt, most companies would be terrified to fire someone for that. 

Contact your State Department of Rehabilition, right away. That is your entry point to *all* of the services. If you call, they will have regular enrollment days and they will fill out the forms for you. You don't need to worry about anything when you get into the office, they will take good care of you.

Contact your local blindness support center, they will likely start your mobility (cane) training right away. Orientation and mobility are your two first and biggest challenges. Once you master those things, it will raise your confidence level, I know it did for me. 

You are going to get a backpack and carry home your meds. I bought a draggy grocery basket and I wheel my groceries home now from the closest store or take it on the bus if I have to go further afield.  They taught me how to clean blind. They taught me how to handle my money and gave me apps to help out with things, like matching up what I am going to wear which doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is). I am now volunteering to teach cooking blind. 

It took me a while, but I slogged through it. I got apps to help me make everything on my computer bigger and got a bigger monitor. I had to learn to use an iPhone to use blind square. I learned basic braille.

The best thing about the training at the blind center, was that a lot of it was done by either blind or legally blind trainers. They really inspired me and I realized that there wasn't anything I could not eventually master. 

I started losing my vision right before Christmas almost 4 years ago. It's been eye opening, if you will pardon the pun.

---

00:00 The video opens with a close up of an elevator calling panel, with the two buttons laid out for up and down. A hand reaches into the frame and presses the up button. 

00:04 The elevator door opens to show a young woman woman with dark hair wearing a backpack and long-sleeve shirt, her hands crossed in front of her. She is staring stoically ahead. We see a young man wearing a baseball cap, light colored t-shirt, and a backpack step into the elevator looking at his phone.

00:12 The elevator door closes, and the young woman begins to speak. The young man, who is wearing headphones, looks surprised and answers. They have a short conversation and the man looks quizzically at the woman as the camera jumps to showing her feeling for the braille on the elevator panel, eventually selecting floor 7. After the selection, his face shows a 'not bad' expression.

00:29 The scene cuts to now being inside a hallway of a new, dimly lit apartment building. The woman is walking down the hallway, clearly aware of where she is going. The man comes around the corner, looking at his phone and signs to identify where he is. As soon as he sees her, he rushes to get to her, apparently calling out to her because she stops and waits for him to catch up.

00:41 They have a small animated discussion which ends in her pointing off down the hallway, nodding, and both of them setting off in the same direction walking side by side.

00:49 The scene is now inside a different hallway; the man appears to recognize the number, turns to the woman, and explains that he's in the right place. The woman raises her hand in a 'goodbye' gesture, and the man waves back. He turns to face the door he's standing in front of, knocking on it and waiting. The woman continues to walk down the corridor, her hand brushing the right wall as she goes. The man watches her walk as he waits to be let into the room.

01:06 The door opens and the man is let into the room as the scene fades to black.

01:12 It fades back in to show them sitting across from each other, her with a laptop on her lap and him with a laptop on a low table. He steals a quick glance at her, showing her staring straight ahead wearing headphones, and a furtive smile crosses his face.

01:23 He reaches out coyly to tap her knee; she reacts by swinging her arm out in his general direction. They are silhouetted, but the man appears to chuckle as the scene changes.

01:30 The camera opens on two small pizzas next to each other, pulling back to see them sitting next to each other. They eat while talking, with rapid camera jumps showing conversation as the meal progresses. It ends with him feeding her pizza, both of them smiling.

01:42 A new scene; dark, blurry, rainy, very out of focus. After a few seconds, the camera focuses to show the man staring at his reflection in the window as rain pounds on it from the other side.

01:54 A close-up of a piano; feminine hands are playing a song. The camera switches to behind them, showing the woman playing a song, the man sitting on a couch beside her listening.

02:04 They are now standing in what appears to be an urban train station; no one is around, but they are standing between two sets of tracks that look to be about 15-20 feet apart. Their backs are to the camera, and she rests her head on his shoulder. The sky in front of them is either in the evening or very early morning, with purple hues spreading out across the sky as the sun is not visible. The scene fades out.

02:12 It opens on a modern kitchen; the door at the far end opens and the woman enters. She is comfortable in this place, only touching key places on the walls to verify where she is. She is speaking, but no one responds. It appears to be early morning, with the sun streaming in through the windows.

02:24 We are now inside a bedroom. A bed and a desk are in frame, with the desk fairly clean and the bed very unkempt. It is not immediately obvious if anyone is in the bed or not.

02:30 The camera goes to the open door, facing into the bedroom, and the woman slowly walks into the room. She trips over a small trash can, pausing to set it upright. She then trips over the desk chair, which is laying on its front. She picks it up slowly and maneuvers it to its place in front of the desk. 

02:59 Her hands brush the desktop as she does so, and the camera moves to show a closeup of the desk. It shows her feeling used tissues and then discovering a pile of about 15 yellow and red pills.

03:10 She feels the pill container, picks it up, and the scene changes to outside the doorway looking in as before. She drops the empty pill bottle, stunned.

03:17 She steps back, the camera now on her face to show worry and agitation. She begins to trace her way back through the apartment, now always with her hand on the wall.

03:30 It cuts to a black and white version of them eating pizza, but this time with new information. While she is talking, he is distracted, answering when appropriate but digging for his phone with an unreadable expression on his face.

03:39 We cut back to her in the present time, as if she is remembering these scenes.

03:40 Back in the black and white pizza scene, he continues to engage in the conversation, but reads what is on his phone and then stares off into the distance looking pensive.

03:50 Now a black and white version of them sitting together on their laptops appears. He appears exhausted, fidgeting with his hair, eyes, and hat.

03:56 A black and white version the rainy window. The same scene as before, but now it jumps between the rainy, blurry window and black and white shots of him lying in bed alone. He stares at the window stoically, and the camera then jumps to his hand tightly holding onto something.

04:08 We are now in the bathroom, still black and white. He stares at himself in the mirror.

04:14 Back in bed, he now stares at the ceiling.

04:17 In the present time, we jump back to the apartment with the fretting woman. She continues to wind through the apartment, although the scene is so filled with close-ups that we can't tell where she is in the room.

04:23 The man now stands with his back to the camera in the train station where we last saw them both. He is in the middle of the frame, staring outwards at the sky. He takes a breath, almost resolutely. Suddenly, he looks to his left, surprised; the woman slowly comes into frame. She almost walks past him, but he stops her by putting out his arm.

04:43 A short conversation ensues as she stands in front of him. She slowly moves her hand up his arm to feel his face, as if unsure of who is standing in front of her. The camera shows her face looking unsure.

04:57 We jump to him staring at himself in the mirror, but now it's in color.

04:58 She continues to feel his face and says something, perhaps in recognition.

05:00 It cuts to him lying in bed, in color, staring at the ceiling.

05:04 Back in the train station, she pauses.

05:07 A cut to them eating pizza, in color this time. He stares at his phone and starts to look at her.

05:08 In the train station, she steps closer.

05:10 In color, he is staring at his laptop, hand over his mouth, and appears to be crying.

For what it is, I was very impressed. The braille definitely makes a click refreshing, but it wasn't terribly loud. The refresh does take a little longer than most displays. Connecting it to my phone was very smooth. I also like that it has the ability to read files off an SD card for times you want it disconnected.

If DOR was paying for it and I wanted a pocket display to accompany my existing larger display, I would personally prefer the smart beetle (14 cell) from HIMS. The build design, braille, and especially the buttons buttons seemed nicer than the freedom scientific focus 14 blue I've used. It has cursor buttons, which the orbit reader does not. Overall it was just a nice display to use when I tried a demo of it. It might be a little smaller than the orbit reader, I'm not too sure. 

I am personally going to buy the orbit reader when it comes out as I am buying it cash, and I didn't see $800 or more difference between the orbit reader and the more expensive small displays for my uses. If it were a more affordable option, I'd pick the smart beetle. ",,,1,0,0,

[First, you can translate the information on the invitation into braille](http://www.brailletranslator.org/). 

Then you can put the braille directly on the invitation either by using a [braille labeler](http://www.braillebookstore.com/Handheld-Braille-Labeler.1) which will print clear labels that you can stick onto the invitation itself.  Or you could use a [braille stylus and slate](http://www.braillebookstore.com/Labeling-Slate.1) to add braille directly on your invitation.

Space is going to be an issue assuming your invitation is the size of a normal card, so you may have to limit the amount of information.  There are two levels of braille, contracted and uncontracted, or grade 1 and grade 2.  Obviously grade 2 would save space, but the labler only has the most common grade 2 braille and may not contain all of the braille you need.

Another option would be to send a note in braille that is separate from the invitation itself, that way you won't be concerned about space.",,,1,0,0,

Ummm, I wish you could speed up speech.  There's a few things I would change, umm, I mean, ummm, you know I wish, I wish that you could maybe have less verbosity at times. But overall it's something that the blind has not had and and you know we've, we've, you know it's kinda like the newest thing. Uh, this has been available since december 23rd, ummm this is the first release. And I think Dish Network did a hell of a job on there first release I'll be honest. I do. I mean, uh, you know, Comcast has had issues in the past, and they've, they kinda corrected that. I think Dish Network will be, will be willing to do so. When you sign up for the hopper if you're blind or if you have a hopper already, you just have to contact Dish and let them know. Uh, least that's what I hadda do when I signed up, I had to sign something from the FCC saying I was blind. I don't really understand all that. But ummm, apparently, I've heard mixed reviews on this and I don't know what's true, but, umm, the newest release from December 23rd if you hit options twice you should have the accessibility menu. However I've heard you have to request the accessibility mode. So I'm not sure what to believe I wish dish would make that a little bit more, uh, clear. I went ahead when I signed up and let them know I was blind and I needed the accessibility view and they knew exactly what I was talking about. So, I mean, I've not had an issue where no one knew. So, if you're, if you have any issues comment to me, uh, if you you know have any questions comment.  Ummm, like I said, it's not perfect but it definitely is very cool to, I mean it's freedom, you know I can sit down with the remote control, go through the channels like anybody else, and it is, it is so awesome.  Ummm, I mean even just like, I mean I, I mean I have millions of devices that tell me the weather. I mean the iPhone iPad, you know I got an echo, uh, all of which I could ask what the weather is. But I just sometimes like to bring up the, the weather app here. I'll show you real quick.

I mean, I just I dunno why, I mean, it's just cool to have, have that on my, you know be able to access it like anybody else. I think it's kind of nice. I mean, you know just something extra I guess. But, ummm, Pandora is accessible it actually does work. I don't have mine set up or I'd demo it. Uh, I can't remember my password right now and I just haven't felt like messing with it, but, I do know that does work from another blind person.

If your mother can use a computer, she should read the lessons on her computer, and try the tutorials on her phone.  If not, you might need to go through them with her.  Reading the lessons on your phone, while learning, really won't work.  

As for apps, VoiceDream Reader is probably the app I spend the most time using.  It makes it as easy as possible to get books on my phone, from multiple sources.  If your mother isn't part of Bookshare, she should be; it's totally worth it. And VoiceDream Reader can download and read books directly from bookshare, without needing a computer or anything.

I use Google Music for my music streaming needs, because it's the most accessible of the available options.  Anyone who has completed the lessons from Voiceover Easy won't have any trouble with it.  Interestingly, Apple Music still has bugs with voiceover (you can't scroll past track 20 on any album with more than 20 tracks, for example).

I have the smallest 1920x1080 LCD display that I could find attached to an Ergotron LX arm. This is great and lets me move the monitor an inch away from my face so that I can see it, and lets me easily move it away again when I don't want to feel so claustrophobic. With my sight I can't view the sides of the screen while I'm looking at the middle (this wasn't a problem with smaller 4:3 displays). Most games give me a resolution and aspect ratio choice, and when available I'll take a 4:3 screen mode. For games that only show you navigation in a minimap that sits in the corner of your screen this is a must. While your at it, take a lower resolution if the text is too small. This will enlarge the game in a way the developer has planned for. I've been playing games since the 80's so a few less pixels doesn't bother me nearly as much as slow framerates which will be less of a problem the fewer pixels there are.

I also like to play solo and co-op games with my spouse. To make this happy for everyone we use separate monitors hooked up to the same nVidia GTX 780ti graphics card, one as DVI-D and the other as HDMI.  Any halfway decent nVidia or AMD card can do dual monitors without any problem. Put Windows in mirrored mode and game away. Our monitors both have USB hubs in them, so we can plug controllers, keyboards and mice into our own monitors and not have to worry about cord tangles or stretches. This is also how we watch movies, browse the web together or anything else. You can also do this in living rooms, you just need longer cables. Sighted people can watch the TV from the couch (which is just a big monitor really) while you watch an arm mounted monitor hooked to the couch arm or a side table.

After all that though, some games are just less accessible than others. I have always found that driving in GTA using the minimap is almost game-breaking, while using the &gt;&gt;&gt; GIANT FLOATING ARROWS &gt;&gt;&gt; in Saints Row lets me get really immersed. So there are some design elements that can help and hinder, and little you can do about them.

So in summary:

* Use a PC
* Use a monitor arm
* Use two monitors in mirrored mode
* Put your game into a lower resolution to magnify it
* Put your game into a 4:3 display mode to bring the sides closer.",,,6,0,0,

I'm not going to spend a few thousand dollars to produce audio description for a show that several million canadians will watch.""  If a station is stupid enough to do that, some other station will pick up Doctor Who instead, and happily take those millions of viewers.

8f0eb11f-903f-4ebc-8933-c7d1088218fb,1491837904,"1.	Do you prefer online shopping or shopping in a real store? Why?

Depends on what I'm buying.  Underwear, socks, t-shirts or shirts I'll just buy online as they are pretty much guaranteed to fit.  Trousers/jeans I prefer in store so I can try them on.  I'm fairly short so getting correct fit on leg length is important.  Overall I prefer online as most clothes stores have very narrow aisles with display stands bunched close together which can make navigation difficult.  White cane is mostly useless.

2.	Please rate the degree you care about what you wear? 

Not care at all 0-----1-----2-----3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----9-----10 care a lot

7

3.	Could you describe your last experience of clothes shopping in a store? Please involve if it is a positive one or negative, why?

Was looking for a jacket but had great difficulty navigating the aisles.  There was maybe 1ft space between the clothes on opposite aisles so the floor was mostly hidden and I almost tripped a couple of times on objects left on the floor by other shoppers and on an open box left by staff.


4.	How you get information about the clothes when you shop at a store?

Asking assistant or from labels

5.	Please list the problems you meet when you do shopping at a store.

Again, narrow aisles interfere with using a cane is the main problem for me

6.	What kind of help do you (or hope to) receive when you do clothes shopping in a store?

More assistance from staff.  When I ask where an item is, then staff will usually show me where it is then disappear back to whatever they were doing before.  It would be nice if they could assist me the whole time I'm in the store, but I understand they are normally very busy and management would rather be understaffed than overstaffed.

7.	Do you use any type of devices or technology to assist your clothes shopping? 

To read labels I usually use my phone on video mode to zoom in on the text

8.	What kind of information will you want to know when you purchase a piece of cloth?

Size, leg length.  Usual info.  For those with colour blindness I would imagine having the colour clearly stated on the label would be helpful.

9.	What property of clothes will you consider when you purchase a piece of cloth?

I'm usually not concerned with the property of the cloth.  I'm mainly concerned with price, size &amp; fit",,,1,0,0,

Yes, phones.  These days, a blind 17-year-old would be most likely to own an iPhone and use the built-in tts software called voiceover.  Also, many schools are giving blind students iPads instead of laptops, because they boot up faster, they're easier to carry, and the battery lasts longer.  Blind teenagers are doing a lot more on phones and tablets, and less on computers, in the same way sighted teenagers are, and for similar reasons.  

&gt; i think it would be possible for him to walk home by himself and he'd be able to go to places without requiring much assistance from other people. 

Depends on where he lives. Walk home by himself, sure.  Although many modern communities (at least in Canada) aren't building sidewalks on residential streets anymore.  Walking in the road isn't the safest thing!  However, it would be fair to assume his parents took that into account when purchasing a house, and he lives in a neighborhood that has sidewalks, and is otherwise decent for pedestrians.  

Similarly for going to other places. What's public transit like where he lives? Cabs are way too expensive for a teenager, and he'll never drive obviously.  

&gt; not sure if bullying would happen

Depends on the area, the school, etc.  At that age, though, it moves out of the realms of bullying and into crime.  Blind students tend to carry either laptops or tablets to do school work, and we can make attractive targets for theft.  I'm aware of several times in Ontario where a blind student has had his/her technology stolen.  However, in small towns, small schools, or specialty (tech/science/art/music/etc) schools, this probably wouldn't be an issue.  But if theft/violence is a problem in that school, it's safe to assume a blind student might be (or at least feel) more effected by it.  

&gt; people would treat him differently like they're treading on thin ice. 

All the time. Either that, or just not bother to talk to him at all.  When I was in High School (admittedly 20 years ago), I'd go days without ever speaking to another student.  I'd do my homework while eating lunch, and otherwise just be in class.  But admittedly I'm an introvert.  But I know the problem of meeting people can be a huge one for most blind teens. We can't catch someone's eye across the room, and it can be hard for us to approach new people.  And teenagers, while somewhat mature, are not likely to come up and introduce themselves to a blind person.  

&gt; smokes cigarettes and drinks like most teenagers do at some point.

I never did either of these things, because I was a well behaved dork growing up (still a dork as an adult, just less rule abiding LOL).  But I know lots of blind teenagers who did!  

What about dating/romance/sex?  Those can be hugely terrifying subjects for any teenager.  But blindness can add a lot of self doubt (why would any girl want a blind guy?), along with worries about looks and all the rest of it.  We generally get over these feelings by adulthood, but it can add to the teenage struggle.

Nothing is more frustrating when you are trying to navigate information or a story only to have the screen reader suddenly focus on something that's covering the content or appearing between paragraphs of a story breaking the flow of information. Having to navigate down through a bunch of links associated with an ad using finger gestures or keyboard commands on a desktop gets even more frustrating when the act of doing so makes you lose your spot in the content you are actively trying to read.

The most ideal suggestion is to get rid of the damn things entirely, or move them out of the main content area and only have them framed the page and not get in the way of a screen reader. Make them as unobtrusive as possible, or make them easy to navigate around. The frustration they cause makes us only want to ignore them even more, removing their ultimate function entirely as an attention grabber.

Don't have any suggestions for alternatives but do have a few things I'd suggest checking/adjusting in Windows to see if it helps.

* Right-click desktop, in Display Settings make sure font size is 100% and resolution is as high as you can go (bump up magnifier if needed)
* Start Menu, type clear to bring up the ClearText settings and go through the cleartext setup *this will also check your screen resolution).  Some people actually have better luck with this disabled.
* Use the regular size mouse pointers, and check sensitivity/etc.
* Disable non-useful Startup items in Task Manager ( ctrl-shift-esc ) and unnecessary services in services.msc
* Some actual cost, but less than buying ZoomText- check the graphics card (get a dedicated nVidia or ATI card, not the default Intel built into most motherboards) and/or add RAM so everything gets more responsive.

I'm into tabletop wargaming and can still paint my own miniatures. Nothing fancy, basic paint jobs, but they look decent and nice on the table. When playing, I have a habit of losing dice, so I usually rely on my opponent finding them for me. I can still read the pips though. In the future, I'll keep playing even if I can't paint or read the dice any more.

I've a boardgame collection that numbers over 40. I often get others to help with the reading, and will also double check colours and images too. I don't tend to play as much as I'd like though. Certainly you can play regular card games without sight (crib, hearts, canasta etc) or assistance. 

I run both Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Shadowrun. Tabletop RPGs are great because you can do it all as theatre of the mind. The only thing you'll need sight for is dice rolls, and even then with technology you could have a dice program that could be read out to you (I've not actually done this myself, but I'm pretty sure it'll be possible). Even if props are involved, you're working with a party towards a common goal (or running the game for said party), so it's a collaborative effort and others can assist where needed to position your miniature say on a battlemat/dungeon tile etc. 

I'm learning the banjo. I'd never learnt a musical instrument in my life, but this year decided I wanted to. I picked the banjo because I like the sound, and I listen to a lot of Irish rock and folk music that uses it. Admittedly I'm still reading tabs and watching videos, but you could have someone convey the information verbally to you, or learn by ear. 

A couple of other hobbies I have, which I haven't done much with recently, are shooting and model railroading. I really enjoy shooting and I know guys with much less sight than I do who hit the range regularly and even compete in competitions. I just haven't been able to find the time recently to get to the range myself. As for model railroading, again I just haven't had the time. You'll need some level of sight to do certain things, so you'll likely need assistance to build your layout. But you can certainly operate a layout when you're totally blind (my grandfather was totally blind before I was born and he has had a couple of layouts since then).

She also mentions not wanting her disability to be a reason or motive for somebody to take an interest in her.

Obviously, it's upsetting to think that there actually are people out there with that kind of mentality. 

With that said, she does have pictures with her guide dog in her profile.

On the practical side (if you're in the US. If not I will try to get different useful information for you):

- Look if there are any organizations that serve blind people in your area and get in touch with them to get an idea of what services are locally available. 

- Look up your state's ""department of rehab"" or ""vocational rehabilitation"" office and sign up ASAP. They can help fund anything from orientation and mobility training to equipment that you need to keep doing your job. 

- Look into applying for SSI or SSDI in the mean time, as well as using any short term disability insurance you may have if needed. 

- Get in touch with your local chapter of the National Federation of The Blind. (If you let me know where you live, I would be happy to look it up for you if you'd like.) Members can provide you support, practical advice, access to the resources in your area, and so many other things. 

- The NFB will send you a free white cane, no requirements except for being visually impaired or blind. [Click here]
(https://nfb.org/free-cane-program) to apply for one. The attached book ""the care and feeding of the long white cane"" is an excellent introduction to some of the travel skills you can learn with orientation and mobility instruction. 

- How are you doing with using your phone and computer? If I have a better idea of what your current challenges are, I can give you a place to start. 

- Consider enrolling in a residential training program for blindness skills. In my opinion, the best to look at are  

- Colorado Center for the Blind 800-401-4632, www.cocenter.org

- Louisiana Center for the Blind 800-234-4166 www.louisianacenter.org

- BLIND, Incorporated (in Minnesota) 800-597-9558, www.blindinc.org 

Your state may have a residential training program, but the standard of instruction and philosophy of blindness may not be as good. Do your homework and ask people in your area. You can go to an out of state program for training, and your local and state NFB chapter can help you secure the funding to cover your entire expenses if rehab gives you any trouble. 

A typical program lasts 6-9 months (with the colorado center, you live in student apartments that are near the center) and provides instruction in technology use, home skills, cane travel, braille reading, career skills, as well as recreation.

With regards to your immediate concerns, one month after a stroke is pretty much one of the most justified times in your life to lean on your friends for help (especially considering your husband choosing to leave!) 

- Cabs, uber, or lyft will get you from place to place when you can't get a friend to drive you but cost more of course. If you live in an area with public transit, with practice and training you will be able to use public transit to get around. You might also be able to get paratransit services for door to door rides places that might be more affordable. 

- For grocery trips, ask a friend to start with. Once you're more confident to go alone, ask the grocery store for a ""personal shopper"" or ""assistant"" when you go in each visit (to help you locate things on the shelf and read labels for you.) It will get easier with practice and patience. Having a list prepared helps. Grocery delivery is also great if you can get it. 

- For medications, if you cannot read the labels, many major pharmacies and mail order pharmacies offer audio labels (with a little reader) or large print labels with the ""scrip talk"" program, call 1-855-773-2579 to sign up. 
 
The early days are scary. Let people into your life who will try to help, even if they won't always get it right. I promise that when you get the help you need and start to rebuild your confidence, it gets much easier. 

If there's anything specific you have questions about or are struggling with (or ten or twenty things,) or you want to talk, I am always open to it as well. There are a lot of people on this subreddit who have been somewhere similar to where you are and want to help you succeed. ",,,18,0,0,

I totally understand the thing with her husband. When you let your spouse do these things for you all the time, it reinforces the expectation to the general public that you should have a friend or family member help you rather than being given the tools to do it independently. It also can create an unhealthy dynamic within your own relationship.

I actually was chatting with a blind friend the other day about this. We were discussing public transit and uber and lyft, and how freeing rideshare services are for blind people. She talked about how it had been a strain on her marriage in the past to keep having to ask for rides when taking their kid certain places, as taking the bus (where paratransit was the only option) would add hours extra to the trip. 

I also try not to ask my husband for rides (except when we're traveling together, of course) very often. With uber and lyft we treat it like paying for a second car for me. He is often willing and available which I appreciate, but I never want to make him feel like that's something he has to do for me all the time, you know? 

I've seen a lot of this expectation on him from others. Why doesn't he help you with the groceries? Why is he sitting in the waiting room instead of filling out the forms at the doctor's office? Why are you paying for a ride when he could drive you? Why doesn't he just help you use the touchscreen? Why do you need an accessible menu when he's here with you? and so on. It's not like opening the pickle jar in that way.

1-I prefer in person. I look at colors more than anything and will tell how clothes work based on how they feel. 

2-5. As I go through phases. I like clothes that feel comfy and usually go with clothes I know work (jeans and a t shirt, black pants and anything, etc) it's hard to get creative when you don't know what you're looking at or in my case have a hard time seeing it all together. 

3-I went to Ross a while ago for some clothes for a Hawaii trip. My tactic is grab a bunch of things that look okay, try it on, ask my mom, and buy what works. I don't like shopping alone and am kinda a pain in the butt as I rely on whoever is with me. I don't go with patterns too much but rather texture and maybe words but often times not. Colors are what I look for more. 

4-I ask my mom for help. I look at the colors and what feels okay on my body. It's a matter of guess and check. When I'm alone I ask for help from employees. 

5-the problems I meet when shopping anywhere is running into people. Clothes stores especially have a lot of tight squeeze paths and things in the middle of the floors. I have to be really cautious when walking around, finding things, and asking for help. Another problem is finding helpful employees. I get it, it's a long day and I'm a pain but I really do need help. 

6-I want someone who is truthful to me. The biggest help is when someone tells me the truth about things on my body. Another big help is someone who is okay with sitting with me and just being patient. It's just as frustrating for me as it is you. 

7-my phone is my number one tool. My camera gets full really quick.

Comcast and Verizon are not available in my area, Dish Network is, and so I went ahead and switched to them. I...I really just like it. I mean, here's another thing that I like to, I...being a sports fan, you know having to flip through channel, I didn't wouldn't know who's playing until you know hopefully the announcers would say something.

Take an audiobook narrated by a human, and speed it up to a speed similar to that of your screen reader, using Goldwave or another program that can modify tempo.  I find about 400 percent speed increase results in a similar length for the human recording and the tts recording.  It doesn't matter how long I listen to the human, I can't understand anything at all.  My theory is that our brains are extremely good at recognizing patterns. When TTS is speaking, it always says the same word the same way, pauses the exact same length at the end of a phrase, etc.  I think our brains can easily pick up on these patterns.  When a human is reading, she uses a different tone with every phrase, and might not always say the same word the exact same way every time. Thus, when we speed a recording of a real human up to 700 words per minute, we can't understand it at all.",,,2,0,0,

Ontario has a school for blind children (W. Ross), and that comes up often, with low vision kids bullying someone who is total.

Just because a kid has vision loss, doesn't mean they are always good, either. I also knew a low vision teenager who hung out with a rough crowd, and they ended up stealing a car and taking it on a joy ride. They ended up getting into a car accident and killed themselves and an innocent bystander. I do not know if the low vision kid was driving, but I imagine that was a possibility.

One issue that often comes up with dating someone with visual loss is the lack of visual cues when someone is interested. A lot of non-verbal cues are used in flirting (hair touching, smiling, blushing, being checked out) that are missed if someone can't see them.

For some people with vision loss as well (more often if they were born blind), blind mannerisms (they also used to be called blindisms  http://blindchildrensfund.org/for-families/tips-for-parents/blindisms-strange-behaviors-that-have-meaning/ ) can be a huge disruptive factor.

For my mom who is legally blind, I know some things that drive her nuts are:

When I move things from where she expects them to be because she can't find them 

When we are at home or a restaurant and she doesn't see the wine or water glass and she knocks it over she gets angry. So I try to remember when water is put down to ask her if I can show her where her water glass is. Then I kindly guide her hand to the glass. 

At a restaurant I try to call ahead when making a reservation and request a table with good lighting to optimize shadows-- this helps her a bit (obviously this depends on level of vision)

Also when picking restaurants we prefer places that are quieter if possible since the she can't see faces/read lips so hearing is important. 

I bought her the Amazon echo which she loves because she can listen to music and audiobooks and ask what time it is, weather, set an alarm/timer etc. 

Hope this helps!!

I also listen to text to speech at probably around the upper end that most blind people listen to, and I have since shortly after I lost my sight and started using TTS. 

I don't know what the conversions are, but for examples I typically listen to Alex on iOS at 100% (which is not fast,)  Acapella Peter in Voice Dream Reader set to “700wpm” (I really wish it could go much faster, and that there were shorter pauses,) ETI-eloquence Reed on Android at 90-95%, espeak-ng max in NVDA at 50-55% with rate boost checked (100% without rate boost is slow to my perception, although I don't know if rate boost just means it goes to ""150%"" in that case or if the scaling is completely different. I feel like I listen slower with espeak, but I don’t know if that’s true.) I use exclusively male voices, and typically set the pitch slightly lower than default. 

Is it at least in part some mix of natural ability and practice, and it just so happens that sighted people listen to fast speech far less than blind people do from lack of incentive? My sighted husband couldn't understand the clips, and can't understand my TTS at full speed although he picks up words here and there, but he can understand my Voice Dream voice with effort if I dial it down to 500 or comfortably at 400, which seems above-average. I'm inclined to believe that this is just from a lot of exposure.

The article says: 

&gt; ""That hyperactive radio announcer spewing fine print at the end of a commercial jabbers at 10 syllables per second, the absolute limit of comprehension for sighted people. Blind people, however, can comprehend speech sped up to 25 syllables per second.""

The [""24 syllables per second""]
(https://rdouglasfields.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/24sps.wav) clip from the source blog is very understandable to me.  Understandable enough that I wonder if they had a big enough sample of blind people (or the right conditions.) The author says in the comments: 

&gt; “ no sighted person is known who can attain the listening speeds of these individuals who are using their visual cortex for auditory processing.”

This just leaves me even more curious. I wonder what you would see if you put me in an fmri today, or when I first started losing my sight. “Blindness changing your brain is the only way people develop this ability” seems so reductionist when I think about all the possible reasons why I have it (despite continuing to receive substantial visual input,) and why others don’t. I’m interested to hear what other people’s experiences on this topic are as well. ",,,2,0,0,

Please list the problems you meet when you do shopping at a store. 
Reading: price tags/size tags/sale signs
Stuff: visually there will be a tone of stuff on the table/racks. Some will be the same color but a different shape. Just to much everything everywhere.
Finding: some big stores put all brands together. Grouping by items would make things soooo much better.
What kind of help do you (or hope to) receive when you do clothes shopping in a store?
I just want help finding stuff. 
Do you use any type of devices or technology to assist your clothes shopping?
I normally bring someone with me. If not I tend to try and know what I am looking for so the person just has to help find it and if it doesn't work out they have an idea of what I want. In other words shopping is a task

I think it varies for each person. I happened to start losing my vision at a convenient point in my life because i was starting to grow and develop my identity then. My vision started changing a few years back when i was in my mid-teens, so i still had access to resources (o&amp;m, daily living skills training, basic tech and labeling training) from my school district and youth organizations for the blind. Because i was sighted, i had a point of reference to determine when i wasn't being treated fairly or given sufficient accomodations. And since i had a bit rough start transitioning into the visual impairment world (learning how to explain my situation to others when i didn't entirely understand or feel comfortable with it), i was forced to quickly learn self advocacy. Unfortunately, the world that we live in is not perfect, and we all will inevitably be discriminated against at some point in time. But, because i had to learn how to fight for access suddenly and randomly, i feel more prepared to handle the ""real world.""

But, i acknowledge that things are different for every person, based off of the resources and support available to them, the time they start losing their vision, their personal talents and skills, etc.",,,3,0,0,
bd938754-7e97-4f4f-a7c2-5285808657fc,1491880286,"Generally speaking, most people with vision loss can identify what is behind them through three different ways. 1) Remembering the item is there from a previous trip, 2) feeling it with the cane, then walking past it and 3) hearing the item (if it makes a sound or through echolocation). 

If they are low vision, they can also turn around and possibly see it.

This question gets asked a fair bit, and there is one issue that I've found comes up often, that doesn't have a good compromise. There are a few different types of tips for the cane (pencil, marshmallow, roller, ball tip, etc). The more sensitive the tip (the pencil and new marshmallow ones especially) get stuck in crack a fair bit (especially if someone is just learning and haven't learned all the different techniques yet). You can use a less sensitive one that rolls over the cracks (ball tip or roller), but sometimes they aren't sensitive enough.

And Ambutech's Dakota disk tip.... I can see why they sell it, but it doesn't really tell you much of anything.

Double tap the Menu button, the item in the top left-hand corner of the screen that says ""menu"".  Then you can swipe through the options that appear: Shop past purchases, Shop by department, Your orders, Your account, Help and about, contact us, change location, and lastly, log out.  Double tapping on any one of these options will launch your desired function. Want to shop by department?  Then, double tap on shop by department.  Each item in the shop by department subcategory is marked up with an H1 tag, so you can quickly flick up/down through the available products in each sub category by using the rotor jesture to select headings, and flick up/down through the list. Double tap on any item for an item description, reviews, the ability to add the item you chose to your cart, etc. If these options are two time consuming, use the search feature, which is the sixth item in presentation order if your swiping from left to right in the app.  The field is labeled ""what are you looking for today"".  Double tap and a search box will load, offering you the handy option to key  in or dictate a product by name.  Want to buy apples, for example, type apples, and double tap search and then you'll be shown a  list of all the Apples PrimeNow will bring to your door. 

As for Amazon not offering movies and shows available with audio description, Amazon has been audio describing all of their original productions and making audio tracks available for any title that has audio description enabled, since the public outcry over them not audio describing Dare Devel.  Now, there are well north of 300 movies and shows, and thousands of hours of audio described content available.

It became even funnier, when the class stopped laughing, becaus the teacher replied:

They don't have lessons for all of the new features in IOS 10 yet, but they're getting there.  And all of the other features work the same way.  As a blind person, the phone is the most powerful tool I have, so it's more than worth putting in the time to absolutely master it.  With the right apps, my phone can be a barcode scanner, do OCR, read books, help me travel with GPS, manage my shopping list, do word processing/calendar/email/etc, help me communicate with friends on facebook/twitter/sms/whatever, help me cook, control my smart devices, and more.  All in one device!  I've gotten to the point where I do not own any specialized devices (ebook reader, orcam, etc) because my phone can do it all.  Why learn to use two or more devices when you only need to learn one? And why carry all that extra stuff?  

There are other mainstream devices I like though, that work well with voiceover on my phone.  The Instant Pot Smart, for one.  Makes cooking easy, and can be entirely controlled from the phone, so no memorizing buttons, or wondering how long until dinner is ready.  Blind people can, of course, learn to cook with regular ovens/stoves, etc.  But when I'm alone and just making a meal for myself, I find the instant pot smart is the best and easiest way to go.  Easy to use, easy to clean, etc.  

Another set of devices I really like are Sonos.  The sonos app is fully accessible with voiceover.  And now, instead of fiddling with the inaccessible menus on a stereo, I can just use the sonos app to start playing whatever I want.  And unlike with bluetooth speakers, I don't have to worry about voiceover also coming over the speaker. And Sonos sounds just as good as a regular stereo system would.  

I also have a WeMo smart switch, because the timer built into the coffee pot is not accessible. So I just plug the pot into the WeMo switch, and then use voiceover on my phone to set up the WeMo.  But I wouldn't say I love it the way I love Sonos or Instant Pot Smart. It's just a way to solve an irritating problem.

Hi. My name's Austin Hicks, and I'm a blind programmer.  Online, I go by Camlorn.  In the blindness community, I'm most known for libaudioverse, a large library for 3d audio and synthesis, Unspoken, an NVDA addon that replaces control names with 3d sound, and dictationbridge.  

(00:21)  
I intend to produce data sonification tools that can be used by blind people in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and other similar fields.  Audio graphing has already proven itself at the high school level, and I am more than qualified to take it further.

Want to explore machine learning, examine the stock market, learn digital signal processing?  All of these are nearly impossible today.  The best current solution is a Braille embosser, a costly, slow, and two dimensional option.  I can't predict what other users will need, so I intend to seek suggestions from as many people as possible.  

(01:06)  
I've linked demo audio in the description of this video. I wanted to provide a functional demo you could run, but didn't find out about the Holman Prize in time.  The software I will produce will be free and open source.  The Holman prize is 25 thousand dollars.  That's a lot of programming hours!  The tools I will produce are of critical importance to any blind students or professionals in a scientific field.
