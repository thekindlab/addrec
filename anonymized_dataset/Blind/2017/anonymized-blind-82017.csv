I recommend turning on the ""screen curtain"" feature that blacks out your screen so you get a better sense of how it would actually be to use your site or product.

There are many things frequently done wrong on the web, but the two most common are no or poor alt text on buttons and images and a lack of semantics.

The alt text issue is actually more common and annoying for buttons, search boxes, etc., than it is for images, since often it's not really important to know what a particular image is, but it's really annoying to hear the word ""button"" and not know what it does. Most screen readers have a labeling feature so you can experiment and name things yourself, but obviously that's annoying to have to do.

Semantics means using elements for what they mean, rather than what they look like. While for sighted people a list formatted with CSS might look like a table, a screen reader user might not be able to understand that it's a table or interact with it properly unless it actually uses table tags. Similarly, sighted designers often use heading tags indiscriminately because, say, they think the &lt;h3&gt; tag looks nicer and let's just go with that. But if you're laying out a page structure, it's really annoying to be a screen reader user and to have the heading tags have no semantic meaning. Similarly, it's better to use &lt;nav&gt; than to use a styled list (though I'm guilty of that one myself).

Good on you for taking it upon yourself to learn about this.",,,1,0,0,

I would follow the recipe times and put the pan of cookies on a wire rack for about 10 minutes before removing them. Maybe you can do a couple this way to try the time suggested in the recipe without wasting it all. You want your cookies to come out of the oven soft to the touch because they will harden some when cooling.,,,3,0,0,

2) When you say map, you mean map of where the property is located I take it? Maps aren't useually provided in Australia.

There was also a year or two there where Google Maps didn't work with the Chrome high contrast extension. Those were dark days, or blindingly bright days as the case was).

Also, both NVDA and the extension read out the caption.  If it were me, what I would probably do is modify the alt-text of the original image that the user right clicked on, to make the alt text be equal to the returned caption. Then just play a small sound to signify that the work has been done.  That way, the user can review the caption with his regular screen reader commands, without losing his place in the web page, or having to listen to a third party voice reading it.  

Also, if the image contains text, your extension doesn't seem to indicate that at all.  It would be useful, even if it couldn't do OCR, if it returned something like ""Also contains text"".  Many screen readers (NVDA and JAWS at least) have a command to perform OCR on an image. However, that doesn't describe the image at all, just recognize text.  So, for example, the first image on [this page](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-test-imonial), when I OCR it with NVDA, returns:

I'm sighted and have a lot of experience with cookies. I have no ability to tell if the cookies are done by visual ques. They never look done. It is so misleading to rely on visual ques for cookies that I would tell any sighted baker the same thing, try a bake time,  and adjust one to two minutes in the next batch according to the end result of the cooled cookies. We have to base this on cooled cookies only because they don't feel done when they are cooling. 

That is another thing though, cookies hot off the pan can often look too soft and undercooked. I've made the mistake a few times of relying on that visual data to convince me to bake them longer when in actuality they were done and I was now overcooking them. This taught me to rely strictly on the cooled texture and feel of the cookie to base any changes on. You just won't know what to change in which direction until then.

Also, I work for CNIB, and I have no idea why they said no one learns Braille anymore. Not as many people learn Braille, because adaptive technology is easier, but I have a few clients who are still learning Braille. 

Degenerative myopia is most commonly associated with people of Asian descent (often Chinese or Japanese, although some Middle Eastern countries), although it is a genetic condition that anyone can get. One of the dangers of this particular eye condition is due to higher myopia (I would guess that you have a fairly strong nearsighted prescription?), the retina at the back of your eye is stretched more than average eyes. As a result, the stretched retina sometimes ends up with abnormal blood vessels growing along cracks, which causes scarring. Additionally, because the retina is stretched, you also have a higher likelihood of retina detachment. You may also have a higher likelihood of acute angle glaucoma. If that happens, that is an ocular emergency and you should go to the hospital immediately. The symptoms include extreme eye pain (like someone shoving red hot pokers into your eyes) and headache so bad it makes you vomit.

I should also mention, I will likely get this condition myself in the future. 

You can still get training, even if your vision isn't too bad. I am currently working with someone who has better vision that I do. Even if your doctor suggests against it, you can still ask for a copy of your eye report and fax that in to your regional office. Here is the link for the refferal form if you want him to fill it out.

https://www.visionlossrehab.ca/Documents/REHAB_DrReferral_FORM-1_pager-Rev.pdf

Technically speaking, you can also make a self-referral. That gets a little more complicated, because they do want to get an updated eye report, but it is possible to get service without it.

*click and hold left joystick

&gt;if the joystick button is depressed -  temporarily disable the normal function of some other keys in anticipation for a code input

*while holding left joystick button, hit a b a b, or an equivalent depending on the system. This is the key sequence, or code. 

&gt;this triggers all menus henceforth to be voiced out loud for the player. Another button sequence/code can be used to specifically voice only the current menu, and not all menus. Ex.  ' depress and hold left stick button - hit a a b b - release left stick button. Current menu is now read to the player '

Now if you really want to go an extra step and make an impressive impact, you can have the programmers set up a small memory for which menus the players profile wants to be voices. Lets say, a low vision player only needs a few of the specific menus read to them. A third key sequence or code can be used by the player to say ' Remember this menu and always read it'. Now the player doesn't need to hit a code every 2 minutes of game play, and they don't need to listen to voiced menus that they don't need to hear.  A fourth key sequence can be used to reset all menus set to voice activate. Print the key sequenced codes on a Braille sheet and insert that into the jewel cases of the game, or mail it to customers if they email a specific address. ",,,3,0,0,

I do think too that a plan of the property is really a must-have! But I think that most of the time, they are not representing the real dimensions and if someone is using a wheelchair and needs to have space for rotation, it will not be that useful. 

Let me explain: I'm a web developer from Montreal, Canada. For the past 2 years, I've been studying web accessibility. I'm doing it for myself, and because we will all face, at a point or at another in our life, some disabilities (sight, mobility, attention, or other). I really want to create a better web :) 

Anyhow, I'm now working for a company that is selling website templates to broker and real estate companies, and I want our websites to be accessible and top notch! So I'm doing that research on my free time, because that's what I do. 

So a big thank you for your feedback. I appreciate it, mate! And what I get from it is that: floor plan is a must, location-location-location, and after that, it's all the same. 

Quick questions: 

1) do you use a screen reader? if yes, which one,and on which browser? 

2) How was your navigation online? Were there some information hard to find? Would you like it more if a relevant map was the first thing you could see? (on most of the websites here, the maps are on the second tab)

Thanks!!!

c4f82a04-745f-4b72-b4ac-42a7c56532cb,1501631915,"Keep in mind I still have central vision in my left eye (as was the case when I bought my place):

When I started working, I started looking for a house to buy. I'd saved up a deposit through uni thanks to my pension, casual retail work, and then a PhD scholarship (not that I finished my PhD, I quit). So I had a price range (my deposit to be no less than 20% the value of the property). 

Next up: location. For a sighted person, easy access to all amenities (shops, public transport etc) is great. For blind/vision impaired, it's essential for independence. I wanted a place that was walking distance (5-15mins) to the supermarket and public transport, and that public transport would get me into the city (Adelaide has a central business district that's about 2km² surrounded by suburbs for days) within 30 minutes. That narrowed down my suburb selection.

Preoperty type was easy: Torrens title (detatched home) or Community title (usually semi-detatched home with common area needing strata to cover public liability insurance, possibly sinking fund etc, e.g. common driveway. You own the building and the land though, not just the building as is the case with a Strata title). I also wanted nothing much older than a decade (less maintenance cost, nicer in general).

Regarding interior, with such an age range things are quite standardized. I wanted bright interiors because my condition means my low light/night vision is shot - modern builds cover this well. Rooms, I was after at least two but preferably three bedrooms. That's just a personal preference. I live on my own, but I've plenty of hobbies, also it's an income source if you want it to be (which it was for three years, let them out to my brothers, and brother's mate). 

In terms of searching for options, online listings. I'd go through, open up everything that was in my price range in the suburbs I was interested in. I'd then briefly flick through the pictures to what I really wanted to see, which was the floor plan. It annoys me so much when property listings don't have floor plans. That is, in my opinion, the single most important thing to include with the listing. The write ups are always the same really, but they can be useful for those key phrases like ""up and coming suburb"" (it's a patchy area), ""great for investor or the first home buyer"" (an older property on the smaller side), ""renovators dream"" (do not buy, it's a dump) etc. I'd then use Google maps to see where the property was relative to shops, public transport etc.

When it came to viewing, my grandfather offered to drive me round and check them out (which was great because it meant cruising in his Mercedes CLK 240, which was a really nice car. We went for lunch after too, on him). It was more about the utility of his car than anything else, as I said, I still have central vision in my left eye (though it is worse now than it was then). 

Ultimately if you're buying newer properties (anything built after 2000 really), designs are very standardised (at least, they are in Australia), so all it really comes down to is location, whether you like the floor plan (i.e. space is used well, there aren't areas that are compromised because of the positioning of doors etc), and price. 

So with the exception of the increased importance on location, and the desire for mad brightness indoors, pretty much the same as a sighted person goes about purchasing property.

And, yes, I did purchase one of the properties I viewed with my grandfather. Been there over four years now and couldn't have picked a better spot. 2mins to train station (max 20 mins into city, major shopping centre 4mins back down the line, then 10min walk), 5mins to bus stop (25mins to city, or 20mins to beach with shopping, restaurants), 5-10 mins walk to supermarket (plus bank, post office, bakery, chemist, Cheesecake Shop, and a few other things besides), and the all important bottleo (liquor store if you're from North America, off licence if you're form the UK) round the corner.",,,2,0,0,

I made the mistake of choosing a very loud Spanish tapas restaurant on a Friday night for a large group of blind people. Entering the space the sound was like a sonic waterfall. Almost immediately there were complaints about disorientation and feeling uncomfortable. The very loud white noise environment was intolerable and we had to leave. 

Since then I have been more conscious about sound environment with blind people. Sound is a large part of balance for most blind people and they can find loud environments disorienting and even dizzying. My wife found water falls like Takakkaw falls in Yoho park to be overwhelming. She has the same experience at some loud concerts and restaurants. Other blind people I have met are better able to hand loud environments or appreciate them. 

In general though blind people probably prefer environments where they can spatially orient and differentiate directionality of sounds. Next to a waterfall might be too much but a streamside with rapids upstream or a waterfall in the vicinity can be really enjoyable.",,,5,0,0,

They may be able to help you select the best products and try stuff out in person. Your insurance might not cover blindness gadgets, vocational rehab might, but you should always personally check what is available to you.

If you ever go to any blindness-related conventions, it's also a great opportunity to try all the latest gadgets. 

I have tried orcam in a conference demo, and was unimpressed. They weren't super clear with me on how someone could be trained to ""point"" at items they cannot see, which is required for the device to read. The battery unit seemed bulky. The recognition was fine. I recommend going for a demo and personally trying the device before buying, but also compare it to other options that are on the market. 

Some other options to look into: 

If you want portable optical character recognition, KNFB reader (on your iphone or android phone) works well and costs $99 per license. I own and use this. It can be used to read text in large print, to listen to it, or with a connected braille display. 

Another app worth mentioning is the new ""seeing AI"" app. It can identify products, recognize saved faces, read text, and describe scenes or objects in very general terms. 

If you want magnification, the glasses do not provide this as far as I know. If you have an iphone it has a built in magnifier app (go to settings, general, accessibility, turn magnifier on.) There's also android apps that do this with your cell phone camera. If you need more power, there are dedicated low-vision portable video magnifiers that typically cost a few hundred dollars.  

It's not quite the same, but Aira has glasses with remote human agent minutes (who can read, describe, look up information, etc for you.) It's a paid monthly subscription. If I was going to spend a lot of money on ""smart"" glasses, this would probably be it. ",,,1,0,0,

b73591d8-60c2-48e7-82f1-3403ae8fb8f3,1503761689,"Just a quick foot note about the bar scene.

I'm VI, and have been to a bar solo about a dozen times in the past 2 years or so.

First, a question, how do you go about finding a bar stool? This is one thing I still, to this day, have to ask for help with when going alone.

Now, on to the point about conversation.

The bar I mainly went to was the Village Pub in Palm Springs, CA. A few nights a week they have live music, but I normally dodge out before than because I'm an early bird. Either way, they'll have decently loud music going, and when I'm there the bar is probably at least to half capacity.

My method is just to listen in on conversations around me, see if anything interesting is being discussed, or if anything interesting is going on.

Interesting things I was able to jump in on.

1. Two people were talking about maybe traveling to Seattle, my home town.

2. An old man was flirting with two girls and used the line ""What do you think I am, blind?"" I jumped in with ""You may not be, but I am."" Ended up unintentionally distracting the guy while the girls walked away. They bought me a drink later.

3. The guys sitting behind me were talking about boating, a favorite past time of mine.

Interesting things I've noticed. With these, they're good ice breakers if there's someone / some people sitting near by not talking.

1. Drunken guy getting loud with security, before getting being turned away at the door.

2. Some drunk marines getting in a brawl with local college kids. Apparently this time around the bar itself actually cleared out, and I was the only one that stayed sitting. I knew everyone left, but didn't know a quick way to get out without getting involved, so I just kept eating, ignoring them.

3. Drunk guy spilling freshly ordered drink on off duty bar tender, then forgetting he ordered a drink. (This was actually the same guy as #1, he left and tried coming back.)

Now, for the actual chatting.

It's loud, we know it, but they know it too. There is no shame in asking someone to repeat themself. Or asking if they'd like to head outside for a breath of fresh air.

If the conversation hits a natural pause, there's nothing wrong with turning back to the bar and just focusing on your drink for a minute. if you think of something else you'd like to talk about, or they do, great. If not, not that big of a deal.

Is it a bit overwhelming to be in a bar / loud place being VI? Yes. But if you can establish yourself in a stool, and try to tune in to things going on around you, I think it's fairly easy to start chatting with people.",,,1,0,0,

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1504202857,"My thoughts on this kind of thing have evolved and changed a lot over the seven years that I have been blind. First of all, let me just say there is no black and white, one size fits all ideal approach for either offering assistance or receiving assistance, because every blind person will have a different preference, and every sighted person will try to help in different ways. As several people have already pointed out, I do think the most important thing for sighted people to do is ask first. On the flip side, I believe the most important thing for blind people is to try and not react with frustration or resentment when sighted people offer to help them in a reasonable manner. To open a door for someone, as you did, is reasonable and I do not think it was right for the blind person in question to express frustration towards you. However, you could not imagine some of the insane, unreasonable things that sighted people do which we blind people have to deal with. It is a pretty regular thing for people to touch us and grab us without our consent. People will follow us, even when we have explained that we don’t want their help; to be touched or followed like this takes away all of our agency and is the kind of experience that is normally reserved for children, although who thinks it’s ok for a stranger to grab or follow a child? When facing such treatment, I believe it is understandable and even advisable to make it clear that the “assistance” is not appreciated.

When I first lost my sight and learned mobility skills, I was very resentful when sighted people offered help. I had worked hard to regain my independence, and it felt like these sighted people were questioning this independence. I eventually mellowed out, because sighted people normally have good intentions and making them feel bad does not accomplish anything. Occasionally, I would make an effort to help sighted people understand the proper way to offer and provide assistance. For example, if I was dealing with a friend or coworker who I knew I would be interacting on a regular basis. However, for most polite sighted people who I would encounter it would simply not be worth my time to try and explain the intricacies of interacting with blind people, so I would just politely refuse or accept their help, depending on the situation.

A year ago, I lost a great deal of hearing in one of my ears, so it is much harder for me to get around now. As a result, I find myself needing more assistance from sighted people then I required in the past. On the other hand, however, I will say that with my decreased hearing I do find it more difficult to deal with doors that people are holding open for me. I’ve always found it easier as a blind person to simply find the door myself, but now this is even more the case because I have decreased directional hearing. In other words, it is harder for me to tell exactly where someone’s voice is coming from, so it is much easier to walk into them; this combined with the fact that it is often difficult for people to correctly offer left/right directions can result in some annoying situations. For me this is a great example of how you can never know what assistance a blind person might need, so it is always best to ask; likewise, as a blind person, you can never know what a sighted person’s intentions are, or what their previous interactions have been like with blind people, so it’s best to try and default to a polite understanding approach. Honestly, with most human interactions it is best for our default to be polite understanding with limits on preconceptions, weather or not our eyeballs work.

You are correct in that the stab method doesn't work with cookies. And each time the door of the oven is opened the temperature drops out of the range it needs for cooking. So 30 seconds of open oven may result in 3 or 4 more minutes they need to be cooked. This will lead to frustration because we don't actually know now if the original bake time you decided on is or is not sufficient. That situation is very frustrating. The anxiety will be reduced though by trusting in your recipe, and letting the recipe fail, and making only simple adjustments to the recipe after all the data is in from the cooled and tested cookie.

Our pension plan actually offers a disability retirement benefit that is a better option than either withdrawing your funds (and pay penalties plus taxes) or leaving it until retirement age.  You go through a medical review process like for SSA disability, but it moves more quickly.  

Here in KY, I don't think teachers contribute to Social Security.  A lot of teachers work part-time jobs just to pay into SS.  My disability retirement benefits will be in addition to my SSDI, but the combined amount can't exceed 80% of last rate of pay or my county pension gets reduced.

1.  The person opening the door for me is standing in the door themselves.  I can't see you to go around!  If you're standing in my way, this could mean bumping into you, or increased anxiety having to figure out how much of the door you're blocking while holding it open for me.  If you're holding the door open, make sure you're standing somewhere where I won't bump you trying to go through the door, or if you can't do that because of the layout, call out so I know where you are.  

2.  You didn't fully open the door.  Again, sometimes you can't, for various reasons. But if you're holding a half-open door, I'm likely to misjudge, and just walk into the door itself, rather than through it. Painful! Or just try an go through on the wrong side. If I open the door myself, that never happens, because I'm holding onto the door so I know where it is.  

3.  You didn't tell me you were opening the door for me!  This results in a situation where I know I'm approaching a door, so I slow down, and hold out my hand, looking for the door.  Then...know door! I move slower and slower...am I lost? Where'd the door go?  Awkward, and puts me off my feed.  Then five seconds later I realize someone is standing there holding the door. And they're probably judging me, wondering why on earth I slowed down in the middle of the door and held out my hand.  OK, you're probably not judging me; put that feeling down to personal anxiety.  

But any of those things are simple to explain. A simple ""Woe, dude! I didn't know you were blocking the door...almost bumped into you!"" or ""Oh, I didn't realize you were holding that for me!"" or similar would explain why I was annoyed without making the interaction negative.

Client A went in for routine heart surgery. During the surgery, there was a complication and his brain didn't get enough oxygen. It caused brain damage to his occipital lobe, which caused complete vision loss. 

Client B was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at age 20. It is an aggresive version, and told that he will likely lose all of his vision before he is 40. 

Client C is an elderly client who has been diagnosed with macular degeneration, an eye condition that damages the central vision that causes loss of fine detail. While it doesn't cause total blindness, it will make it virtually impossible to read without adaptive aids, or to see her grandchildren clearly.

In all three of those examples, I've had that happen to more than one client. Sometimes the client gives up and doesn't want to do anything... another client, though, may refuse to give in and work hard at their rehabilitation. ",,,1,0,0,

It would definitely last longer, I believe it is made of the same material as the high mileage tips (Although if lasting a long time is a factor, you should also consider the ceramic tips).

Yes, the roller ball is hollow, and when it's worn down enough, the ball comes apart. I don't see that happen very often, though, and when I do, it is usually because the client has been using the ball for a really long time. Where you live, is there a program that helps cover the cost of a cane? In Ontario, the health care system covers 75% of the cost of a cane every year. It doesn't cover the cost of a roller tip specifically, but your area might. 

If you aren't happy with either choice, there is a third option, although that may not be what you want either. It is called the Rover tip, and it is a wheel. The technique to use it is slightly different as well, because you need to twist your wrist at the end of each scan to line the wheel up for the scan back to the other side. Because it is a wheel, it rolls over a lot more obstacles and doesn't get damaged as easily. However, it is physically more difficult to use. Most of the people who use this sort of tip usually uses it for hiking or non-paved surfaces. Also, it sucks in heavy snow (sinks into the snow if it is too deep, too heavy and unwieldy to use for two point touch).

I didn't get to do a full demo of esight, but I did briefly try them at a conference. While I was impressed with how far away I could see objects with it, the view was very narrow and grainy to me (at the high level of magnification needed.) Nothing about it seemed like $10,000 worth. 

I've seen compliants online previously from people who claimed that they weren't able to make use of the devices and had trouble returning them, although I've obviously never bought the device so I can't personally say if this is the case.

Plus, I just don't like their advertising. For example, their site states: 

&gt; ""eSight is a comprehensive customized medical device that can replace all the many single-task assistive devices that are currently available but do not provide actual sight (e.g. white canes, magnifying devices, service animals, Braille machines, CCTV scanners, text-to-speech software).""

Now how in the hell is a pair of zooming glasses going to replace a white cane or guide dog? What are you going to do, carefully scan around with the glasses before taking every single step? And how do magnifiers and CCTVs not ""provide actual sight"" as opposed to what seems like basically a fancy glasses-mounted CCTV system? 

Also, the idea that low vision tools (like this) can fully replace non-visual tools (like text to speech or braille) in partially sighted people is wrong and harmful to partially sighted people, even those on the ""more sighted"" end of the spectrum. Imagine a child who might be made to read with exclusively magnification tools. How much faster (and with less eye strain and pain over long periods of time) might they read if they were given adequate access to audio or braille? 

They really seem to be trying to sell up how ""unique"" and ""revolutionary"" these systems are, probably to encourage family members, donors, and organizations to pay that much money!  For example, the site also has a section of ""moments"" which are videos of people using the glasses. They have titles such as ""Christian sees for the first time,"" ""10-year-old Sophie gets the gift of sight for Christmas,"" and ""John has been blind his whole life. But he can finally see!""

The worst thing that can happen is that they think you're weird, which, as a VI person, you kind of already are. But you might need to have a certain personal style to pull that off.

Not sure what your personal situation is, but my best advice is to join structured activities, like clubs, teams, and games. The structure can make it easier to keep track of who's there and what's going on.

The thing I often get is false awakening nightmares. They're the worst. You think you're laying awake in complete darkness, and there is someone that has just entered the room and is moving toward you. You try move, you can't. You try scream and scream and scream, you can't. You know it's not real, and you try to wake yourself, you succeed. Oh wait, no you didn't, you've just transitioned into false awakening sequence two.

You'd have noticed a section of your vision in each eye is invisibly empty, a blind spot, and causing the images you look at to have missing parts. Like you look at a flag pole and a section of that pole is just blue sky, so you naturally shift your eyes to move the blind spot off of that section and it magically reappears. That's because your brain is filling in the blindspot in an attempt to adapt to the damage, however, you'll notice it because obviously flag poles can't stand with a missing section and books don't have text that appears and disappears depending how you shift your eyes. You'd have noticed the damage to your eyes immediately because that oddness would be noticed too many times for you to ignore.

On a phone, with a small screen, I suspect the problems with keeping track of an audio only board would be even worse.  To make me happy, all you'd need to do is announce each players move, give me a way to bring up the move list in case my physical board gets out of sync with the state of play, and maybe provide a listing of the current position of everything on the board.

&gt; IF you knew all the joy I feel at being able to speak to you to-day, I think you would have some idea of the value of speech to the deaf, and you would understand why I want every little deaf child in all this great world to have an opportunity to learn to speak. I know that much has been said and written on this subject, and that there is a wide difference of opinion among teachers of the deaf in regard to oral instruction. It seems very strange to me that there should be this difference of opinion; I cannot understand how any one interested in our education can fail to appreciate the satisfaction we feel in being able to express our thoughts in living words. Why, I use speech constantly, and I cannot begin to tell you how much pleasure it gives me to do so. Of course I know that it is not always easy for strangers to understand me, but it will be by and by; and in the meantime I have the unspeakable happiness of knowing that my family and friends rejoice in my ability to speak. My little sister and baby brother love to have me tell them stories in the long summer evenings when I am at home; and my mother and teacher often ask me to read to them from my favorite books. I also discuss the political situation with my dear father, and we decide the most perplexing questions quite as satisfactorily to ourselves as if I could see and hear. So you see what a blessing speech is to me. It brings me into closer and tenderer relationship with those I love, and makes it possible for me to enjoy the sweet companionship of a great many persons from whom I should be entirely cut off if I could not talk.

On her writing (from the same book):

&gt; The style of the Bible is everywhere in Miss Keller's work, just as it is in the style of most great English writers. Stevenson, whom Miss Sullivan likes and used to read to her pupil, is another marked influence. In her autobiography are many quotations, chiefly from the Bible and Stevenson, distinct from the context or interwoven with it, the whole a fabric quite of her own design. Her vocabulary has all the phrases that other people use, and the explanation of it, and the reasonableness of it ought to be evident by this time. There is no reason why she should strike from her vocabulary all words of sound and vision.

Some of the values articulated in the book can seem a little outmoded, but it's worth reading. I think it should also be apparent from these quotes that the answer to your question is ""yes.""",,,4,0,0,

I think what it would end up being is something like a selection deal where you would essentially scroll through the board with talkback and it would tell you the tile location and information and if you clicked a tile with one of your pieces on it, it would list all the available moves. So, to move a piece you could scroll through the tiles for the piece you want, then scroll to where you want to move it.

Can you explain what you mean by this? Why does the screen size matter if you can't see it? 


Do you use primarily use talkback on android or something else? ",,,1,0,0,

There's no groups at my uni that are to my liking. I joined an anime group but left because I can't read subtitles, the people were kinda... awkward (not that it's bad, but they never asked for my name or anything). I also joined a psychology group but that was disbanded and sent to the campus that's really far due to lack of members. 

I joined a volunteer group but have yet to meet anyone. 
Classes are good. I'm pretty social in tutorials but I can't approach anyone on campus. Usually those who say hi are older. I don't care much about what's on trend like Ed Sheeran or Game of Thrones, either, and small talk is just annoying. 

I'm scared that I scare others off. I look unfriendly because I have darkness around my eye due to eye drops, make up doesn't do much either. 

I'd try MeetUp groups but it makes me scared I won't be able to recognise anyone. ",,,1,0,0,
