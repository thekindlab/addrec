Uber still has problems with drivers not taking guide dogs, and Lyft has definitely quelled that. As a company, Uber is Morley defunct as they do not treat the drivers well, most of the passengers are very rude when it comes to shared rides, they don't follow the law or rules wherever they end up spreading, they are politically backwards, and have come out as a tremendously sexist company culture in recent news. The whole company is just bad news all around.

I will say that I do work for Lyft as a contractor, making sure the app and features work for the blind and visually impaired, but bias aside, I had those feelings about Uber long before I was hired to work at Lyft.

In the same way, most Samsung products feel, when I use them, like they were designed without ever consulting any blind users.  I'll admit that the remote for my Samsung amp is pretty nice though.  But the amp has no screen reading function, so even though I can easily identify the function of each button on the remote (and a few even have Braille labels next to them), I can't actually use any features of the amp.  Switching inputs and changing volume is all I can manage.  Changing settings, the various apps, and even adjusting the equalizer are right out.

Edit: to be absolutely fair, when I cast something from the youtube app on my IOS phone to the samsung amp using the ""YouTube TV"" feature, the amp will turn on, switch itself to the correct input, and begin playback.  I can play/pause, and fastforward/rewind from my phone.  So that app kind of works.  Similarly, when I turn on my TV, or activate the Apple TV, or play a DVD, the amp will turn itself on and set itself up correctly for whatever source I'm using.  So I never need to even touch the nice accessible remote LOL.  But the equalizer settings are really stupid by default, and I do kind of want to change them and can't. Sigh.  ",,,5,0,0,
bd938754-7e97-4f4f-a7c2-5285808657fc,1487218569,"Photophobia is fairly common with many eye conditions, as the eye has trouble regulating how much light enters the eye. Historically, the solution to that was squinting and large brimmed hats (or staying inside). However, sunglasses have been used since the 12th century, and possibly even earlier (similiar to snow goggles). 

One thing to that may matter is contrast. When there is strong contrast, it is easier for things to visually stick out (imagine a black dot on a white wall, as opposed to a light grey dot on a white wall). That works both ways, too (the green grass strongly contrasts next to a grey sidwalk, but after a bit of snow, everything is white and it becomes much more difficult to identify the sidewalk). Another common travel issue is misinterpreting what they can see. When someone is walking on the sidwalk and see a large black shape on the sidewalk, it may look like a hole to them, or it may just be some asphalt used to patch a hole. ",,,2,0,0,

I've been meaning to update the Wiki with a few more Blind organisations, heres a couple for you in Australia.

Royal Society for the Blind

Vision Australia

&gt;It's weird I'm pretty much mid 30s and still want to look 'cool' at the expense of being safe.

I thought the same when I first lost my sight a couple of years ago and a cane was recommended for me, then I thought

""What's more important - the opinion of people I don't know, will probably never know and if they thought less of someone because they had a cane, wouldn't want to know - or stop walking into stuff and tripping over kerbs?""

You can guess the answer :)

&gt;Like yourself when I'm at home I can get around pretty well apart from not seeing smaller stuff laying on the ground (thanks to my 18 month old kid).

I have two cats that are constantly trying to assassinate me by leaving toys in the middle of the floor so I can sympathise. lol

If you're worried about how you look or what others may think, then I reckon one of your countrymen may have some advice on how to tackle it.....

I have IOL implants, drainage tubes and my left eye is pretty much a lost cause with a damaged cornea. But that's not the reason I'm losing sight either. I had a retinal detachment about 3 years ago and that one was repaired without a hitch. I than had one about 6 months ago and it didn't go so well, and now I'm losing vision due to epiretinal tissue that's formed due to scarring from all the sutrgeries I've had. Doctors are wary about removing it because of how much trauma my eye has already been through.



I have 20/400 vision according to an eye chart but I see uneven static in my vision and there are blurry spots where macular pucker has formed. Everything looks like it's covered with a slightly cloudy film and there are distortions all over and colors don't look quite right either.




Ironically my eye pressure is at the lowest it's ever been, around 6-10mmHg.

The signs do point towards Stargardt's though). Stargardt's is a genetic disease that affects about one in ten thousand people. It causes the macula (the part of the retina responsible for fine central vision) to deteriorate. 

I was totally sighted until about three years ago. Over the course of a few months, my vision began to blur till it stabilized at around 20/400. Now, I have reduced acuity and moderate light sensitivity. Also, I constantly see neon lights. I use a cane now for identification purposes, but I can walk without it. 

It was tough at first, especially at school, but my district thankfully had a pretty good VI program that helped me transition to ""blindish-ness.""

1. Label everything. Use titles, names, ID attributes, and learn the aria attributes labeledby and describedby. Use titles, labels, and legends with fieldsets and form controls. Make sure hyperlinks are adequately written and don't just say things like ""click here.

2. Group your website DOM in a logical and semantic manner.. screen readers move through the website in a linear fashion, so while visually you might have things all over the place, right the HTML code in the order that you want everything presented in a linear fashion. Screen readers will ignore position CSS but Will be affected by tab index. Screen readers use landmark such as headings and links to navigate quickly through elements on a page, so make sure to keep your heading levels in order of importance, and do not have more than one h1 on any given page. Do not use headings to make text bold or strong, only use them to semantically define appropriate information on the page.

3. Use the alt attribute with any important images on your site that you want everyone to experience. Right descriptive but brief descriptions in the alt attribute for images. If you want a screen reader to completely ignore a decorative image, just use the alt="""" method.

4. Pay attention to colors and contrast if you are concerned about visually impaired people trying to read text and links/graphics on your site. Make appropriate, easy to read color choices with good contrast between the text and the background; no putting very light gray text on white, etc.

5. Title your page! Make sure the title of each page on your site is something logical that thoroughly defines what page we are on. That is the first thing the screen reader will encounter when loading a new page. Don't make it the same thing for each unique page, each unique page needs to have itself defined by its title.

6. Stay away from using any JavaScript unless you decide to completely learn and understand the aria attributes for live regions and dynamic content. It's not that hard to learn and implement, as long as you are thinking about it when designing anything with JavaScript interaction. Try not to use any deprecated code, keep everything simple and clean with HTML 5 and there landmark regions such as Maine, article, header, contentinfo, section, etc. rather than using divs all over the place.

7. Add a skip content link to the very top of each page before anything in the header. This link will make the screen reader cursor skip past the navigation bar and move down to where you want it to go, usually the first heading for the start of the main content in the page. This makes screen reader navigation a hell of a lot easier especially if you will have a lot of clutter or navigation links set up in the nav section.

Stick to those methods and you should have yourself a fairly accessible website. There is more to it, but you have to pay me to help you at that point :-)",,,3,0,0,

It sounds more like your character is low-vision. The enhanced senses thing isn't a natural phenomemon, it occurs because someone uses their other senses more. Children generally pick it up easily because that is what they were presented with at birth, but older adults may need training to teach them what to focus on and how to interpret that. 

For someone living in a town that is largely filled with musicians, they may not even need vision loss to be able to pick out details such as what instrument is making what music, simply because of exposure.

The pupil expands and contracts (gets larger and smaller) for light, but it also gets smaller and larger based on attraction. When someone is receptive/warm, you can see it in their eyes because the pupil dilates a little. It's usually subconscious but a trained person can observe it. Additionally, people who are paying attention ardently have a habit of switching focus from eye to eye, which creates the effect known at ""twinkle"" because the light that reflects of wet things like the eye moves a tiny bit. That light is called a catchlight. When someone wants to kiss you, they will almost always look at your lips, which, unless your eating and have reason to believe there's food stuck there, usually gives you a twinkle in your nether regions.

If it's not convenient to use and learn, he's far less likely to stick with it.  I can't blame him, something mildly inconvenient to me can be a major source of frustration to him.  I'm still amazed at the stuff he does on his own, particularly when I think he's hit a wall that I would have given up on long before.

He lost his sight long before PCs were a thing.  He started out on Apple Basic, moved to MS DOS QBasic, and is now writing his games and other applications in VB.NET.    One of the other big stumbling blocks is finding a good tutorial/book.  The audio needs to be voiced by a human, not a computer (so he doesn't fall asleep), but he still needs all the sample code to be downloaded so he can review it along with the audio.   

Your explanation about PHP is appreciated.  I feel like VB.NET limitations are holding him back sometimes.  I suspect PHP has many of the same helper libraries as Python. Hopefully things that would make it easier for him to do more Internet targeted actions, like writing something to scrape websites and simplify the presentation, or send text messages from his PC.  Or just move to a more object oriented strategy for his games.  His computer opponent logic is thousands of lines, and it's full of loosely related variables.

I often use speech-to-text when I have too much to type on a phone or while driving. Whether homophones' spellings are correct, can sometimes be a toss-up. Dunno how many % of the time it guesses homophones right though. I'd guess Google's S-T-T engine is being worked on to understand context (from the rest of the sentence or paragraph) as much as possible.

But who's S-T-T engine do you use?

Do it [the right way](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), and do it frequently.  If you need to touch something that isn't food (a braille recipe, your phone to set a timer, random stuff in the cupboard while you're searching for something, whatever), you need to wash your hands right away before touching any food, dishes, measuring spoons, etc.  People who can see just touch a lot fewer things in the course of cooking than blind people do.

There are a lot of muscles around your eyes, so you can change what you commuincate with them silently, and more quickly than you can with words.

If my child disobeys me, I'll raise my eyebrows and look at them while thinking, ""Would you like to try that again?"" Or, ""Get it done. "" this mostly works because I've said those exact phrases with that exact look on my face multiple times. My kids understand what I'm communicating with my eyes because I've used the same phrase in similar past circumstances with the same look over and over.

My husband is really good at reading my eyes when we talk. If we're looking at each other and he says something I object I can accidentally interrupt his train of thought by squinting my eyes in disagreement, or just raising one eye brow (that usually communicates,  ""Really? Did you just say that? "").


I think a lot of eyeball communication is a direct result of previous communication with words while using the same eye-looks, so to speak.

I hope that makes sense.  

Eye contact is a way to show a person that you're interested on what they're saying. If your eyes are on your phone while someone else is talking to you, obviously their attention is divided between your conversation and their phone. If they're look right at you, they're showing you that you have their full attention and you're not allowing any visual distractions to detract from your conversation.

For instance, when people are scared or shocked, their eyes open wide. When we are annoyed, we roll our eyes. When you're caught doing something wrong/embarrassing, we can look around in the shape of a rainbow (that's hard to explain lol) in all different directions jokingly. And when we are joking with someone, you can wink. When we're angry, your eyes can squint and look very intense at someone, like ""daggers"" across the room.

So, sometimes when there's no other information other than looking at someone's eyes across the room, you can get an idea of what's happening. If I look over at my sister and she's talking to a stranger at a party and she makes a wide eyed, shocked face while the stranger isn't looking, I will know I need to go over and rescue her from that conversation.

For a blind person (and speaking as a sighted person, though one who knows a blind person very well), blind people are going to be attracted to physical form that can be perceived by touching, as well as function.  Visual attractiveness will do nothing for a blind person (unless the person has some sight and can actually see the beauty).  On the other hand, textures that might matter little to most sighted people might be very interesting to blind people, since they relate to the world through touch so much.  How the object sounds as you use it might be a part of the experience as well.

I don't think sculpture would be off the table - sculpture can be touched.  But blind people probably wouldn't care much for paintings, unless they were trying to buy them for monetary gain later.

As an example of this, I have a nice skeleton watch that looks amazing, but my blind friend is far more interested in my $25 Soviet Raketa watch, even though it's very plain-looking, because she thinks the sound of the movement is more interesting.",,,2,0,0,

If you're still relatively young you might consider attending a program like the one at the Louisiana or Colorado Centers for the Blind. The programs are typically a year long and will , in most cases,  fully prepare you for what lies ahead. I know a year sounds like a big part of your life to commit to learning non visual skills... but it will save you time in the long run by getting it out of the way early on in your disability. The  reality is that you'll be taught what typically takes blind children, who are receiving appropriate services, 15 years to master in one year. I'd compare it to a language immersion program. You'll be immersed in the world of the blind and come out the other side ""fluent"" in the skills you'll need to be independent and successful as a blind adult. In most cases your state's Vocational Rehabilitation services department will fully cover the cost of these programs. 

Get in touch with blind people in your area, notice the difference between those who've embraced non visual skills and those that don't. Start practicing cane traveling, start using the accessibility features built into your iPhone or iPad, sign up with your state services for the blind. Don't listen if they tell you you don't qualify now, future need is a qualifier. Local advocacy groups like the NFB are a great resource. 

Don't be afraid, blindness can not in and of it's self limit your potential. Your perception of it can. Don't let your fear cripple you. There are 1000's of functional blind people all over the world and there are millions of non functional blind people.

For example, if the BBC in the UK records the audio descriptions, it doesn't license them to international broadcasters. International folks either have to due without, or record there own.  ABC is probably similar.  I suspect it has something to do with the contract they sign with the voice actress who reads the AD.  She'd probably be owed international royalties if they broadcast it outside of the country.  I can't really point fingers: CBC audio describes all programs inside Canada.  But just like everyone else, CBC programs don't seem to have AD in other countries.

Edit to add: and movies, too. I remember watching a movie in Canada in theatres with AD back in the early days (10 or 15 years ago), and then watching the same movie later in the US. In the US, the AD was read by an entirely different person, using a different script.",,,1,0,0,

The cones in my eyes are dying (Cones are responsible for central vision- detail and  color.) There is no cure and glasses do not help me. My disease has progressed greatly in the past year though I have had it my whole life and was unaware. I was always told I just had poor vision and was colorblind. I never imagined it would be a rare disease. I am very sensitive to light. I can't go into daylight without sunglasses, and I have the brightness on my devices all the way down. I can't read or see details on anything unless it is a few inches from my eyes. Colors give me a lot of problems, especially when they are bright. For example, I can't see what I text people in iMessage because it is white text with a blue background. All of my devices are in black and white or in night time mode because it's the only way I can see text. I also always see (the only way I can describe it-) static. Say I am looking at a photo of a cat. I see a film of black moving tv looking static on top of that cat. I see the static when I close my eyes as well. I struggle with depression because of this. I can not legally drive, and there is no help, just adaption. I feel useless. It's very frustrating, especially with video games being my passion. My only hope, the only thing that keeps my chin up is technology. Right now I can see more than I should because of the features on my phone.

Further, even in towns with taxis or buses, many don't actually leave the town, so if a place you work, or like to visit, or so on is in the next town over, what was once a 10 minute drive in good traffic is something you might have to plan two or three days in advance with the help of friends, family, or someone else you need to arrange to drive you. 

And that can ***suck***.

There's also a loss of the ability to provide that transportation for others. Maybe you enjoyed taking the kids to school, or were usually the captain of the road trip, or whatever. Those things can still happen, but change can really suck sometimes.

The biggest thing I think my vision cost me? Opportunity. I can't go out on short notice very easily, so if there's a party, job opportunity, or just a place I want to go for lunch on a whim, I can't do it. Further, to touch more on job opportunity, I'm pretty sure there isn't a person on this sub who would claim there isn't any favoritism for the sighted, let alone the non-disabled in the workforce. 

This is why I want autonomous vehicles so dang bad. Yeah, I'm biased, because I stand to gain a lot in the way of freedom and autonomy, but I feel like if sighted people had to choose between what I have now, and what they have now, a lot would choose to stay on the side of the fence where you can actually see the grass and not accidentally drive on it.

956626d1-649a-41bc-990e-06ac1faf0297,1487500722,"I was diagnosed with adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy about three years ago. It took them a very long time to figure out what it was. There were a lot of tests and multiple exams by many doctors. A condition so rare, that they don't bother to study it. My arrival at the eye clinic will bring every opthamology resident running to stare into the slit lamps at my retina and the OCTs at the behest of the attending, since they may not see it again for a very long time. 

I spent the first year having monthly eye shots (very traumatic), but since I am not bleeding into my eyes anymore or forming new choroids, they have stopped doing that, as I was developing retinal atrophy. I am 20/300 in one eye and 20/350 in the other. 

It's been a tough haul, mostly because I am older and the adjustment has been exceedingly difficult for me. I resisted the cane training for a very long time, because I thought that it would put a target on my back, since I was pinned up against a work truck and groped when I told someone that I was giving directions to. However, getting into the support center and group support was great. One of the trainers that works there that I knew before this happened, told me his cane was not a target, it was a weapon. I started training right after that. 

The biggest challenge was the day I discovered I could no longer read a book, even with glasses. I was suicidal. It was very difficult. Since then, I am kindled up (an unexpected gift from a total stranger I met at the bus stop who had gotten a new tablet) and the large print has enabled me to read. 

I have done my tech training, and did much better than I expected to. Mobility training was a giant challenge. Travel training is ongoing, since they just changed all of the bus routes in my town, so I had to start from scratch. 

It's rough some days, learning how to do things all over again. However, I did go to culinary school years ago and adjusting to cooking was easy. So easy, that I now volunteer at the support center teaching safe and healthy cooking classes. Knife skills are second nature still, and we have a lot of new people coming in with diabetic retinopathy that need the help. ",,,4,0,0,

Sort of. Some blind people love Python to bits, and would never use anything else; the free and open-source screen-reader [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org) is written almost entirely in Python, in fact.  Personally though, I can't stand it.  This is largely because I started programming for myself as a teenager, and am entirely self taught.  That means I have terrible habits, like never ever indenting anything ever.  Thankfully, PHP doesn't care, and several excellent code formatters are available that I can use on any code I'm sharing with the wider world, or writing for work.  The other reason I use PHP is because it's easy for me to write stuff that runs on the command line, then if it later develops into a tool other humans need to access, I can quickly stuff the same code into a Drupal module or Wordpress plugin or something and throw a GUI on it.  So even though I realize PHP is the wrong tool most of the time, I use it anyway because it fits best into my workflow.  One of these days I should learn Python. But that would mean getting into the habit of indenting code, not just letting a tool do that for me after the fact. And I just don't have that kind of discipline.  ",,,3,0,0,

Eyes express emotions voluntarily and involuntary (i.e. pupillary response), and evoke an empathetic response. ([source](http://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2040-2392-4-33))  

&amp;nbsp;

Eye contact, however, is hugely cultural.  As a personal example, I've found many people from India convey more through their eyes, while people from Japan and Germany may be culturally encouraged to hide their expressions (though being born inside the culture undoubtedly makes a big difference).

&amp;nbsp;

There are, however, universals in facial recognition in general, worth looking up.  Pupillary response, for instance, is generally a reliable physiological indicator.  Wide eyes are alert, wide pupils frightened and/or adjusted to the dark, while narrow pupils convey focus, and also with narrowed eyes, pleasure and pain.  To me, it also seems significant how people often close their eyes when they experience overwhelming emotions (although this, too, is often an easily read indicator to others).

&amp;nbsp;

Personally, although I am sighted and notice these things, I am inclined to notice and focus on audio more, when available.  While people may be reluctant to start talking, you can often get a pretty instant read of emotion from voice tone that is similar in information to what you can pick up with facial recognition.",,,1,0,0,

I do.

I have Homonymous Hemianopsia (no left visual field after a stroke) and also Charles Bonnet syndrome.

I can see well enough to get around the house, cook, etc but use my cane when I'm outside so I don't walk into things on my blind side and also as a visual warning to others.

It's a big help when crossing roads as cars are more likely to let me cross without getting frustrated and leaning on their horn, when walking around buildings people will more often move around me rather than expect me to move out of their way if they aren't sure I have seen them.

At night or in low light I'm almost completely blind across my whole visual field due to the Charles Bonnet syndrome  - imagine an LSD fueled kaleidoscope type effect overlaid on top of your vision that gets more prominent the darker it is.

&gt; guess I just don't like to look 'different'.

While I've never had anyone say anything negative about my use of a cane, I don't care what others may or may not think I look like.  I've had enough falls and scrapes from before I had my cane to be more concerned with being safe than others opinions.

It sounds like you might be best suited to a guide cane like myself rather than a long cane.

A guide cane you hold out in front of you diagonally across your body but you don't tap it on the ground or sweep side to side.  When coming to a kerb I then let it touch the ground so I can judge the depth of the step.

You don't say what country you are based in but there is a link in the sidebar to a few Blind organisations in different countries and if you contact your local one  they should be able to provide you with advice and some training in cane use if you need it.  They can also help measure you for the right size cane.

I had reasonable vision during the day time during high school and my first few years at university.  About four years ago my dominant eye which had approximately 30/60 vision started making everything I focus on wobble.  I am not exactly sure why this started happening.  The doctor I spoke to about it did not explain it very well, however, it is a symptom associated with my condition.  It was just distracting at first, but when I went to the doctor last year my dominant eye's vision had deteriorated to 1/60.

My other eye could never see very well, When I lost my dominant eye the other one could see about 15-20/60.  However, the last year or so it has deteriorated a lot.  I can't really play video games anymore and I have lost all interest in even attempting to identify people, be it on TV or in person, by sight.  The current dominant eye is losing its ability to properly absorb light.  Everything always seems dark.  Even if I crank my PC and TV's brightness to the maximum I still can't see any detail.  It has reached the point where something can only be too bright or too dark.  That in between spot is no longer there.

Two years ago I was a final year law student and did all my studying by using a high contrast camera on my text books and reading the text white on black.  Now, however, I don't even try to read books or articles be it on paper or digital.  I still read things on my phone now and then, but I can no longer use my PC without a screen reader.

I can't really navigate properly anymore, I am waiting for my country's guide dog association to contact me and let me know when I can come for training.  It has become too dangerous to travel the route I do without a dog.  Also, living in South Africa with any disability is a challenge.  The infrastructure does not have any form of support structure, and the general attitude hear is that any help given to a disabled person is help that the person ought to be damn thankful for, because there are not really any legal obligations on anyone to assist disabled folk.

Admittedly it does suck to be on the threshold of blindness.  It would kind of be a load off my back if I could just become blind and get it over with.  Since I can still see a bit I still try to play video games and watch anime, but it takes me 10x longer to do so and sometimes I just abandon a game halfway through because it is too much effort to navigate through it.

I don't know anyone else with my condition.  Anyone here with it?  Do you guys have similar difficulties?",,,1,0,0,

I agree with the learning braille. I have been trying (I am older than you are) to no avail, it's never going to be second nature. Even a sign in a building is a giant struggle for me. 

The best thing that I can recommend to you, is get your mobility and travel training ASAP. That way, you won't be tempted to isolate yourself if things get bad, quickly. Learn the technology as soon as you can. ",,,1,0,0,

I didn't care much about losing sight for as long as it was enough to read magnified high contrast text off a computer screen and code, but once I went blind I became obsessed with it.  Perhaps the first step is figuring out exactly what it is that she used to like doing and can't anymore, and finding an alternative way of doing it.  It didn't work for me since coding blind is a real pain, but it might work for her.

Regarding the train stop problem I personally use a GPS app called BlindSquare which, among other things, allows me to mark places of interest and sounds an alert when I'm approaching them so I can mark bus and train stops, but yes, I'm always afraid of falling asleep in the train or running out of battery on my phone and missing the train stop where I'm supposed to exit, leaving me in a situation where I have to either jaywalk across and risk getting run over or potentially get disoriented trying to find the overpass.",,,1,0,0,

At that age, I remember I was enjoying Gordon Korman's books for older readers, especially _Don't Care High_, _No Coins, Please_, and _A Semester in the Life of a Garbage Bag_.  However, these are targeted more at Junior High boys. But if she doesn't mind books with boys as the main characters, they should be fine. There's nothing dealing even remotely with romantic or similar feelings.

In grade 6, I was just starting to grow out of Daniel Pinkwater's books for older readers.  But I was still enjoying _The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death_, and _Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy from Mars_.  These are just as strange as the titles suggest.
