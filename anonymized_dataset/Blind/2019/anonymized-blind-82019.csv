One of the things I do is pre-measure seasonings, because there’s no way I can see the tiny granules coming out of the containers.  I’ve been picking up sets of measuring spoons and cups with various colors (i.e. 1/4 teaspoon is white, 1/2 is red, etc.) to make it easier.  We bought colored cookware, so the handles stand out against the stove.  I put bump dots on certain buttons of the microwave like the 5 and start keys.  My wife makes a lot of delicious slow cooker meals that are easy and cheap, so you might consider that route.  You can find all sorts of kitchen items at second-hand shops and yard sales to make it cheaper to get the items you need.

As far as food budgeting, you can have two of the three: cheap, good (and/or healthy), and convenient.  I find that cooking from scratch seems expensive, but is overall cheaper and healthier.  We can buy a Knorr rice packet for $1.00, or make a lot more rice from scratch for that same dollar.  We get a lot of staples from the Dollar Tree like herbs and seasonings, beef and chicken stock, frozen vegetables and fruit, etc. However, not everything is cheaper there by price per ounce, so it pays to shop around and get to know where you can get the best prices for the food you like to eat.  We also watch the sales ads and plan around that, so if chicken is on sale one week we usually have a chicken-based meal plus stock up a bit.  I’m fortunate that my wife is an amazing cook who is also frugal.

Could you place a stool/chair in the kitchen so you can sit and rest as needed while cooking?  Have you applied for food assistance like SNAP?  Are there food pantries in your area that you can access to make your food budget go farther?  I applaud your desire to become more independent and healthy and I wish you great success.",,,1,0,0,

I love reading about blind characters (my daughter's blind and I work at a nonprofit for the blind), but SO often people do a ...really bad job with writing them. I hope it isn't presumptuous to give you some advice! 

I feel like the two most important things to remember are a) most people who are legally blind aren't completely blind (you can have ""no light perception"", which is 'seeing nothing' but that's pretty rare. Most people have SOME vision, though is may not be useful) and the other thing I'd recommend is  to  remember that blindness is a symptom, not a condition itself. Look up eye conditions that can cause blindness and pick one, make sure you do your research. Figure out HOW blind your character is, look up what the vision of someone with that condition looks like, figure out what other symptoms their condition has. Someone who has retinitis pigmentosa and slowly lost their vision in their 20s, someone who has optic nerve hypoplasia and was blind from birth, and an elderly person with age related macular degeneration are all going to have wildly different experiences and needs.

Calling myself legally blind creates some confusion and discomfort sometimes (because I can usually pass for sighted in public) but it gives me a springboard that I can use to further explain my disability.

Generally, I prefer being clear over being “politically correct” in the context of my disability, but your mileage may vary.  I’ve had my whole life to grapple with this, so talking about my disability isn’t something that causes me much embarrassment or distress.

I'm going to be honest with you here, it sucks sometimes. I have to depend on my husband to drive me to/from work, I have to walk to get our son from daycare even in the middle of winter if hes stuck at work, specialist appointments are a nightmare because we don't have family in town so someone is either taking a day off work or driving 2h to pick me up in order to drive another 1-3h.

*However.* After a while it's just normal. You know how close everything is within walking distance and it keeps you active. You default to adding at least an hour to your schedule due to the bus. If someone offers a ride, sweet. But you also always have an excuse to not do stuff (man, I'd love to but the bus doesn't go that way/it stops running at a certain time/it's too cold to walk that far.) When you're of age, you never have to DD - I rarely drink, but it's a nice excuse to have in my back pocket.

My youngest brother (with a massive age gap) will be learning to drive in a year or two. I absolutely expect to have a twinge or two of jealousy. Here's the thing - when I was diagnosed 8 years ago, stem cells were science fiction. Now they're in second stage human trials. I fully expect that when my toddler is old enough to get his licence, I will be able to teach him to drive because I will have my full sight back (because yeah, I'm wanting a cure, fight me.) Learning to drive in your early 30s won't be a big deal. I'll be in my 40s and relearning.

  Learn all you can now. Get a job you love and you could do should your vision worsen. Get some new skills your right eye being the way it is it wouldn't hurt. Stay calm. I know its hard right now.
We can't control the future and that sucks. You can however control how you see it even if say you did lose more vision. There are many people who will help and the resources! So many! I know so many  blind/ VI people that are just happy to be living life independently which is way easier now.  I know it can be done.

Important CO Announcement

I am very pleased to Inform you all that 2958 RCACC -1 st Anti-Tank Regiment will be moving our

parade venue to Barrhaven. I have worked very closely with the Army League Representative

Mr. Chris Legere and the Support Committee Chair Ms. Kim Billings to ensure that this September

we had a new facility to house our training. This move has been several months In planning and

after much searching, meetings, consultations and approval we have the good fortune of forming

a new partnership with ��cole elementaire publlque Mlchaelle-Jean located at 11 Claridge Drive,

Nepean (Barrhaven) Ontario. With this relocation of our regular parade nights we have acquired

space suitable for the Corps to continue to thrive, Improve and deliver the Cadet program to our

young adults. In order to be able to utilize the spaces that w e require we are obliged to move

our regular parade evening from Thursday night to Wednesday night. This grants us use of the

Gymnasium which wlll easlly accommo date our parade format, drlll and sports program. We

have also been able to reserve the use of three classroom spaces in order to provide a better

environment for learning. This new space will allow the Corps the potential to expand and recruit

as we move forward over the coming weeks. Our first offlclal parade night of the 2019/2020

training year wlll be on 11 September 2019 at 1830 hours (6:30 pm). It will be an orientation to

our new venue.

we have enjoyed a very close and Important relatlonshlp with the Legion Branch 314 In Manotlck.

They have been the Primary Sponsor of 2958 RCACC for years and it Is our Intention to see our

continued relatlonshlp In that role. We have been arranging to maintain a footprint In the Legion

by way of our stores and offlces space. We are working out the dctalls for the continued use of

the Veteran's Hall for ourspeclallty teams and to practice our marksmanship on select weekends.

We will also continue to support the community of Manotlck during the Poppy Campaign and on

Remembrance Day and with other suitable events In line with the Cadet program.

I do understand that since the Annual Cadet Review In June 2019, there have been several

significant changes within our Corps. A new change of command and rotation of staff duties.

Now a change In venue location and parade evening. However, I bell eve these are all positive

changes and I can assure you there are more to come that wlll focus on making your experience

at 2958 RCACC both fun and valuable.

Respectfully,

captain K. L. Shourle MO M. M a,

Commanding Offlcer 2958 RCACC

I would say it doesn't really have the tools you would want to make music. But if you are wanting to use it to record sound, then that is where it specialises in. It has many different processing features, but isn't the best program to manage multi track. I would say for sure that Audacity will be the simplest to navigate if you are using a screen reader. 

Something to note is that when using Audacity the tracker on the bar above the recorded sound area needs to be moved around according to where you want the recording to start. If you play something then hit record it will record at the place where the tracking seeker has stopped which will be something that might save you a bit of time to know. 

There is the ability to highlight sections of the recorded track and delete them however from my usage of this it will not leave a blank space, but will bring together the sections which you have cut.

For me, I found my faith while laying in my little room in public housing, after being homeless for years. I was so angry at God. I felt abandoned. But even in my anger, I could not deny what I felt, and what I had learned. I swore I would never be like those judgmental people. It was in the silence afterward that I realized that nothing I was taught had told me to act like those people.  


When I started losing my sight, I was scared. But there was something I had said when I was younger. I'd rather lose my sight than my ability to listen to music, or to taste good and new food, or to smell the storms and snow, or to feel the touch of a friend. I don't think God took my sight as a result of that, but it reminds me of all the blessings I still have.  


Funnily enough, my faith and trust is a bit deeper now. When I walk, I have to have faith that I am going to be okay, that the next step won't be my undoing, that my cane will alert me to any changes in the terrain. The same thing applies when I play video games. I have to have faith that, no matter what, I will be okay.  


God and I still have our fights. I get angry and wonder what I did to make him hate me so much. But it passes. In the end, I'm here. I have a home, a family, good friends. I have food. My computer is my window to the world, so I don't feel so isolated all the time. My faith calls me to be a better person than my selfish default mode. When I'd rather not get involved, it reminds me to reach out. It helps me be more compassionate and understanding when I am not inclined to do so.  


I'm not sure about an afterlife, or an eternal reward, or any of that. Don't have any evidence to support it. But I have this moment, I have this life, and I have these circumstances. I choose to use them to try to lift people up, to listen and understand, and to show kindness to whoever needs it.

Message from the commanding officer
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to our Corps family. As you and your young adults commit to sharing in the Cadet experience and adventure, the staff at 2958 RCACC and I committ to provide a safe, supportive, respectful, yet challenging environment where all can flourish and develop their knowledge and skills to be strong contributing citizens and future leaders. I believe in the importance and value of the Canadian cadet program and the positive youth development programs that it offers. We are fortunate to be sponsored by the Canadian Armed Forces. We are also fortunate to have funding and support from civilian groups such as the Army Cadet League of Canada, as well as local community sponsors that include service organizations and yourselves, the parents of cadets. This program is unique in that there is no cost for youth to join and they have a variety of opportunities where they can participate in learning valuable skills that are not available to many of their peers. While we have strong affiliations to military traditions and regiments Cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces nor are they expected to join the military. However, in this structured program your youth will experience what it is to push themselves to achievements, to learn to be self-disciplined and accountable. They will also learn skills that will enable future leadership potential and learn what it is to be part of a team concept or something even larger, achieving through teamwork the foundation of good citizenship. I am proud and honored to be the commanding officer of this army cadet corps. I look forward to being partnered with each of you to help prepare your young adults to become the successful leaders of tomorrow.

I don’t think my vision loss had a huge effect on my diminishing faith, but I must admit that loosing hearing in one of my ears a few years ago may have helped me down the path I’m trying to figure out now. I’m really conflicted about a lot of moral/philosophical questions around Christianity, life, and death.

Since you mentioned it, my wife and I are actually Eastern Orthodox. I was really into the faith when I first converted, but now I want to check out some African American churches. I love 50s and 60s R&amp;B/Soul/Gospel, and I hear that a lot of this music has roots in the black church. There are beautiful aspects to the Orthodox faith, but it does have a very strong patriarchal aspect to it, so I’m not sure if it’s what you’re looking for. You should look into Lutheranism; they have a High-Church atmosphere, liturgy etc.. But I believe are much more equitable when it comes to gender and the church. If you do end up getting to attend an Orthodox liturgy, either read about it before-hand, or find someone who can help explain the service to you. There are a lot of non-verbal things going on; it’s almost like a symbolic theatrical performance. Although there is plenty to listen to as well, singing and chanting through the whole thing. 

One last thought, I to do not like people praying over me for my blindness. I went to college at a Southern university, and I often had fellow students stopping me to try their hand at a miracle. This gave me a lot of practice trying different methods of dealing with such people, I’ll tell you what has worked best for me. When someone comes up and askes if they can pray for me, I ask what they want to pray about, even though I already know. They say they want to pray for my blindness, and I say something along the lines of; well, I don’t want you to pray for that, but actually I have been going through something and I would very much appreciate a prayer for that, if you want to pray for me. The thing you bring up for them to pray for can be anything, I have used final exams I was going to, important meetings I felt unprepared about, vet checkups for my cat etc. The person is usually taken aback, but they have always respected my request and prayed for the thing I mentioned. Then, when they are done, I ask them what they are going through and I say a quick prayer, for them, about that. I have been surprised at how this method can take an experience that feels annoying and demeaning and flips it around to be one of equality and real connection. 

Good luck,",,,4,0,0,

And resenting you for something you can't control, without seeking therapy and proper healing or at the very least open communication about it, is not your fault. It's his. It sounds like you've tried to be very forthright with him and gotten no return for your effort. I think at this point if he says openly offensive things to youz it's in your right to stand up for yourself and call him out. I know it's hard, but his treatment is uncalled for. He sounds like a total jerk. I get your parents position. I don't think they can do much unless you start to openly stand up for yourself and set really strong boundaries with this person. You cannot let him make your life even harder than it already is. Keep a healthy distance, open yourself up to forgive, but in the moment, don't take shit. You deserve basic respect, even if you can't be best friends. 

Like I said, I relate. My sister was diagnosed with autism when she was 14. She is 6 years older than I am, but emotionally we are experiencing different stages. I don't want to say I am more mature, but I have my life slightly more together. Having two kids with disabilities was so hard on my parents but also readily accessible info wasn't as easy to come by in the early 90's. There just wasn't even open communication, psycho-educatuon and joint growth in our family. My early life felt very disjointed and I normalized and internalized s lot. My sister would smack me and scream at me out if nowhere. She stole from me and lied to me. She did a lot of things.... And it was a relief to me recently when she could articulate that she wished I had never been born. I got treated ""better"" because I had a physical disability and not a mental one. Of course that's not even true, because being blind comes with its own emotionally complex problems. It was a relief for me to hear her say that, because all of the abuse and jealousy and gaslighting made more sense. A lot of the time she had delayed empathy for me. 

We are never going to be best friends, but we don't always have to relive the past. I've had some therapy and read some books about childhood trauma and healing. I suggest maybe you try this too. It's okay that you feel hurt. It makes sense that this has worn down your confidence, but it doesn't have to continue.

Usually I follow the wife around, so I don't need a cane, but when getting weed, I have to go alone.

One time I was following the wife around the grocery store, and she disappeared, and I just grabbed some random woman's basket and started talking.  She didn't freak out at all, and just had a nice conversation about cereal.  I quickly realized it wasn't the wife, and asked if she was nearby!

The handicapped guy realized the other was empty, and he took it, while I took the handicapped one as soon as some little kid ran out of it a few seconds later.

I never really wanted my disability to call that much attention to me, you know? And I also have some sight, and was pretty good at getting around my high school and neighborhood because by the time I had lost a lot of my sight, I was 14, so my muscle memory was enough to get me by. But I really paid for it when I went to moved to university last year-- I felt really vulnerable and lost, because for the first time, I had to use the cane, both for ID and ensuring I made it from my dorm to my class without geting hit by Birds (those damn scooters) or people skating, etc. It was really tough to be guided by a cane, rather than being sighted guided by my sister, or another trusted loved one. But honestly? On a college campus, most people are too concerned with their life to be too concernced with ours. Sure, you'll probably get some stares, but who cares, really? And yeah, there is that fear that some people will think you're 'faking' it, but that's not a big deal either. Most able bodied people probably won't assume the worst when they notice you have a cane and also seem somewhat sighted, cause most able bodied people understand that they don't understand disability all that well-- most people think that all people that are blind are completely blind, rather than visually impaired, when that's not at all the case.

 Sorry this is so long, I just related so much with this post, and hope it helps.

The only time it's a factor is if a guy is unhealthy to a degree that medical intervention is necessary. Not that it would deter me if i like him. I'd be all in to support that kind of thing. But part of being a well rounded person is understanding that you have to take care of your physical and mental health. I stay fit and maintain a workout regime, but it's only for my wwell being. Anxiety and depression are a bitch and its up to me to keep them at bay with diet and exercise because I'm lucky enough to not have them severely. Not everyone is so lucky and that's sometimes portrayed by physical appearance. In my opinion, though, fitness and physical attractiveness fade as life goes on, things change, and get harder. If a guy can't look past a few pounds to the person i am, then we're not a good life match, right? I won't always be able to maintain my physical appearance like i do now and that's true of everyone. So i don't think body type is all that important unless the person simply doesn't care to take care of themselves at all. That's just a turn off. 

I'm not very spiritual, no. I sometimes waver on it, though, because the positive and negative energy thing really seems to play out sometimes.

I just think people should be good and kind to one another. That's not really a spiritual sentiment, though. 
I hope that wasn't offensive at all. I don't care what others believe and I'm open to conversation related to these matters because i don't claim to know it all. It's just not my thing personally.

If I were to remove mentions about the blindness from your posts, it would still read like posts on /r/depression , /r/suicidewatch or other discussion boards where depressed people vent their sorrows.

I do agree with you that the blindness and difficulties that comes with it does seem to be at least part of the equation though. Maybe that combined with other things such as having no friends, adhedonia and feeling like there is no purpose in life might might be the coctail which has pushed you over the edge. 

However, blindness alone does not cause depression or make life unliveable. People also get depressed and suicidal regardless how well they see. You are generalising your own issues as if it affects other blind people too, but that's not the case. You have more in common with depressed and suicidal people than with blind people.",,,2,0,0,

That said, I'm visually impaired and have lost over 100lbs by combining dietary changes (eating less, eating better, etc), an exercise bike and a set of weights. Get someone to show you how to perform different exercises using the weights and ask them to watch you a few times to make sure you're consistently getting them right. Hop on the bike and set a timer and just pedal, building up your time over weeks and months (I started out barely able to do 10 minutes, I could now comfortably do an hour or more at a time).

Add general exercises like push ups, sit-ups, etc and I honestly think that should be more than enough for most people. If you're interested in going to a gym, I also really enjoy using a rowing machine or treadmill.

But because I need to be so close, I almost never use it (since I would need to lean over to it and strain my neck/back). 

I've though of a couple ways to make the secondary monitor more useful, but haven't actually tried them. One would be to mount it on an arm as well, so that both monitors would be really close.

Instead of exposing the grid to VoiceOver so you could explore the board with your finger, they opt to control the game with a handful of 1 and two finger swipes to move a virtual cursor and read entire rows and columns at a time which I personally found more frustrating than helpful as it throws standard VoiceOver navigation concepts out the window.

I have never learned to play chess, though I'd like to do so at some point. That being said, I know that VoiceOver friendly chess games exist. A quick Google finds that chess wise was made accessible, so this may be a good point of reference how to expose the board to VoiceOver. The touch screen makes spacially understanding the board easier because you can either swipe through it or just ""feel"" the board by touching around the screen, so I feel like exposing the interface to VoiceOver would probably be the far more helpful and probably easier way rather than abstracting the interface Blindfold Games style.",,,3,0,0,
12c07eda-bff8-47eb-a97b-a8b1d6cbc4ca,1567033549,"Hallo ���� partially blind girl here. 
I was actually born with optic nerve hypoplasia (meaning the optic nerve just stopped developing)in one eye, so I’ve never had any vision in my right eye. 
Overall, the eye reacts to light and I have feeling in it, but I have absolutely no vision-no shadows, nothing. 

Honestly, it’s not ever really been a big deal to me...I can drive, play sports, etc. I don’t have any actual restrictions. I will say that it sucks not having the peripheral vision (especially when someone comes up on that side and scares the shit out of you �� although most of the time you can feel their presence-slight change in the air, maybe?), and I have to watch it with sunlight. Sometimes the sun will be shining only in the eye I’m blind in and I don’t notice until it starts getting painful! 

Also, my eye doc was reeeeeallyyyy hesitant to let me wear contacts (obviously) because a single eye infection could cause you to be completely blind for the rest of your life, but he eventually allowed it (on the pretense that they would only be used during gymnastics because my glasses kept flying off, but he knew better).  

I feel for your friend, though. I’ve always thought, “if anything, at least I was born this way and don’t have to adjust”. I couldn’t imagine having sight and then one day losing it. 

As far as research, it’s a tricky one. You can find general articles online and I check up on it every five years or so but not much has changed. There are BILLIONS of optic nerves, making any restoration or surgery insanely difficult. It might be a possibility if your friend has enough nerves left, but otherwise......
There’s just no way for us to replace so so many tiny, complex electrical wires with our current technology. I’ve read research that suggests using stem cells could provide a viable possibility, but that research is still very young and, well, all the “killing babies” nonsense is kinda holding everything up. 

Best of luck to your friend! I imagine it’s seeming like the worst possibility to them, but seriously. It’s completely doable- the brain can adjust to many things! And after so long, it’ll seem normal. Hell, I’ve become so used to it I forget to note it on medical records now �� feel free to message me with any questions!",,,2,0,0,

73fa6038-c94f-4e13-8307-331807e7c7fd,1566393085,"hi! For context, I got my first retina tear at around 9 years old àd my first detachment at 14 and I jad several since them (I’m now 19 turning 20). My left eye is completely fucked and my right eye has a fair amount of blind spots but I can still see decently out of it. 

Basically, when you have a retina tear, any small shock can evolve into a détachement and make it a lot harder to treat and you have a huge risk of going blind. 
How retina tear are treated are usually with laser, you’ll sit down in a dark room, get some eyedrops to ease the pain, get your head stuck between two bars and the doctors will flash green light at your eye from 5 to 10 minutes. It is quite painful but bearable. When it’s over you might feel lightheaded and see in funky colors. If you do get laser treatment make sure to bring someone with you as you probably won’t be able to see much. Also bring a good pair of sunglasses because you will be very sensitive to light. 

If you do get a retina detachment, it usually requires surgery, there are two techniques that I know off, gas and silicone, both meant to to hold the retina in place. 
Gas is quite inconvinient because you won’t be able to go on planes or go diving or anything where the pressure is off. Sillicone also has cons because a lot of complications can arise (for exemple cataract, eye tension, cornea damage, the sillicone slipping in front of your eye and blurring your vision, making a visible ‘bubble’ on your eye and that’s pretty much it), it also wears off after two years and you can’t replace it endlessly because it will damage your eye at some point. 
After you get better, there’s a lot of things you won’t be allowed to do to spare your retina another tear or detachement, like fighting, specific intense sports, rollercoasters etc. 

How bad it will be really depends on you and your specific case. Although relapse is quite common, it can be fixed and then be just that. My detachements are caused by a genetic disorder, so I have plenty of exemples. I’m very unfortunate and had many relapses and complications, hence my shit eyesight. My grandpa was left untreated for too long and is completely blind. My father is blind in the right eye but his left eye never had anything and he sees fine out of it. My brother had a tear as a child but he got it fixed and he never had anything since then and he has very decent vision. 
It really depends on you, your body and your luck really. 

I don’t know if that’s exactly what you wanted to know, but I’m here if you have any questions as I think I’m pretty knowledgeable about the topic!!",,,2,0,0,

Important CO Announcement

I am very pleased to Inform you all that 2958 RCACC -1 st Anti-Tank Regiment will be moving our

parade venue to Barrhaven. I have worked very closely with the Army League Representative

Mr. Chris Legere and the Support Committee Chair Ms. Kim Billings to ensure that this September

we had a new facility to house our training. This move has been several months In planning and

after much searching, meetings, consultations and approval we have the good fortune of forming

a new partnership with ��cole elementaire publlque Mlchaelle-Jean located at 11 Claridge Drive,

Nepean (Barrhaven) Ontario. With this relocation of our regular parade nights we have acquired

space suitable for the Corps to continue to thrive, Improve and deliver the Cadet program to our

young adults. In order to be able to utilize the spaces that w e require we are obliged to move

our regular parade evening from Thursday night to Wednesday night. This grants us use of the

Gymnasium which wlll easlly accommo date our parade format, drlll and sports program. We

have also been able to reserve the use of three classroom spaces in order to provide a better

environment for learning. This new space will allow the Corps the potential to expand and recruit

as we move forward over the coming weeks. Our first offlclal parade night of the 2019/2020

training year wlll be on 11 September 2019 at 1830 hours (6:30 pm). It will be an orientation to

our new venue.

we have enjoyed a very close and Important relatlonshlp with the Legion Branch 314 In Manotlck.

They have been the Primary Sponsor of 2958 RCACC for years and it Is our Intention to see our

continued relatlonshlp In that role. We have been arranging to maintain a footprint In the Legion

by way of our stores and offlces space. We are working out the dctalls for the continued use of

the Veteran's Hall for ourspeclallty teams and to practice our marksmanship on select weekends.

We will also continue to support the community of Manotlck during the Poppy Campaign and on

Remembrance Day and with other suitable events In line with the Cadet program.

I do understand that since the Annual Cadet Review In June 2019, there have been several

significant changes within our Corps. A new change of command and rotation of staff duties.

Now a change In venue location and parade evening. However, I bell eve these are all positive

changes and I can assure you there are more to come that wlll focus on making your experience

at 2958 RCACC both fun and valuable.

Respectfully,

captain K. L. Shourle MO M. M a,

Commanding Offlcer 2958 RCACC

ee3bded6-bbcc-4b04-8508-53da4683a20d,1566613955,"Yup i used to have sight until about 3 years ago. 

This time around i don't pay attention to looks at all. I never used to place a lot of weight in them before, but now it's a distant after thought. Part of that is because i have to ask my friends to deScribe a guy's appearance and its actually really difficult to describe a person's face in any meaningful way. It's like describing the color green. There's only so many times i can hear "" he's got a great smile and beautiful eyes. He's cute. I don't know what else to say."" lol 

Honestly, a guy's voice is what starts my attraction. You can tell a lot by a person's voice: whether they're arrogant, witty, nervous, shy, flirty, etc... 
I personally don't like overly cocky guys and i can sense the false bravado a mile away. But a guy who is gentle or sensitive, attentive, funny, etc... I'm on board. 
Try it for yourself. The next time you're on the phone with a friend listen for those moments when you can hear a smile cross their lips, or the way their speech rate increases when they're nervous or are trying to get a punchline to a joke out. Speech patterns and vocal ticks tell you a lot about a person, so that's first. 
Then, for me, it's scent. If you smell good with or without a nice cologne, I'm onboard. It's a weakness for me. 
After that its just personality stuff. Gotta make me laugh and laugh at my jokes too. Gotta be kind to people even if they're total strangers or if they're doing a service for you. Have to be confident, but humble. Have to be intelligent and curious. That kind of thing. 

Maybe after that I'll get a better feel for his looks, but no it doesn't really matter. 

I'm sure this all varies drastically across blind folks, but that's how it is for me now. 
Hope that answered your question! 
I'm an open book, so if you have questions, fire away.",,,1,0,0,

I too lost my ability to see the puddle and thusly weld, I had to voluntarily give up my license at 20/200. Most importantly I went from someone that relied on no one and did everything my self to relying on everyone for a little help here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant drive anymore but I still have my truck. and I keep adding/modding it for offroad race support use. Its REAL easy to find a friend that wants to go to mexico eat tacos drink beer and drive my truck for me (including all the miss daisy jokes)

I cant stack dimes with the Miller anymore. But I still have my 251 and a TIG. Its REAL easy to find someone that wants to come do the ""I just come and weld and talk about how good of a welder I am"" part

Its hard for me to handle a plasma torch and follow any sort of line. so I waited and found a smoking deal on a cnc plasma and use the computers assistive tech to draw in solidworks and then cut it out on the table

I know I cant drive a race car in the baja 1000 so I decided to build a car that I can let all the above people drive with me in the passenger seat, because I still plan on crossing the finish line damnit.

I had to run in front of the carts to prevent them from hitting her because she was walking at a much slower pace than my carts that were on an incline. After I entered the store, her and her daughter started to literally yell at me. Along the lines of “don’t you see that she is disabled???

Get packs of porkchops , get some seasonings, put some seasonings in a bowl, massage the seasonings into the meat. Get an oven tray, cover it in foil, lay your pork chops on there and throw it in at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.

You can also do this with chicken. Rice is easy to make and you can fry some steaks and such. The real answer here is how much are you willing to learn? How fearful are you of heat? Stoves? Popping oil? Bowling water? Setting your oven? Failing and really understanding that meals aren't going to always come out right and that it's all trial and error.

*  Great problem solving skills

*   Ability to focus.  Tasks and environmental cues etc
*   Going more Buddha or being able to create greater mental richness because the mind has fewer visual distractions or an unimpaired mental ability.
*   Ability to cut to what's important / brevity.  The information bandwidth of talking or writing to maximize the information flow given visual restriction.

Accessibility also covers stuff like having a broken arm, colour blindness and dyslexia. Make sure that users can easily read what is on the page.

I think it's important to realize though, that being upset about it won't make it come back. That's not to say, don't be upset about it - give yourself time to cope, certainly. What you should avoid doing is letting that become your  new default. Eventually, quite soon in all likelihood, you'll find that those moments of severe frustration at your loss only serve to cut away from the enjoyment you get from tasks. Once it comes to that, practise dismissing those thoughts. Not stopping them, but recognizing them and then letting them go. If you have to, literally say ""okay"" out loud. Not a positive or negative recognition. Just ""okay"".

You'll find that, over time, it becomes easier to do. Eventually, it will be automatic and not long after that, those thoughts won't plague you. 

The anger you experience in losing the vision is a result of expectations. In time, you'll get used to your new situation, your expectations will change - the anger will also fade. It's important to note that changing your expectations is not the same thing as lowering them. It's about finding joy in what you can do and letting go of the anger about the things you can't. 

And if you aren't the type to be convinced by words, then know that science has found that extreme change in situation leads to no long term change of happiness. Whether you've won the lottery or lost a leg - you'll return to a baseline of happiness in time.",,,5,0,0,

For instance, my dog doesn't care if he eats at 4:00, or 5:30, or 6:30. If he's somewhere he knows he gets food, he wants the food. If he's working or traveling past his normal feeding time, though, he doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. He can also delay the times he normally goes out to relieve without issue. My point is, planning your life around a strict schedule isn't really a thing, at least in my case. Yes, there's planning, but it's not as demanding as it sounds.

The main advantages I've found are in getting to specific things. In waiting rooms, the dog can find you an empty chair; when you're leaving a building, it can lead you to the door, then to a car once you're outside (this has limits and is something I taught my dog); it can find entrances; you can teach it to take you to an object you carry and may leave somewhere, like your briefcase, backpack, or jacket; it can more easily locate hard-to-feel curbs or other places of interest; it can be taught to find specific doors on streets crowded with buildings, letting you mark a business you frequent and find it easily; my dog takes me to the various machines in the gym, skipping the ones that have people on them; and it's very, very early in the morning so I know I'm missing stuff.",,,3,0,0,

I also got training in non-visual skills right away. Because I chose to do that I managed to stay employed.


Now I live next to a train station and go where I want, when I want, without having to coordinate with anyone else. It is very empowering.",,,2,0,0,

I also have an extremely rare condition (probable AZOOR), so rare there isn't even an estimated prevalence for it. I was delighted to find one person on this sub with the same diagnosis. Before my recent vision loss, I had no clue there were so many different ways to go blind/lose vision! I'm 30 years old and had near-normal vision til a few months ago. It's hard to even explain what my symptoms are and my family is pretty much at a loss. Relatives keep saying, ""It's getting better though, right?"" I'm like, dude, okay, for the hundredth time, it is literally an untreatable disease that is never getting better and is currently getting worse! At the same time, I'm ambivalent about getting involved with the blind/VI community in person and/or taking advantage of services. I'm afraid people will think I'm faking it or overreacting because I currently can still function almost like a sighted person...except when I can't. Anyway, you're not alone--there are a lot of us here with various rare conditions.

Vision loss is really hard--socially, emotionally, logistically, on every level. I think what you're feeling is a very normal and understandable reaction to such a challenging experience.

I should also mention that I have nystagmus too, so my eyes wobble a little bit, making it even harder to focus on things far away.

Being blind can be lonely enough as it is and it can often lead to depression (as I'm sure you know all too well) which causes us to isolate ourselves even more and things go round in a vicious cycle with vision and everything else getting worse with each passing day. Going blind as an adult brings with it this and a lot of other new and different challenges to being blind from birth and sometimes it might feel like every time you finally come to terms with something you can't do any more now there's a dozen more and you can't escape but I promise you there is light at the end of the tunnel.  

For years my friend struggled to accept what was happening; he wouldn't walk with a cane, would never talk to anyone about it and believed that it was a sign of weakness to ask for help from anyone. He was pretending nothing was going on so he could grasp on to the fragments of what once was: the friendships, the things he could do and the places he could explore. Ultimately this leaves you feeling more isolated than before you started trying to make things seem normal again. You feel lonely when you're surrounded by people. You have to be willing to reach out to people and talk about who you really are and the struggles you face. Allow them the opportunity to understand rather than giving up on the pursuit altogether because that stage isn't going to come the first time you speak and being let down can feel like that kick that breaks you when you're already down.  

Please reach out to other people, VI or not, same disorder as you or not, and talk to the ones that care about you because they will listen and eventually they will begin to understand even if they never fully can because that's the only way to feel less alone. I know you'll probably dread doing it and convince yourself of a million reasons why things are going to go wrong but I promise you won't regret it.  

I really hope the courage to reach out and start to not let yourself and the people you relate to be defined by the bad things in your life but by the positives. Feel free to drop me a DM if you ever want to talk because I really want to be there for you if you feel like you need someone!",,,2,0,0,

When he was 1st admitted in the ER he just had vision trouble in one eye, but since they transferred him to a different hospital both his eyes have been affected. 

The doctors thought at 1st he had an allergic reaction to something the ER administered to him, but as the week went on he began losing vision in his other eye.

The doctors now think he may have an auto immune disease brought on by a virus. So all the doctors have said is his vision may return in a couple of weeks. 

They are beginning treatment today but he has to stay in the hospital for the duration of treatment.  Which is why we're trying to come up with ideas of things for him to do.

7e236443-8391-4fbf-b8ee-d9e41b637f1f,1565553017,"I was diagnosed with AZOOR by an ophthalmologist nearly two decades ago, I think largely because my symptoms didn’t fit anything else.

Basically, I have a large blind spot in the lower right quadrant of my right eye (approximately 25-to-30 percent of my field of vision is totally blank), which was confirmed by exhaustive optical tests done by other vision specialists from Johns Hopkins.  In addition, I see double-vision in that eye that is crystal clear, not fuzzy or out-of-focus.  Other exhaustive tests confirmed that the double-vision was optical and not neurological in nature.

I was told that so little is known about AZOOR that they couldn’t offer up what to expect in the future...  It may get worse, or it may not (only that the conditions would not improve over time).  I may eventually go completely blind in that eye, or I may not.  The AZOOR may eventually spread to my left eye, or it may not.  Lots of vague “may-or-may-nots”.

At this point, after nearly 20-years with the condition, I can say that it appears to be spreading — albeit very slowly.  My near-vision in that eye is totally gone now and the blank area is slowly widening in coverage.  So far, my left eye remains untouched by the symptoms, so I still have good depth-of-field vision and can continue to drive a car without issues.

I don’t know if any of that helps you at all, but I’ve just learned to accept it and live with what I have.",,,2,0,0,

0ddb0583-cc20-4ef9-80ba-405e5ee6c220,1565303471,"Yes the results could be the same. That's the thing. There is no 'type of person' to be susceptible to nocebos. Our brains are incredibly good at making obscure connections. It's the feature of humans that, loosely speaking, allows things like invention and abstract thinking. It's not like a conman's lie, you don't ""fall for it'. It's more like Alchohol. Everyone, even the smartest of us, is suseptible to nocebos. And It's not just talking that transfers them. It is, more accurately, the connection between the EMF and pain that happens in your brain. That can be caused by talking about it, but it can also happen by accident. Maybe you had a mild headache one day while using the phone. Or maybe the phone was particularly hot, or the audio was up too high. At some point though, your brain made the connection that ""EMF == Pain"". It became so sure of that, that it would generate pain responses in the future.

If you stepped onto a hot coal and your foot began to hurt, your brain would make the same kind of connection. It just got it wrong once, by pure chance. 

The first studies to prove the existance nocebos definitively worked like this: Take two groups of patients and give them a flu shot. Give one group the normal discourse ""you'll feel a slight pinch, or maybe some pressure etc."". The second groups is told ""This will start painless, but pain will ramp up over the course of the next half hour"". Both groups were given the same shot. The second group experienced pain enough to request pain killers. The pain was real. The painkillers even worked, and later studies showed that the brains of afflicted individuals lit up in the same way they would to any other pain.

We're not entirely sure of the complexities of how it works (Or at least, I'm not familiar with the research in the area). The good news is that treatment is possible. Our brains are great at complex reasoning and they're incredibly plastic. It made the wrong connection. It can fix itself. 

Firstly, educate yourself. Stick to peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals, or sources that cite only peer reviewed journals. 

This summary of the condition by the world health organization (down below) is a good start. It will give you an overveiw of the condition and some further reading.

Nobody denies that being blind sucks. It's a massive challenge and makes everyday tasks way more difficult but you just have to keep going in spite of it.

From the head down they have a leaner physique than your regular blackbird. Their head is a deep blue with a green tinge. Their neck is interesting because they have a collar which looks to me as like the beard of a thinly haired old man, it's white and is like a choker around their neck which then meets to form a much thicker white bowtie. They then have an apron below this choker. The choker starts as sea green then moves down through deep blue to black by their legs, which are also black.

Not sure if you have experienced 18th century British Naval Lieutenant or Captain's uniforms but the best way to understand the distribution of the colour on this bird would be similar to that. If on the off chance a blind person has the chance to be in this exact situation, the distribution and shape of the colour on the bibs of the birds is often the same as a fully uniformed ranking officer of the 18th century British Navy, who is standing with hands held behind his back, while his coat is unbuttoned.

I'm not using any special tools to code, just Xcode, which is fairly accessible.  The biggest problem I have with it is the debugger which is not very accessible even if I use commands, because there is no way to insert break-points with the keyboard and I can't read the debugger's console output since when I try to focus it with the screen-reader it only focuses the input text box, but I sort of get around that by inserting lots of asserts and watching the values when they fail.",,,3,0,0,

I've been checked for retinal detachment since I started seeing eye docs at the age of 3 because I have always had both issues.   
A tear does not \*have\* to lead to a detachment. After my right eye detached and did not recover well- my specialist lazered the same vulnerable spots on my left eye so that it would ""tack"" the retina in.  There was no tear at the time, it was preventative. I wound up tearing (""giant tear"") my left retina a few years later (just by falling, thanks shitty collagen!). My dr. said that if he had not tacked the retina, my left retina would have detached. He lazer repaired the tear and tacked a bit more in. I've not had any more problems. I know I'm not the only one here who has gotten retina ""tacking"" done to prevent a detachment in their good eye.  


nopimpara does  a good job describing what the laser is like. I did not find it painful in the same way as muscles and bones, but it did sting intensely and I got a head ache that day.

I think about blindness and visual impairment for the majority of my day.  What you just described... the forced change in way of life would be the hardest part for me if I were ever to lose my vision.  Vision loss can be a death in some ways because you don't always get a choice about the things you've just described losing.  You may not be a city person,  but life circumstance and vision loss may force you out of the country.  All these things are not choices you may have made otherwise. That's super tough.  
Everyone you meet will think it's terrible too... and they'll feel sorry for you and assume you can't do things because they may see you struggle.
When you are ready,  reject the idea of feeling sorry for yourself.  Enough people will do that for you.  
You are going to have to recreate your life. There are still many things you can do that you will enjoy.  It just may look different than you expected. Be kind to yourself as you explore all of this newness. Don't expect to be an expert right away.  Give yourself time to practice skills. This part can be hard and embarrassing at first,  but it will get better. 
I tell my students that they can get good enough at the things they can do to make it look like magic to others.  It takes a lot of practice and a lot of failure to get to that point though.

Do you live in a house you built yourself? Did you teach yourself how to read? Do you grow all your own food? No. We all live in a society where we support each other by doing certain jobs. 
Just because you are visually impaired doesn't mean you can't be pretty independent,  but you are fooling yourself if you thought you were ever going to be totally independent... vision or no vision.  
Ask yourself,  what changes are you willing to make to support a life style you can be proud of? Maybe being able to travel without waiting for a ride from someone is important to you.  That might mean moving to a large city.  Maybe that means you have to move away from your family, but it would still allow for a greater level of independence. 
 You like mountain biking.  You're right.... a tandem compared to extreme mountain biking is just lame. Maybe a Wahoo kicker trainer is for you or rollers for biking indoors.... all of the balance and independence with none of the cars.

It's just my opinion, but I figure it's ok to share it: Life can be much harder experiencing it with others like you dealing with similar issues, because you and they will deal with it inevitably different. Once your paths diverge, you will ultimately have the decision of dealing with shit you already learned to get over, or they will towards you. Either way, the hurt is just not worth it.

Translation: You can deny the fact all you want, pretend like it's not there, scream injustice at it all, and insist until you're blue in the face that you not adapt and reality will not win, but reality's already won. Reality won the day you were born. The question now is, what the hell are you going to do about it? Are you going to sit there sulking because you can't do exactly what you want exactly how you want exactly when you want, or are you going to figure out how to still do exactly what you want exactly how you want on a slightly longer timeline?

Okay, I get it. Life sucks. You can't do a damn thing about that. You've been losing your sight for 18 years, and the thought didn't occur to you that hey, this shit is coming? Living with blindness, and living well with blindness, is not impossible. Teaching someone how to do that overnight, when they've both never thought about it and even now refuse to think about it, is impossible. If you can't find a way around that, then no one here is really going to be able to reach you.

The truth of the matter is you can still do a large majority of the things you want to do in life, blind or not. Okay, so maybe your days of playing Call of Duty are over. That's not the end of the world--and if you're not working, that's probably a good thing. But mountain biking, martial arts, writing, gaming, exploring--all of those and then some you can still do, even if you have absolutely no sight whatsoever. Hell, I've never had sight and put in a good 10 KM on average hiking on a semi-regular basis. If that's the kind of thing you want to do, then you might have to figure out how to do it slightly differently. If you don't want to learn how to do that differently, well, that's all I've got. But be aware that ""I don't want to learn"" is not the same as ""it can't be done"". It sure can. You just have to want to.

You don't strike me as the kind of person to take the easy way out of shit. So why are you now considering taking the easy way out? That makes no sense whatsoever. You like to be challenged, and life just gave you one. The difference is, this one you don't get to quit without saving if you fuck up. You had 18 years with the training wheels on. Now, they're off.

7716495d-928e-4a54-9274-1028888036f6,1564878733,"I don't like that whole enhanced senses thing. Mostly because when people say that, they're thinking Daredevil. I do believe we're forced to learn to pay more attention to our other senses, but I don't necessarily think they're enhanced per say. That's why someone who's recently gone blind has some of the struggles they do--they haven't acquired that skill yet.

Here's how I kind of see that whole enhanced senses thing. The sounds we're able to distinguish to a particular level have always been there. We'd be able to hear them whether or not our eyes work. The difference is in how we process them. A sighted person would likely dismiss them as background white noise. You hear a car pull into the driveway and you can tell, from your own experience and memory, that hey mom's home. Someone else would have to look out the window to obtain the same information, unless the sound mom's car makes is particularly obvious.

We also focus on things that aren't exactly sensory specific. For example, I have a degree of what I've heard called facial perception. I don't necessarily need to find a wall with my cane to know it's there. Similarly, I can tell almost immediately when I move from a narrow hallway to a more open area--just by paying attention to the space around me. I don't think that's particularly a blindness thing, but all my proof is anecdotal--picture anyone who is uncomfortable with having things near their face, for example. A sighted person might just know they hate having their face touched. A blind person might be able to tell you more. Like, I can tell your hand's near my face without your hand actually touching my face. I mean, that also doesn't bother me, but that's another story.

TL; DR: The senses and sensory information is there. We handle it differently--some of us don't handle it at all. I don't think it's a blindness thing.",,,4,0,0,

I'm sighted. I initially came here because mom was blind. She passed away almost a year ago. I've stayed here because you've all been kind enough not to ask me to leave, and in return, I've tried not to be ""that sighted guy.""

My mom had RP. Her vision degraded over the course of decades until she was finally completely blind. Because of that and other complications in her old age, she needed more and more assistance until I finally moved in with her.

She was born a Catholic and remained a Catholic until the day she died. Her life was defined by family and faith. Nothing else was as important as those two. She raised me as a Catholic, but for reasons I won't go into, I slipped away. She didn't understand it, but she accepted it, and we had an ongoing agreement to just not talk about it. This wasn't out of any hostility. Her faith was an innocent one, and I didn't want to tread on that. She prayed for me, and that was fine. She always said ""God bless you,"" and that was fine. It was her home, and I actively encouraged her to feel absolutely free in her faith without fear of offending me. I just didn't want to be preached to or reconverted.

Now to the point:

It came to be that I would be sitting in the living room, watching TV or browsing the web or whatever, and Mom, once or twice a day, would come into the room, go to one of the lamps, and turn it off and on, or on and off (depending on which state it was in to start with), then walk away. This was after she completely lost her vision, so it made me curious. At first, I didn't want to ask, because she was sensitive and vulnerable about some things, and I didn't want to intrude. But one day, my curiosity got the best of me, so as gently as I could manage, I asked her why she kept turning the lamp on and off.

She was praying every day, sometimes several times a day, and she included in her prayers some plea for some restoration of her vision. She would come in to turn the lamp on and off just to see if her prayers were having any effect. She was looking for the merest glimmer of light, literally. Just the slightest ability to be able to recognize the smallest measure of the shortest moment of transition between light and dark. That smallest bit of an answer to her prayers would have made her happy.

Her sight never recovered. She never lost her faith. She never stopped praying. She never stopped checking. I slipped away long before that, but if I'd been on the fence at all at that point, that definitely would have pushed me over.",,,4,0,0,

One day, I was getting some ice from the freezer, and as I was filling my glass, I dropped an ice cube which, as they are prone to do, slid across floor and somewhere under the table.

Before I started crawling all over to find it, I just bent down a bit and scanned the floor with my eyes. Mom was in the kitchen doing something else, and after maybe half a minute or so, she asked, ""Did you find it yet?""

I was like, ""How in the heck ..."" Just to gauge her actual understanding, I asked her, ""Did I find what?""

She said, ""The ice cube you dropped.""

I asked, ""How did you know I dropped an ice cube?""

She said, ""I heard it.""

Of course. Obvious, now that she said it. I felt kind of silly for not realizing that. So then I asked her, ""How did you know I was looking for it?""

She said, ""Because I know you wouldn't just leave it.""

With visual artwork, a person can draw an object with detail. Color, shading, reflection, all that good stuff. A person can also draw basic line art, which just shows the shape.

And yes, I mean all of what you described. I'd rather take the bickering and few toxic left than the far worse right wing... conservitives, and the like.

Case in point. I agree with about 60% of the  SJW points, especially about the systems of white privilege, and the systems of oppression... And otherwise. I'm also a member of the LGBT community with many trans friends, so know full well the toxic nature that goes in among our own. Again, I'd much rather take that kind of toxicity than the bull I had to listen to for more than five years. The toxic left is nowhere near as bad as the right.

And, if I find an ass on the left, I stop supporting them. It's that easy. I've done it before. The right wing stuff just makes me roll my eyes now, at all of it. and, I mean, all of it. stuff like not wanting women as frontline troops in battle field 1 unless they are, ahem,  historically accurate retellings of rare events? Because it's silly and a poor excuse to have the freedom to whine about women in a fictional game. 

the defense of jiggle physics in fighting games. the more serious parts like the desperate guys who relentlessly go after any female voice on XBox live. The shitstains who called in death threats to female video game journalists during gamergate. Those were death threats, period. You won't change my mind on it.

If I ever want to listen to a right wing gamer, I'll do it on my own without suggestions. If I want to seek them out again, I will. Until then, if I can avoid wasting my time, the better.

so, yeah, maybe I have grown intolerant of conservatives. Tell me why I should care beyond the echo chamber nonsense? Because... I've grown really, really, really, really, tired of it.

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1565159688,"I'm a fully blind gambler and I go to casinos with my sighted partner. There are many games that are inherently accessible due to the nature of how they are played, and casinos have no problems at all with you having someone help you if needed. 

Baccarat is great, because you only have 2 bets you can make plus an additional tie bet. The dealer does all the rest and announces what they are doing through the whole game. 

Blackjack is fine with a helper. My partner sits next to me and tells me what cards I've received and tells me the dealer's top card so I can make the right basic strategy decisions. If you ask the dealer, they'll have no problems telling you your cards; most casinos play cards up so you never have to touch them. 

Craps is my favorite game in the casino. The dealers are usually very helpful and accommodating, and my partner makes sure I'm putting some bets in the right place and she helps grab winnings as the dealers pass them out. The pit boss and crew even let some dealers hand me winnings directly or put them on my rail which is usually forbidden for players. I call out what I want to do and am confident about it and the dealers take care of the rest. If you don't know how to play, I highly suggest you learn since it has the highest potential for big wins and has the lowest house advantage over you out of all the games in the casino. 

Just stay away from slots. Best way to throw money away. I've had some friends use Aira to have a live agent describe the slot machine to them, how to play, what the buttons did, etc., but ultimately, just don't play any of them. 

I don't have any poker experience, but again, the house will have no problems with someone telling you your cards as an accommodation.  If in doubt, just ask and they'll help!

If you have a mobile phone then on Android it is called Talkback, on an iPhone it is called Voiceover. You can find these under Accessibility settings. They take some learning but can be extraordinarily enabling.

Phone apps would include  [Seeing AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/seeing-ai) for the iPhone.  This free app from Microsoft will capture and read document a page, continually read short text (like scanning a buffet bar), recognise money, describe scenes, identify colours, read bar-codes, even describe people and learn faces to recognise them later. Bloody fantastic!

Soundscape is another great phone app from Microsoft to help you get awareness of your surroundings. With headphones on it will call out landmarks and the sound will appear come from the direction the thing is in. Also bloody fantastic!

[Be My Eyes](https://www.bemyeyes.com/) is an app I hear about on this forum but I have no direct experience. It connects you to people who will tell you what they can see through your phone's camera.

[Voicedream](https://www.voicedream.com/) Reader is another great app for reading text on your phone or tablet. It can do a good job of pulling the text from a doc or pdf and reading it out loud while displaying the text in large print and highlighting the word being read. This works well if you have some sight and want to follow the text as it is read out. Lots of controls for voices and speed of reading. 

A similar app is Dolphin [EasyReader](https://yourdolphin.com/en-gb/products/individuals/families/easyreader) which is free for your phone or tablet.

The VI person I know has a software package called Dolphin Supernova which reads the menus and text on their computer screen including the content of Word docs and some PDF. The same package can also take a camera image or a scan and convert the images of text into characters to be read out loud. Other similar packages for desktop computers are [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (free of charge) and [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) ($90 per year for home use in the US).

I'm sure there is stuff I've missed. Also I'm in the UK so there will be differences with the US. In the UK we have the [RNIB](https://www.rnib.org.uk/) which provides a lot of advice, information and support. I think the US equivalent is the [AFB](https://www.afb.org/)",,,1,0,0,

Me too. I would say probably everyone who has been through extreme difficulties too. I have had many piles upon piles of hard problems. I've questioned why I have been getting these things. Why can't I have a charmed life too? Why can't I be healthy all my life, why can't I have the money I need so I can do what I like to do and explore my hobbies, heck sometimes we can't put enough food on the table. Why do I have multiple strange health problems? I could take it all out on God and just turn away.

If I put a cellphone to my ear, within a minute or two I feel buzzing heat swirling around in my ear. If I keep talking I can feel it penetrating. It feels extremely uncomfortable. So I never sleep with the phone next to me or anything because of this. I use wired headphones when a call is going to be more than a minute. I have to! My husband has Bluetooth headphones. I tried them. It is the same sensation. That solution is out.

  


It's EMF and it's happening to everyone, just some folks can't feel it or aren't as sensitive. But it's really painful after a short time.

  


If headphone jacks are removed I will shop only for phones that have them. If none have them anymore, I will have to put everyone on speaker phone. Sometimes that's bad if there is background noise. If that happens we will have to talk later or find another communication method (Skype on the computer/Google chat/Discord if they want to talk to me that badly?)

  


For music - I never ever subject my ears/brain to extended listening with a headphone. Within about 15mins to a half hour of headphone use, I get the same sensation as using the phone straight against my ear. So I've downloaded my audio to an old Creative Zen mp3 player with no wifi. I can listen the whole day if I want! There are still some non-internet capable mp3 players sold. They're very inexpensive.

There are about five really common conditions that cause impaired vision; I think that they are (in no particular ordgh) RP, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

While lots of people have these extremely common conditions, there are lots of people who, like you, have conditions that most people don't know about simply because of how uncommon the conditions they have are.

Rather than trying to find people with your specific condition, you could try to find the people who can't rely on an RP support group or a macular degeneration support group. The reason you should try to find the other people who don't fit into a common-vision-disorder-group, apart from being easier than finding people with your condition, is that no-one's experience of losing their vision is the same, because everyone loses it at their own pace and has different life circumstances (their support network, their home, their job, etc.). Unlike losing a family member when everyone passes through some sequence of stages of grieving—because now scientists know that there's more than one set of stages—losing a sense like vision is different for each person, especially for the people with rarer conditions who cannot rely on the experiences of others to know about the future.

Finally, I just want to state that some people who were born with a vision impairment know what losing a sense is like because they might have been born with impaired vision that they gradually lost, or they may have lost their sense of hearing or touch, so even some of us know what it's like to lose part of what makes us human.",,,4,0,0,

If your really an SJW like you say rather than simply a commited activist, than you should know your likely doing more harm to the causes you subscribe too than help on the societal acceptance level.  For instance, most trans people when asked feel very misrepresented and used by the LGBTQ+ community and in particular SJW's.  Most victories would be hollow shadows because of how forced they were.  You'd get people going along with it publically to save face, but hating you and by extension the groups you represent for the way you've force fed it to them.  True SJW's reject human nature and want everything done right now as fast as possible, fuck anyone that stands in their way including their own, and who ever can collect the most injustice points or act the most outraged wins.

It's often a highly narcissistic, self congratulating form of activism which likely stems from feelings of no control.  Understandable in this world and with the media riling people up for views...  But still not acceptable.

No one likes a loud, prejudgemental asshole.  And yes, even though some groups have it worse, you can still be racists/sexist/what ever even if you stand up for the little guy, and end up becoming a mirror image of exactly what you hate, without even realizing it before it's too late because of the aforementioned echo chamber.

And refusing to listen to dissenting opinion doesn't make you look committed.  It makes you look weak, as if you know your position is tenuous and wouldn't stand up to scrutiny.  I can understand not wanting to be hounded about it constantly or having to defend everything you say, but you were the one who came out swinging.  You don't get to dish it out and then expect not to take it right back.

So advertizing that your actively siding with this kind of movement is kinda stupid IMO...  After all even though the majority and minority are not at parody so putting one over the other isn't going to cause an immediate power shift like fox news will have you believe, it's still not a good attitude to have (one person is more deserving/better/more valuable because of a non skill related trait) there by inevitably devaluing the other, and can easily spiral out of control down the road.

If you really want to get people to accept what they don't know, you need to break down barriers and let them see the echo of humanity in it, so that they can empathise and therefore try to understand it better.  We understand love, so two gay men getting married makes sense from that angle when you take the (uncontrollable) biological repulsion out of it, show how normal these people's lives are outside of the bedroom, and discredit those making wild claims about the supposedly outsized impact, ""homosexuality spreading like a plague or being the only cause of AIDS"".

I mean preferring LGBT/POC to straight/white is already kind of telling, as it gives the impression that your putting one group over another simply because of traits which are A. out of their control and B. not at all relevant to the medium, but in the end, you watch what you want.

Also keep in mind, not everyone wears their personal life on their sleeve for extra views or just confidence.  Half those people you listen too could easily be gay/bi/asexual/pansexual but you wouldn't know it because they don't feel the need to scream it from the rooftops.  It doesn't define them, nor do they take advantage of the current political climate to disproportionately increase there viewership.

Frankly, what we need is less shallow groupism and outrage culture, not more.  This road is one paved with good intentions, but it goes directly to hell, just by another rout, and your (decent human beings) comment is a perfect example of how it's shaped you already.",,,1,0,0,

The way they tip tap around to check on you or make little barking noises and jump around when their all spun up about something is pretty great too, same for when they growl while tugging on a toy and respond to the pitch of your voice.

I also like their wet noses, their warmth just as another living and present creature, and furr if it's nice, like a big stuffed animal (it's just calming to stroke) as well as the shape of their face and especially ears particularly if they can move them around, the little dip at the top of their head ETC.

I can totally understand not wanting to debate people endlessly, I just can't understand why you would make such obviously baiting statements and not expect to be called out on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Your reasoning behind wanting LGBT/POC channels now makes more sense (you want to stick up for the little guy and you don't like going with the status quo) that's fair enough, but why is it that you expect these people to be not just as bad as their straight white counterparts in other ways?  Black trans women can be pieces of shit too...  And most LGBT/POC seem to be liberal leaning mainly because they are going with the heard and have been told by politicians that the left is who has their best interests at heart, when that's clearly not the case much of the time.  So yeah, you may get fewer right wing ideals, but what makes you think your going to get anything valuable either...

I mean most people are centrists on both sides, and if a little bit of conservatism really bothers you that much, maybe your being intolerant as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Which kinda brings me to my last question.  What right wing video gaming culture.  Most smaller gaming channels aren't much a part of that culture anyway, and as I'm sure you know, their are so many people playing now that it's a melting pot of backgrounds, ages, financial situations, and politics, so as with most of the population, your going to get mainly centrists who sway from one side to the other slightly on various subjects, which is perfectly healthy.

Do you mean stuff like not wanting women as frontline troops in battle field 1 unless they are historically accurate retellings of rare events?  Or are you talking about the defense of jiggle physics in fighting games?  or do you mean the more serious parts like the desperate guys who relentlessly go after any female voice on XBox live?  or the shitstains who called in convincing sounding death threats to female video game journalists during gamergate.

Exciting stuff!  If you don't mind me asking, what studio do you represent.  I'd love to check them out!  It's pretty awesome when companies take itnerest in our community.

I'd strongly suggest asking some questions on the [audiogames.net](https://audiogames.net) forum and trying some of the popular games from there too, you'll get a good idea of what we already have.

I don't know what genre your game will be though so not sure which titles to suggest.  Also if it's on IOS, try asking on [applevis.com](https://applevis.com) as well, and if it's for console, try ""ablegamers"".

It's important to ask about the negative tropes and pitfalls of previous titles coming from outside the community.  Some of our best games are brought to us from that rout of course and we always appreciate the effort, as we have very little money and it's pretty much all solo hobbyist devs, but if you want to sell well it would be a good idea to get some feedback about your ideas before steaming ahead as others have done in the past unsuccessfully.

That said, not everyone plays audio only games, like the other posters mentioned.  Try Liam Erven  [https://www.youtube.com/user/liamerven/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/liamerven/videos)  for a decent mix of both.

Object recognition is quite sparse in it's descriptions most of the time, and at other times wildly inaccurate.

Color identifiers are also terrible across the board, even with good light, so that's out too.  We may use them for currency identification if ours doesn't have tactile markings, but it's generally too slow and unwieldy of a method to do it while actually at a store, so most people do it at home and then fold their bills in different ways or use different compartments to keep denominations separate in their wallet for later.

Face recognition seems like it could be useful for finding a friend in a crowd, but you need a person willing to let you train your phone to recognize them, and it's kinda rude to take a picture of a large group without permission.

These club owners might be talking out their asses because they're afraid, but it's possible that they're not aware of the laws themselves. If you know your rights, you can challenge them. And if there's nothing in your local laws that protects you from this kind of discrimination (and it is discrimination, flat out) you can contact your law makers and maybe get something started so this problem will go away in the long run. It's frustrating, but we often have to stand up for ourselves because nobody else will. 
In the short term, just challenge the club owners by asking why sighted patrons are allowed in. They're more likely to get hurt in an atmosphere of a dark club with flashing lights than you are because they're not used to being in the dark.

Shchwann's delivers food and you can pay them with food stamps, so that's an option to get some things. It's not exactly healthy but you won't starve.

It sounds like the big problem is that they're just not remembering that there's a blind student in class but I should note that you're doing a great job of advocating for yourself and getting your own needs met even in this circumstance that's not ideal. You may have to sit at the front, but it allows you to participate and that is a way of making what you need known to your teacher. Sometimes we have to take the little victories while we work towards the big ones.
But if you start feeling like you want to educate your teachers more, you may have to be your own ambassador. Here in the States, a lot of us learn about our own disabilities and how to explain them from a young age. You could maybe write a letter explaining your blindness,  what it is, and how staff can best help you or how they can work with  you so that everyone learns some strategies to make your time as their student better for everyone. Self advocacy isn't always the most fun, but it's one of the most useful tools you can have as a blind person.

Out of shape guy here who used to be a fitness nut and is looking to get back in to it because of my sedentary job. 

It is of course a little hard without knowing your exact situation but I would say, yes, you will need to do aerobic exercise, preferably first thing in the morning or on an empty stomach at least. This way you will burn fat, not just carbohydrates. I suggest a treadmill because it is the best machine for maintaining an elevated heartrate in my opinion but, really, any aerobic exercise will do. Find something you can do for 20 minutes and go from there. In other words, improve your duration and intensity slowly over time. Find a new aerobic activity after about 12 to 15 weeks if you can so your body doesn't adapt. 

Second, and this advice is specific for people who are blind, learn the motions for executing anaerobic exercises using your body weight and dumbbells to improve your metabolism and burn extra calories  during the recovery period. Do not rely on machines. This is because weight machines change from gym to gym, dumbbells do not, and, even if you never change gyms, you will have to move around a lot to find the various weight machines. Dumbbell racks and benches are in the same place so once you get set up, you don't have to move around for an entire workout which, again will keep your heart rate up and will allow you to fully concentrate on your workout, not your mobility. It will ultimately be safer for everyone. Concentrate on your form as you perform each exercise, not how much weight you can move to prevent injury and from… well, looking silly. Move the weight slowly and deliberately to impact each area during the range of motion and for the same two reasons as before, injury prevention and silliness. 

Now, the hard part, how do you know proper form if you can't see others doing it first? I would say, worry about that less than you think. Most people in gyms, and on YouTube for that matter, don't really know what they are doing. There are websites out there with good text descriptions of various exercises. Know what exercises you are going to perform before heading to the gym and practice without weights. Once there, and, before performing any anaerobic exercise, warm up with about 30% of the weight you can actually move so you can get comfortable with your balance. You will be moving in space in unusual ways, and, if you are total, it may feel pretty disorienting at first. I also recommend you, in about the first 4-to-6 weeks, workout with a more experienced partner or Trainor so you can get a sense of the intensity you will need and to correct any flaws or bad habits you have developed. I worked out with a body-builder a couple of times and this was the only way I knew how hard I was supposed to be working. He was very impressed with my form though and only made a few minor corrections. I don't recommend doing it sooner because it will take some time for you to get strong enough and comfortable enough with the motions to be able to repeat them consistently for them to observe. 

If anyone wants me to describe certain exercises or full workouts, or even try to record them in audio, I would be willing to give it a try. Just let me know. All the best to you.",,,1,0,0,

Well, I can relate to all of these. Thank you all for posting. Let me take it on a slightly different bent. I can tell you about a conversation I had over and over again. I was dating someone once who probably has slightly better vision than I do but because of her upbringing had very little cane skills. She was just learning at the time (this was in her mid-thirty's) and wasn't comfortable using it particularly in clouds or in the dark preferring instead to use me as her not so sighted guide. She would bring it out when the ground was more open and flat only. The one thing she wasn't though was shy. Whenever we would ask for directions, and the hapless sightling would ignore me (you know how they do) she would say something like ""don't show me, I am blind,"" The person would almost without fail say, ""oh sorry miss I thought he was."" They would inevitably look around for a third person to talk to. More than once the conversation ended with the person thinking we were just messing with them and get exasperated. I know when I write about it doesn't seem that funny but to us, it was hilarious.",,,1,0,0,

Hi Everyone

For starters, your brother is a (insert derogatory name here), and it sounds like it is not possible to totally avoid dealing with him. This is a somewhat painful admission but growing up, I treated other blind kids badly much of the time. I am writing specifically to thank you for your post. I read it over the weekend and it got me thinking that the reason for this is probably because I saw them struggling with things and being helped and did not want that for myself even though, I was just as blind if not more so than they were. I've changed. Somewhere around eighth grade things started to flip. I've had three girlfriends with visual impairments and have had several blind friends in my life in the past. Moreover, I became a service provider for students with disabilities. I apologize to any of those blind people out there I knew growing up. Given you were, like me, young, being bullied by another blind kid no less, was a painful experience. Second, I am sure I would have had a richer, rewarding, childhood had I been able to maintain friendships with other blind people back then. 

Now, He's quite a bit older, but perhaps there's hope for your brother once he matures too. In the meantime it is okay for you to feel like cutting him out. Best of luck, and, again, thanks for your post.",,,1,0,0,

Please explain how there is a causal relationship between your school being 95% Catholic and it being a school with blind and visually impaired children.

The fact that the school was largely Catholic has nothing to do with whether or not the school would have blind attendees. I am assuming that this was a private school and didn't receive federal funding. According to the US Department of Education, schools that do not receive federal funding and are not required to be in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). The IDEA is the primary law that requires publicly funded education institutes provide reasonable accommodations and modifications for students with disabilities to guarantee their Constitutional right to a free education. 

Honestly, I don't give a crap about your opinion. You have made blatantly racist comments and did not apologize when I pointed them out.You make significant errors in your posts that obfuscate the points you are making; and you keep bringing up prostitution, which is a red herring. Some people go the grocery store to by the ingredients to make a hamburger; some people go to McDonalds to get a hamburger. Prostitution is none of your business. It doesn't affect you and it has nothing to do with issues in the blind community.

You say that you are not racist because you attended a teleconference that included people of color? Wow! I have never met someone who is so clearly a bastion of tolerance and acceptance! It is an honor. You are racist because you implied there should be a limit to the number of persons of color that can be helped. Period.

The historical snapshot of the treatment of the visually impaired on which you are fixated is somewhat representative of the period 1890-1960; at least as far as the treatment of persons with visual impairments in the public sector, there is insufficient accountability and regulation of the private sector.

This is not an insignificant amount of time. However, significant legislation and Supreme Court rulings came through in the 1960s to extend the rights of all persons and changed our country significantly. And, with individual experiences perhaps being different, the shifts in treatment, services, and benefits for the blind have consistently improved. We are not even close to equity of rights for all persons in this country, but we are getting closer.

I disagree with your assertion that people with ""vision loss"" and people with ""congenital blindness"" should be treated by separate entities.

It is easy for service providers to communicate and coordinate for clients with similar needs.

A common lunch, $10-15 makes about 6-7 depending on how big I have them

- Butter/boston lettuce, the best tasting one. I could eat a bag of these leaves on their own. I just toss a handful in the bottom of the bowl, then about half of the rest of the ingredients, another handful, then whatever I left aside, ie cucumbers, carrots, cheese, etc.

- Sliced and quartered cucumber, about a third of a cucumber each time unless it's too big / small. Roughly a 2-3 inch section. I wash and dry it each time, but leave the skin on.

- A handful of shredded carrots. Usually I just buy the bag because it's like $3 and the normal carrots are like $2.50

- Sprinkle on cheese, usually shredded taco cheese or parmesan

- 2-4 frozen meatballs, diced, or bacon bits, or chicken if I have leftovers. Some meat, though.

- A glug of italian dressing.

Then I just shake it up and eat it. Mushrooms, tomatoes, croutons, eggs,whatever you like can go in there. I just keep it simple. I can put it together in about 2 minutes. I usually put some of the cucumber aside so it doesn't sink into the salad, never to be seen again, when I'm shaking it.

Then, for dinner, I use whatever boneless meat I have and generally a random sauce, plus onions or something like that. Barbacue sauce, boneless chicken, onions, a little hot sauce, and let it cook on low all day. Shred, mix well, and then you have tasty sandwich fillings that go well with easy steamed veggies.

I really like black beans and chicken covered in salsa. The beans soak up the heat and become little spice bombs, and you can wrap it up in a tortilla with rice, lettuce, tomato, a little sour cream if you fancy it, etc. It might even be good in a salad with some ranch or something.

I can't help but feel like half of the suggestions on here are people saying it in the hopes that they'll one day believe it. Described video isn't as good as *real* TV and movies. Audio games aren't as good as video games, Tandem biking isn't as good as just going for a ride whenever you want, etc. If someone wants to try arguing against this they must first answer this question. If they really are just as good then why aren't droves of sighted people also using them in equal amounts? The answer of course is they're *not* as good and sighted people don't use them because they don't *need* to. The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. I much prefer to recognised that basic fact of reality rather than lie to myself as if I'm dumb enough to believe it. Things that were never visual in the first place are things that you have an argument for. Music, meditation, working out, reading, etc. I for one am into a lot of paranormal stuff and to a degree vision loss helps me run tests on my intuition since I already don't have much vision left to get in the way of it. It's made out of body experiences and remote viewing sessions interesting since in some cases my blindness goes away. Which as I've learned is an interesting facet of some near death experience research since congenitally blind people will report vivid visuals that they physically should not be able to report.

9478469f-9bab-4f9d-aa45-fbd89ba0e45e,1565829068,"Sorry it took so long to reply, I decided to take a break from all this before reading any other replies. 

I have been preparing for pretty much all those years, however I simply don't want any of what's coming and don't think it's remotely lazy or entitled to cash out instead of force myself to struggle for something I don't want. That being said it's not like I've been doing nothing all this time either. Though the story is far too long to go into in just a comment. 

I did a bunch of research and stated doing experiments in areas most people would consider ""paranormal"" to see what I could do with it and if there was even anything there to begin with. Turned out there was and I started using that to put together something that, if completed, could probably do a lot more than just fix my eyes. It's a little convoluted but sufficed to say, a form of psychokinesis would be involved.

Encouraged by my friend (who is still my friend, they apparently weren't even mad at me) partly because I was able to give them more than a little evidence that it worked over time. Eventually when things got bad enough that I qualified for disability income I decided to take the money and put everything I had into developing this. Willingly setting myself back economically to work on something that could be more valuable than money itself as far as I'm concerned.

Took a number of years but I have demonstrated that what I'm trying to do is at least possible and now everything is devoted to making it work stably and on demand. But this doesn't exactly make money, and I don't want it to even if it's fully successful. But nothing is certain, it's entirely possible that I might just fail at the end anyways. 

You might be thinking ""Okay but then why don't you jut go make money and develop this on the side?"" I thought of that too, but the training kicks the fucking shit out of my body and makes it pretty much impossible to concentrate during the recovery periods. So I've learned that I basically have to choose one or the other. Certainly at this stage.

There's absolutely nothing of value down the path of normality for me, nothing at all. I refuse to remain as weak as this and I won't submissively ""accept"" blindness and beat my chest like so many others at how tough they are because they were willing to settle for less as if that really equates to life satisfaction. Reality has not won, not by a long shot, even if I die before completing this it hasn't won. It only wins if I give up and see it as unchangeable like so many others here, and I will die before doing that.

My experiences developing this have left me with with no fear of death and learning about the field of parapsychology and how it's not exactly the psuedosience it's often portrayed as helps with the R&amp;D. If by any chance you or anyone else is interested in any of this I'd recommend checking out these two channels as a start.

One thing that will really help is counseling with a therapist who specializes in vision loss.

It's called Adjustment Counseling.

Here's the write-up from someone in my local area, so you can see if this sounds helpful:

### WHAT IS ADJUSTMENT to Vision Loss COUNSELING?

Counseling that helps individuals and their families learn how to cope and accept vision loss. It often consists of:

* Understanding and accepting your condition
* Grief Counseling
* Learning what to expect
* Moving beyond false limitations
* Job/career transition
* Advocating and educating others
* Consulting with schools, employers, and others regarding accommodations and best practices
* Adaptive skills and devices
* Resources

There are many topics covered during adjustment counseling, and I will modify it to each person’s unique needs. The primary goal is to help you not only survive this transition, but thrive. You will walk away realizing that, if you choose, you can still be independent and have a life you love.

### WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?

There is a grieving process that is healthy for people to go through during this transition. After all, it is a significant loss and is often unexpected. There will be a wide range of feelings including sadness, anger, stress, shame, confusion, and uncertainty. However, this grief and accompanying feelings can often transition into something unhealthy. If you or your loved one experience any of the things below, it may be time to reach out:

* Hopelessness
* Isolating from friends or family
* Significant changes in mood
* Frequent anxiety
* Difficulty sleeping
* Limiting activities
* Fear of others knowing about the vision condition
* Avoidance of things associated with blindness (refusal to use cane or participate in training)

All of the above are very common for people with visual impairments to experience, but should not be considered normal or ignored. These are symptoms of someone who is struggling with the adjustment to their condition and it should be addressed.

&amp;#x200B;

### REACH OUT

Adjustment to vision loss counseling can be extremely beneficial. Sometimes it takes some guidance to get from a place of loss to a place of hope. I can tell you from experience that there is hope, and there is life after vision loss.

I am a certified Vision Rehabilitation Therapist with more than 10 years experience working with people with visual impairments. I also have my own [personal experience](http://blindnewworld.org/blog/changing-the-world-one-person-at-a-time/) with vision loss that led me to this field of work. I am passionate about helping others realize that there is life after blindness, and live their best possible life.

### ARE YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE EXPERIENCING VISION LOSS?

You don’t have to navigate it alone. This can be a devastating experience, and no matter what stage of this process you are in, I am here to help you along the way.

You may be grieving. You may be feeling completely overwhelmed. Maybe you are experiencing anxiety or depression. All of these are extremely common for people who have developed a visual impairment, and you can learn to manage it.

### WHAT IS VISION REHABILITATION?

Vision Rehabilitation is a term used that encompasses all areas of training, adaptive equipment, adjustment counseling, job/career transition, low vision evaluations, and much more. In short, it is everything that will help you to live the life you want after experiencing vision loss. I will help you to get to a place of acceptance and make sure you find your way through the various resources and options for assistance in the other areas of your vision rehabilitation process.

### WHAT IF I CAN’T COME IN FOR COUNSELING?

If you do not live in the Indianapolis area, or don’t have convenient transportation options, distance counseling may work for you. This involves doing the same work we would do in person by phone or video conferencing. It is extremely effective and provides extra convenience. Make sure to ask about this if you think it may be the right fit for you.

You don’t need to do this alone. Contact me to find out about counseling, support groups, or other helpful resources.

&amp;#x200B;

But the population in the study is not necessarily the same as in all other countries.  Here's a quote from the paper:  ""Consanguineous marriage, especially first cousins’ marriage, has been reported to be the most common etiology of RP in Iran ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4433734/#ref12)).""

&amp;#x200B;

This indicates marriage between first cousins or closer, and this can lead to many complications in health and genetics, beyond RP.  Here's an article from the National Institute of Health on the topic: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3419292/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3419292/)  


So this study is specific to the population they tested, unless your country and population is markedly similar and you have the same genetic variant of RP (which they did not test for).  


It's easy to read a study like this and panic, as if RP is giving you all these other disorders.  It's not.  

However, there are many studies showing the relationship between vision loss, stress, depression, and anxiety.  This is a substantial concern, and something we should have a lot of tools to address.",,,1,0,0,

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, many doctors are ""experts"" but that doesn't mean that they're an expert of all the various conditions and diseases.  


What you really need is to see an ophthalmologist at a teaching hospital who does extensive work and research on complex disorders.   You seems to have a very good grasp on eye and medical disorders (based on your previous posts), so I navigating the conversations with the universities medical eye department should be really doable for you.

&amp;#x200B;

And thanks to the Internet, we are only limited by the number of languages we speak and understand.

&amp;#x200B;

So one goal could be to either find the online group where people with your disorder gather... or start one.

My vision took a huge hit in my teens, so I can relate to what you went through. At the time, I was starting to question the Evangelical beliefs about homosexuality, other religions, and evolution as well, so I became agnostic in all but name for a while even as I went to church with my mom. Then, I came back to evangelical Christianity for a time after I met someone who I believe to be a godsend at the time and who turned me back to the faith. Now that I have lost more vision and gone to college, I am questioning again and struggle to call myself a Christian on many days. It's not just one thing, but many things that make me question. My family is Pentecostal-leaning, non-denominational Christian, so I grew up believing God might heal or stop my vision loss either through a miracle or scientific breakthrough. That did not help me come to terms with my condition or prepare for the impending blindness.

I am warming up to Christianity once again, but I think I’ve given up Evangelicals for good. I’m not denying the possibility of miracles, but I don’t want to go to a church that teaches miracles will rain down from heaven if I just have enough faith or that talks about the healed blind people in the Bible like there are no blind people in the audience. I’m looking into mainline Protestantism and possibly Eastern Orthodoxy. I enjoy the ritual, music, and moral contemplation that is lacking in Evangelicalism and would prefer a denomination which ordains women and doesn't rant against the LGBTQ+ community. I know they're out there. Regardless of the existence of a deity, I am trying to figure out if I am just one of those people who needs to believe in something. Even if I come to believe that religion is mostly metaphorical, I still believe it can have value. However, I live at home right now, and I know I could never be anything other than openly Christian to my family. My inability to drive has kept me from exploring other beliefs as well. I would love to visit a Buddhist temple someday, but I would have to go secretly on my own.

I also had a family friend who I hadn’t seen for years ask to pray for me in public. That was an odd experience, but it felt like there was no proper way to say no. I’m not sure what he thought he had that the others who prayed for me before did not.

The sme disease that has caused my vision loss also caused my kidneys to fail, which resulted in receiving a kidney transplant during my senior year. I had the normal questions like, why does God allow suffering or why did God let this happen to me? I found my answers. I went through periods of depression. I leaned on my faith during the hard times. Just because you have faith doesn’t mean you are free of questions and sadness and frustration. My faith has played an integral role in my life and especially in the instances of vision loss and health issues. The ministry of Jesus was built on praying for and healing the sick. Miracles sometimes happen. The faith community doesn’t always understand acceptance of a physical or psychological impairment. They do not always understand what to do when you don’t get your miracle. I believe that our prayers are always answered, but they are not always answed in the way that we want. My family still prays for a cure. I personally do not need or want a cure. I believe that my challenging experiences are just part of my tool kit to do God’s will and help others.",,,3,0,0,

However, IF someone said that to me, I'd say ""thank you"" and be happy about it. Cuz especially the ""brave"" part isn't actually that wrong in my opinion. Maybe if you're blind since birth you feel differently about it but having gone blind during the past few years, I struggle with all kinds of negative feelings. I've become quite the hermit, which makes me said and my wife even more so. I want to change this but going out of the house is difficult emotionally. I've done all that O&amp;M stuff and I'm also in therapy but I still get anxiety (something I had never experienced before in my life). It's stressful to constantly ask strnagers for help, search things etc. Also, the worse my cornea becomes the more I'm dealing with the sunlight being unbearably blinding. I'm wearing dark sunglasses but it's still a big problem (I also don't have an iris, which makes the whole thing much worse). I like going out on rainy or cloudy days but on sunny days I really need to give myself that ""kick in the butt"" to go outside. It's not a very pleasant experience. So, when I end up doing it, if I just walk to the supermarket, I feel great about myself. According to this sub, most blind people don't want to be called ""brave"". I differ from that. I'd love to get that compliment granted that it's meant genuinely. I really do think of myself as brave. Yes, going to the supermarket may not be a big deal and when I had better vision it really wasn't. But now it is. And so I like when people acknowledge that.

Maybe one difference to other blind people is that I'm not getting too much acknowledgement for my achievements in general. Both my siblings treat my going blind as a mildly interesting blip on the radar. They don't ask me any questions, they don't make comments. All I get is a sarcastic joke from my older brother every now and then like ""sorry about spilling your drink... oh wait, you can't see it anyway hahaha."" My parents care and I know they feel for me but they also want me to deal with my negative feelings on my own. So, in the end, I only have one person who truly acknowledges my struggle and that's my wife. Everyone else (family, friends etc) cares about it on an extremely superficial level. Sometimes they ask me how I am but whenever I try to tell them about my daily struggles related to my eyes, they seem to get very impatient and want to move on to a different topic.

Maybe other blind people have a ton of friends and family members who make them compliments and so they don't really need to hear it from strangers. I don't get many compliments related to my eyes and so I appreciate every genuine compliment I get, even if it's the bus driver who says it.",,,3,0,0,

I don't wanna bore you with the medical details but one big problem for me is that I don't have those stem cells at the edges of cornea (it's called limbal stem cell deficiency I think). When people need a new cornea, be it artificial or donor, which is the case for me, those corneas usually get attached to those limbal stem cells. Since I don't have those stem cells, there's no ""hook"" to attach an artificial cornea. About 20 years ago when I was a child, they tried to take stem cells from my dad and transplant them into my eye. The idea was that those stem cells would then grow and finally they could work as a hook. Sadly, my body rejected my dad's stem cells.

I'm not asking for medical advice or anything but do you know anything about the current stem cell research? Do you think this issue could be solved (especially the one related to the immune system overreacting and rejecting everything)? I'd be very interested to hear.",,,1,0,0,

It's not that I can't do it; I've become very independent with my white cane, I just find it exhausting that I always have to search everything, ask strangers for help everywhere etc.

One of the problems I've noticed is that sighted people have very little patience with blind people. They will act nice and kind to you because they want to be polite but they don't actually want to be your friend because that's just too exhausting to them (or at least they imagine it to be very exhausting). This is all very troubling to me. So, while O&amp;M is great, there are these emotional issues that it can't help me with.

This was different for me. It made a ton of sense for my parents to protect me from his aggressions and violence. My eyes are/were extremely sensitive, not at least due to multiple surgeries I had to undergo as a child (including the long recoveries) and the very high glaucoma. A forceful punch in my face may have easily been enough to rob me the extremely precious eyesight I still had. For example all of my doctors explicitly told my parents that I couldn't play team sports because the danger of a soccer ball or something similar hitting me in the face and making me go completely blind was simply too high.

What shocked and hurt me was the fact that my brother obviously has no empathy for this. Like, if I had a sibling with glass bone disease and he told me that I have to treat him with great care because I might otherwise cause him permanent and irreparable damage to his body, this would make total sense to me. It would also make total sense that a dad or a mom would protect their vulnerable child from its needlessly aggressive sibling.

I had been a JAWS user for many years. I spent ages learning to script JFW3.7. So apart from the scripting, which NVDA does better but differently, there's a few big JAWS gotyas that I miss, and so keep JAWS around for. 

First and most annoying are the little annoyances on the web. JAWS treats the information about virtualised text as part of the buffer, so you can here ""list of"" or ""table with"" and skip it. Opening items in lists, tables etc are also therefor on the next line. 
Navigating by paragraph and sentence is a different experience and that works best with JAWS, and the way you find text in virtualised documents is also handled better with JAWS (NVDA doesn't provide much context if you do an in-page find-next). 

Next, JAWS ability to OCR both screens, controls and standalone gfiles/documents is vastly superior to NVDA. I recognise of course that's because of a paid-for system, but that doesn't change the level of effectiveness. 

Finally, JAWS has some tools that I've just grown used to. the inconsistency checker that ships as part of the JAWS text analyser is very handy professionally. JAWS ability to adjust synthesizer settings or play sounds for certain text characteristics is potentially game-changing for some, and of course having all the voices available may also be attractive. 

That said, I do now use NVDA full-time on Windows. Remote access is my main reason for shifting - I spend so much of my time on other systems it's just impossible to do that with JFW. Often I can go hours without knowing which I'm using, there's very nearly parity. 
I'm very much a fan of NVDA. Maybe one day I'd learn to code addons to solve my little gripes.",,,5,0,0,

I have Airpods that I use ninety percent of the time, but days when I have class I have some Bose earbuds that I use because they have less noise isolation than the Airpods and the Airpods have an ever so slight lag to them, that is noticeable when typing, and I don't really want that when I'm taking notes, etc.
The only problem I have with the removal of the headphone jack is that I've had to buy several of the adaptors at this point becuase they seem to be a bit flimsy. I notice that after they are used for awhile and subject to daily use, you can bend it a certain way and this will trigger the media controls on the earbuds you have plugged in. So if the phones in my pocket and I move a certain way it could randomly start playing whatever I had paused, adjust the volume, skip track, etc.",,,2,0,0,

Not sure is you're familiar with Ayn Rand, but the stuff about people being totally independent is really similar to the arguments against the philosophy found in her novels.
