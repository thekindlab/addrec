The problem is I'm from Switzerland where disabled individuals have almost no legal protections. So it's frustrating in a two ways. When someone discriminates you it's already super frustrating but then you can't even do much about it. However, I have written an email to the management now. I told them I want a different stove/oven and I also told them the sexist/ableist remark was totally inappropriate. I haven't yet heard back from them but I hope that they will eventually give in if I get on their nerves for long enough. I'd even go as far as paying for the new devices myself because the current situation is really not working.

What depresses me the most, however, is the fact that the architect couldn't think of this. I mean, he's not some random office worker. He's a freaking architect who designs living spaces for people as a job. How can it not cross his mind that such a stove/oven would be a problem for a blind person? It's like designing a building without a ramp and without an elevator, not even thinking about the possibility that wheelchair-bound people might want to live there. Thinking about the different needs of your customers seems like such a basic thing. So, yes, I totally agree with you that it's very annoying how sighted people assume everyone's just like them and everything's a piece of cake.",,,1,0,0,

I have been struggling with this for a few months now, but decided to just behave like I would with any other person and so far me and my new friend who happens to be blind, is getting on like a house in fire. 

One thing that really put me at ease was him saying the word see in a sentence. He said 'I saw something this one time' and immediately that made me feel ok to say 'see' too. Silly I know... 

The only thing that is still a struggle is to know if I am bombarding him because, of course I initiate the conversations, as he doesn't know I'm around, but does he really feel like talking to me? I don't know, other than to start the conversation and taking it from there, which sometimes meant having conversations dying out awkwardly (he wasn't in the mood for one but was too nice to say but it became clear eventually) anyway will keep working on it!

Make them give you all material including textbook in PDF format as well. Then request Jaws from them as you will need it for Microsoft Office products, if they refuse to pay for it then ask them to point you in the direction of a state agency that can provide it to you free of charge, because you cannot afford it.

If you can, get the Voice Dream Reader app (I have a calculus book on mine), and the Voice Scanner app (I use my app to read handouts).

You can also request a note taker and/or a classroom scribe, and even record lectures. 

Ask them if they have a swell machine, if they do not, then there is a portable device that a scribe can use to draw graphs that allow you to feel them in 3D (I forget the name of it), see if they can order this device for you.

There is also talking graphing calculators that they should be able to order for you. 

Then request that all test be given on some type of CCTV such as the DaVinci. You can also request 2.5x on all exams or quizzes due to your visual impairment.

For online homework from Pearsons, you need to tell the professor that he can only assign the assignments that are accessible for screen readers. Here is the link that will explain how to do this, https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/mymathlab/accessibility/index.html

NVDA works best with google drive (such as google docs). Unlike Jaws, NVDA is free, however it is somewhat limited.

You state should have some type of blind organization that can advocate on your behalf with your school in case you run into issues with your disability office.

having to adjust to a new setting while blind is pretty intimidating— i moved to a big city when i started college and i initally stayed only on campus or in my dorm— i knew the city offered plenty to experience, but i was too scared. 

And that’s just moving to different cities! I can’t imagine what it must be like to move to a different country. 

For getting out more, I think it really is vital to experience public transportation with a trusted loved one. after using the bus/subway system here was my sister a couple times, and I felt confident enough to try it myself. but of course, if that’s too big if a step, simply go for a walk around the block— familiarize yourself with what restaurants/cafes are close by, find your favorite, go sit there often— it’s all up to you.

True though, if all my r&amp;d costs are for 1 or 2 products, especially in a small market, I can't take chances on doing anything other than maximising profits which would lead me to find the sweet spot between cheap and out of range.

I wonder if the price is inflated because they know that people can apply for government help to purchase it but it's unlikely to be too much. The trick will be to figure out how to build in high quality things for accessibility and make sure that it's part of of every day technology. As it is, the cost becomes a barrier to entry for too many people or a cost to the state. That is to say that there is a justification even on liberal grounds for helping people maximise the use of freedom they already have and either mandating good accessibility or subsidizing it where necessary. I would far rather the second option because I don't like mandating things unless necessary.

Individuals who utilize screen reading software can determine the structure of a webpage by using keyboard (and in your case for your project) voice commands to access and interact with the webpage’s content. We rely heavily on the HTML native markup (native HTML elements, links, buttons, etc.) to get a sense of a webpage’s layout. Users also rely on correct heading level and structure &lt;H1-H6&gt; and landmarks such as headers &lt;header&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”banner”, navigation region &lt;nav) or for labels containing ARIA role=”navigation”, main content region &lt;main&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”main”, articles &lt;article&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”article”, and footer &lt;footer&gt; or for labels containing ARIA role=”contentinfo” etc. I know you mentioned that when users give a voice command or navigate to a focusable item, you have redirects to move them to an item. I am not sure how screen readers would deal with the automatic content as it is updated when moving the focus from “Programs” to “courses”. In most case scenarios it is recommended that moving the focus and the control for moving the focus for individuals who utilize screen readers is within their control. Sometimes, when focus is automatically moved for users without it being within their control, it can cause screen readers to lose focus of the location even though you are seeing the focus move from one element to another on your screen. I think with some tweaking and testing, you can use JavaScript to make sure your focus order and where you redirect the focus is correct before testing with other individuals. It is not uncommon for developers to think the focus order is correct because they see the focus change on their screen; my advice would be to test this with a screen reader and make sure focus moves exactly where you are redirecting it. But, if you can get a screen reader like NVDA to change and read the information on a focusable form field or link for example, perhaps this idea will work well and get others on board for making screen readers work more efficiently with voice recognition programs such as Dragon Naturally Speaking.Since the form is for students to fill out information for resumes, a spelling option may be needed. If you have individuals who are blind, deafblind, or visually impaired using your screen reader and/or voice recognition to complete this form, maybe a spelling option (for all other fields except the password field), that should increase the accessibility and usability of your website. The spelling option will assist these individuals in being able to ensure that the information provided is spelled correctly.As far as the usability of your form goes … it is best practice to ensure that specific directions for how to complete each field are provided within close proximity to the field. For instance, let’s say that one of the designated form fields asks for an e-mail address, to the right of the label for this field you could place in parentheses (example, domain@example.com). Having the instructions for completing each field adjacent to the form field or as close as possible to that field is important because screen readers are only capable of reading the item that has the keyboard focus at one time. If you put all instructions at the top of the form, screen reader users as well as individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities may have difficulty completing the form because they would have to keep referring to the top of the form for the instructions. Breaking them up and placing instructions adjacent to each field or as close as possible to that field decreases distractions and provides users an easier way to complete the form because they can read the instructions for each field, fill in each field, and go through the form in a linear fashion. 

 

I hope this is helpful and makes sense. I know I threw a lot of information at you here. If you are looking for someone to test your website with a screen reader and would like to go through this by phone together once it is completed let me know. I’d be glad to assist you. Kudos to you for investing the time and effort in this project. I’m glad to see that there are people out there who do take accessibility seriously and believe it is important for people with disabilities.",,,2,0,0,

1. it takes a LOT longer to get around. most people assume I'm totally blind when they see my white cane out, but I can see, it just takes me longer to figure out where everything is. if I drop or misplace something, it takes more time to figure out where it went, because I just have a small patch of central vision. I've started corralling stuff around the house on trays because it makes it easier to find. 
2. been married/with the same person for a long time (23 years), and I'm still the same person. he's OK with it, and totally supportive—we're making adjustments along the way. he's learned not to steer me around, and that I'll ask for help if I need it. (one of the biggest pain in the ass things when you go blind, I've found, is people grabbing you or making assumptions about how much you can see. or YELLING REALLY LOUDLY because they assume you can't hear too.) as far as support from family, not so much -- my aunt apparently said ""well, I've never heard of that!"" when my mom told her I had RP, and as far as I know, she still doesn't think it's a real thing. my mom also seems kind of embarrassed when I whip out the cane sometimes.
3. RP is very slow and progresses over decades. so far, it hasn't really been a problem (again, because I still have central vision and work on computers all day), and most of my employers have been supportive when I've told them.  the only time it's been a problem is socially (like, if someone sticks their hand out for a handshake at work, or tries to give me something, I really can't see it.)
4. haven't learned Braille yet and won't for awhile, again because of the central vision. please don't assume that all blind people have the same amount of sight!
5. hard question to answer, because I'm always focused on what I CAN see, if that makes any sense, not what I can't. I guess if I had to answer, I'd say it's just black, like tunnel vision.

It's changed in a lot of ways that, while each item may seem small, feel much more daunting when combined.  On top of that, there are a lot of people who try to *""help""* but more often than not: 1) make things worse, 2) unintentionally expose you to the chance of further injury/frustration, 3) set you up to be taken advantage of.  Many times, all it takes is one ""incident"" to set someone's independence back by months (possibly years).

&gt;2. If you had an SO when you went blind, how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

My mother was initially supportive, but the truth came out when she was frustrated/low on cigarettes.  ""You were supposed to be the one taking care of me!  Without me, they're gonna walk all over you if you don't stop them.  Grow a spine!""  My dad left when I was young, so he was never a part of it.  I only met him once since the vision loss and he kept himself detached, struggling to not talk about my disability.  My sister's been very supportive but I try my best to not be a burden since she already has two kids and multiple jobs.

&gt;3. If you were employed at work what happened? Was there a shift in the type of work you did? Did you get fired?

The vision loss started while I was in college, so I was referred to the State Department of Labor to rehabilitate my navigational difficulties on-site with a support specialist.  I also trained with multiple common software solutions for computer applications (ZoomText, JAWS, Narrator, later on being familiarized with text-to-speech functionality).  After about a month of ""re-orientation"", most of the work I did on-site was doable.  

&gt;4. Was it hard to learn Braille?

I'm not fluent in it, but my mobility teacher was more focused on learning necessary phrases and signage recognition.  I can't read a page of Braille but my odds of finding the correct bathroom or a fire exit are a lot better than they were at first.  

&gt;5. This is sort of a weird question and is personal, not school related, but what do you see? This always interested me. Is it black? Is there nothing?

There's no concrete diagnosis since it stemmed from a pre-natal developmental injury (umbilical cord around the neck, certain functions didn't develop properly but weren't found until after birth).  The state: 20/800 in one functioning eye, the opposite eye can sometimes perceive light, deuteranopia (a type of color blindness), my field of vision is \~15 degrees (normally 170), distance is &lt;1 meter.  Yet people claim I can't be blind because I can use a modded cellphone...  

What it looks like: imagine holding your hand behind your head.  What does the hand look like?  There's no darkness, there's no weird aura, just the visual equivalent of ""No Data Available"".  You may ""know"" it's there from a combination of object impermanence and secondary sensory input (rustling hairs, the sound of whooshing air, I dunno) but there's no visual identifier for ""hand"".

I hope this helps!",,,3,0,0,

1. I never actually noticed my world change, as my sight disappeared so slowly. I can't remember having a full field of vision, but I know that my field of vision is very reduced. I guess once I found out, it made more sense why I kept missing things on the outside or walking into things. I am however scared of the future and how potentially losing another sense might affect me. 

2. I was single. I will say tho that the time I was being diagnosed and having all the tests was really stressful, and it affected my friendships. My mum went into attack mode almost immediately, trying to find ways around things and getting information out to relevant people (school). My siblings are still the same, maybe just slightly jealous bc I recieve benefits. The rest of my family are all still the same too, if not just a bit more thoughtful of where to put things, and telling me if there's an obstacle that I could fall over (e.g the other week my dad told me he'd left his muddy workboots outside the door so I didn't trip). My dad also adapted our house by painting the steps for me and putting a reflective strip on a door in my house that I always walk into. All in all, my family are very supportive.

3. I didn't have a job at the time, but when I went back to my seasonal summer job this summer, I made them aware of it, and they were okay with it. I didn't particularly need specific adaptations as I can get along fairly well. However I am glad they gave me shorter shifts than other people my age there. It would have killed me to do 8-10 hours 4/5 times a week.

4. I haven't learnt braille yet, I'll explain why in q5.  However I have learnt how to use a white cane.

5. RP is where you lose your peripheral vision very slowly, and it also affects your night vision. For me, I cannot see anything in the dark, so I prefer not to leave the house at night unless I'm with someone or have a very bright torch. In the parts of my vision that I've lost, it isn't black, I just see nothing. There's where I can see, and then if your hand/object goes out of that, it simply doesn't exist. It's nothing. However in my peripherals I still have some light perception, so if someone was to turn a overhead light on, I would perceive that there's a light been turned on. So far only my peripheral vision is affected, so I can actually see perfectly in my central vision with glasses, and even without them I can still see quite well, hence why I haven't started learning braille yet. I think my advisors are planning on starting that soon tho?

Hello,

 

I am a visually impaired individual who utilizes a screen reader, JAWS in conjunction with a Refreshable Braille Display. As I believe another member stated, it sounds like you are reinventing the wheel here, and although you are running into glitches, your idea and creativity is sound. As an accessibility tester, I always tell people to keep the following in mind when creating accessible web content and fillable forms:

Since each screen reader is different, each screen reader has its own set of hotkeys or keyboard shortcuts that assist users with navigating through webpages, documents, and even forms. For this reason, it may be better and will take less time if you have users utilize the screen reader with which they are the most familiar. For screen reader users, familiarity is the key to getting things done efficiently – users having the knowledge that pressing the Tab Key on a QWERTY Keyboard for instance will move them from focusable item to focusable item (links, buttons, drop-down menus, groups of radio buttons, etc.). If you implement a new screen reader into your project, it will take users some time to become familiar with the way the specific screen reader works – the nuances so to speak. Does the screen reader read by character, word, paragraph, line etc.? Does it allow users to navigate from field to field within your form and from link to link on your website? How do users switch between scan, reading, and forms modes? These questions and the answers to them may be the reason the other individual is suggesting that users use the screen reader with which they are the most familiar.On your website, it is great that you are trying to get the screen reader to read the navigation links and information as part of your website. One suggestion I do have is that you can place a “Skip to main content” or a “Skip navigation” link immediately before the main content of your website begins. This saves blind and visually impaired users the step of having to read or listen to each link as it is presented on a webpage. This takes a great deal of time to listen to each link as it is read before getting to the main content on a website. The “Skip navigation” or “Skip to main content” link allows users to activate it, which in turn, should automatically move the focus directly to the beginning of the main content.Your choice to use radio buttons instead of drop-down select menus is a good one. Users can easily navigate to a group of radio buttons and use their Up and Down Arrow Keys to choose the radio button they would like, and select it easily using the Spacebar. In order to use drop-down select menus, you would need to be sure that the correct ARIA structure is used on the top item so it tells users to press the Down Arrow Key to open the menu and then use the Arrow Keys to choose the item they would like to select.When labelling form fields, whenever possible, make sure native HTML markup (e.g., &lt;button&gt;&gt;, &lt;a&gt; for link, &lt;select&gt; for drop-down menus, etc.). Screen readers can read these native elements and interpret them correctly for users. However, if you used a custom JavaScript or Widget to create the labels and fields within your form, you may need to test the tab order or focus order with a screen reader. One popular screen reader that is used by many blind, deafblind, and visually impaired individuals is NVDA. This software is a free screen reader that can be downloaded from the NVAccess.org website.

Yo, late to the party, sorry op.
I'm 24 this month.
I sustained my retinal detachment maybe almost a year ago. I was at a practice for a boffer sport/LARP called dagorhir. Me and a friend were sparing and I caught the brunt of a missed slash with my eye(silly me for not wearing a helmet). I felt what I could remember at a sharp stab and then a full ache that soon faded. I remember feeling like something was swaying past my vision like hair or something but couldn't figure it out.

Later I first started noticing floaters in my left eye that weren't there before(vitreous detachment).

I was living in on my own and money was tight. I just shrugged it off, for like 6 months, until my next eye exam when money was less tight. I had 2 surgeries(a partial buckle and eventually a pneumatic retinaplexi) and some laser. I'm fairly lucky I'd say.  I lost vision in the upper right periphery of my left eye, not a ton, and my right eye picked up the slack. This is partly why I waited so long, I didn't even notice the vision loss until the vitreous detachment progressed a bit more and made the floaters more visible.

It's been a very scary time for me the last few months and I hardly lost much vision, so I can only imagine what it's been like for you.

I know in my case it's also been difficult talking to people about it. I feel like alot of people are very squeemish about eye inju
ries. 
tl;dr I was sparring for nerd sport(dagorhir) practice and took a fist to the eye. Let it go for atleast six months to find out the severity of what actually happened. Had two surgeries. It's been an anxiety filled few months",,,1,0,0,

my portal does not read letter by letter, only page content (words) and phrases that I create - basically combining some small content on the screen to feel more dynamic. Would you say that a spelling option is needed/good? I thought of it on the password field, for example, but it did not feel very good so I removed it...

and yes, the user can navigate using the TAB key or by using voice commands! for example, if they are in the courses tab and I say that the is a course on Programming, if they say they want to go to programming, I'll redirect to it!

as for the skip to main content, I have that implemented in a way, when the user clicks a link in the navbar, the content that changes on the screen is focused, that way, the user does not have to go through the whole navbar to access the content. Would you say that a command to go back to the navbar is useful? (considering that if they say which navbar item they want to go, I'll also click there and redirect)

I'm glad to hear that I made a good choice on the radio button! And I'll definitely use NVDA to see how it handles forms, thanks for the recommendation!

as for my form, it's for the students to fill a resume. Is explaining what it is and the respective fields (instead of just reading the label) useful? And is an instant feedback and clean function of the field good as well? Should I read the whole form after submitting? I'll be testing with the students next week but I would like to have something nice for them already!

Then, paint your nails with nail polish. Once the polish is dry, you should be able to peel the glue off of your fingers, and this will take with it any polish that got on to the skin around your nails - an annoying problem for everyone!

General polish tips: always do two coats, and let the first coat dry for at least a few minutes before you put on the second coat. Single coats are almost always patchy and see through in spots. Also, shake your polish bottle gently before applying. If you shake it vigorously, you might get air bubble in your polish.

ff4f2c57-d470-4bba-9020-d9a847b134de,1571538150,"For context, my case is a bit unusual. I lost ¼ of my visual field from brain surgery as a very young adult, then as a proper adult (who still doesn’t feel like one :-) ) began to have trouble processing visual information. The processing issue became progressively worse but I kept adapting and remained completely independent and able to work. A couple years ago my ability to process visual information quickly and severely declined. Since it was likely due to brain damage caused by constant seizure activity, my docs insisted on more brain surgery, but unfortunately that only made things worse. I now have no vision on one side (both eyes) and on the other side my brain struggles to make sense of the visual input and is completely overwhelmed by it. My response to your questions will refer to my current situation.  

1. It sucks. I am learning but still extremely dependent on others, which has created quite the identity crisis. I can’t do any of my favorite activities because they are very visually intensive and involve heights. I’m forced to sit in the dark listening to podcasts most of the time, which has become very boring. At moments when I have the energy I take full advantage and try to learn and practice techniques that will give me some independence. The things that I am able to do by myself take 10 times as long as they used to and are exhausting. Even the simplest things require concentration. 

2. My SO has been with me through the rapid decline and the most recent surgery and has been unbelievably generous with his time and effort taking care of me. I am gradually adjusting to the idea that I really do NEED help and to some degree always will.  

3. My job refused to make suitable accommodations that would enable me to continue to work, and they forced me into an indefinite unpaid disability leave. I never heard from them again and eventually resigned when my surgery was planned. So yes I was fired, but in such a way that they could avoid a serious lawsuit. It was especially nasty since I had relocated from another country 8000 miles away to take the job. Now post-surgery I am trying to learn skills that will allow me to work again, though it is unlikely I’ll be able to do the same type of work...

4. I’ve had all kinds of rehab and vocational training with agencies for the blind in both the SF Bay Area and NYC, and no one has ever suggested that I learn Braille (even though I can’t read, aside from a few words with great strain). Everything is focused on tech instead these days.  

5. The commenter who described it as what it looks like behind you did an excellent job! That’s always how I described my field cut. However, since my most recent surgery I also see little sparkles where my central field should be. It’s like the vision equivalent of a phantom limb, and it’s extremely intrusive and hard to ignore.",,,2,0,0,

0d6af7e6-a20a-4e20-8aa6-a7f360dc1d21,1572258423,"hi there! I am one of those, who can type with Dirrect touch typing pretty well. I got used to it pretty quickly. What I did was learned where the keys are on screen and size in between those. I knew computer keyboard very well at the time I first used IOS. That was usefull, because I already knew which keys were next to which. Then that just goes to touch screen with certain differences, such as there's no tab key or caps lock, which means that q and a are moved to the most left side of the screen. g h, t y and bn are always in the center, positioned vertically, like on normal qwerty keyboards. One difference is that p and l are on the most right side of the screen. Next thing is to remember the size between those letters. Later on, you'll get really used to it and your accuracy will be improved. If you do 90% of the time, that's considered to be good, because sighted people are also making mistakes while they tipe as well, so it's not a big deal if you make mistakes. The only thing is, you need to have voiceover set to tell you the keys you type, so you can catch the mistakes. If you get to point where you have 100% accuracy, you can disable that as well. Besides what I've found is that on bigger screens the size of the keys are bigger, which means, that if you change the phone and it has a bigger screen, you'll have to readjust. But readjustment process is easy after you've got direct touch typing once.

Security note!

If you're in groups of blind people or have voiceover on slow speed at which the average person can easily understand it, want to enter password, don't have disabled speak typed letters and don't have/ware headphones, use breile screen input!

I can imagine how that would be difficult, especially if you haven't had time to adjust.
Especially if you recently became visually impaired. If you don't mind me asking, how did it happen? And also, are you fully blind? You don't need to answer these if you don't want to.

I also am very interested in technology and wanted to start a YouTube for it as well but since I used to be mute and have a lot of social anxiety too, it was hard to speak and I didn't have anyone that would help me or look at my videos haha.

On a side note I have seen a completely blind YouTuber before, a girl that turned blind. She does have family or a friend that helps her with the harder things and a dog.

There's a lot of technology that has been made, is being made and could be made for blind people. I hope they would help make life easier. 

What type of technology were you or are you interested in?

* There is a severe shortage of braille teachers which is only going to get worse. I know there is a growing amount of tools to teach braille but there still may be room for more. Consider that the learner needs to have a refreshable braille display for this to work and they are generally quite expensive, though there are some cheaper ones out there now.

* Seconded the thoughts on children not getting basic skills like tying their shoes. Parents can teach, but I wonder if there is a fun set of YouTube videos for kids that parents could watch with their kids that teach concepts like this in an accessible manner with audio descriptions, etc.

In regards to your best friend, they probably found out a lot of information about your disability indirectly through spending time with you which eliminates the need to ask direct questions about them. This should be the same for your exes. 

It’s different for a dating event. I feel that asking questions directly about your disability is appropriate in this situation. The purpose of these events are to find someone to go on future dates with and maybe even start a serious relationship. If I were a sighted person who came across a visually impaired person at a dating event, (I’m legally blind btw)  I would want to ask direct questions about that visually impaired person’s disability so I could figure out how that would impact a potential future relationship. Asking questions also helps appropriately respect and accommodate this visually impaired person on any future ventures we have together.

My best advice is to have your instructor spend a little one-on-one time with you before or after class do to a blind mirror mold. Mirror molding is usually done by looking in the mirror to make sure you are in the right position, and then repeating the move until you have muscle memory. Since you can't do this, I recommend the instructor put you into the ideal position for a technique, such as knife hand guarding block for example. You will need to hold it still for a long time, either from an L-stand or Junbi, and then attempt to execute the exact same block again without moving anywhere including intermediate hand positions. The instructor could then reposition you back into the correct position. After a number of times, you will start to build the muscle memory by feeling rather than by sight. Just an idea.

I lost lost my left eye to a detached retina, normally a quick fix but the only medical coverage I had at the time was the VA, they put me on a 6month wait list and by the time I got scene it was so far gone they refused to operate.
That was almost 9 years ago.

About 4 years ago I started having issues with my right eye, they found that I had glaucoma in that eye and the pressure was extremely high. By the time they got it under control I had lost roughly 80% field of vision. 

Back in May of this year, They found cataracts in both eyes, but due to some complications from previous surgery’s they have been hesitant to operate.

The bad luck of it all is the first two types of vision loss were neither genetic or from any sort of trauma. They just randomly happened and each one is exclusively in its respected eye. They don’t know why,.

As for the touchscreen stove, the closest I have come to that experience is at a former friends house. The landlord renovated all the apartments and installed new stoves with glass cooking services and touch controls. I pointed out to my former friend that this would be an issue if I was staying over at their place, and they were not available to assist me. Well, since they are now a former friend, this is no longer an issue. I hate when sighted people automatically assume that blind people have an easy time of picking up new information as quickly as a sighted person does. We know this is not the case, at least not always. One lesson I have learned from imperfect interactions with sighted people is this, record everything! A simple audio recording goes a long way to straighten out a misunderstanding, especially when it involves crude sexist remarks like the one directed toward you regarding your wife.",,,3,0,0,

**KEY POINTS**

 The Supreme Court denied a petition from pizza giant Domino’s on Monday to hear whether its website is required to be accessible to the disabled, leaving in place a lower court decision against the company.

The case was originally brought by a blind man named Guillermo Robles, who sued the pizza chain after he was unable to order food on Domino’s website and mobile app despite using screen-reading software.

The decision not to grant the case is a loss for the company and a win for disability advocates, who have argued that, if businesses do not have to maintain accessible sites, disabled people could be effectively shut out of substantial portions of the economy. 

* The Supreme Court denied a petition from pizza giant Domino’s on Monday to hear whether its website is required to be accessible to the disabled,      leaving in place a lower court decision against the company.

* The case was originally brought by a blind man named Guillermo Robles, who sued the pizza chain after he was unable to order food on Domino’s website and mobile app despite using screen-reading software.
* The decision from the justices was announced in an [order](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100719zor_m648.pdf).

* Attorneys for Robles argued in court papers that the Americans with Disabilities Act requires businesses with physical locations to make their websites and other online platforms accessible to those with disabilities.
* A      panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Robles, writing      that the “alleged inaccessibility of Domino’s website and app impedes      access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchises—which      are places of public accommodation.”
* Domino’s urged the Supreme Court to review the decision. By declining to do so, the court’s decision on Monday will leave the ruling in place, meaning      Domino’s will have to fight Robles’s accessibility claims in court.
* Attorneys for Domino’s, backed by a range of business groups, had argued that the      ADA does not apply to online platforms that were not envisioned when the law was passed in 1990. And, they said, no clear rules exist for how to make their platforms properly accessible.
* The lawsuit is one of an increasing number filed over website accessibility in recent years. Last year, more than 2,200 such suits were filed in federal courts, according to the accessible technology firm [UsableNet](https://blog.usablenet.com/2018-ada-web-accessibility-lawsuit-recap-report), nearly tripling the number a      year before.
* The case is known as Domino’s Pizza v. Guillermo Robles, No. 18-1539.",,,4,0,0,

18ba6916-e94c-4535-b6c4-8be0e5497045,1571031425,"Hi. And thanks for your concerns. I will explain the reasons.

1- We are not asking to work for free. We are asking about ideas. An idea needs to be implemented and that takes a lot of effort.

2- You are not forced to participate. But many people sent us emails offering their help and this competition is a way to reach for fellows. Some people just like to co-operate.  We ask for help and they respond positively. That is one of the good things of this community. With the help of those friends we can continue doing audiogames. With the negativity of others, we might turn other direction and never be back.

3- Do you think we will get millionaire doing AudioGames? I'm struggling to pay the salaries of the people we have now, and two weeks ago I could not pay the small room I rent for them. I will never get the investment back, even though we are trying so hard. I'm not going to tell here how much it has cost to do the game and how much we got from sells. But relationship is now 1/10. So we still have a way to go.

4- In AudioWizards all the music was composed by blind musicians from all around the world. They got paid with 150 €. They got their money before the game was launch. I haven't seen no money yet and I have work selflessly for weeks.

5- I can't afford to contract you if you are not a programmer living in Finland. Experience on C# required. We have open two times a working application for a blind programmer in Finland. Nobody applied.  

6- I'm working full time in University as teacher and researcher, and I don't do this for the money. This company, myTrueSound, is let's say my hobby, where I spend my money and my time in doing something I think it needs to be done. I believe in accessibility and the universal right for everybody to play nice games and have fun time. Is anyone against that?

7- The game is being translated to Spanish now by blind fellows. They get paid for their work. We are looking for a voice actor, also from the blind community, who will get paid with 300 €. More than that we can't offer at this moment, because my bank account is empty. Should I stop because people think is unfair I look for help. No, absolutely not, at least not yet.  

I wish we could drink a cup of tea together and chat friendly about this things. Criticism is okei, but do it carefully and once you know all the facts. That is the fair thing. 

Best regards and have a nice week",,,1,0,0,

A good place to do some research is the F***Combustion forum. I don't think I can post the link but it's pretty easy to find. Convection vs conduction vs hybrid heating, time it takes to hit temperature, bowl size, battery life vs charge time or replacement, USB C, Micro USB or custom chargers etc.  are all things to consider. It can get pretty intense. There are also vapes that you can attach to an ECig type mod, but that does tend to get a little complicated and requires caution, though there are a few complete configured kits around.

This is my first post but I wanted to reply to you because what you wrote really strikes a chord with me. My partner posts here and told me about your post. Her name on here is Sadie Ragbaby. I have 20/80 vision in both eyes and am completely blind in dim light (nyctalopia). I was also born 3 months early, as was my partner. It's one of many weird coincidences we share. I totally know what you mean about not being able to read signs and find your way places on your own. Between my vision and agnosia (lack of ability to recognise things due to brain injury) I find getting around and doing simple things like grocery shopping or even getting to the shop in the first place gives me really bad anxiety. I also suffer from major depression. I try to keep a brave face and not complain because Sadie's vision is a lot worse than mine and I should be more grateful for what I have. She only has light perception and life is very difficult for her. It's not easy always being brave though.

I use the magnifier and zoom on my phone and computer too. What phone do you have and are you a Mac or PC person? Apple have really great accessibility features in my opinion. I used to jokingly laugh at Sadie for using an iphone but now she laughs at me because I have more Apple devices than her :P

Last Tuesday I had an appointment with a mobility instructor from Vision Australia and we went to the supermarket to try a monocular for reading the signs in the shop. I could read them if I found them in the first place but trying to find the signs with it made me feel seasick. Usually I use apps on my phone like Seeing AI for signs and text and Blindsquare for getting around outside. Blindsquare speaks what intersections I'm approaching and what businesses are around how far away my destination is in what direction etc.

It's amazing how many things people just don't even think about in daily life that are very hard for those of us with disabilities. Even movies suck for me because with vision impairment and agnosia I don't recognise the characters unless they have very distinctive features like a hair colour that stands out and have to keep asking whoever I'm with who's this who's that. It gets annoying for people so nobody wants to do things with me other than Sadie who understands.

It gets embarrassing too. On Monday I walked from the kitchen to the lounge with a bowl of porridge (oatmeal) and cherries. I didn't gage where the table was correctly and ended up dropping it upside down all over the carpet in front of my home care worker. I do stuff like that all the time and I hate it.

I don't work. I'm in a wheelchair most of the time because of a car accident and I have to wear a machine to breathe because of severe respiratory issues. Being in a wheelchair with a cane is challenging.

I'm on social security for disability too. I don't have any great suggestions for you to make life meaningful as most of the time I wonder the same thing. I have hobbies like playing and composing music and I am trying to learn to draw but depression and anxiety make it hard to get into anything. I have a magnifying lamp which is great for stuff like craft and drawing but it's not portable so I can't use it in the lounge where I spend most of my time. Sadie and I are going to look at the Vision Australia store to see if there are any decent portable ones.

Anyway sorry for the essay. I just wanted to write to you because all of what you said is so familiar to me. If you ever want to chat you are welcome to message me. Same goes for my partner. We both don't have anyone other than each other who gets what it's like.",,,2,0,0,

For beginners it's a bit tricky to get used to it and don't get things out of the plate. Finger food is also the best and I also liked an idea about the messy food stuff. In that way you can tell to him that everyone looks like hat now and not only you, and that's the normal thing. kalmaries shouldd be good as well, french fries, pizza, sandwitches, Hotdogs, nuggets, sausages and similar. Half opened doors are the hell! Besides, if you change something in your environment, inform him about the change as soon as possible, so he can react on it adequately. Also, please keep in mind, that when talking to him, first call him and then tell whatever you want so he knows that someone is talking to him. That is necessary unless the context implies otherwise, for instance if he asked a question and someone answers that question. In that case he most probably will catch up just fine. If some important things happen, briefly describe what happend. For instance I had a situation, when person came up and he did some strange action, that everyone around the table started laughing. Now, since I'm the blind from mu childhood, I could quickly sense that it was related to that person's movement so I could ask correct questions to get correct answers. Now, in your case, just describe that action and he should quickly catch up on the same page as other members.

Given those prices, multi-line displays have to make compromises.

The Bristol Braille Canute is probably the closest thing to a multi-line display that actually works, is actually for sale, and really has multiple lines. Maybe that's the one you saw, it's 9 lines of 40 cells, with 6 dots per cell. Do you realize just how ridiculously large that is, though? 9 lines of braille makes for a pretty large device already. If you wanted 25 lines it literally wouldn't fit on your desk.

Anyway, the main tradeoff the Canute besides 6 dots is that it's slow to refresh. You can't use it for real-time text editing really, it's good for reading books. The price is good for how many cells you get though, under $2000.

DOT Inc is working on a tablet, I saw a demo at CSUN. Definitely not finished and not ready to buy, and it's not clear what sort of software it will have.

The Graphiti is interesting, it's a 2-D grid of dots that can be used to make shapes and images. Pretty cool and comes with some nice software, but the dots aren't small enough to make actual braille.

There are some best practices around a visual description, which can serve as a good starting point. Discussing a photographs contents really depends on the photo itself. Different visitation patterns, like clockwise or quadrant-based or linear, can be used to help the person who can’t see the photo to build a mental model in which you can fill in all of the details you are speaking about. I’ve done a considerable amount of work in the space, and we regularly hold visual description workshops for people in the culture sector, especially museums. Happy to share specific tips and resources. Does your project allow for tactile reproductions? When coupled with guided tactile descriptions and visual descriptions, they can be a wonderful multi modal way of conveying visual information. This is the approach we took with the Andy Warhol Museum and the Canadian Museum For Human Rights, the latter of which actually has had multiple exhibits, traveling ones, consisting of lots of photographs. We’ve also found that making sure the description is able to be accessed both as a recording as well as programmatically, helps a whole lot. Someone like myself who prefers very rapid speech can easily read a 350 word description in 15 to 20 seconds, but someone else may prefer to listen to that 350 word description over the course of two minutes as a pleasant voice Recording. At the end of the day, this is about returning agency to the visitor, and there are some inexpensive ways of doing that as well as higher quality ways if you’ve got some budget for things like reproductions. Art Beyond Sight has some guidelines that we like to start with Wynn showing people how to do visual descriptions. There is good advice in those like how to use metaphor appropriately when discussing differences in colors.

I always thought the grey ones were best for me because they seem to block the most light, but it turns out that I do better with the brown ones as they are better at filtering out light scatter.



If you don't need prescription glasses, you don't need anything expensive, so you could get a few cheap pairs and see what works for you.  If you do need prescription, it's a bit more involved.  You can get surrounds that go on over your glasses and wrap around the sides to block light from all angles or prescription sports goggles.  I get a brand called Clips that are prescription lenses that come with a clip on sunglasses.  I find that this is less expensive than purchasing a separate pair of prescription sunglasses.

I agree the part where people hear you explain your problems and then they seemingly seem to forget them the next second is the worst. I'm not blind but I do stick out, got several disorders as they are called.

I am thinking, perhaps we need more education around this. Classes in school, Emotional Intelligence is one thing I am pondering. EQ. It would help people understand others more and perhaps if they imagined themself in your shoes they would remember that you will be ""looking"" at their ear without them looking over their shoulder.

Stress fucking sucks. We all have it but you who are visually impaired must have it even more, I am trying, but I can't imagine how it is like properly.

I'm sorry that you have had such negative experiences with people.. I'm sure most of them don't mean any harm but they just don't have the same awareness. This notion has relieved some of my social anxiety coupled with other strategies. Also knowing that you are not alone. Even sighted people experience shitty social anxiety too.

Haha yes, wanting to hide in the shadows, preferably in my room but somehow always sticking out, in the spotlight.

I hope you can receive help with this stress that seems to be taking up much of your life. There are people, including me, who want to spread more awareness and stuff.. so life will be easier for us all. Hey, you are one of them too.

i can certainly relate to the whole independence issue— i was so accustomed to living with my family that when i moved to a huge city like LA for uni, it was terrifying, and i won’t lie, really depressing for a while. i didn’t know how to handle public transport on my own (i wasn’t born with my disability, happened when i was 14 or so), had to use my cane seriously rather than be sighted guided by a loved one— it was tough. it was also tough to find clubs, organizations, etc on campus becuase no one really knew the protocol for providing info to a blind student with a cane, even though handing the flyer to me is just fine. i was in LA, surrounded by things to do and people bustling in the city, but you also just feel so isolated. It wasn’t easy, and i’m still trying to fully establish my routine, but i have some close friends and activities that i ended up finding and really being passionate about. just takes time, you know. 

as for ssi, i do get it, but most of the checks go into saving for my housing payments, as i stay at the dorms if my uni. i don’t work, as i’m mainly focusing on studies, so the checks are all i got. thankfully fafsa covers everything else besides housing. personally, i do plan to work— not to evoke any overdone ref’s, but i have always wanted to be a lawyer and that ambition didn’t go with my vision. but for now i’m still in the ‘humble beginnings’ portion of my eventual wikipedia page, lmao.

Even after figuring that out (with help from a sighted person), if it’s running Android underneath, it probably isn’t very usable. The simpler UI the better in terms of accessibility design, especially at a kiosk that will be a new or rare experience for the blind user. (Most of) the cabs in NYC have a great super simple accessibility mode if you know how to initiate it. The visual appearance of the UI is actually completely different in that mode. 

P.S. I know the world doesn’t revolve around NYC but I am just one person with one set of experiences. :-) 

Generally speaking, I would find it really useful if  when the user first interacts with the kiosk (e.g. touches the screen or even just walks up to it), there is an audible announcement about how to switch to accessibility mode.

The way I learned direct touch typing was with a lot of preparation.

If I mistyped a letter in a word, I deleted the whole word and started over. It was hellishly frustrating, but I could almost immediately type with direct touch and not make any errors that autocorrect wouldn't fix. After a while, touch typing just felt slow and restrictive. I did have a Speed Dots protector on my phone for about six months, so that might have also helped me learn the positions of the keys a bit better. As far as I know, you can still get one.

General advice for all prospective dog owners:

1. Make sure everyone in the household is fully on board with the whole thing, and understands the responsibilities.

2. Make sure your living situation and income is stable. A dog is a 10-15+ year commitment. Can you provide a safe and appropriate home for them? Can you cover any and all vet bills?

3. Educate yourself about different breeds and different temperaments. Remember that breed isn't always the deciding factor in temperament.

4. Think about training, grooming and exercise requirements. How much hair can you tolerate? What about barking or drooling?

5. How experienced is the primary carer? How good are they at training?

6. Looks should not be the deciding factor in which breed you choose for any reason ever. That path holds only misery for you and the poor pet you've chosen.

7. When it comes time, make sure to obtain your new family member ethically. A shelter dog isn't the best idea if you're inexperienced, so go for a registered breeder. Yes, you'll pay more than a backyard breeder, but you're paying for healthier breeding practices and a happier pup. A breeder should be registered with your state/province breed club and be able to show you the parents and living conditions at their operation. They should also screen every breeding dog for health conditions common in the breed, such as hip/elbow dysplasia.

8. Prepare your home before bringing the pup back and introduce them to a single room so as not to overwhelm them. Decide right away what is and isn't acceptable behaviour and enforce that consistently. Can your pup be on the couch? If you don't want them doing something as an adult, don't let them do it as a puppy.

9. Get yourself a puppy training guide or attend lessons, even if you're confident. It's good socialising for pup. Aim for positive reinforcement training with no yelling, hitting, yanking of collar/lead, etc. Also shock, choke and prong collars are cruel and ineffective over the long term.

10. Just like a child, get into a steady routine with your pup. They want structure and predictability. They want boundaries and to be the bestest Boi. A well mannered dog is a happy dog because you know you can take him fun places because you know he'll behave.

Advice specific to dogs in VI/blind households: from my own experience I've never had any issues. Smaller dogs may pose a safety risk if they get underfoot but you can train them to stay out of your way when it matters. 'Go to bed' is an all-around amazing command to have up your sleeve.

As for breeds, if you can put in the necessary exercise to keep them happy, Labradors are always a favourite. They need early bite inhibition and socialisation but are very easy to train, easy to groom and generally have a sweet nature.

If exercise is a concern and size isn't, you might consider a Mastiff. They're big goofy couch potatoes who love to snuggle and stand on your feet. They do tend to break the bank with feeding costs but can live just about anywhere.

Certain breeds of spaniels are good companions. They need exercise but won't exhaust you. They can be difficult to train and may have strong prey drive. They tend to be single-minded when they get an idea.

If smaller dogs are your style a Bichon is a good pick, they're one of the calmer toy dogs and quite easy to care for. They do bark a lot though.

If everyone gets involved with and remains consistent with training, most dogs will make a great pet.",,,5,0,0,

I think a lot of us can relate to the feelings you're expressing here. We fight so hard just to do half as well as any sighted person and no one else really knows how much of a toll that takes on us. It can be frustrating to see others execute something with perfect ease while we struggle.

But I think that's sort of the point, really. Life is all about struggle, and everyone struggles with something whether we see it or not. Comparing yourself to others by any metric is an exercise in futility; either you come off better and have an undeserved sense of ego, or you come off worse and feel shitty about yourself.

The trick is to compare yourself to yourself, and not others. What have you done that you're proud of? What can you do now that you couldn't before? How have you improved?

And I'm not just talking about O&amp;M and life skills, how have you become a better person? What valuable life lessons have you learned and applied to yourself?

These are the metrics by which you can judge yourself.

Also, what resources are there for you in your area? Do you have a disability service provider that you could do some O&amp;M training with? It sounds like maybe you could use a bit of a confidence boost, and they're pretty good at giving you the skills to feel safe and secure getting out and about.

They might also be able to help you with employment, or studying for a career path. Blind/VI people are having more and more success finding work, especially in tech-based industries where the playing field evens up a little. Larger companies are generally more willing to hire, and might even have diversity policies.

I know how rough it can get sometimes. But you can either be a victim of circumstance, or you can become an agent of positive change in your own life. You can take back control, explore, expand, and overcome. It's scary, but it's worth it.

Good luck!",,,14,0,0,

First, if you enable BSI (braille screen input) and leave it, it will stay where it is in your rotor. That could mean a lot of rotor twists to find it.

Some people love this, others find it annoying. Again, it will only move to always be one turn away if you put it at the very top of your rotor options.

As to locking, you do this with a three-finger swipe down. Get to the orientation you like, and perform that gesture to always have BSI stay in that orientation.

Firstly, in the US, you should expect that the college to do an assessment of you to agree with you what is required to make to allow you to study.  The process can be tortuous and at my college I lead a process where we interview all the new intake before they start if they have said they are disabled, but that wont help right now. 

Before you have any meeting please write a list of the adjustments you need and show that you have considered everything you think puts you at a disadvantage.  Then show how the adjustments can be made in each of your classes.

Simple things like providing everything in a printed or text only format before the class is reasonable.  It depends on your area of study.  I teach English and on the whole its easy, the only problem area is when we use video clips which I have to source as audio described. 

Maths is much harder to provide for as the software needed to interpret very complex formulas is much harder to accommodate especially if you are working things out on a whiteboard in front of the class.  It’s is possible be requires an assistant to code the formulas contemporaneously for the student to read.  In general the humanities are easier, anything medical is almost impossible, and sciences are ok if you have accommodating tutors. 

The main issue for my students is professors not preparing early enough.

So listening to them, and allowing them to have a say is very important. Not punishing them is also a very good idea. I didn’t want to wear glasses, so instead of consoling me, my parents took my toys, and my teachers yelled at me until I did. To this day, I have a very hard time communicating with people about my disability, because I’m terrified they’ll punish me for it. I would also suggest introducing them to role models who are visually impaired as well. I’m sure there are children’s books out there on this subject, and I think I would have benefitted a lot from this. It took me a long time to figure out that it wasn’t just me. Being honest is another tip. This is more for parents, but I think teachers/employers/mentors could do this as well. Evolve them in planning and accommodating for their disability. Work with them, not above the,. Of course, this would probably by more appropriate for older children, but it is still important. 

You might think this has a lot to do with the learning process, but school is pretty much the entire life of a child. School is where everything happens for them, and it’s a very important place. Enfolding them with their opinions and their wants, gives them the knowledge that they actually DO have a choice. This will give those kids so much confidence, and will teach them how to advocate for themselves when they need it. Confidence is a very important part of being independent. They can have the skills, but they need to know they can USE the skills. 

Being independent isn’t just about tools and technology. Building the motivation, and the belief that they CAN be independent is just as important. 

This is a very good question to be asking, because I really do believe a lot of teachers and parents have no idea what they’re doing. How you treat a child with a disability impacts them for the rest of their life, so it’s great that someone is trying to make a difference for the better.",,,2,0,0,

Often when people write alt text they have a hyperfocus on objects and their spatial relationships. Your example with the broom is pretty representative of this. What's better is to go up one level of abstraction and think more about the purpose of why you're sharing or exhibiting the photograph.

Less useful: A photo of a smiling older woman wearing a pointy hat sitting at a table. There are candles on the cake, which are lit. There is a cat sitting on a windowsill in the background.
More useful: My grandmother's birthday party. She's about to blow out the cake, and we're all smiling.

If there is a person in a blue dress in your photo, you don't need to say the dress is blue unless it's salient to why you're sharing the photo or unless you anticipate a specific use case for the photo that requires that information.

If you want blind people to be able to participate in your exhibit—appreciated—I'd recommend going the narrative text route that you laid out. Articulate the meaning, purpose, and importance of what you see, rather than the minutiae. I wouldn't write reams of text—a picture might be worth a thousand words, but a blind person isn't going to read a thousand wrds for every photo. Fundamentally, a photo is a sighted medium, so there's some extent to which you'll be leaving blind people out by the exhibit. That's largely OK, your responsibility (moral if not legal) is to provide reasonable accommodations, and that mean the experience isn't 100% translated into an accessible format.

For example, Charles Bonnet syndrome (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_release_hallucinations). Depending on which studies, the statistics for that can range from 10% to 40% (the most recent one I know about from 2016 suggested it was 20% https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26874151 ). 

One big issue is that people don't like to talk about it, because they don't want others to think they are crazy, so they hide it. Other times, the client may not realize something is an issue (mild cognitive impairment or dementia or memory loss), which may not be immediately noticeable but problematic later. For example, I taught someone how to cross the street using an APS (Audible Pedestrian signal), and explained how it worked and what the signals meant. The next time I met with someone, they attempted to cross when the signal had traffic in front of them going, and I had to intercede. When asked why she did that, she said that is when I told her to cross (when I didn't). She definitely had memory problems, but she didn't realize it.

I want to be clear, I am not saying it is impossible to teach O&amp;M without formal training. But formal training does give you the tools and techniques that have worked, as well as variations for when other issues come about. It is the same idea as providing CPR. Doing something is often better than doing nothing, but getting training on the proper way to do CPR may be better. 

It may also depend on the nature of your clients. The majority of my clients are elderly (probably 95%), where other issues are common.

The social model was originally created in the 60s by men in wheelchairs, when the system was literally stacked against them and people didn't want ramps and such. But times have changed. And while the theory may (or may not) be accurate, it does very little for someone who, after living with vision for 60 years, suddenly loses it. Even if everything was designed to be accessible, they still need to process the loss and get rehabilitation. 

Personally, while I think theory is useful, it's dealing with the immediate issues the client has. A client probably doesn't care they can't access the elevator when they are literally peeing on the floor because they can't find the bathroom (I've had two clients do that before, unfortunately).

Regarding ""for the blind"", is there an organization that is ""of the blind""? We have those in Canada, but I'm not familiar with the organizations in Britain so it is a bit hard coming up with searches. 

The closest one I found was something called National Federation of the Blind of the UK (https://www.nfbuk.org/). Another option as well is the Royal Society for Blind Children (https://www.rsbc.org.uk/) and ask to speak to a worker to find out what services are available when they are out of the children's system.

Another possibility is the British Blind Sports (https://britishblindsport.org.uk/). You may just have to talk to some people to find where they access services.",,,1,0,0,

I wouldn't be surprised about the policy. Organizations are often pushing for the social model of disability (that society has barriers and society should eliminate those barriers). Which is all fine and good, but that doesn't help when someone first loses their vision and needs go go through the five stages of grief and get rehabilitation training.

Have you checked with the Royal National College for the Blind?(https://www.rnc.ac.uk/) I vaguely know they do some rehabilitation training, but that may be with just their students. However, you can ask them to find what other rehabilitation services are available.

I believe there have been a few people who are totally blind that have become certified Orientation and Mobility Specialists. The process for certification (in North America at least) is through Academy for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation &amp; Education Professionals  (https://www.acvrep.org/).

There are two other techniques. One is putting the nail polish in the refrigerator. That way, when applying it, you can feel where it is going from the colder temperature.

Another technique to help keep it a bit cleaner is getting some Vaseline and putting in on the skin around the nail (but not on the nail itself). That way, any nail polish that would get onto your skin gets onto the Vaseline, and you can wipe it off afterwards. In practice, the edges aren't quite as clean with that one, though.",,,2,0,0,

We moved into a newly built house on an estate where the kitchens all had induction hobs with touch controls. The oven had rotary dials with very limited feedback as to their position.

Induction hobs are good because they are more energy efficient than other electric hobs. The problem is that they almost universally come with touch controls with only visual affordances (things that help you use it) and visual feedback (things that tell you what effect you have had.)

Before we moved in to our new house we were able to arrange to have a different model of induction stove top installed which featured rotary controls with very good tactile feedback.

The rotary control knobs are shaped so the direction they point in is very obvious from the feel of them. The controls have a resistance and ""notch"" that you feel when turning a hob element on. To turn a hob on you have to push against the resistance and cross the notch after which the resistance drops suddenly which means the hob is switched on. The stove beeps when the first hob is switched on. The rotation of the knob is proportional to the power output of the hob, 90 degrees is about 33% power, 180 degrees is about 66% power. 

Turning the controls as far as they turn to push against another spring resistance gives another beep and activates a boost feature to rapidly bring a pan to the boil. 

Turn the controls anticlockwise from the off position until the stove beeps and red indicator flashes, this activates another feature of the stove which runs the element at high power until the pan gets hot at which point the element turns down to the heat setting you selected.

The controls are also positioned across the front of the stove (not the side as is common) so you don't have to reach across the hot parts of the stove to access the controls.

The stove has, just above the control knobs, bright red illuminated (LED) digits in a 2 x 2 grid mimicking the layout of the hobs. They turn on to indicate the power setting of each hob or if the are still hot. They will also flash if there is no pan on the associated hob element. They are big enough and bright enough to be helpful to a cook with at least some sight. 

I've gone into all this detail so that you may better understand what you can expect to get from a well designed stove top that also happens to be accessible without relying on perfect vision.

I've checked the USA website of the maker of this stove top and they don't have the same range, including our stove, as available in the UK.",,,2,0,0,

It is useful to think that a lot of problems disabled people have is because everyone else take the easy route of making things work best for themselves, the able bodied people. It can take just a few reasonable adjustments to make things work better for disable people.

A simple example of this would be to install ramps and lifts in buildings so people in wheelchairs can get in and out and around them. For blind people the adjustments might be to put braille information around a building or use big high contrast signs that can be read by people with some sight.

Modern technology has made a big difference for blind people. Software called screen readers will speak out loud the words and controls on a computer screen. This sometimes allows blind people to do the same jobs as sighted people. Applications on mobile phones can help you navigate your way around outside. They can also help you read text or even describe what the camera can see. 

Getting a job is important for blind people as it is for everyone else because the money you earn lets you care for your family and any left over lets you have fun. Some blind people with jobs have a sighted assistant who helps them when technology can't. The assistant might help guide the blind person to meetings and tell them who is in the room. In this case the blind person might be a senior manager or other well paid worker.

Blind people also have hobbies and social lives. They might be musicians in a band, or sportsmen or sports-women, or chess players, or in quiz teams.",,,3,0,0,

9d9314ec-be0b-49a0-a37d-1b124bc6c581,1571063168,"It really is a complex question, but here is an in depth comparison that might help you.

&amp;#x200B;

JAWS has great context sensitive help and built in training materials in both text and audio, plus an impressive amount of additional in depth training available online at various prices, and all settings have a blurb that usually does a decent job at explaining what each thing does.  It also comes with allot of extra features, better OCR for reading inaccessible documents or programs, text analyzing tools for proof reading, significantly better support for business apps like microsoft office or turbo tax, a deal with the sighted assistants app Aira for up to half our long calls, code to turn ribbon menus into a more user friendly format automatically, much more customizable number reading,  a powerful bookmarking feature for websites, a bunch of high quality voices that you can download for free, ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it also has allot of unintuitive or unnecessary keystrokes, some deprecated tools that are still just kinda, hanging around for no good reason or don't work well but are referenced in the documentation, and doesn't come with it's settings very well optimized by default.  Since even with the blurbs and filtering ability, the settings center is still a sprawling behemoth, most users won't even know what they are missing until they get familiar with it, and therefore suffer needlessly.

Importantly, it's very expensive and needs to have additional (also expensive) paid upgrades over time if one wishes to stay current, and can only be paid for annually within the USA.  Lately updates have not at all been worth the subscription costs for the majority of users either, but skipping them means you'll end up paying allot more later on when useful features actually get added and you want to upgrade, do to the very unforgiving update pricing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, NVDA is completely free and mainly donation supported, and comes with some pretty great documentation built in.  It's controls are generally allot easier to remember for most, and it doesn't have nearly as many extra features to get confused by, which is obviously both good and bad.  It also tends to have less lag, and crashes less often for most people.

The community is able to create addons for NVDA, to extend it's functionality and help it stay relevant with useful features, some of which have even been rolled in to the main product in the past.  and though they may very in quality or update support, they are almost exclusively free, and since far more people know how to code them than how to script for JAWS, it would be allot cheaper and probably faster to get one written for an inaccessible program at work.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, they are also less secure which means that companies will be dubious of allowing them on their network, but that will hopefully not be a big issue for much longer as NV Access is working on it as we speak.

It also doesn't have quite as good braille support as JAWS, though it's definitely still plenty usable.  And you'll need to buy extra voices unless you don't mind the ones built in to your system, since most people can't stand the default speech synthesizer.  Also, it tends to read out emoji and other special symbols better, gets far more frequent updates, and the settings are allot easier to deal with for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would say that if you want room to grow in higher education or the workplace, get JAWS and maybe the Leasy scripts from Hartgen.org but if you just want to get up and running with a screen reader, I'd use NVDA and grab the training book on the NV Access website plus install the control usage assistant addon.  Another option is narrator, which is a pretty good screen reader built right into Windows 10, and if your familiar with the Mac, than Voice Over is another very good option which is built right in and has tons of context sensitive help, the best emoji support in the business, and free high quality voices, but doesn't get updated enough and is starting to have problems on newer Mac OS versions.",,,5,0,0,

&amp;#x200B;

I've used graphite Ambutech folding canes with roller marshmellow tips for most of my life, with the occasional pencil or non rolling marshmellow or aluminum cane thrown in.  I even had a super heavy steel one once, and I've used those big rolling ball tips a time or two as well.

But personally, even with the drawbacks, I just really feel as though I can get better feedback and walking speed out of those NFB 50/50 carbon fiber and fiberglass canes with the metal tips and foam handles, at least with the open palm technique.

Yeah, the tips wear out pretty quick (a couple months?) if you walk almost every day in the city, less quickly if you use two point touch or slide tap rather that constant contact, and yes, they are bendy but it actually takes a surprising amount of force to break them (particularly the non folding ones) and I still don't know how I feel about the handles, but the lightness and lack of pain when I hit people with open toed shoes alone is a big plus.  It's just so freeing.

An alternative to this may be the telescoping Ambutech canes, since they are thinner and lighter still, but I think you can still use most ambutech tips with them.  Now I know that the telescoping NFB canes are a fucking nightmare, but since these ones have that twist lock thing, I'd hope they'd be allot better than the NFB ones.

&amp;#x200B;

That's just my two cents, and really their are drawbacks to both, so allot of it comes down to personal preference.T",,,1,0,0,

The rule of thumb is to say “visually impaired” and use person first language unless asked to do otherwise. It’s a pretty fraught issue for us and blindness is so different for everyone that you really can’t make a sweeping statement about the language we prefer and have it be accurate. I know the Deaf community has more of a culture to it and deafness is a big part of it so that influences how they want to be addressed. For autism, just based on the people I’ve met, you guys seem to prefer being up front and to the point about it. Both groups are very large too. By contrast, people who are blind are a very small, very scattered group and we can be anywhere. Blindness doesn’t really define us and the cultural assumptions that it does causes a lot of problems. 

The thing I want christians to stop doing is touching me and demanding to pray for me whether I want them to or not. :D Because of the negative way blind people are portrayed in the Bible, being swarmed by church goers who insist I need divine intervention is frustratingly common.",,,13,0,0,

Things that make it more pleasant to use are not in the design but in the way you move the cane. It still has to be functional above all; it’s a tool and the tool itself isn’t what makes using it unpleasant, but the way people treat us for using it sure does.

Just be sure to practice reading for at least fifteen minutes a day so you can build up reading callouses. You can get books from the National Talking Book Library in braille to read for free white you’re learning. I would do that before spending a few thousand dollars on a note taker just yet.

I can look whereever I want under them and nobody knows.

Alternatively, consider getting a guide dog. People react differently to them.

With that knowledge you can find some security, if that makes sense; it's an awful situation, but it's one you know is coming and you have a good idea of what that will be like. Enjoy the vision you have while you have it but also work on the skills you know you will need; putting them off is just going to make it all harder.

That was the best thing to come out of going more blind the past couple of years; I rediscovered my love of reading. If you have any knowledge of how to read print, you're halfway there already with braille. I think the best way to deal with this is going to be getting that training, the sooner the better, so you will have some idea of your future and you can find out that there's still so much you've got going for you. Yes this is an awful thing to go through and it's torture, but it's not going to change.

I am a blind teen. I started losing vision when I was 9. My school at the time basically kicked me out. Then I home schooled for a few years. Went to an awful primary school. And found an amazing high school. 

But still I feel like I am always depending on other people to drive me around. I am worried about finding work.  

And I feel like to other people all I talk about is being blind. But it’s such a fundamental part of who I am, that I can’t not talk about it. Like when everyone talks about moving out of home and finding apartments while they study. I talk about finding a university near home so that my mom can help take me around.  

And I know the feeling of hiding how sad you are from others. I always felt that even though people try to understand, they just can’t. I needed to talk to other blind people. My people. Because it is a great thing to have someone to talk to that has gone through or is going through what you are. That’s why I love using Readit. 

As for wanting to see. I kinda don’t want to anymore. I know I would be a totally different person without being blind. And I think I have grown so much. I have learnt to always ask why someone does something, not just to judge them. And to think of others, because it is so rare that someone out of no where will think of helping me, or how something will affect me. With small things like going to the movies with friends, they don’t think that I need to sit in front and they will book seats right at the back. 

I too have wanted to write a book about being blind. And if you don’t feel like your life is worth anything, maybe you should start writing and maybe that’s where you are meant to be. And you can feel like you have a purpose",,,6,0,0,

if you get a Samsung phone, use voice assistant to get to the play store so that you can install the Android accessibility suite. Samsung is a special snowflake that doesn't install it by default and uses their own crap screen reader instead. Android also doesn't have as smooth a setup experience as iOS. supposedly you can start TalkBack from setup with holding down both volume keys for 3 seconds but I've never gotten it to work. Maybe it only works on Pixel devices, not sure. There's an on-screen toggle for the screen reader under the vision settings menu on the very first screen. You can get a sighted person to turn it on if the hardware key combos don't work. if you need Braille then be sure to install Brailleback as well. I have no idea how well it works since I've never used it. Also I recommend gboard, if your phone doesn't ship with it by default.

0d45c2bd-c8d2-41fd-bbe9-97297fb7fa44,1571808356,"Hey there. I'm the owner and former user of a NuEyes headset and I've also tried eSight. Both of them have their annoyances. eSight has a non-detachable remote that resembles something attached to a hospital bed but it has an HDMI input and a battery that will last a few hours. NuEyes is a lot more portable and comes with a nifty little bluetooth remote that you slip onto your thumb. Unfortunately headset battery life is about an hour at high brightness and maybe 2 if you keep it lower. eSight has larger, more color-accurate displays while NuEyes' are smaller, a bit greenish, and are in the topleft corner. This may be helpful if your peripheral vision is bettter than your foveal vision. The cameras on both are mediocre at best and suffer from the typical lag so you won't be doing anything that requires a quick response time on either of these. eSight claims they have a low-latency system but it was about the same as any other camera when I tried it.

Both get pretty hot during use and the weight will get uncomfortable. Since eSight offloads the battery and processing to the attached remote it's a little better than NuEyes but that non-detachable remote is a really hard sell. I found it not too difficult to just carry a small bag with me and hook up a battery bank to my NuEyes. It was kind of buggy though and eSight had a lot more features that made it feel a lot closer to ""wearable CCTV"" than NuEyes.

For me, the compactness and portability of NuEyes trumped the more robust feature set of eSight... also NuEyes was an authorized DOR vendor here in the states. Like hell I'm paying 6 grand for a camera I strap to my face. Oh yeah, the trackpad on the NuEyes broke twice on mine. I think it was sweat leaking in and messing it up. Very annoying.

As someone who's been in that rut of frustration I understand how aggravating it is to be denied access by unfair barriers to entry. Screen readers are expensive. Braille is either expensive or huge and expensive. Every major OS and even many Linux distros, all include their own screen readers but it's never the same as being able to look at a program with your eyes. Not even close. Not to mention the plethora of developers that make your screen reader useless by ignoring accessibility guidelines and conventions.

I understand that frustration. That anger how anyone else can pop into their local bigg box retailer and walk out with a $200 Chromebook and be up and running within minutes but you had to take weeks or possibly months memorizing keystroke after keystroke so you could use the screen reader. I get it doubly so because I used to be in the sighted camp. I know intimately how far the conventional interfaces and tech are ahead of their adaptive counterparts.

My first instinct was to rail against companies that profit off of this. Yes, it's unfair. Is it disgusting? That depends on your views. It's a product of capitalism, scarcity, and Human nature. We want to be compensated for the things we create because resources are finite and our effort and energy are also finite. As long as all of that continues to be true, which it will unless we start mining asteroids with automated robots or something, then we'll continue to expect compensation for the things we make.

We all have to pay for stuff, regardless if it's Mx. Consumer buying that $200 Chromebook or a blind user purchasing a screen reader. It's not wrong for people, or companies to charge money for what they make. I think that the high prices are wrong but that's a story for another time. I agree that a lot of this stuff is way too expensive, but here's the thing. Nobody's going to listen to you if you're just ranting. There's probably a myriad of things that could be done to help bring down the cost of adaptive tech, a lot of them involving subsidies in place of major institutions shouldering the high cost and making it available to its members. It's an uphill battle that no one person could ever hope to accomplish. Trouble is, ranting is even less productive than accepting the status quo. We know. We know this stuff is expensive. We know only schools and governments can afford it. Posting up a rant about it might make some people feel good or whatever but it's probably just going to piss the rest of us off and it won't help you or anyone else.

Am I happy with the status quo? No. Absolutely not. It's bullshit. I can buy a 4K gaming monitor for less money than the cheapest Braille display. I bought a laptop, flagship smartphone, two bluetooth keyboards, and 3 pairs of bluetooth headphones and even a custom core i7 desktop for less than what some Braille notetakers cost. Sadly this is the way things are.

What you do about is up to you. Personally I've gone down the road of adapting and making do with what's available. A high-end Android phone with a bluetooth keyboard and some headphones along with a Laptop with NVDA suits my portable computing and content creation and consumption needs well enough. When I need the expensive stuff I turn to government agencies to sponsor it for me. Perhaps you would rather try another way like campaigning to reduce the cost for the end user somehow. Does that sound corny? Probably, but not as bad as posting an angry rant about it on a tiny part of a website that gets sporadic mainstream attention at most. People here and in other online VI communities are often happy to help and provide solutions to problems where you can't have the expensive stuff. Again, posting an angry rant isn't the way to do it.

My partner and I have eye conditions. I was born 3 months early and have retinopathy of prematurity. I have light perception but apart from that I am totally blind. My partner has 20/80 vision and is completely blind at night. I can completely understand how you are feeling. I have anxiety and depression Andy lack of vision does not help me in my every day life. My dream job has always been to work with animals but because of my vision nobody will consider me probably for insurance reasons. People overlooked me when I did voluntary work for a cat shelter even though I worked hard and had been there a lot longer. My partner also has the same troubles with reading signs and her phone as you do and I can understand it must be very frustrating. Apart from my partner, nobody else truly knows what it’s really like to be visually impaired. They don’t even try. At school I was badly bullied by other students and a teacher’s aid because of my vision and the affects of it are still with me to this day. I find it very hard to deal with. I also find it frustrating typing on my phone but a couple of weeks ago my partner got me a bluetooth keyboard and now I can type heaps faster and keep up in these groups. I also find it hard going out on my own and getting around places. I think it’s good you do modelling. I have done reception work before and did voluntary work at a cat shelter and worked in a vet for a short time. My vision does make it hard to get a job, especially one I really want to do. We both love apple devices as they are great for accessibility. I use voiceover and my partner uses the magnifier and zoom. She has to use a cane at night and this is very challenging for her as she is in an electric wheelchair. We would really like to chat to you more. We both have no one except each other and are looking for other blind and visually impaired to chat to that understand what it’s like. Take care and hope to talk soon.",,,2,0,0,

09b4f009-5982-4d90-bcef-118e4af5ba9f,1571460900,"&gt;1.	How has the world changed for you? Obviously sight, one of the 5 senses is now impaired or removed. How has this changed the way you act or think?

- Honestly, I'd say it's made me more empathetic. As a teen, I was very much a ""fuck everyone else, their offense is their issue, haha slurs are funny"" kind of garbage person. I now try to be more caring about others because of how much nonsense I've dealt with. Being patronized like I'm a lap dog and not a functioning almost 25 year old makes my blood boil, so I tend to be less forgiving of discrimination, even if I understand where it's coming from. I also struggled with the whole ""you are a representative of the blindness community at all times"" part of it. For about 2 years I felt like I had to have on makeup, have my hair done, dress a step nicer than I ever had, and look extremely put together. Now, I have run out of fucks to give and I'll wear yoga pants and a band shirt I've had for a decade just to be comfortable.

&gt;2.	If you had an SO when you went blind, how did they react? How about your parents, siblings or any other family?

- I was single when it happened, so thankfully I didn't have to deal with that piece of it. I've talked about it before, but my mother's negligence and medical neglect of me caused me to be permanently blind, since she chose not to get me the help I needed. She is very much the infantilizing type, minimizing me to more of a token she can get sympathy with. Several others in my family are also bad about it, making assumptions that just because they couldn't do something with their eyes closed, today, that I couldn't do it either. I have an aunt and an uncle that are great though and just take me at my word that I can do certain things without having my hands held.

&gt;3.	If you were employed at work what happened? Was their a shift in the type of work you did? Did you get fired?

- N/A

&gt;4.	Was it hard to learn Braille?

- Quite a bit, actually. I have constant tingles in my fingertips so feeling paper braille can be quite difficult. I was also taught with used braille books, so the soft braille was also rubbed down. If I could have learned with a borrowed braille display where I could really feel the dots, I would have struggled much less. It's still pretty hard, though, not gonna lie. Many letters, like A, K and U can be mistaken for each other if you're going too fast and miss the bottom row, or bleed together cells. It's very situation dependant as well, so it can get very complex.

&gt;5.	This is sort of a weird question and is personal, not school related, but what do you see? This always interested me. Is it black? Is there nothing?

- I'm what's known as a low partial. In my right eye I'm much closer to light perceptive as much of my vision is either complete blindness or exceedingly little difference. I have a constant static in my vision, so looking around, things seem to be moving even when I manage to keep my eyes still. I also have Charles Bonnet Syndrome as well as color blindness, so in the sepia and sky blue static of my vision, I see a lot of faces, eyes, and non-specific horror movie stuff. I've done a few AMA's about it, with varying success.",,,9,0,0,

Honestly, I think braille is hard for everyone, especially those that have other issues. Regardless of your other disabilities, I think they'd make it harder. Tremors or involuntary movement especially. Any cell, with the exception of jumbo braille, is roughly the size of half a fingertip to a whole fingertip depending on how tiny your hands are.

From real bad to good:

- logo.jpg

- Businesslogo.jpg

- The logo for Business Inc.

- A tree with leaves making the logo of Business Inc.

- A tree in the background, its leaves spilling down in the reds, oranges and yellows of the Medieval helmet of the Business Inc. logo

Then, the amount of detail can get to be too much.

- In the background, blurry leaves blend into green grass. A gnarled oak spills its branches out in every direction like a pom pom, a few leaves sticking to the branches still. The gold leaves make up the base of a helmet, red and orange leaves creating the visor and plumage. In a large Serif font, Business Inc is written, a thin double underline cutting through the very bottom of the words.

That description may be good in some contexts, but annoying in others.

- The green grass of a park is blurred, blades indistinguishable from one another. Autumn leaves lay on top, blurred into firey piles at the base of an old tree. Its mostly bared branches stretch in every direction, the few leaves it still has focused on the left side. Their angles seem as if the wind is blowing gently. Next to the tree, with a little space to let the blurry green grass show through, is the helmet of Business Inc.'s logo. Various shaped leaves form together, red spade shaped ones creating the slots of the visor and much of the plumage of the medieval helmet. The other leaves, golden yellow and orange, vary in shapes although most are maple shaped.

I went through some of that myself a while back when I decided to start using a white cane. I can get around most of the time without it, so do I *really* need it? Am I being overly dramatic? I did just fine for 40 years without it, after all.

In the end I decided that no... I'm not just being dramatic. I went without it for 40 years and my perception was that I was doing ""just fine"" but that's only because I didn't know any different. The reality is that just because I wasn't falling down injuring myself and walking into things all the time, that doesn't mean things couldn't have been better. I was forever looking down. I lacked confidence when walking around in unfamiliar places. I would occasionally cut someone off or bump into someone because I couldn't see them and they'd think I was just being an oblivious jerk, etc. The cane mitigates a lot of that. It lets me feel safe, lets me look up and engage in the world around me a bit more, and lets others know that I can't see well.

Dispatching for SAR was more interesting than dispatching for law enforcement, because I was also a trained [Incident Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System) for lost persons and drownings and I just really enjoyed the logistics of it all. It felt more hands-on/involved and we were a close-knit group.

I got out of it and went into software development shortly after college, though, because of the higher earning potential and the fact that I could do it from home. Also, I have to admit, my vision loss is less of a factor in this job than it was doing dispatching/IC.

I've always been visually impaired to about the same degree, legally blind since birth. Over the years, it's gotten a little worse in some ways a little better in others.

I still very vividly remember the dream, because it was so detailed and it happened so frequently.

But first some backstory: My dad used to do HVAC/electrical work when I was a kid. He ran his own business and sometimes I would tag along if I was on a school break or something. There was one house he used to work at quite regularly (I think they were remodeling) that had a crawlspace under the floor from their basement (the basement wasn't as large as the whole house's footprint, so part of the duct work/electrical wiring was only accessible via the crawlspace). I remember crawling under there a couple times and it was very ""scratchy"" - lots of gnarled roots and sticks and things poking at you.

Well, my dream started with crawling through this crawlspace for an unusually long time and eventually emerging from the other end into a forest. After walking through the forest a bit, it would open into this clearing. The whole area was lit with a sort of ambient pale green, moonlight-like glow, but there was no visible moon or stars, just weirdly illuminated clouds.

In the middle of the clearing was a HUGE tree that had a ""treehouse"" that was an actual house -  an old two-story white house.

I'd climb the ladder into the house and inside it was all just open, completely empty rooms with squeaky wood floors. I'd walk past the stairs into the living room (never went up them) and there were doors there that opened out onto this balcony that gave a great view of the clearing and the forest beyond. I'd go stand out there and take it all in, then the wind would really pick up.

After that, I'd go back inside the house and I'd be standing there looking around, when suddenly I'd feel something wet on my arm. Then I noticed something dripping from the ceiling. Then I realized it was blood.

That's when I would look up and see all kinds of dead bodies hanging on ropes from the ceiling.

I'd freak out at this point, run out of the house, down the ladder, back through the clearing (still very windy), into the forest and the trail just sort of closed in behind me as I ran. I'd dive back into the hole into the crawlspace and start crawling toward the basement, but all of the gnarled roots and things in the crawlspace would turn to hands that grabbed me and pulled me back toward the clearing.

That's usually the point at which I woke up. I think one time I did barely make it out of the crawlspace and back into the basement.

I had this dream off and on for months. It was probably when I was around 12.",,,1,0,0,

4242a80b-e96d-4f81-bd84-3efe12cc8e54,1571987522,"Ah, that's got to be a rough adjustment for him. 

If he were 20 and adjusting to blindness, my answer may be a little different, but I'm guessing he's older and it sounds like he may not be around much longer. Given those two things, I wouldn't really focus much on him learning to accommodate his new situation like I might a much younger person who has 40 years of life as a blind person ahead of them. He no doubt will learn these skills, but I'd be more hands-off about it and let him work it out, unless he asks for help. Right now he's probably just trying to hang on to some dignity during what he knows are his final moments and I think that's going to require a bit of deference on the part of the family.

My dad had a stroke a while back and was similarly embarrassed for a while (he's since mostly recovered), not because he couldn't see, but because he was just so uncoordinated. 

I would try and find other things to do with him, first and foremost. 

If he's willing to get together for meals, plan simpler things - sandwiches, casseroles that can be served in a bowl, but won't drip like soups, etc. With my dad, we kind of planned family meals like that for a while without really telling him that's why we were doing it, but he knew and thanked us for it later. 

But mostly, I wouldn't force it. If he wants to join you at the table for conversation, but eat earlier or later, let him know that's totally fine. Or maybe he wants to skip the meal and join you all to spend time together in the living room once dinner is over. Either way, let him know you just want to spend time with him and food doesn't have to be involved. 

And then give him some space on the subject. With my dad, when we backed off about stuff like that, he'd come around and come out and join us after a bit. If we pushed the issue, he'd push back - I think because he thought it meant more to us than it did and then he'd feel even more inadequate.

It's more than just being embarrassed about making a bit of a mess - it's what the mess represents. It's about feeling like you suddenly can't do this basic thing.

There are some countertop ovens, and there are still portable single burners sold for college dorms,  that still have old-fashioned knobs, so that's an option.  

But ultimately, as ""smart"" appliances make their way to the market, we'll be able to control them from our smart phones.  The ones hitting the market now are pretty expensive but they'll come down.

So, if the apartment complex won't work with you (and there are no laws to encourage this), the cheapest option might be a portable single burner.  In the US, they start at about $15 and go up from there.

First, you want the cats to come to you when it's time for something like brushing (or making sure they're inside).  This is a cat training issue, and of course cats can be trained!  Not training them is training them that they don't have to come to you when called.

Here is [a good article by National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/05/animals-cats-training-pets/#close).  You'll have to give your email address to read the article.

Second is tripping over then and other issues.  It would be great if animals always knew where we were and got out of our way, but sometimes they sleep or aren't paying attention.

If your cats can hear, you can train them based on an auditory signal, just as loudly clapping your hands, stomping your foot, or just saying, ""Yo, cats!""

Frankly, I talk to myself all the time, so shouting out, ""Yo cats!"" or ""Yo pupper!"" would seem par for the course.  LOL

And finally, the escaping issue... this really is a difficult one.  Long-term, you train the cats to sit and stay at the door and never run outside. Depending on the cat, that can be more difficult or not.  

But it's a safety issue and you need it resolved now in the short-term as you work on the longterm.  /u/2fa4d75b-0baa-43cd-8dc8-e3104184698c's answer is really good.  They get treats that are tossed away from door.

Nobody can tell you or I that having sight problems is not a pain in the ass. I get irritated when people claim that they wouldn't take a miracle cure. Of course anyone would just for the convenience. Someone once said that being blind is incredibly inconvenient and that's so true. I agree. It's not great. People sometimes ignore that in an attempt to try and sound positive but sometimes you just want someone to go yes, it is bad. Modern medicine, I am ready for your cure.

The problem now is that I am sort of tempted to try to turn this around and pep talk you which is probably not that helpful. So here's stuff I would say to anyone with or without sight problems who was looking to get into a tricky career like modelling.

If you make money out of modeling you're a  model, and that's what you tell them. Don't mention the disability, I never do. Never make excuses for yourself.  Never give them a reason to think less of you. I'm a musician and I guess it's similar to modeling in that it's a fake it till you make it career. If this feels like building yourself up too much, bear in mind it is what everyone else is doing. Get yourself set up with some sort of online presence that calls you what you want to be. Have business cards made. Put a logo at the end of your emails. People will believe it.

As to the practicalities sure, I find that being blind makes life very very expensive. I spend a stupid amount of money on cabs and ubers and stuff. In the last week I have done five jobs all over London and earlier this year I was in Tokyo and Los Angeles, and I went to Tokyo solo. It can be done. You just end up spending a huge amount of time making phone calls and if things go wrong you have to problem solve. You also have to have planned for things to go wrong. The number of times I have called a building, while I was standing in the building, for someone to come find me is huge. If that's price of doing business so be it.

You will fall into bed exhausted at the end of every day because you will be working twice as hard as everyone else and I have no idea what my old age is going to be like when I just can't do it anymore, but I'm going to do it while I can.",,,1,0,0,

That is exactly what I hear from RNIB, oh you can do anything you want and if you can't it's everyone else's fault. Sometimes that is true, mostly it is total rubbish. I can't drive, I can't take photos, I can't travel around solo without doing hours of preparation and running a significant risk that someone will forget and leave me standing in a building, calling the building I'm actually in, and asking them to come find me. That's one person's mistake, that's not evidence of some evil hegemony of sighted people working to keep me in my place. Obviously I don't shove that sort of thinking down the throats of the people I work with but they're not stupid, they're going to realise they're there are limits and I'm not going to patronise them by saying otherwise, and I am not going to try to tell them to blame society. Sure, get help from people, you have no choice, but don't blame them for putting up barriers if they're really not. That just makes it an argument.

Sorry that winds me up. One thing nobody gets about disability is how political it is.

I honestly know almost nothing about RNC. Everyone I have met doing this has been very very keen to stay in mainstream education, whether that's school or college. I think any of them would have just refused point blank to go anywhere whose name ended in ""for the blind."" Silly maybe but I know how they feel, I still feel the same way quite often.

I don't want to deal with the hair and the slobber and crapping and throwing up in the corner, the stinking food and all that stuff. Second I travel a lot for work and I'm always going to different places. Some people would say that's where a dog would help but I have no real idea where I'm going most of the time, I get cabs and ubers and they drop me at the door. The dog is not going to help me get from the door to where I'm going as it doesn't know any better than I do. I fly quite often and I don't think I can take a dog on a London to LA plane flight of possibly 12 hours without it taking a dump in my seat. 

I have been guided very briefly by someone else's dog, it was terrifying, I have no idea how anyone ever trusts them. It's a dog. It's a highly trained dog but it's just a dog. At some point it will turn around and gnaw your leg off.",,,3,0,0,

Current mentee is looking for a place to go to school and she has been knocked back hard by several places that she'd have really liked to go, but which made it very clear they just didn't want her. That's horrible behaviour, and they knew what they were doing to a 15 year old they wouldn't have done it.

Those people have earned themselves a permanent place on my shit list but what are you going to do, force them to do something they don't want to? That's not going to be a good outcome for her.

I know there's a train of thought that says ""make a point, make them do it"" but it is not my job, or hers, to change the world. I'm about problem solving.

RNIB renamed itself from ""for the blind"" to ""of the blind"" in 2002, then again to ""of blind people"" in 2007. I only realised because of the announcements on the tube (er, subway, Americans.) I guess if forced to choose I am happier to be ""a blind person"" than a nameless, personality-less member of a group called ""the blind,"" but it's all just politics. I'd still rather be ""Jan,"" you know?

Hilarious side note. What I didn't know before I looked it up is that in 1868 it was originally called (deep breath) the ""British and Foreign Society for Improving Embossed Literature for the Blind."" Does it get any more old school British than that? I say, what ho, Carruthers!

Another hilarious side note. As regards sports, current mentee is a keen runner (I correct her when she says she was a keen runner as I run too.)

The fact is, to quote someone I knew years ago, being blind is when every mouthful is a surprise, and sometimes you find yourself sucking desperately at an empty fork, which is even more of a surprise. Usually you don't get to assemble a delicious custom mouthful containing just the right amount of bacon, sausage and stuffing all dipped in gravy. That's just life. But you can usually get stuff down your throat without spraying everyone in the vicinity with hollandaise sauce.

It needs to be directed properly and have a specific goal in mind.

Obviously, having a bunch of people just blindfold themselves and try to do stuff is going to be a waste of time. I have said to people when they have been whining about stuff they can't do, ""well, you don't know what you're doing yet."" When they get some idea what they're doing, it's different. I think we all understand that.

Also, to get political, this is the same NFB that protested the movie ""Blindness."" The film shows a situation in which huge numbers of people go blind all at once. NFB complained that it didn't realistically depict the day to day lives of blind people, but it's pretty obviously not trying to. It's trying to depict the initial trauma that they're talking about in that paper and it does that pretty reasonably. If huge numbers of people suddenly went blind and nobody knew what they were doing it would not be pretty.

Many people here will know how shockingly okay it can be long term, but most people won't know that and that makes them careful, like they'd be careful talking to someone who'd recently lost a close relative. You might be careful about mentioning that relative until you had figured out how the person was doing. That is not wrong.

It is my job to help people out in this situation. You can let people off the hook by talking to them. Someone already posted here that if you start using sight related terms, you make it okay. If they say something about it, great, that's your chance to laugh it off and make it even more okay. If that seems like a chore, it is, but it's my disability and I will take responsibility for it.

Yes you're going to have to tell people about it when you're working with them but I never open the conversation with it. I tend to try to have a few phone calls so they know me as a person before I drop the bomb on them. I'm not talking about deceiving anyone but there's nothing wrong with getting to know people first.

I guess there's two ways to go. Either you promote yourself specifically as a model with a disability, or you go for more general stuff. I don't know which one is best. These days stuff seems to be about building a brand for yourself. Molly Burke has done it very successfully. She's turned the disability into a brand and it seems to work for her. But I wouldn't want to tell you what to do. I don't market myself in that way, I'm just a musician, I would rather bury the disability as deep and as far as I can, but not everyone feels like that.

It's so hard over the internet to really help but a lot of the time it all comes down to chance encounters. So what you have to do is make sure you have lots of chance encounters. Do everything you can get your hands on. Volunteer for stuff. Go everywhere you can, meet everyone you can. There's always something to do. Yes it is hard, but if it takes a bunch of phone calls and a cab ride, maybe that is the price of entry. It's worth it. And you maybe don't get to choose exactly what you want to do. You play the hand you are dealt. I never planned to be a musician but I wasn't going to turn it down when it happened. Just do everything you possibly can, meet everyone you possibly can, and show them happy Hailee. Most people just need the ""yes I'm fine it doesn't stop me doing anything"" version.

Now, a lot of blind people are not very young or have other problems too, and that's a factor, but on its own? I don't want to write off the challenges but there's a job for everyone and nobody should doubt that for a second.

That said I am probably not a helpful example. I'm a musician, which is of course blind person career number one. I am also involved in running an agency for guitarists and I make a percentage of my income renting out equipment by consigning it to studios (that is, it sits on their shelf and if someone uses it, I get paid and they take a cut.) If that seems weirdly specific it is, and it is just a result of me trying to use the opportunities that came my way.

What's more important than any of that is that I am self employed. To some extent that makes it unreliable. I don't have to be fired, they just stop calling me. On the other hand it also means that I have a lot more opportunity to negotiate for the things I need, which generally isn't much. In the end it means that I take the jobs I can do. This means, for instance, that I turn down a really depressing amount of work because I can't read music, but that's life.

Between taking the opportunities you can get, and taking the jobs you can do, in the end you don't get much choice about what you end up doing. The thing is, and the really liberating thing is, that is the same for everyone. I know lots of (sighted) people who I see as very successful and people to emulate, but over a drink in the evening they often start griping about the fact that they wanted to be doing something a bit different. Obviously you can push for things but life has a way of taking you down unexpected roads and sometimes it's a good idea to go with the flow.

I'd love to have 20/20 vision, but we were given these struggles because we are able to handle them. ❤ I have a lot of hobbies, like reading, writing, painting. I model on the side as well.  Being visually Impaired is NEVER an excuse for me, but always a reason. That is a pet peeve of mine: when disabled people use their disability as a crutch or an excuse. I make it a point in my life to never do that, because it's just not who I am. I would like to refine my mobility skills &amp; learn some more braille, &amp; look into volunteering or helping people like me in any aspect. I think that would be fundamental to my personal growth &amp; independence as a visually Impaired individual. I try not to dwell on the fact that I have trouble seeing what sighted people easily can, but it's hard when I'm surrounded by them constantly. I am very grateful for what vision I do have because I know others do have it worse, but that doesnt lessen the hardship of my own situation either. I will forever be grateful for being able to see what I can.
