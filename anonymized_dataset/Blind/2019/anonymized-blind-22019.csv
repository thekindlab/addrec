My choices have been limited since I haven't had functional glasses, but there were some games that could be played with limited vision. 

For reference, some of the games we like include:
-Red Dragon Inn (not playable with limited vision, unless you have something that can read the text of the cards to you without anyone else hearing)
-Smash Up (the text tends to be large enough to read, or I can magnify it with my phone)
-Elder Sign (this game is cooperative, so I can mostly get by with having someone read things and explain the board for me)
-Castle Panic (also cooperative)
-One Deck Dungeon (also cooperative, with a really good set up for color blind and visually impaired people. My wife and I were really impressed with this game.)

d97463a5-f856-4ae0-816d-870fa8fbfc70,1551235371,"* blindness does not necessarily mean absolute darkness.  There are varying degrees of sight and sight loss
* Blind folks do not need pity and do not necessarily need aid with everything.  There's nothing wrong with politely asking if someone could use assistance but don't assume (seen too many posts and irl people physically touching/pulling visually impaired individuals and treating them like they're some poor waif who can do nothing alone).
* Yes.  They probably know about daredevil/Stevie Wonder/Toph/ etc.
* 'watch out', 'over there', 'that thing'- think about these phrases.  Most visually impaired folks will understand it rolls off the tongue but it is FAR more useful to say 'on you left', 'twenty feet ahead', 'the basket on the table'.
* A white cane is very useful! However not everyone will use one and not everyone needs one!
* Know someone with a visual impairment and want to help? Ask them if there's something you can do!  \[note- salt your damn sidewalks.  This helps SO much in winter.  Also if they walk around a lot or rely on public transport, maybe keep an eye out for things like broken glass, pot holes, construction/other that could impede or be hazardous to them that they may not detect otherwise and inform them or maybe your local city about the problem\]
* Everybody deserves respect :) Also, many people appreciate humor.  I used to assist a blind lady who would crack jokes about her non-sightedness ALL the time.  'guess what I saw? -oh, what...?- NOTHING :D'
* many blind and visually impaired people have very fulfilling lives.  They have jobs, are parents and I can guarantee they are in your community somewhere.  However some career seekers will have significant struggles in finding work that is accessible, safe, rewarding and non-offensive.  My blind lady used to work in a manufacturing/assembly job until they closed down and she was given the option by a collaborative group of either taking a 3 hour public transport across state with two transfers to get to a part time, minimum wage job handing out samples \[wasn't worth the time/money put into the bus pass and she was left with nobody to assist her.  Things were often moved to another storage without notice and she was given a LOT of grief\] and a greeter position at wal-mart.  She was a greeter for about two years until the company wanted to push her into bagging \[as she couldn't check receipts, detect many of the folks she was meant to greet due to the noise around her\] and she went on disability to pay her rent.
* if you are an employer, consider how you can make jobs accessible to the blind and visually impaired in your locale.  Some only need minimal accommodations such as a high contrast and/or magnification program on a computer or a scanner/reader for them.

\[edit- thank you so very much for gold!!! :) &lt;3 I appreciate it and honestly with how stuff has been going its really made my day!\]",,,33,0,1,

1fac76bd-3ff9-4b16-b554-01dce46482d1,1550889518,"no problem! I live in a city, so while I was always the only blind kid in school there were usually another couple blind kids in the school district. this probably helped, as I'm sure if I was the only blind student in the district it would've been much harder to get things like Braille/O&amp;M lessons.

I started learning Braille when I was 4/5, and up until high school had at least 1 Braille lesson each week during school hours. I have some remaining vision left, so I would just use enlarged print and assistive technology instead of Braille for school work. I never really had any access issues, except on one or two occasions where I didn't get enlarged materials in time for an assignment or things like that. Overall I'd say my schools did pretty well with ensuring that I had access to things I needed.

You're not entirely wrong about public schools being unaccepting of blind kids though. My parents were also repeatedly told to put me in a blind school, and I know my mom had issues when it was time to register me for school because they kept insisting that I couldn't be in mainstream classes even though I tested 2-3 grade levels ahead.

1. I see people here largely saying they skip these survey posts anyway, so what good is posting the survey here if nobody answers anyway and it just clutters things up for us?
2. If I'm plunging time into something, I'd like to see it benefit me, you know?  Most of these projects seem like they'll never go beyond a presentation for a class.  For those that do, I'd like it if they compensated us if the survey was of substantial length.  Then again, I'm a broke college student.  Spending cash is a luxury for me right now.  
3. Something just seems slightly off-putting about people coming to a forum about blindness just to outsource a bunch of blind people for something a sighted person is doing.  Not sure why, really, for some reason that doesn't sit well with me.  ",,,2,0,0,

I think that people have the need to feel helpful. They might get some sort of feel good self-praise from “helping” you. Unfortunately, the general public is grossly misinformed. They get wild ideas about blindness from the media. It boils down to two theories: either you are helpless or you have super powers. Since you’re not fighting crime, you must be helpless. It sucks, but the only way to combat these perspectives is education. And , unfortunately, you have to be the one to educate them. 

Here’s a tip. It’s an O&amp;M move called the Hines Break. It’s the second thing I teach new students, after sighted guide. If someone grabs you (or their cane), your first move is to grab their hand. Then, you’re in control. You can choose to reposition yourself to let the person guide you, or you can decline their help. 

I know it’s not much. I try to inform the public as much as I can, but I’m only one person. Hell, my family doesn’t even believe me half the time, and I went to school for this. ",,,26,0,0,

Some people have *legitimate* reasons that make them unable to stand in line.

It's incredible to me that people opposing the continuation of a racist regime like the zionist entity are accused of racism by others. Antisemitism is absolutely unacceptable, but there is nothing antisemitic in calling for a fair resolution to the occupying colonial settler regime in Palestine.

Sighted people don't do that at all, since there's no reason to; it's just taken in visually as needed.

I nearly brained myself on an open van rear door once - the sort that swings upwards. At a busy taxi stand that I was crossing. I was pretty well out of it. Knew the car was there, approximately, and could hear the driver futzing about, but there were cars and drivers all over. 

Didn't make the inference of 'oh there's probably an open hatch door between driver and car' until after I somehow felt the air pressure differential at a couple inches away from the door edge and reflex dove backwards. Nearly fell over in the process. It wasn't even at conscious level; just the ""emergency hazard"" lizard-brain.

Israel was given that land @ WW2, it was forcefully taken from Palestinians by the Allies. This was able to happen because the area was a British Colony until 1948. (info from a page on our State Dept page that is no longer maintained: [https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel)\_

  
There was a war in the 60s where Israel extended their reach into Palestine. They then agreed to boundaries which they have ignored. The ""wall"" they have is not a contiguous wall. The are barriers that wrap around Settlers settlements in islands of Israel. There are instances of people having to go through check points to get to their own orchards.   


Don't get me wrong, the problem is NOT going to be solved by Palestinians lobbing bombs into Israel. I am not supporting a terroristic solution. Within Israel itself, if you are not Jewish you were a second class citizen until recently. Some Israelies want to go back to that. There were actually designations on their National ID.  If you are Jewish Israeli, you can marry someone and give them a way to citizenship. If you are Palestinian Israeli (citizen of Israel with Palestinian heritage not a citizen of Palestine) you cannot. There are far too many rules and laws like this.    
It is a fucked up situation and the US has thrown all of our eggs in with Israel and is afraid to/ refuses to criticize what they do. In the US if you criticize Israel, you are painted as anti semitic, which is truly not fair.  You can criticize a country because you want them to be \*better\*. It is like saying I am anti American if I criticize the US, but worse.  You are being accused of being the same as neo nazis!  There are US Jewish who are against some of the stuff that Israel has done.

I have never understood the plate-clockthing. Grab a fork, stab something, layout mostly determined immediately. I'd be annoyed if someone felt the need to describe where everything is, unless there was, like, some really tall, thin, unstable glass of boiling acid, surrounded by dominos, right beside my plate, or something like that. I wouldn't want to take risks reaching for the salsa if there's a highly unstable tall glass of boiling acid in the way. That could really ruin the meal, if that got knocked over. Mostly, though, I just drink water from regular glasses, so in the unlikely event something actually does spill, it's not as bad as if it was coffee, sugary softdrinks, or boiling acid.

Mostly, the only thing about restaurant-going that is problematic is when you get the weighter who finds the nearest sighted person and asks what you want, as though it is a high crime to actually address a blind person directly.

If something is past my line of sight I simply see nothing.  Hope that helps ��",,,1,0,0,

Reputable schools care about the dogs they’ve trained and it’s possible the resident could be putting the dog’s safety in danger when it’s off duty.  So maybe someone else like the school should be talking to her as well. ,,,2,0,0,

However, I have been having a very difficult time ""dosing"" my meds. I take 38 pills a day for various reasons (I have Behcet's disease, as well as depression and migraines) and so opening up a bunch of different pill bottles daily is a hassle. It's generally easier to put them in a med organizer. I've gotten better at doing this, but I don't always get it right. The last time I screwed up I overdosed myself and ended up having a pretty serious seizure. After that I asked my doc about getting me a home health nurse to come dose my meds weekly so there are no issues. She told me no, and my pharmacy doesn't do dosing. So now I'm back to square one. Meds while blind are super frustrating. I kind of took being able to do these kinds of things for granted when I was fully sighted!

ee3bded6-bbcc-4b04-8508-53da4683a20d,1549379614,"You should really consider joining the D&amp;D group. I am. :D

I can really relate here. I grew up with video games and it was always my escape when I was bored. Over time I lost most of my remaining vision and it’s just not possible to play the same games anymore. I can still sit and watch my partner play his games from time to time because we have similar interests, but it’s not really the same. Especially now that Kingdom Hearts 3 has finally come out and I can’t play it after 13 years of waiting! But anyway...

D&amp;D has really been the best thing to come into my life since video games weren’t an option anymore. It can truly be immersive and more engaging than video games ever were because you actually have the chance to impact the story in a meaningful way. You should really consider joining: it would be great to have more people involved :)Also, I’m 28, so the above age estimation for the group is likely correct based only on available data. You’d fit right in.

So, since console gaming isn’t an option anymore, maybe consider a few other things. If you like Pokemon and have a Windows PC and are comfortable using the NVDA screen reader, someone made a blind friendly Pokemon Crystal version. This was a lot of fun for me because I loved pokemon growing up.
Also, look into MUDs. These are text based games that work really well with screen readers, though I’ve met a few magnification users who rock them too. The game style seems to be fairly close to the typical high fantasy stuff, so it’s sort of like going through Skyrim without the graphics. 

Hope this helped.",,,1,0,0,

You could use a second sound card if you had one. I think another way would be to set line 1 in the playback tab of mmsys.cpl as the default device, which would send all your sound there, but if you wanted microphone, you'd have to use a repeater.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the greatest at getting VAC to always do what I want, but the question I'd be asking myself is what do I want to do. If your answer is record a specific app, I'd do it slightly differently. If your app has pipable output i.e. you can choose where to send it, you can simply pipe it to line 1, and then your recorder of choice can be receiving from line line 1 input. If your app doesn't have pipable output, well, Windows 10 can now redirect sound on a per-app basis to an output of your choosing. Windows I &gt;&gt; system &gt;&gt; sound, then tab to ""App volume and device preferences"". Once in there, you search for the list, find the app (note that it must have played sound at least once), then tab to output which is a combobox you can manipulate. The thing is a bit finicky, like it will throw you out of the tab order sometimes, but you can get back in, it's definitely workable.. Once the app is redirected, you then can fire up your editor or DAW and record. If you need your mic to be patched in, and you can deal with the hearing of yourself, a hackish way is to go to the microphone tab in mmsys.cpl, then hit listen to this device, which is a checkbox, the combo box after it tells Windows where to pipe the output, in this case, line 1. hth",,,1,0,0,

ee3bded6-bbcc-4b04-8508-53da4683a20d,1550851822,"Samsung phones seem to be pretty well-received and are among the most popular model. Aside from what I come across weekly while teaching assistive technology, Samsung is to Android as iPhone is to iOS. That’s just an assumption based on my small sample size who prefers Android to iOS.

As long as you’re running the latest version of TalkBack with an android version above Lollipop, you’ll experience a decent version of Android. I’d still recommend snagging something running the latest version of Android, though, which is Oreo right now.

Don’t bother with other screen readers aside from TalkBack. They’re a lesson in frustration. For example, Samsung phones come with a poorly named screen reader called “Voice Assistant”. It has similar gestures to iOS, and so many think it will be the best option for them until they try to access the internet and some other applications. Voice Assistant can’t focus on items in these windows and ends up being worthless. Suddenly they have to ignore all of the stuff they learned in Voice Assistant and learn the new gestures for Talkback. Just go with TalkBack.

In some cases, TalkBack isn’t installed when you get the phone. You can either get sighted help to grab it from the Play Store, or use another screen reader temporarily to snag it. There’s no telling if you’ll have it installed. I recently spent a day setting up four Samsung S8 phones and there was something different about each and every setup. Some had TalkBack installed, some did not. You can’t really generalize Android like you can with iOS. If i wanted to, I could pick up any iPhone with VoiceOver and hit the ground running. That’s not always the case with Android, though in 99% of cases, you could do the same with only a minute or two of getting up to speed.

When you have TalkBack, you can set it to be the accessibility Shortcut. Some Android models allow for more than one shortcut with different ways of activating them. Most common is to hold both volume buttons down for three seconds to toggle TalkBack on and off. Yeah, it’s really simple just like the triple click home button for VoiceOver.

No good podcasts for the screen reader that I know of, but there is a talk back tutorial that you can run through when you start VoiceOver that will teach you everything you need to know to get started. There is an adjustment period — especially coming from iOS, but if you spend an hour with the phone running TalkBack, you’ll be off and running.

A tip: Do not go into this comparing Android to iOS. You’ll just be disappointed. Think of it like this: you can use a screen reader to access text, or you could use braille to access text. There are people on both sides who say that one way is better or more efficient than the other way, but regardless of how you do it, you’re accessing the text. They are just two different tools to do the same thing. This is what it’s like comparing VoiceOver to TalkBack. Both are efficient enough, both are good tools, but that’s what they are: tools to complete a job. You can’t compare them apples to apples.

I use an iPhone 8 as my daily driver right now, but I use a Samsung S8 as my work phone. As a blind person, I can easily switch between them and I’m happy with both. If Apple doesn’t get it’s pricing situation and lack of innovative features to justify that price under control, I’ll be switching to Android full time. Apple might have an edge for new blind users who want a uniform experience across devices, but I’m not willing to continue paying astronomical prices for a phone that hasn’t changed much and still has the same accessibility bugs that it had a year ago. That’s just my two cents for your change jar.

You can check out the Inclusive Android site linked by another user, though it’s not exactly like Apple Vis. it is the best you’ll get, though. I think there’s a google group or mailing list for eyes free android, though, that would be much more helpful.
There’s also a book called “Getting Started with Android” from National Braille Press which offeres the book as a digital download in Word format. Written by blind people, for blind people. It’s a helpful read when you’re getting started.

Good luck; have fun!

ee3bded6-bbcc-4b04-8508-53da4683a20d,1550540432,"This is an amazing idea. There are lots of blind people like myself who grew up with video games and, for one reason or another, are not able to play them anymore due to visual issues. I’ve waited 13 years to play Kingdom Hearts III, for example, and now that it’s out, I can’t play it. I’ve often felt that blind individuals miss out on some of the pop culture that comes from video games and it’s something I’ve sorely missed over the past couple of years. Thank you for embarking on this endeavor.

I’ll preface this by saying that I’m not incredibly acquainted with let’s plays because it gets frustrating trying to watch someone play through Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess while talking on other non-game related tangents. Perhaps I can help, though, so here we go.

How important are visual aspects such as game-play mechanics, graphical quality or art to contextualize?
Take a note from movie audio descriptions. While there is a ton that could be described, frankly you could spend an hour describing the nuances of a mountain in the distance of Skyrim. Simply stating that mountains loom in the distance is enough. However, things that are forefront should be described with detail. As a gamer who used to spend a good ten minutes watching the animations for casting spells or swinging weapons in RPGs, this detail would be missed. Still, describing it the first time it shows up and later casually mentioning it is fine. So, over all, the visuals are important, just don’t get too bogged down in the details so that a quick scene takes ages to describe. It may be worth it to have a series introductory episode to describe the art style and color pallet so that you don’t have to consistently describe those minute details.

Which would be prefered, exhaustive play-throughs or abridged play-throughs of longer titles with a lot of optional content such as Bioshock?
I feel this could go either way. Yeah, I’m interested to see you fight the mindless armies of mooks a couple of times, but if you’re forced to grind through them over and over it might get a bit tedious to listen to. However, this is the authentic experience, so I think I lean toward the exhaustive playthroughs.

For cut-scenes, would movie style AD be preferred or a post cut-scene synopsis?
I would prefer movie-style AD, though there will certainly be scenes that require a post-scene description. I think you’ll need to go with both depending on the game and context. I agree with a previous reply, though — use a sound to denote that game play is pausing for description.
What sounds are most important to you to understand where you are?
Positional audio will be key for immersion. Use audio cues for purely visual elements such as meters on screen, but try not to muddle the audio landscape too much. There are certain scenarios where the game’s soundtrack can do the work for you — such as the music changing as enemies spot you or low health alarms begin ringing. 

Are any kinds of sounds disorienting?
Not particularly. There are bound to be very loud scenes where game audio needs to be ducked for narration, but the narrator will be able to keep things on track. just avoid piercing high frequencies and all should be fine.

Do you have anything that annoys you in regular lets plays that we might not think about?
The premise of this project about well covers it for me. :D

Would more in depth descriptions of things be appreciated or annoying? Like would giant suffice as a descriptor or would you want a size comparison?
Giant suffices unless the size is an important factor. However, size comparisons would likely require further and further reference points since it doesn’t matter if the giant is four times the size of a house nearby when I don’t know how big the nearby house is. 

What kinds of descriptors don't really matter for your understanding of something?
I’m not too sure how to answer this one without rehashing what I’ve mentioned above... Sorry.

Are there any genres of games which you feel are already covered accessibly (such as fully read visual novels let's plays) or any genres which are especially under served?
 
I’m probably not the best sample for this question since I’ve not been very involved with let’s plays.

We're planning on distributing via Youtube and iTunes and other podcast apps. Are there any accessibility issues we should be aware of with these platforms? Are there any other platforms we should be considering, such as Spotify?
Podcasts and YouTube will have the majority covered. Spotify might be a worthwhile addition, but not necessarily the target platform for most.

I hope this helped a little. It’s great that you’ve started seeking out opinions early. I’m sure you will get more useful feedback once you release a prototype of sorts and it will only get better with time.

Thanks for starting this. It’s a really exciting idea.

Just hanging onto the handle/bars at the back works fine.  The one thing to keep in mind is that if you're in an electric wheelchair, the blind person behind you can't feel any of your body language. This means you really need to warn us if you're going to back up, or speed forward suddenly when we might not be expecting it!  In the case of backing up, you risk driving over my foot if I didn't realize you're about to move, and in the case of speeding forward, you could lose me entirely if I wasn't expecting you to move.  And even if you don't leave me behind, having to go from standing still to a fast jog without warning is unpleasant.

Firstly, games I'd personally love to see are those like Shadow of the Colossus, Legend of Zelda, things like that.

I'd really try to branch out a lot more with advertizing this, like to the Audiogames Forum, because Reddit and blind people don't really get along well at this point, unless they're using an iPhone with a certain app that is in beta.

A podcast would be great for me, I use the Apple Podcasts app a lot.

Optionally, if the game supports it, it would be great if audio of the game was in surround sound. Operating system modules like DTS in Android (LG) or Dolby Atmos (in Samsung phones) or Windows Sonic for Headphones, can make surround sound into more of binaural audio, giving greater depth in sinimatics or battles.

For longer description, it may be good to pause the game and describe it, like entering a new location, or a colossus and its surroundings. Then, gameplay can resume and narration can go back to normal. Perhaps have a certain sound to denote long-description mode starting and ending.

Also, using sound effects for health bars can cut down on having to speak as much.

For example, say you're starting out a fight in Mortal Kombat. The health bar is at the right side of the screen, so play a sound in the right ear. Opponent hits player one, so play the health bar sound slightly closer to the center than before. You strike out in revenge with a special attack, and another, distinct sound plays 80% at the right. Really, its showing health bars and such in an audio form. For meters, there could be a sliding sound, at the left end for player one, and the right end for player two. This may get a little tricky to balance, but it should turn out to be a great, enjoyable audio experience.

One more bit of advice, look at audio games. See how the highest quality games do things. Look at mush-Z.com to see, what is basically, an audio MMORPG, and how they do progress bars. , ",,,1,0,0,

It wreaked havoc on my body and immune system, but long story short, it left me with corneal scarring and zero tear production (scarred tear glands and ducts). Since then, I have used preservative-free eyedrops daily (literally use a box/day) and have to use mineral oil/petrolatum ointment at night. I tried autologous serum drops a couple of years ago, but they were just too expensive ($400 for a 6 week supply and not covered by insurance) and didn’t really help curb my existing eyedrop usage. I’m with you on them being a pain in the butt to store, as well. I had to travel around with ice packs in a YETI thermos just to leave the house. 

The SJS/TEN basically threw me into an autoimmune storm, so I’m currently on prednisone and methotrexate to keep my corneas from melting again, among other autoimmune issues. With the myriad problems SJS/TEN left me with, I really feel like the lack of tear production is one of the most challenging physical issues I’m dealing with. It affects EVERYTHING I do. And is stupidly expensive to treat, too. The drops I use are mineral oil based and cost about $20-25/box out of pocket, as again, insurance won’t cover them since they’re OTC. Last year I spent around $7k for the drops alone. 

Are you using any other drops in conjunction with your serum drops?  If so, do you mind me asking which ones are working for you? I’ve tried a ton of different ones, but they all seem to get sticky when they run down my face and end up irritating/chafing my skin. 

I am so sorry you’ve had to deal with no tears your entire life. I feel your pain and know that it sucks, big time. Also, I’m not sure if you’ve tried it, but when I traveled via plane a couple of years ago, I had my corneal specialist write a letter/prescription for me to present to TSA stating my specific medical needs for my drops (and in your case, the required dry ice/cooler set up). I was terrified that they would fight me on having to bring so many boxes of drops in my carry-on luggage, since I can’t be without them for any length of time, but they just read it and sent me on my way. Hopefully something like that might ease your travels, too.

My state, CT, paid for multiple canes until I was happy, gave me training, and at any point I can just call them and have them bring me out a new cane if I decide I need a longer or shorter cane. Generally shorter, like under your pecs up to your collarbones, is about where you should start as you get used to proper cane use. As you can walk faster, you can move up to longer ones, and I personally like mine about to my chin, but some people have canes up to their nostrils or eyebrows because they walk very fast. I'm not about that life, under my chin is plenty.

Basically, you use your cane to find obstacles and make sure you don't walk into them, so the faster you're moving, the longer your cane needs to be to give you advanced warning. If you walk slow, a longer cane just mostly gets in the way.

I personally like 4 piece canes, any more than that and it becomes unweildy and awkward IMO, and I like the marshmallow tip.

First of all, being VI, I think there are *some* visual aspects of the movie that you're getting. Second, even if you were *completely blind*, there are still other things in movies like music, plot, dialogue, and characters that you can enjoy. Finally, even if none of that was true, friends don't ignore their friends, and by doing that to you they're being colossal  bags of dicks.

I think one way to get this across may be something like, ""Even though I can't see the movie the way you do, I still want to enjoy what we're watching because I want to enjoy our time together. It's hard to enjoy our time together when I am feeling ignored. I'd rather be included in the decision making process than have it decided for me.

There are many accessible forms of entertainment which are normally thought of as heavily visual. Many popular movies and TV shows have what's called an ""audio description"" option, where a narrator describes what is happening visually in between existing dialogue. 

[Here's an example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7j4_aP8dWA)

So for me, having in depth characer descriptions, and an overview of the area we're in when it's first entered would be nice.  Like as example, if there's an RPG and you're in a new map, describe what you can see of the map.  When a character is introduced, describe how they look.  In cutscenes, I think handling them like audio described movies and TV are handled would be the best way to go (look on netflix, or iTunes and turn on audio description for good ideas) but don't talk during the cutscenes, and just let them play out.

For one thing, when I start, it just plays this music. I sat there thinking it was the intro for a couple minutes before I decided to try and tap around the screen and realized I had been on the main menu the whole time. You need to start with something saying ""Please turn off your screen reader, you are now at the main menu swipe up and down to scroll through options and double tap to select"" or something like that. Also, when the guy is telling you to tilt your phone right or left he should tell you how to hold the phone in the first place because if your holding it straight up and down your not going to tilt it the way the app wants. Also, I noticed that at least in the beginning you can only use the controls when it vibrates and makes a sound. It would be nice if the voice explained that so you don't end up doing what he says before the app is ready for your input, then you're just frustrated because you did what the app said but it didn't work. That at least I was able to figure out though. After I crawled through the air vent it started playing that music again without any prompting on what to do. Once again I waited a little bit and finally tapped around on the screen and it went to the next thing. The problem is the voice's instructions were complicated and went by quick, all I heard was listen for the beep and tilt your phone around until it gets longer to put in the code, or something like that. Also, you should change that to say listen for the click because if you're telling people to listen for a beep and that sound you're using I think most people wouldn't describe as a beep, they'll just be waiting there.

We were thinking that the lack of sight is such a big sensory hole that anything that might help fill it would be welcome.
But we do understand that things that don't work well can be more frustrating than helpful.


Your answers already brought up a problem we should have considered: the tone in the ear would indeed conflict with the need to really hear the environment, but it was an important part in our ""fast scanning"" plan.  
It would allow the user to detect distance-discontinuity (like a step/object) by a jump in the pitch that would not be discernible if it was a vibrator on the wrist (instead of the tone).


Maybe we should explain better.  The plan is to point the sensor towards the area of interest (let's say down-forward) and rotate it like you might a narrow-beam flashlight if you were looking for something on the ground.  As long as the ground was flat, you would hear something like a siren with the pitch going up and down continuously. If a step or other object was ""scanned/pointed-at"" there would be a ""step"" in the pitch of the sound too.  Even a 5% pitch-step might be discernible.  But a 5% change in vibration level would not be noticed.


If we have to use vibration instead of tone, we're thinking that we might have to implement a ""step detector"" in the device that would ""notice"" the distance ""step"" and vibrate somehow differently; maybe extra hard; when such step is detected.  However this would not be as good as a finely tuned ear that could probably tell a lot about the nature of the obstacle after getting used to the device.


Thoughts?  Maybe dual mode: vibration in general with a tone mode for fast-environment ""mapping""? Eh?",,,1,0,0,

&amp;#x200B;

First of, you can open most of the bottles vape juice comes in. When you remove the top cap of the bottle the drip cap can be removed to reveal a larger opening in the bottle; most people use a sharp knife which can be put between the drip cap and the bottle and then twisted to pop of the cap. Note!: be careful twisting the knife with too much force, it might break and launch metal fragments which are especially dangerous to... some specific parts of the human body. This is the easiest way I have found to open the typical 10ml bottles. This technique works on most other types of juice bottles as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the following suggestion for filling your tank; use a toothpick to ""feel out"" how low your tank is.  You could open your tank every so often (easy to do with the pico, just push the cap to reveal the small opening) and put in the pick straight down whilst holding the pico as level as you can. Pull out the toothpick and slide your fingertip down the toothpick, the moment you feel oil marks the amount of oil you have left. You might want to keep a tissue handy to wipe of your fingertip and the toothpick.

&amp;#x200B;

In time you would get better at predicting how full your tank is. I would suggest not letting the liquid decline to less than say 20% from entirely empty to prevent yourself from burning and thereby killing your coils. You could ask someone to let you feel how far the toothpick should be covered if there is about 20% left in the tank.

&amp;#x200B;

In regard to filling up your tank; if you can find a bottle with a fine enough drip cap you can actually push the drip cap a bit inside the opening of your tank. Have someone help you get a feel for how much a single squeeze of the bottle will fill about half to 75% your tank, this way you can safely fill it up when you know there is about 20-25% left. If it turns out toothpicks are to porous and absorb the liquid making it hard to feel how far it was submerged you might want to opt for a different material stick; perhaps a plastic one or a paperclip.

&amp;#x200B;

An alternative would be to buy many little plastic 10ml refill bottles (in Europe you can buy them, including good drip cap for less than a euro each) and have someone prepare a bunch of those, each filled with about 70% of the total volume of your tank.

Most of the people who are blind will be using a screenreader to access the web and get to your page from the very beginning. There is no need for an additional voice assistant when the web content/application is properly built and formatted- the screenreader is already the voice assistant, and already known and familiar to the user, so there is no need for learning additional controls either.

As others have pointed out, there is much that can be done, but it is primarily on the design and construction of the web application/page/content. I also agree and especially encourage you to start with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the World Wide Web Consortium ([https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)) and then do some user testing with the free NVDA screen reader ([https://www.nvaccess.org/](https://www.nvaccess.org/)). Some studying will be required to learn NVDA, but it is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to address the user experience of being blind or visually impaired. It can also show you new ways of approaching web content, from a semantic point of view...

ee3bded6-bbcc-4b04-8508-53da4683a20d,1550720717,"I had the same situation, though a different eye condition. 

I felt somewhat insecure about my eye as a teenager, but i got lucky in that long emo hair was a fad when i was in high school, so i could push my hair over to cover that eye. It was silly, but fashionable. Ha 

When i was 19, i started to get skull splitting headaches. Doctors determined that my eye was shrinking due to atrophy and that i might consider having it removed. 

After some time thinking it over, i decided to go through with it. It made sense in my situation, so i can't recommend it for you. However, i can say that having a full sized prosthetic definitely improved the symmetry of my face and i got noticeably more dates in college after i got it. 

It's been nine years now and ironically people think that the remaining authentic eye is worse looking than the prosthetic. One day I'll probably do the same with that eye. I don't regret it, but that's to be expected since the original eye was causing a lot of pain. 

Just to set the record straight, though, not all prosthetic eyes are glass nor are they spherical. 
Cringe warning. If you're squeamish, probably skip the next paragraph describing the surgery. You were warned. 

During the surgery, a spherical implant was placed in my eye socket and the muscles surrounding the eye ball were wrapped around it. The implant kind of resembled a whiffle ball if i remember correctly. Anyways, the muscles were wrapped around it so that the prosthetic eye could have some movement and look completely natural. 

The prosthetic itself looks like a sea shell. It lays on top of the implant and faces out. The doctor who made the prosthetic is actually an artist and he meticulously painted a replica of my remaining eye so that they would match. He took a ton of care to get the color, size, and even placement of visible blood vessels just right. It was rreally impressive. It was covered in this super glossy plastic material and its really light. I can't speak to actual glass eyes, but mine has never even come close to popping out accidentally. It's too light for anything like that. 

Cleaning it is a breeze and it takes about as long as brushing your teeth. Also, it doesn't have to be done daily. Your eyes are a very clean part of your body. They are naturally cleaned by the body. As long as you have working tear ducts, eye lids, and eye lashes, not much debris is getting in there. I only have to clean mine once every couple of months and even that is pretty frequent according to my doctor. 



There you go. Now you have the other side of the story. Only you know what's right for you and the best thing you can do is be informed on the facts. 

By the way, if it's not your eye that people stare at, it's a cow lick or toothpaste on your shirt, or some other mundane thing. Try not to worry about it so much. People just stare, but that doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Think of it this way, they might be staring because they think you're attractive. You never know. Just do you and don't give it so much weight. ",,,2,0,0,

People would be hostile towards a different tribe or religion. Look at the recent incident that happened in Novemember when that tribe attacked and killed the Christian missionary - they did that for survival reasons. I guess when people were exploring the world and mingling with other groups, they were passing on diseases and other things. Early humans weren’t known to have common sense so maybe they thought when a fellow member of their group died from a disease that they thought was some sort of witchcraft after they made contact with a person whose skin colour was different and wore different clothes and beliefs, they may had a sense of hostility to that group that they assume deliberately killed them. This isn’t a theory or anything, and I would love to nail down some research on this and if and how racism evolved, but this makes the most sense to me. Eventually racism just became this ugly hatred for other races that they perceived as inferior to them. As well, if you think about it, you can link it as what connects us to the other earthlings. Cats are hostile to neighbouring cats entering their territory. Racism is just another form of this behaviour from a different species. Another question is - does alien life have racism?

We moved from an institutional and sterilization model where we basically got rid of people who were different to a model where we educated,  but in different settings without the same expectations of achievement. We had sight saving classes where any remaining vision use was discouraged and punished. Now we have laws in place that are supposed to prevent discrimination based on disability,  that are supposed to grant equal access to the least restrictive environment in schools, and theoretically mean people with visual impairment have the same access as everyone else to things like jobs and services.  In practice though... that's not true.  Laws may be catching up with where they should be,  but public perception is taking a longer time to let go of their preconceived notions about what blindness means. There are still many people who will expect less of someone with a visual impairment or think they need more help.  I have teachers who correct my students with visual impairments for getting close to things.  Some people think my students don't belong in school with their friends.  We've certainly changed as a society in 200 years,  but those old beliefs and values still linger through prejudice.

I personally find the white cane laws confusing.

You can't guarantee that they have seen you,  that the other lane has stopped,  or that someone won't try to pass on the berm and hit you anyway.  Still,  people with visual impairments fought hard for those laws.  You'd probably get your head bit off by trying to change them,  even if they are contradictory.

This coupled with the fact that I raise guide dog puppies means I get my fair share of unwanted conversations,  albeit in a different context. I've got two stories that help shape my perspective on the matter.  
The first is when I was out at the mall with a 12 year old student who had recently lost a lot of vision.  We finally had to force the issue of cane use because he wasn't safe or independent without it.  So here we are in public with his cane and he's kind of having a good time.  We're dropping into the Apple store when a total stranger stops ME to ask, ""Excuse me. Is that boy with the stick blind?"" I responded that he was visually impaired and tried to scoot away,  but not before this man could say,  ""Oh. That's so sad.  I'll pray for him."" Fuck that guy! This kid was feeling very small and insecure and awful about his change in vision.  I've worked so hard to help him accept himself,  and here is this asshole telling my student that it's sad that he exists.  My personal default is to be nice,  but that doesn't mean my student has to pick that same default.  I wish he would have yelled at this guy, or told him off. That guy hurt my student more than he ever could have realized by trying to be sensitive. 
The second student was an adult female adjusting to vision loss with all the strength of a tiger. She shared with me an instance in which she was in a not great part of town with her cane and she could hear someone following her. She called out, but no one responded.  They continued to follow her.  Finally she yelled aggressively as she whipped around,  swinging her cane wide.  They stopped following her. She felt guilty about doing this,  and was asking for feedback. 
I think neither student was wrong.  We can only react to unwanted interactions in the way which works best for us.  I don't think rudeness should be off the table if someone is not listening to you when you want to be left alone.  Sometimes it ends the conversation more quickly.  ",,,3,0,0,

So here is what I came up with: I also added just a tactile marker to the liberal policy cards which solves that problem nicely. The second part requires that everyone at the table has their phone with them. Everyone always does anyways lol. I have also added a single tactile marker to each fascist card and two tactile markers to the Hitler card, so I know my identity from the start. We do the whole intro sequence as normal, where fascists open their eyes and look around. After we complete the sequence, everyone at the table will text me. What they will text me is based on my identity and their own identity. For example, if I am a fascist, then my other fascist friend will text me and identify themselves as a fascist as well as tell me who is Hitler. Meanwhile everyone else at the table will send me a blank text or just some nonsense or a funny phrase or something. If I am a liberal than everyone just texts me nonsense. And if I am Hitler, then it is the same result as if I were a liberal. This system works for resistance as well, but not for Avalon expansion characters. The whole thing only adds about 30 seconds or less to the opening of the game and it only takes a couple games before it becomes a routine for everyone in the group. It's a very quick work around and allows someone VI to jump right into the game with minimal extra steps or setup. It also does not tip anyone any extra information about someone's possible identity, which is always a concern when trying to come up with VI friendly game modifications. Earbuds are also helpful to make sure no one else at the table hears my texts, but not a necessity. Let me know if you have any thoughts or possible variations on this system.",,,1,0,0,

Adding braille name, title, email and phone number is a cool idea, but probably only if you know ahead of time that you are going to be handing them out to a high percentage of VI people.

I was born with my visual impairment. I could never imagine losing my vision completely tho. I don't really know what kind of impairment I've got, but I usually describe it like this.

I can see enough to play some video games. My right eye's better than my left, so I mostly use that when I can.

Just so you know, everyone has something they struggle with in life, including me. the second half of 2018 was a disaster for me, since I'm about to finish up my sound engineering course this year, and don't really know where to continue my adventure. I know exactly how it feels to vent about issues, which seem to be a small obstacle for a sighted person, and a mountain climb for me.

One thing I've started doing now is to lower my bar a bit, so I can achieve my desired goals. For example, instead of aiming for my dream job as a radio DJ, my goal has been to just ask someone in the industry, how it would work out for me. It was a pain to ask the first time, but now it feels so much better. A school I want to apply to even began asking me about my visual impairment, so I guess that's a step in the right direction.

Just make sure you enjoy the small things in life, and I bet you'l feel so much better soon enough.

When it comes to night clubs I see my experience as some kind of drug. I haven't actually tested any, but I imagine that I probably would feel the base pump through my body and get that awesome feeling of having fun. Feeling the base, combined with all the lights I can see makes me feel so happy inside, mixed with a responsible amount of drinks of course. 

Most of my friends are very responsible, even when they're drunk, so I've never had to worry about being left out.

 I remember one time, when I went with some friends to a night club and a security guard wanted to throw me out, because he thought I was sleeping, when I just went to sit down for a moment. When all my friends went out smoking, I followed them out and began crying, because everything felt so hopeless. almost every girl I knew in that smoking area came up to me and gave me a group hug, and some of them located that guard and forced him to apologize to me. That was one of the best, and worst times of my life.

7716495d-928e-4a54-9274-1028888036f6,1549524291,"Speaking as someone who was born blind, this is not a blindness problem. Granted I wouldn't know you if I tripped and fell over you, but depending how much attention you call to the fact you're losing your sight and are clearly having a difficult time with it, that might very well be doing more to turn people off than actually losing your sight.

With the exception of a couple years in high school because I wanted to try something new, I'm entirely educated in public school. I went to college. I'm employed, and not for one of the half a billion blindness organisations that seem to think they're the cure to everything that ails us. While I know plenty of blind people, in person and online, most of whom have also had more than a few years functioning in a sighted world, I've quite a few sighted friends as well. I've had girls who would have dated me were I not already in a relationship. I've had girls I've had a thing with when I wasn't in a relationship.

The trick is not to make your blindness the focus. Yeah, it's there. You're not going to be able to ignore it. The people who are going to want to focus almost entirely on your blindness wouldn't do you any favours if you could somehow get them past that anyway--those people almost never fully get past that. The people who are less likely to want to put the spotlight on your disability are going to be turned off when you put the spotlight on your disability for them. Hell, maybe you spend half the first date playing 20 questions about your blindness because they're curious. Awesome. Wonderful. They've gotten it out of their system, you've hopefully been able to teach them something, and it probably won't come up in any meaningful way again. And the upshot there is you'll get to a point where there's not a question in the universe they could ask you that you haven't been asked at least a hundred times already, which will make dispensing with all of that pretty straightforward if you're you.

As for your current dilemma, I think what we have here is a case of grass is always greener. There's nothing wrong with having multiple sexual partners before you've hit 30 (unless you're female, apparently, at which point they have names for that), but there's nothing saying it's a requirement either. The people who openly aspire to have multiple sexual partners tend to be the kind of people who get themselves into situations easily avoided by using the other head to think for 5 seconds.

Also, and this cannot be stressed enough, certain surprises are perfectly fine on the first date. Learning that you have a disability when they see you is not one such surprise. Ideally, you'll have at least approached the subject before you've met them, at least if you're doing the Tinder/OkCupid thing. As u/Marconius pointed out, that alone takes care of a majority of the people for whom your disability will actually pose an issue without you possibly helping it along.

Beyond that, relax. Be you. If you're not coming off as completely freaked out about your blindness, there's less of a chance your potential partner will be freaked out because of your blindness. It's a fact of life, and you're not changing it no matter how many times they or you wish you could. Either they accept it, just like you have to, or they make room for someone who will. Presumedly your wife has accepted it, so it's possible. Hell, ask her what did it for her if you're curious. That might also provide you with an answer or two that we can't.",,,1,0,0,

Also and semi-related, having a can-do attitude is never a bad thing. I don't overcompensate that I know of, but I can tell you this much.

I live in a state with one blind school and, after my parents were told I would go blind before I was old enough to start school, they were told to find me a blind school instead of putting me in public schools.  I ended up not going blind, but I guess I assumed for a long time that all blind kids were not accepted in regular schools based on what my parents had been told.  I've recently started a braille transcriber certification course and am learning a lot not only about braille, but also about how blindness can affect people, but I have a lot to learn, I'm sure.  I have discovered that braille equipment is expensive and often difficult to acquire and have read that the fact that there is not better infrastructure for braille leads many individuals who may otherwise be capable to choose not to learn it.

When I was a kid, my mom had cancer.  Her leg was amputated and she was bald from chemo.  There were many times people stared or commented.  On one occasion, I had told my daycare/preschool friends about her wooden leg, and when my mom came to pick me up, they all wanted to knock on her wooden leg.  Of course, curious children sometimes take it too far and they all ended up knocking on her other leg just to compare.  She was great about it, but she was probably pretty bruised up after that.  On another occasion, a little girl smiled at her in the mall, but the mother panicked and started screaming at my mom for coming to the mall sick and risking everybody's lives.

The political people actually single me out for not asking because I am blind. There was actually one petition I thought about signing but I couldn’t because after I asked the guy what it was and said okay I wouldn’t mind signing he made a fuss about me not being able to sign. And then left saying he didn’t have time. All he had to do was show me where. I don’t usually need a signature guide if I can block the spot off with my other fingers. But he left so I was like erm. Okay. I only got hold of that guy because he asked my friend but not me, so I asked him. Probably for the better because I don’t agree at all with the state and their politics at all.


So my advice have you tried being assertive to those people. Not rude not frustrated but assertive and instructive. I have a bit of a commanding personality naturally. Natural leader type of deal so it’s very easy to assert myself. And usually most of these people stop what they are doing and let me tell them how they can help me. I grab them or that I don’t need help.

LBPD and LAPd is not doing as well as I would really prefer them to do. There was a stabbing on the gold line in late November. The trains can be chaotic and interesting.

Gangs, homeless, and the like are really allowed to get on and accost the public, police presence isn’t very good, or frequent. Even the police tell you to put away your phone. I think they use to be better, but sadly they aren’t better these days. They need serious patrol and police action, but you’re not going to get it.

So I haven’t been taking the trains, especially after I heard about the stabbing that went on. I wasn’t there but I believe the guy wasn’t doing anything to encourage it.

I understand all that. And I usually don’t consider myself a very patient person at all. Haha! Very tough minded fast moving person. But this is how I look at it.

It is a opportunity to teach, to explain, to educate. If you are different I think I am different in many other ways then just blind, but I’ve learnt that you just have to explain yourself. Also information is interesting and everyone is different so information is helpful but not always the best. Blind people have different ways of doing things dealing with it, some independent and some incredibly incredibly sheltered and even after their family dies off they’re not going to live a normal life. And some of these people don’t have any other disabilities.

But I do think there is already some but people meet you and so they want to know right there and then. They don’t want to search up the internet for blind people and information. So they ask. I say view it with a good nature and try to adapt.

I also think that some patience and humility is needed here. If you can prove it to these people that you are capable a lot of them will trust you I find even admire you or whatever the case is.

I share my solution on the first episode in the podcast, I am guessing you listened to Episode 0 which was the short introduction episode. Here's a [link to Episode 1](https://sightless.fun/podcast/episode-1-secret-hitler-and-helper-apps/).

I fully agree about cooperative games. I really enjoy Pandemic, so if you haven't played that I recommend checking it out. You should also check out Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, especially if you and your wife enjoy crime mysteries. It's a narrative / story game where you solve cases. Your wife can do the reading, while you can take notes and collaborate together to find the solution.

As for competitive games, you can try the following:

- Dice Forge - no hidden information, dice game where you collect resources to upgrade your dice (die faces are removable). Person with most victory points at the end wins.

- High Society - A great and fast auction, card game. You have 11 different money cards which can easily be marked (even if you don't know Braille, simple stickers or tape in card corners would be enough). 

- Colt  Express - if you play with 5-6 players, this is a very fun game. You are cowboys trying to rob a train. It has hidden informationi, but only 6 card types, so marking the cards is easy.

So basically you'll need to take the bottom section of the cane off, pull the string out as far as it can go (don't worry, it won't snap), then thread that string into the part you just removed until it goes all the way through.

It's fucking difficult to 'get out there' and find women to fuck (as a blind person), true. However that doesn't mean it's impossible. I'm totally blind and I've successfully done it.

People will judge you based on your disability. Yeah I know that we're blind and there's nothing actually wrong with us, but a ton of sighted folk either don't feel that way of feel uncomfortable taking ""responsibility"" for someone who is blind. You learn to get the fuck over it (it's a long, long process because it hurts, but it's definitely doable).

In regards to wanting more experiences, I understand your situation. Perhaps explore polyamory with your wife if she's comfortable with that? If you're not looking for commitment, try swinging.

At the end of the day, the people who matter will come into your life. The judgmental hoes who will fuck anybody besides somebody with a disability are irrelevant to you. Don't waste your time. Don't force anything. There are a lot of people in this world who will not judge you for being blind. They are the women you should treasure.",,,1,0,0,

My dear Ex knew I was blind from the start, no issues for her. She judged me based on my accomplishments and character, not my disability.

It can be incredibly discouraging sometimes, but try not letting the people who judge bring you down. There are billions of attractive humans in this world, I can guarantee you that the majority of the worthwhile ones are not stupid enough to judge you based on your disability.

I think it’s out of print there are not that many copies in circulation. I now own a copy. I don’t know why though.

I think you have got great advice here.

Start out with learning braille first grade 1 and then grade 2. Train your fingers not just your eyes. Learn how to use screen readers voice over on the iphone, voice over on the mac or else nvda or jaws on Pc.

Get a cane and use it learn how to use a cane. It’s easier to get a job if you have a degree as a blind person, but think about something you need to do without vision. There are jobs in the medical field you can do, probably not the one you are doing now, but it also doesn’t sound all that high paying. I know a few medical people are blind, I don’t know them personally but I know they exist. I knew a girl who was going for her md degree who was a blind woman. I heard about a blind doctor who did surgeries. I bet some forms of primary care isn’t too difficult to do if you have good screen reading. I am diabetic and when I go in the doctors just say hi, look at charts and graph and goes good or not good, you need less or more meds. And then you go away. So I imagine something like that is doable. Maybe looking in to a person’s throat may be harder but you may be able to get an assistant. I mean work is still possible if you want to work for it.

I don’t know if this has anything to do with blindness.


I was the same way. I am a naturally really outgoing active person. If you care ESTJ in the MBTI system. Thus my username. I also liked writing story or just making up my own. They were not that creative but at least it was something right. But I didn’t like reading. I liked running around, seeing how far this phone of ours stretched to, it went half way across my complex. It was amazing. Hahaha! Play with CDS invent my own paper toys. And I wasted so much braille paper to write my half page to one page stories.

I got bored and ran out of braille paper one day, and by that time I’ve been outside already. I was running pellmell around my house being really active. My mother made me read the Harry Potter books. I swear I hated the thing, and I hated my mum for making me read it. It was on tapes, red by Jim dale. I would get up after every chapter and complain how boring it was. Things changed after the sixth chapter and then I just read everything from that point on. In my teenage years I read Shakespeare and dickens for fun. I understood shakespeare well when my class was struggling. I had my r/iamverysmart moments trust me. Hahahahahahaha! I was reading nonfiction mostly in my late teens and do mostly that nowadays. Now I just do a bunch of research too. 

Back to when I was a kid, my favorite thing was when my parents were done reading to me, I demanded the book and I would pretend to read to them. I made up stories or stupid ones. But still.... hahaha! But yeah.

I touch the plate and eat like normal and I know what’s there. I am not afraid to be a bit tactile. I use my hand, and I just kind of explore a little, not for long. I also am a person super aware of her surroundings. Well, okay not as much as some people but I generally have a fair grasp. If someone came up and describe my plate in a clock like description maybe I’d be irritated. I am totally blind. Maybe I am more independent than others I guess. I have a good sense of where things are unless that restaurant serves food really unusually. It usually doesn’t happen.

Yeah, some places have braille menus but I just usually ask them to list general categories in a menu and ask what the food items is in that category. Then I eat like normal. And then ask for the bill. I tell them to please tell me the price. I pay my money and then leave.",,,2,0,0,

I don’t know if anyone of us can decide for you. If you just want a simple unfolded card than you will really have to pick and choose your content. Qr codes may not be that good then.

I think you're gonna love the ideas Ashley is cooking up in terms of the editing. Because we're completely forsaking a gameplay video it'll allow us to completely tailor the edit to an audio experience in ways I think you're gonna love. For example we wont need to pause the game to fit in narration, the narration is on a completely separate audio track from the gameplay which means that we can redub any parts of the narration that aren't clear or that have flubs, or that talk over important game audio. Not to mention we'll be able to play around a LOT with the game sounds as well to boost clarity on everything that is happening. We're already talking about boosting footstep sounds to make sure it's always clear when the player is walking or running and I'm sure we'll discover so many other way to improve the experience as we go.

I even have a few tarot decks and other things that'd be worth recognizing, if you need help testing. What's your strategy for getting card pictures into the app, without revealing your hand to an opponent by accident? That seems like it'd be tricky, but I like this concept. I'd say places like AppleVis, the app store, and maybe have it circulated to a few blindness mailing lists as well. I think there are a couple iphone and mac lists and a few lists for other screen readers. Also, if you get your ad in other games that blind people are playing, you might hit some that way. Talk to the people at appa11y and see what they're doing, for example. But definitely if you mention voiceover or talkback support in your store description you'll get a  few downloads just for doing that. I'm more likely to pay for an app that claims to be fully accessible than I'd be to chuck a few dollars at something, only to find out it's unusable.

You can get CBD gummies that don't need to be refrigerated, but they don't last as long as the oils. CBD might be hard to travel with, though, sadly. The best I could recommend in that case is see if you can get something from a Chinese herbalist or something like that. Often their methods are quite good.",,,1,0,0,

If it's something you've memorized, that'd be good as well. Start with that text at slow speed and pay attention to how the words sound. You're not looking for content, but how the synthesizer pronounces words that you know. Then speed the text up gradually until you can no longer understand what it's saying. Then slow it back down but this time not as slow as you'd started with. Just gradually inch the speech up a few words per minute at a time, over a period of a few days, or when you find the current rate is too slow. This is what I do when I encounter a new synthesizer. I find it works rather well. It's similar to learning music. The screen reader keystrokes just take a bit of getting used to, but it will help you if you are a good typist as well. I'd just spend a bit of time every day practicing the keystrokes from your screen reader. If you look for tutorials for tasks you need to do frequently, that's often a good place to start. You might also want to try different voices, as often the default one doesn't work for everyone. I'd recommend finding a voice that sounds pleasant, and that will make it easier to learn. Hopefully you won't end up in the situation that I find myself  in where I'm not a big fan of synthetic speech in general. If braille input was more reliable, I'd use that exclusively but I havnen't found a good place to put the braille display near the keyboard because I can't do the old trick of putting the display on top of the keyboard, because it has the perkins-style braille keyboard. I can type just as fast as I can braille, I just find it easier to type because contracted braille input seems to be still a bit buggy with NVDA. I'd try JAWS, but I'm not so sure that the $1500 CAD price tag would get me something that NVDA isn't currently doing. I'd be interested to hear what you're using, though, to help.",,,1,0,0,
0cd4c0e8-2697-42e3-ba6d-264b0ce8796b,1549027805,"I haven't had the chance to try these, but for serious reading I don't think it would work, due to the lack of routing buttons and on the Braille Me they don't even have 8 dot cells. I was going to get an Orbit Reader, but I was able to get the Brailliant BI 40 because someone in this sub recommended it, so thank you to whoever that was. I'm currently trying to get back into programming, if I can find some good tutors, and reading several large books, so this helps a lot. I have used smaller braille displays in the past (refreshabraille and a 20-cell braillex) but I wore out the access bar on the braillex from panning, and I fear that the same would happen to other smaller displays because you don't have a full line of braille, so you're constantly hitting pan right. It's very nice to have the full sized display. I think anything less than 40 cells is not so good for a lot of reading and anything larger is not portable, really. It'll be interesting to see if these multiline ones ever get produced. The Brailliant one is very portable, and is still 40 cells, but it's too expensive. At least the build quality is better than some others, but I still think there's a lot of  greed involved, considering the claim that piezo-electric cells are expensive really doesn't check out when you go pricing the build kits. Also if you read UEB, you'd definitely have to pan the hell out of a smaller display, as text eats a lot more space. I guess it depends how much, and for what, are you going to use braille. If you just need quick and dirty reads, then a small display with no routing buttons is fine, but if you'd prefer braille to speech for access in general, and you need a high quality crisp braille display, maybe something a bit more expensive would serve better. Big fat disclaimer, obviously you need a fat wallet or an agency with reasonable terms to make that work, and I realize both of those are in short supply. I didn't find APH reliable for service, but maybe the folks that make the Braille Me are better in that regard. I hope we can get low cost displays that don't make these ridiculous compromises at some point, because literacy is very important. You're further ahead with a tiny display than none at all, for sure, but I'd definitely send some feedback to all companies if you can, because the current state of braille is unacceptable, and I'm not sure how best to change that.",,,5,0,0,

One of the issues with using tones and sounds to indicates drop-offs is that it often interferes with listening for other important sound cues. For example, a drop-off curb is often near traffic, so listening to traffic, sound shadows (caused by bus shelters or other large objects) and other audio cues is important. A constant sound would be disruptive.

Most of the current generation of tools use haptics because it avoids the sound disruptions, but as you mentioned, it is also not as accurate. 

Another issue with a gadget isn't necessarily the cost (although cost is a major factor), but the fact it is *another* gadget. For most people that would use the device your propose, they would also need a cane (to locate drop-offs, obstacles, etc). So with one hand already taken up, a second device would take up the remaining free hand. Except people often use those hands to hold coffee, press buttons, open doors, feel for objects, etc. And even if that was in their pocket, it's another item to keep track of, to charge, etc.

One of the big reasons the iPhone was such a game changer was the fact it did *so many* things. For example, previous to the iPhone, if someone wanted to bring their colour identifier, their money identifier, their audio book device, their compass, their GPS and flashlight, they could literally fill a backpack full of stuff. But for many people, that was too much. By cramming everything into a single device, it made it much simpler to carry. For the device you are proposing, such things have been attempted to be integrated into a white cane, with limited success (mostly the cost), with the UltraCane being the best example. https://www.ultracane.com/",,,1,0,0,

They had breakfast items served in easy-to-use stations and sighted chefs were on hand to help out if requested. Never hurts to ask for help, and catered events and buffets generally always have staff on hand replenishing the food trays that can be asked.

Otherwise, I always go with someone sighted.

She has a good idea of what I like and I tell her some staples that I'm craving, and she comes back with a plate full of surprise items then describes it all to me before heading off to fill her own plate. We've found this method to be the safest and most efficient, as human guide through a crowded buffet whilst holding two plates of food can get treacherous, especially around oblivious people and children.

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1549773718,"First and foremost, use HTML 5 native  form controls. They are inherently accessible to most screen readers. Use the for=""id"" attribute on label elements to programmatically associate a label with a control like a radio button or text field. Don't use placeholder text. Mark required fields with asterisks and with the required attribute. 

Error handling is a major issue. If something is filled out incorrectly, do Not use only color to denote the errors. A modal/dialog box should pop up listing all the errors with a link to focus the cursor on the first field with an error. Make sure filling out an application has a review process allowing a user to go over and quickly and easily edit any incorrect info before submission, and build in a Reset button to clear the form. 

Use Aria as necessary, specifically aria-describedby in order to add usage hints to form controls if labeling and context isn't enough to explain their use. Using keyboards and standard screen reader navigation will be much faster and more accurate than using a voice assistant like Siri and Alexa. Make the whole form keyboard accessible and screen reader accessibility will follow suit since they are closely related. 

Hitting Tab should advance the user cleanly between each form control. Don't mess with the Tab order too much and keep controls logically grouped and in linear order in the DOM. Build it cleanly and then style it later with CSS. Use semantic structure like landmarks and headings appropriately to allow for quick form navigation if the form is longer and a little more complex. 

Allow users to save their progress or auto-save it with cookies so users don't have to go back and re-fill everything out if anything goes wrong. These tips are part of overall WCAG and will really help boost overall application accessibility and form submission.",,,5,0,0,

* Decent and consistent voicing of different characters when dialogue is text-based.
* Detailed descriptions of environment, game style (first person, isometric third person, etc.), grittiness, color palette, effects, and character descriptions. 
* Cut scenes should be described just like film and TV content. * Only do this after a direct playthrough so the describer has a good idea of the flow of the game and a good sense of what to describe that makes sense to further the understanding of the story and character arcs, that way it is an informed playthrough rather than trying to describe on the fly. 
* Keep game descriptions on point and don't approach this like just bantering about the game to some blind guy sitting behind you on the couch. Keep us active and in the know, don't get sidetracked with off-topic conversation. We want to be just as immersed in the game.
* Explain fighting mechanics, call out actions to ascribe them to sounds from the game so we can hear and understand what is going on later on. Useful in RPG fights. At least maintain continuing description during fights, don't go totally silent expecting us to remember every detail, we just like knowing what's going on. 
* Don't talk over key dialogue in the game when describing. Feel free to pause the game if something needs further explanation. 
* Be excited and into the games you are presenting to us.  Also don't assume that everyone listening to your descriptions has visual context. Referencing other games or likenesses doesn't always work especially for people who were born blind. 
* Weapon and item descriptions are nice, especially with upgrade mechanics that alter their look or style. 
* Game choice and playthrough style should dictate how you go about describing sections. Perhaps practicing a level, then recording a playthrough, then describing over that recording rather than trying to do it live. That will ensure the right things are called out and that the describer doesn't get distracted during the actual gameplay which detracts from the quality of the description. 

These are all critiques from past people who have attempted these playthroughs. Some were quite good, others were infuriatingly frustrating, especially when they were replaying a game that I had played before my vision loss and having them make a bunch of mistakes and describing with self-doubt tinging their description when doing it live.

She and I have been together for 4.5 years and we are in an open non-monogamous relationship. I was always in monogamous relationships when I had vision, but always felt wired for non-monogamy but never had the vocabulary or communication skills to fully quantify my feelings; and it really took losing my most treasured sense to open me up to who I really was. My primary partner introduced me to More Than Two and Opening Up, two fantastic books for this subject, and they really blew my mind.  Being non-monogamous has been amazing, allowing me to  explore with other play partners, opening up and discovering more experiences with new people,  while also having the support and stability of a loving primary partner at home.  She dates other people as well and we both fully know who we are seeing and playing with, plus we've really clicked well with communication, how to check-in and be vulnerable;  to just talk through any issues that arise and enjoy the compersion, or sharing in the hapiness that your partner is receiving from their other relationships. It sounds like opening up your marriage might be what you are looking for, and blindness doesn't even enter into that discussion at all. It comes down to trust, managing jealousy, having open and honest communication about needs and feelings, having clear rules and boundaries set up with your primary partner, and being willing to adapt and negotiate as new issues or experiences arise. 

I've had no trouble at all finding new play partners for the interests I'm into, mostly using OkCupid, Tinder, and a few websites and kik groups. I even wrote a blog about dating while blind, helping dispel any awkwardness for my sighted partners when we first meet for a date, etc.  Non-monogamy is not for everyone, and even bringing up the concept with a significant other can cause major trouble, especially with insecurity and managing communication.

There may be some interests you are into that your wife isn't into, and she may have interests that you might not be able to satisfy, and therefore being able to explore independently and non-exclusively would allow you both fuller satisfaction and then coming back together with a stronger bond.

There needs to be a lot of communication, have the ability to clearly discuss wants and needs, be vulnerable together, support each other, and be able to come to your terms with feelings that may arise when you are each out on a date with someone new. 

Honestly, I put it out there up-front that I'm fully blind. That's on my OkCupid profile, in Tinder, on FL, and anywhere else where I post and am actively seeking play partners.  Being able to communicate this up front and not make it a big deal to dates goes a long long way in making them comfortable. Being open and honest about being blind weeds out the people you mentioned, those that have no idea what to do and see it as a major hindrance. That is just a major waste of time, so weeding them out early really helps before heading out to meet.

You won't match with everyone, and you won't click with everyone you meet in person. Rejection is a huge part of dating, and dating itself is a job. You only get out of it what you put into it, so if you approach it scared and with low confidence, it will not go well. I find dating fun, meeting and potentially playing with new people, giving them joy and learning their stories, being absolutely crystal clear and up front about what I am seeking, what my boundaries are, and what rules my partner and I have set up. 

I guess I might be conventionally attractive? I have divots on my temples and sunken sunken-in eyes from the radiation I had for bilateral retinoblastoma when I was a kid, and never really considered what that did to the first physical impression people took of me when meeting for the first time. I've run into people who realize how much non-verbal and visual communication they do, people who find the accessible tech fascinating, who enjoy the fact that they don't need to wear makeup or primp for physical attraction, or don't have to clean up as much when I come over, and also people who meet me and then don't respond due to poor chemistry. It's work, and you have to just get out there and not let the disability define you.  I just go back to how I interacted with people when I had vision, and approach it as if the blindness is just one more aspect of myself that I can't control, like height, etc. It's there, I have my way of managing it, I quickly explain any help I need, demonstrate that I'm not some helpless creature, and carry on.

My partner is all kinds of awesome and didn't find the blindness to be a problem at all. When I go out to meet others, I usually meet at one of my favorite cafes in my City. I've been there so much I'm fully oriented to the space, so it's easy to meet people there, and am quite accustomed to taking public transit or Lyft to and from the location. I try to get offline as soon as possible since you really get nowhere with constant virtual back-and-forths with messaging.

I lost mine very suddenly 4.5 years ago when my retinal artery threw a stroke and occluded the blood supply. This happened after several surgeries with complications trying to fix some vision problems I was having and a retina reattachment surgery that didn't take. My eye just gave up one night and that was that. 

I was a hardcore gamer as well and am a major movie nut, plus I was an animator and VFX artist for TV, films, and commercials. Hyper visual is the term I use. All that went away in 30 minutes. 

Now, I play audio based games and accessible games on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. I make board games accessible using braille. I relearned how to code and now build accessible websites, test apps, and have become a serious accessibility advocate. My sighted girlfriend and I attend hockey games regularly where I listen to the action with a radio. Movies in the theatre and at home have audio description, as do some TV shows and all Netflix properties, plus Amazon and hulu are getting into that as well. I listen to audiobooks, attend storytelling events, go out to eat, and still do most of the things I used to do when I could see. It's a challenge and it takes hard work and adaptation, but there definitely is life after vision loss. 

The Department of Rehab helped me get back into working order, as did the Lighthouse for the Blind here in San Francisco. You have time to learn and adapt, to figure out something you can do career-wise through those and other resources. Learn braille, explore accessible technology such as screen magnification, inverting colors, and screen readers. Orientation and Mobility classes will teach you how to use a cane and navigate your surroundings independently, plus you can learn that even when you are not blind; they just blindfold you for the classes.  

When it happens, you will miss your vision. You will miss seeing things and participating in what you used to enjoy. That's all ok, as it's all part of the adaptation process, but you will find new things to do and new ways to enjoy the same things just with different senses. ",,,26,0,0,

When I go into a public restroom for the first time, if I'm by myself I tend to just explore with my cane, heading towards the walls to see what I find. If I get to the sinks, I'll use that as a starting point, then logically work my way around the room, searching for stalls or urinals. Soap dispensers are usually either on the sink or installed fairly close to the wall, so a little bit of explorative flailing will usually find it, and then dryers or hand towels are usually at the end of the vanity, so I'll explore towards the walls and closer to the restroom exit to try to find the drying options. Will make large sweeps to find the trash if it's not immediately under the towel dispenser.

While Christians are compelled by their beliefs to share the Gospel, the Bible quotes Jesus himself telling the Disciples that if their message isn't well received, to stop and move on. This lady is clearly forgetting that piece of Scripture.

As for evolution, I absolutely know it's true. I mean, we've got tons of evidence of it, and there's even Scripture that debates the seven 24-hour periods of Creation. Meaning, that the idea like ""Old Earth Creationism"" (believing that the world is millions of years old but still created under the direction of God) makes sense according to what the Bible says. I don't understand why so many Christians seem to be afraid of science. I certainly am not.

Some people in my church, or my younger son's preschool which is connected to a different church, want to pray for my son's eyes. I usually just shrug it off. I don't understand how someone who claims to believe a Bible that says we are ""fearfully and wonderfully made"" would try to pray away a certain aspect of how someone was born.

Anyways, I'm really sorry for your experiences and please know that the zealots you've encountered (because you hit the nail on the head with that word) aren't representative of what the Bible actually teaches.

I'm sure most of us have experienced the challenge of wanting to be independent, and realizing that doing so in the context of the relationships with the people around us, can require balance. We want to do everything, but there are times when we need help. My experience has shown that authentic conversation and introspective reflection can be the most helpful tools. When I feel as though someone close to me, usually my wife, isn't understanding why I'm struggling or reacting to a situation in an unexpected way, I explain. When it seems like people are treating me in ways that feel patronizing, or if they ask questions, I try to help them understand and feel comfortable. One thing that gets lost a lot of the time in these types of conversation, is that the sighted people around us have to feel as though they can have genuine interactions with us. Some people will do that naturally. Unfortunately, some won't. It's up to us to be clear about what we need and don't need from those around us, and be honest about our own capabilities and limitations.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, at work, I let my team know that seeing everything on the whiteboard is difficult. I take pictures of it with my phone, and take notes when I get back to my desk. At home, my wife knows that I can cook and do household chores, but I'm best at the ones that don't require much vision, such as taking out the trash and loading/unloading the dishwasher. When we have game night with friends, everyone knows that my turn may take slightly longer, as I read my cards under magnification. The highest compliment people ever pay me, is when they tell me they forget I'm visually impaired (legally blind). They don't really forget. Its just that my vision isn't a factor because I'm comfortable with who I am, and I want to do what I can to make others feel comfortable within the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

For short interactions with strangers, the same thing holds true. If a server in a restaurant starts acting weird about me walking through the restaurant or reading the menu, I just address it calmly. I might say something like, ""I can follow you to the table with no problem. I have a little vision."" or, ""My iPhone can magnify the menu. You can just give me a regular one."" Dropping a joke in there helps to lighten the mood. Once the stranger realizes I'm just a guy trying to live my life, they tend to relax and just focus on making our interaction the best it can be. I know everyone's situation is different, so please take my comment with an appropriately-sized grain of salt.",,,1,0,0,

For example: a coffee cup on the table in front of me is visible, while a coffee cup 20 feet away is too far for me to see. The other issue is contrast. If a white coffee mug sits against a white tile, I will not see it until I am very close, a lot of legally blind and visually impaired people need high contrast to identify items. 
  
The other thing is that even if there is a particularly large item, I still need to be close to determine any detail. An example of this would be a car. If a car is not directly in front of me the only details I could determine would be its colour and possibly the number of wheels, providing it is light out and there is contrast.

Anyway, do you want a cane to identify to others that you have low vision or do you need to get one to navigate? If you only need others to know then you should get an ID cane. They're much lighter and easier to carry.

If you need one to get around then you will need a mobility cane. If you don't know how to use one then it would be a good idea to get training. In the US each state will have their own agency for resources like these. There are also local and national organizations that can provide resources for blind and low vision people.

Good news is that canes are one of the few accessibility devices that aren't eye-wateringly expensive. My personal favourite canes are from Ambutech. They have exchangeable tips and conical joints that make them easy to fold and unfold. You can also pick different handle materials to reduce weight.

I don't know if this is a universal rule but my instructor taught me a cane should reach from the ground to the base of your armpit. Some people like them a little longer though if they walk fast. There are also lots of different tips to choose from: different materials, different shapes, different sizes, etc. Ambutech even has a tip that can flex. Hell, you can choose whether you want hook-on or screw-on tips from them. The other company I know of is Revolution. Their canes are all graphite with no aluminium bits anywhere so they're a bit lighter but you can't easily replace tips. Also graphite fibers can splinter off and they're sharp AF.

Hah we've all done this a time or two.

I don't remember what brand I have, but it was pretty cheap. When I was researching I found a similar one on Amazon for about $70. I ended up getting mine at a local brick and mortar store.

Things you'll want:

- a removable water tank she can tell how much water is in it by weight

- tactile buttons; no touch screens or capacitive buttons

- a steamer wand

Basic operation:

1. Check there's enough water, refill if necessary
2. Turn on the boiler
3. Load espresso ground coffee into basket and that into portafilter
4. Tamp down coffee
5. Attach the portafilter
6. Once the water is boiled, a light will come on and there should be a difference in sound - usually a click from the boiler turning off
7. Pull a shot by pressing the appropriate button. This can be timed, usually at around 20 seconds
8. Turn the boiler back on, possibly with a different button for the steamer node
9. Once again, wait for the boiler to stop
10. Get cold milk in a metal cup and raise it under the steamer wand so it's in the milk
11. Turn the steamer knob to steam the milk. I don't know how to check this is done without looking, but the while process is noisy and the noise changes depending on what's happening. A combination of practice, listening carefully and timing should work.
12. Poor the cream over the coffee
13. Enjoy!

I like the whole process (including grinding my own beans), but a lot of people don't.

There are Nespresso machines that make cappuccinos and they are *far* easier to use. You get the regular coffee pod and an extra cream pod. No frills, same result every time. You can get different flavors too.

The cost per cup is higher, but it's a lot more accessible.

I think that the reason why people are so insistent on the conversion side of things is because they simply do not want you to go to Hell. Additionally, people may be insistent on healing your blindness because a large portion of Jesus’s work in the Bible consisted of healing people of various ailments, and they then want to spread the faith so that you could potentially be healed. I experience joy in the practicing my faith as a Catholic Christian. However, I completely understand how many evangelization tactics are extremely problematic.

I had to take high doses at the beginning, and I am now at a lower dose. It is the job of the drug manufacturer and your medical team to make you aware of “potential” side effects. Similar to you, the medications scared me almost as much as my transplant. There are things to help manage the side effects. 

Watching your sodium intake can help with the fluid retention.

Meal prep and proportioned snacks can help with not over eating. This will help with the weight gain caused by an increased appetite. 

Creating a code word for you and your family/friends to use if the medication causes anger outbursts can help manage the joyful mood swings.

That part is by design. The dogs are trained to be ""working"" when their guide harnesses are on, so they can be regular dogs when they aren't working. In that context, they are subject to being trained better or worse, and it is okay to hold their owners responsible for their behavior.

Something is likely going on with the woman other than that one interaction you had. Mobility could be a major daily challenge for her and what you are seeing is the best she can do.

d0746cea-e74f-4cb6-bf10-abe83df8f974,1550362234,"Is this a real saying? I've never heard it.

Blind people do have spatial perception, and a blind person doesn't have to wait to hear. They can move around to note ambient sound changes, sense the immediate environment haptically with canes and feet and hands, and make sounds (the most striking example being Daniel Kish-style tongue click echolocation) to sample more distant features.

In an auditorily rich environment, the difference between light and sound speeds is not that biologically significant. Something visible 100 meters away will not have gone far in the 300 ms it takes the sound to reach you. There are some exceptions, e.g. traffic crossings, where it's harder to parse out traffic noise without the benefit of vision.

One could try real hard to make this saying apply by saying that auditory information is inherently temporal (a stream of pressure waves impacting the eardrum) and visual information is inherently spatial (photons refracted to distribute an image across the retina). But both vision and audition carry spatial and temporal information. Some spatial auditory acuity is higher in blind folks than sighted; some is deficient. Blind people can get very good at perceiving ultrafast speech (≥16 syllables/second) so that would be a faster perception of information, sort of the opposite of ""waiting to hear.""

Side note, I also find the saying fails on its face. If a blind person doesn't have as much time-resolved information, then how could they possibly be the ones to ""see in time""? And how would it follow that a sighted person is excluded from seeing in time and restricted to seeing in space? To me the saying wants to feel profound but, once you think about it for another few seconds, falls apart into superficial shreds at every level.",,,1,0,0,

If you wanted to dissect this more analytically, I would say that despite your cordial wording, the opener wasn't as polite or neutral as you intended. ""Why do you walk your dog without a harness"" is guaranteed to elicit a defensive reaction, especially with the followup of ""it puts people in danger."" Right there she's hearing that you are calling her a menace, and closes up. She didn't handle this well, but whatever else her issues, I'd guess that was part of her reaction. I can't condone or explain the subsequent screaming though.

Hard to tell if this is salvageable, but would it be worth it to try? ""Hey Ms. X, it's YourWelcomeOrMine from the first floor. I didn't mean to accuse you of anything the other day. When [Dog] is off harness, he sometimes [does specific behavior] and I wasn't sure if you were noticing that it's almost knocked a few people over. *[if necessary]* Of course I'm not saying you shouldn't walk your dogs, but in your position I'd want to know that. There are a few senior people living here that would be really hurt if they fell down. Can we figure something out?""

That may be optimistic. Given how your last conversation ended it's unlikely to make things worse, though. And it's not a situation either of you have to accept as is without at least trying.

Sorry, I should have clarified that I'm not blind myself but work in and with the blind community, so I don't want to overstep my experience. But I've seen blind colleagues give presentations, and I think all the ones I saw used Powerpoint. That's probably simply true because PowerPoint just has enormous market share overall, not due to some problem with Keynote.

I don't see a lot of intrinsic differences between Keynote and Powerpoint, though some people people will swear by one or the other. For familiarity reasons, I use Powerpoint since I have lots of practice with it, but when I've used Keynote it has seemed pretty intuitive. The file formats are also cross-convertible.

You're most interested in reading someone else's slides, not making your own, so if the instructor uses Powerpoint slides, you're best off using that program. Conversion often forces weird unintended shifts in formatting and so on. Advancing slides is pretty intuitive (just spacebar or arrow keys), and other commands would be intuitive like any other app.

One tip I would offer, if the prof has designed the slides in an organized fashion, is to export an outline from the presentation. It assembles the presentation title, slide titles, and slide text in an organized way that you can just paste into a text document. That might not get everything, but it's a pretty efficient way to study the main points of a presentation. Depends somewhat on the content, of course.

I think the important thing is that you're upfront about what you need from your friends. Especially if you don't always appear blind, they'll really need things spelled out very clearly when you tell them what you need. That's not to say you can't be of use to them too - many places let a blind person's helper in for free,  you might get better seats at venues etc, so use the strengths if the chances come up. 

We tend to host at home more than going out because we can control the environment.  We're also kinda tied up with a young child, so a different situation to you in that regard. 
Have you looked at any sort of summer camp, activity weekend for the blind? It might just help with some perspective. 

I don't know where you stand in terms of sighted help, but both my wife and I get some money from local government to employ eyes. We use them for driving us places, days out with our kid, I do theatre trips, visit friends who I can't easily get to etc. So forming some form of relationship with a person paid to do what you need may help sometime. 

I don't know how often the average person spends time away from home outside of work, would be interesting to find that, and see if we are much lower than average. ",,,2,0,0,

I was astonished at the stuff that wasn't being covered. IT, which is my field, was a bit of file management and word processing. The fact that I shop, bank, borrow books and magazines online, that I use technology for everything from independent travel to reading and managing my correspondence,  and basically that computers or phones have impacted so far into my day-to-day existence has changed the IT landscape for some of the students I work with.

That said,  school we did a time-measuring activity once where we count off a minute and have a friend see how accurate we were. I was always within 2 seconds of the 60, toward the upper end of my class.  But I was the only blind one there, making proper statistical analysis difficult. 

It is true that we have to react to auditory rather than visual signs. When watching comedy, I often find some amusement in things like slapstic but only if it's explained, never in realtime. By far I prefer wordplay or spoken comedy. 

I do find focus and attention interesting. A sighted person can receive an email - say an invoice - and announce the balance due within half a second.  as a braille  reader, it's very hard to process  in a way other than linear. ",,,3,0,0,
