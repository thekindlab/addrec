If your society doesn’t have brightly coloured paints, maybe they do have bright flowers that they could plant around buildings, to fill a similar purpose.

&gt;	•	Who specifically are you wanting to serve? (Who is the person who will love your site the most?).

The person I am targeting is someone who recently lost sight, and adult students in college. Those people maybe know how to use their remaining eyesight to serve the web, but they want to explore the web in more convenient and less straining to their eyes. If it is possible, I would make an appointment with them in my local library to learn how to type fast, help them if they have some questions about accessibility. 

The website will be mainly text based, and I will post different tools to use at home for people like us who are visually impaired/blind. I will also post YouTube links to watch for those who can. The website will be mainly educational and will consists anything accessibility related. 


&gt;What is the tone of your content? (Professional and distances, humorous, casual and hip, etc.).

The tone would be strictly professional, precisely because comedy is not my
strong suit. 

&gt;What specifically are you helping people do? (Pick up the technology in 30
minutes or less? Learn how to use the tech for careers? Start using the
computer after recent vision loss? Learn advanced techniques for
experienced users? Etc.)

I would focus, at least in the beginning,  how to use assistive technology and how people  use the tech  for their careers. I would refurbish some laptops and train people ( if they can’t afford it) how to install NVDA.


&gt;What are you providing on your site specifically? Why should people come
to your site instead of, say, Youtube? (What's the delight factor?).

That is really a good question. My hope is that they’ll come to my site to
learn more about techniques, or skills, that applies to us as blind/low vision
people. This website would be dedicated to educate people, and the site will
be an extension to the local training I would offer.

You technically still need numeric indicators before each SERIES of numbers in nemeth code. The advantage of Nemeth is in the ability to mix numbers and letters without having separate indicators for each change. This saves space in algebraic expressions.

Some braille users leave the initial numeric indicator off in nemeth as a kind of shorthand, but numbers will not be written that way by professional transcribers.",,,2,0,0,

There's also the Louis Database (louis.aph.org i think) where you can search ANY book title and see if its been brailled.

I was an extremely active, energetic, and adventurous child. I think that as a very young kid, like in preschool, kindergarten, maybe 1st grade, I had a para (a teacher assigned to working with me) at the very least watching me play outside. They didn't hover; I don't even have many memories of them getting involved. They let me interact with my friends and other kids as much as I liked to, which was a lot. I also spent before school and after school hours at a daycare where I was completely independent. I very quickly learned the lay of the land, both indoors and outdoors, and ran around and played at my leisure. I learned to recognize the sounds of different sections and follow voices of people around me. My friends were often with me to guide me if I really needed it, and the employees were very watchful of all of us, so I was never in danger. Yes; I ran into a lot of things. My mom threatened to start making me wear a helmet if I didn't learn to keep my hands out in front of me when I ran around like a wild child. I have quite a few bumps and bruises growing up, but I was never seriously injured and fully believe it taught me more than it hurt me. 

Sometimes I needed an introduction to an area. For example, we moved a lot as I grew up. Before we started moving boxes into the apartment or house, my mom would walk with me into it, alone, and have me trail (follow with a hand) along the walls and counters so I could get my bearings. 

Every blind child is going to be different. I was taught to believe that I could do nearly everything my sighted peers did, so I believed it myself. I participated in activities, sports, games, and most visual assignments. 

I was raised in the public school system and in all regular education classes. My mom considered putting me into a school for the blind for high school, but the suggestion was immediately shot down by my TVI (teacher of the visually impaired), case manager, and all of my school teachers. I think that the schools for the blind have their benefits, but I fully believe that i have been benefited by not attending one. I have interacted with primarily sighted kids my entire life, outside of online places, and my social skills are better for it. I would not suggest putting your child into a restrictive school. Introducing him to other blind kids when he's old enough to understand it is a great idea, but the education system of most of these schools is too tailored to one specific type of person, which would prevent him from growing into his full potential.


I am now a 21 year old college student. I have lived on my own, I'm looking into getting another apartment of my own, and I have been growing increasingly more grateful to my wonderful mom, who never, ever let my blindness inhibit me. She took me hiking, camping, skiing, rock climbing... everything she possibly could. There was no such thing, for her, as letting me sit out cause i was blind. She's truly the reason why I have become as confident as i have been in my capabilities.

You have got this. Your child has got this. You are going to be amazing, and so is your baby. My mom had no resources when I was a baby. She didn't really search them out. She followed her gut, and the guidance of my TVIs throughout school, and she did amazingly. You will, too. Your kid is going to have a full, enriched life. Trust yourself, and reach out if you ever need anything or have questions. You'll find hundreds... thousands of open ears.
I understand your fear, as much as I can without being in your position. I'd be scared, too, and I know what it's like to be blind. But everything is going to be ok. Maybe not always easy, but it's going to be ok. 
Please pm me if you ever want to. I wish you the absolute best of luck!

Once, while on salvia for example, I was feeling really anxious and disoriented because the world seemed as if it was falling away behind me at the speed of light, and I laid back on my bed, and pulled the quilt over me for comfort.

At the start of the school year, many students have started life in a new environment. Among these freshmen at the University of Tokyo this year was a female student from Wakayama City who lost her eyesight in both eyes at an early age. I followed a female student who overcame her disabilities and realized her dream. (Wakayama Broadcasting Station Reporter Zuiha Ide)

On April 12, an entrance ceremony for the University of Tokyo was held at Nippon Budokan in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. About 3100 new students attended, and one of them was a completely blind female student.

Toshika Sugata from Wakayama is 18 years old. At the age of 3, Sugata was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, which gradually narrows a person's field of vision, and now she has no eyesight. She studied hard and got into the University of Tokyo this spring. At the entrance ceremony, Sugata said, ""I am happy that I can learn at the school that I have longed for.""

At the recommendation of her parents and siblings, Sugata began attending a local music class at the age of two and a half. Gradually, she was attracted to the beautiful tone of the piano, and she started to seriously study piano from the age of five.

There is a song called ""Step by Step"" written and composed by Sugata when she was in the 6th grade of elementary school. The song was created with a feeling of gratitude for the music, and the lyrics describe Sugata's frank feelings at that time, saying, ""Thank you, God. Thank you for my nice ears."" With this song, Sugata won a national music festival featuring disabled people, and was later invited to an international music festival in South Korea.

At the music festival in South Korea, Sugata learned that her foreign classmates were speaking fluent English. She said that she felt frustrated because she could not communicate without an English interpreter.

She also realized the appeal of English as a tool to connect with people overseas, and came to think, ""I want to talk to many people using English."" After graduating from a school for the blind that she attended until junior high school, Sugata decided to go to a regular high school with an international exchange course.

When she entered high school, her biggest challenge was studying. It was necessary to ask volunteers from all over the country to help with supplementary materials such as reference books. She looked for volunteers herself and asked them to do braille translations by e-mail or phone, putting all her efforts into studying.

In high school, Sugata studied in three countries, including Britain, to improve her English. When she was in her first year of high school in Canada, she met a woman, originally from Pakistan, who hosted her.

The woman told Sugata, ""There are still many children in the world who cannot receive an education. Be a person who can contribute to the international community in the future, grateful for the opportunity to educate yourself.""

Sugata recalls that until she met this woman, she had seen only a limited part of Japan's educational environment and education for people with disabilities.

However, when she learned that there were many people in the world who couldn't receive an education due to conflict or economic reasons, she was inspired by the words of this woman, and she wanted to find a job that would help eliminate the educational gaps in the world.

After studying hard for 15 hours a day to realize her dream, she finally got her ticket into the University of Tokyo.

As her student life began, Sugata soon made friends with her natural outgoing personality. On the other hand, there were many things to learn in her new life. The University of Tokyo has a ""barrier-free support room"" to support students with disabilities.

The support room made a braille version of the ""Campus Map"" for Sugata. While touching the map, Sugata found out that there were many facilities she did not know about, and said with a smile, ""I'm excited"".

Also, when she entered university, she rented an apartment near the university and started living alone for the first time. It took her 15 minutes to walk to school from her home to the university, and she stayed positive and forward-looking, unfazed by an environment that was quite different from Wakayama.

In addition, compared to her high school days, university classes were becoming more specialized and difficult. Sugata did not want to be late, so she immersed herself in her special device for the visually impaired and textbooks and data translated into Braille by student volunteers, and kept working hard even during the interview for this article.

Sugata is always cheerful and positive, but her favorite expression is, ""When you think of a dream, invite it in."" No matter how big your dream is, never say ""impossible"", keep pursuing your dream, and your dream will surely come true if you keep trying. The way she explained this with a smile made quite an impression.

Sugata has had a distinguished academic record, winning music festivals in junior high school, studying in three countries in high school, and winning the best award in the ""High school English speech contest,"" but she never put on airs and always responded with a humble attitude.

Another thing that left a strong impression on me was Sugata's remark during the interview that ""I think my life has changed since I entered Seirin High School. I cannot thank enough my teachers and friends who supported me. I think I am who I am now because of the time I spent studying at Seirin High School.""

I felt that behind Sugata's achievements were not only her extraordinary efforts, but also the support of many people, her appreciation, and her gratitude. During the interview, I myself was also inspired by her words, ""Let's make an effort even if it's difficult."" Sugata has a dream ""to work for an international organization like UNESCO."" We hope her dream comes true. We are cheering for her.",,,1,0,0,

Your instructor will work with you to figure out what you need- like basic cane skills, familiarity with the public transit and walkable intersections between you and where you want to go, and then you'll work on it, they will teach you how to use the cane, basic walking around tips, and familiarize you with the routes you want to take.

Yeah, I can see how it would look weird to leave after 4 days. It was difficult to explain.

I did have a job as a web development teacher at a tertiary diploma place for 8 months prior to that job, and I managed really well there, vision was pretty much never an issue. I had to leave because the course I ran struggles to meet the required enrolment numbers sometimes. They only had Macs, and my coworkers and managers literally never made it seem like a big deal when I couldn’t see something. I saw my old role advertised there recently, went for the interview, and they grilled me about leaving my last job after 4 days, it was a tough set of questions to answer. They didn’t end up running the course again, and never heard from them again.

I think at the 4-day job, it was a combination of these repeated problems, managers saying to me “well we need someone who can actually do the job”, and the coworker who was supposed to get me up to speed sorta abandoned me and I was left there not really knowing what to do for a couple of days. The office felt really unwelcoming and depressing. I contacted an Employment Consultant from the Blind Foundation, he came over while I was there and basically told me that he can’t solve the issues I’m having, and it’s better to leave voluntarily instead of being fired. I left the next day.

I think half of the reason I left was because of the actual company. The other half would be my expectations being incorrect, lacking confidence, etc.

I was using a Linux VM, but even on a powerful new iMac, the performance was shit for getting things compiled.

We were developing embedded software, and there were constant issues with getting the hardware I was developing for to connect properly to the VM. The IO on the iMac was inadequate, and the networking complications of a VM made it really hard to get things working properly. I’d worked super hard and exhausted all the options I could think of. I think anxiety got the better of me and I stopped being able to think clearly, and combined with the Employment Consultant’s advice, I’d lost the confidence that I could do the job, and I ran.

The Mac’s zoom function is basically a requirement for me. I’ve used the alternatives on Windows and Linux, but they’re just nowhere near as good. It becomes tedious and frustrating to use a computer with anything else.

I’ve learnt since then to never really put any weight on anything Employment Consultants say. They’ve given me bad advice and they’ve ultimately wasted my time. I think I have to use that experience to readjust my expectations. I need to understand I won’t be up and running quickly if I want to avoid a repeat of last time. And I have to figure out how I can stay confident and stick with it, even with all of the challenges of new employment being amplified by vision issues.",,,1,0,0,

There has been some good advice here so let me add what I can to the stack.
I am totally blind, married with kids, went to public school, and have a decent job.
I did a sport in high school, went to college, go out to various places both independently and with other people etc.
Depending on the personality and other abilities of your child, they can AND SHOULD expect to live a happy and normal life.
There will be challenges, but the biggest one will be their own ideas of their own limitations.
Also, more as a parent than as just a blind person, remember that you just had an otherwise healthy and happy baby. Enjoy this time and enjoy just being with your partner and child for a while.
You have a lot of time to figure ,this stuff out and you don't have to be worrying about sending the baby off to college quite yet. You have time to get to know your baby and figure their capabilities out.
Believe it or not, a lot of this stuff will fall into place..

Best of luck ",,,4,0,0,

I have severe low vision with chunks of my life totally blind. My boy was born blind but after a number of surgeries and therapy has severe low vision. 

I was told that there was no chance I would have a child with an eye problem. Turns out medicine gets things wrong sometimes!

We were super scared and confused when it happened. Living through difficulties myself gave me an appreciation of the difficulties that would be coming for us. 

In my view - the big challenges that blind people face are:

1. Transport
2. Employment/education
3. Insurance
4. Friendships/relationships

Transport - when your child gets older they will have fairly limited locations they can live because (unless self driving is solved) they’ll need access to public transport to study, work and play. I am lucky that I live in Sydney with kind-of-ok transport but there are many places in Australia I can’t live because I would not be able to get to where I need to go. 

Employment/education - not sure about your country but unemployment rates are very high for low vision and blind. Vision Australia says it’s 60%. The key is to get help early with development, education, and career advice. 

Insurance - In Australia being disabled often means exclusion from insurance. This has implications for travel, family, business and such. It’s starting to have effects in medical insurance in Oz. The tip - get good advice from other families to avoid pitfalls. 

Friendships/relationships. These are obviously more challenging but attitudes are starting to change so who knows. 

Speaking personally - my life has been hard but I have enjoyed it. At the least it is an interesting story. I look forward to seeing what interesting story your child brings to the world. 

Good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes your kid is totally going to be able to play and I think it's very important to encourage that independence! That said, every kid is different. My work runs a summer camp for blind and visually impaired kids, and last year we rented a bouncy obstacle course, and there was one totally blind kid who shot through the 40 feet of obstacles in about 13 seconds. There was another kid who did have some vision, who took like three minutes to get through it.  But they all did it, they were all safe, and they all had a great time.

&amp;#x200B;

As for schools- its  going to depend a lot on your kiddo and your schools and where you live. If youre living in the US, your son should get Early Intervention starting pretty young, so by the time he's ready even to go to school, you'll have professionals in your life that you can talk to about what's best for your kid. (you will spend a LOT of time in IEP meetings!!) And it's good to note here- pay attention to who works for the school and who doesn't. My daughter's going into middle school, and has a TVI (teacher of the visually impaired) and a O+M (orientation and mobility specialist) that dont work FOR The school, they're contracted, and honestly, they are my daughter's biggest advocates because theyre not beholden to the school. Personally, we chose public school for now, knowing that we also have a school for the blind close by. We have been thinking about sending her there for high school, mostly for the much more intense ""expanded core curriculum"" skills, like how to take care of herself, that I wouldn't be able to teach her in an effective way.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not stupid to want you kids to have friends nearby! Friends are important. That said, as he gets older, you'll find that the friends being close isn't as important. All the kids have phones (and yes blind people can use smartphones- if you have an iphone, turn on voiceover and check it out! Also the app SeeingAI is amazing, but that is just for apple devices as well) and they'll all text and send each other videos on youtube and all that.

Remember! Always ask if the individual would like assistance and if they say yes always ask what type of assistance the individual would like. If they indicate human guide you can also ask them what side they’d like to be on. 

Have them run you through what they’d like you to do when going through narrow passageways (2 people can’t fit through side by side) or if you will be going up/down stairs.  There are proper modifications to human guide for each of these situations and the traveler can fill you in.

Without instruction in the concept, you are correct.

We do use a clock face with braille to teach about clocks. It does use the numeric indicator at each position. 

To answer your original question, would you make a visual aide with the letters a through j then aj, aa, ab on the face for a sighted person? If the answer is no, then you need numeric indicators.

They support and encourage parents and siblings to not be scared, and to let their kids grow as kids, bumping, falling, all the usual trial and error stuff. 
They'll offer plenty of positivity too and techniques to interact and teach.  I'm sure it's hard news initially, but your wee one will still have plenty of happiness. 
I think they'd be really supportive and answer any difficult questions or concerns.

I want to clarify. I'm not designing a new programming language specifically for the blind. I'm designing a new programming language and would like to be mindful of potential blind programmers and how I can make my language more accessible in any way I can.

One example is I've heard python coding may be more difficult because python uses indentation for structure and screen readers ignore leading indentation. If that syntax makes it harder for blind programmers, I'd like to know that and probably not do that with my language. If that's just fine for blind programmers, that's also good to know.

I have been campaigning in Australia to have our organisations lead by low vision and blind people rather than sighted people. 

As I said help is welcome. But well meaning sighted people have taken our organisations over.

This is important because the key organisations are paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year. For that some issues are addressed. But if we had self determination we could focus on fixing the Big Four which are:

1. Transport
2. Education/employment (&gt;60% unemployment in Aus)
3. Exclusion from insurance and superannuation
4. Relationships

In this context, sighted people make “well meaning” decisions but without lived experience there is no sense of urgency. I mean why is it ok we have over 60% unemployment in Oz for low vision and blind people? Why is it ok that banks are exempted from the Disability Discrimination Act (Australia) which results in exclusion from travel, business and other negative financial outcomes. Why haven’t we invested in research to help understand how to improve relationships for blind and low vision people?

Students are in a dilemma: they are doing things that they may be not interested in, yet they have to complete it for credits. Even though they are interested in something, the amount of coursework restricts the effort to put in one project. For me, it's difficult to say if I will continue to pay attention to accessibility of museum websites after I finish the project, but this project was chosen by myself, out of kind of interest. I did narrow my project topic to this specific one from a general ""accessibility and assistive technology"". I decided this topic after some desk research and pilot interviews.

I came here for help because I really have difficulty finding participants, and I'm glad for your replies. As a non-local student, I did not have a network to find VIP. After developing my research plan, I asked for help on Twitter and FaceBook, sent emails to some charity organisations and communities, yet only one of them replied me. It is miserable when you tried hard but you received no response. Anyway, I have had an interview with a participant thanks to that community, and it was really helpful. Interviews with stakeholders is far more effective than empathetic thinking, because the degree of empathy is limited.

An alternative of coursework for this course is to write a literature review, but as I have conducted an interview, I plan to use empathetic thinking myself to finish this project.

One show I actually appreciate (at least sometimes) is South Park. Jimmy, Timmy, Nathan and Mimsy ALL HAVE PERSONALITIES! Man, first show to depict a fourth grader with cerebral palsy as a total dick sometimes, and a fourth grader with down syndrome as an evil little fucker.

Good to know that transport and insurance will be ok. However I would check - blind and low vision people have very little political power. It’s easy for insurance companies to exclude us because - they can. Even within organisations that support blind and low vision in Australia - the sighted workers are protected by insurance where the blind and low vision have limited protection. My suggestion is to get good advice off others to avoid problems. 

Re relationships. There is no research on relationships that I’ve seen since the 80s, and that was a very different time. The main issues for kids are finding friends in the playground, hobbies, and non-verbal communication. Your local low vision/blind organisation can help with many of those. 

For teens and young adults it’s all about the relationships. Often this causes no problems but well meaning family members of sighted people may discourage relationships with low vision and blind for fear of burden and birth problems. 

For blind/low vision adults the main issues are also non-verbal comms, friendships, but also relationships, marriage, family and divorce.

For parents of kids with low vision there are impacts on careers, friendships (as time is taken away to support your child) and sometimes pressures on marriages. 

As far as I know, no one has undertaken scientific study of these issues and how to fix them. I’m working with a Sydney based team to start research in this area which I hope to help launch this year. As you can imagine it’s a very sensitive topic - which is why researchers have kept away from it. 

I know this sounds tough but - like me - your child will know no difference. With love and support your child can overcome these and become a very interesting person. 

Good luck!

I had to deal with various different database websites, most of which did not work well with screen readers. It is key for any library websites to be fully accessible with screen readers. Obviously, any physical materials I got, I would have to scan and run through optical character recognition software to get them into text. Almost all digital materials were in PDF, which is a horrible file format. I would usually run these through optical character recognition as well to get them into plain text. Sometimes the only way to get a digital material was as some document with DRM (Adobe digital editions, I’m looking at you), which made it very difficult to turn into text, but I would do crazy hacks to get around the DRM.

I had normal eye sight until the age of 7, then the genetic form of macular degeneration started taking effect and it has been slowly digressing ever since. things of course will be a little different when raising a blind child, but if you don't mind me saying a couple things about it. please don't shelter this child! I was lucky and am greatful that my mom didn't do that to me. so I was able to develop talents and skills because i was able to do what i wanted and try new things and had the support of my mom in doing so. I play drums and guitar and snowboard and rollerblade and love kayaking... I speak russian fluently and i Have traveled overseas 16 times and in 3 weeks will be 17 times. this is not me trying to brag or anything. but growing up and getting to see how some of the other blind kids were raised.... they had many fears in life that to me didn't make sense. and I suspect that those fears came from their parents being scared to let them do anything. so even though it may be difficult at times, don't worry! especially when this is all your child knows. but he will have interests and hobbies and talents and develop skills of his own. just be encouraging and not fearful.

I have had a friend since 3rd grade who has been blind since birth and he is awesome at music. You can give him any tone and he will tell you what note it is. He can even tell you what note your car engine is running in. once we were in the music store and one of the workers was playing guitar and was talking about the notes he was playing… my friend corrected him and said the real note it was… the guy tried to argue and say it was this note… my friend said “no it isn’t”.. lol… the guy got out a tuner and sure enough my friend was right and the worker was wrong and he was playing a guitar that was out of tune. Man I wish I could do that.

Anyway just love your child and give him all the support he needs and I am sure he will surprise you in many ways!:)

If you do want to spend money on something, maybe have a look at Dolphin Guide Connect, which is built mainly for elderly people losing vision. It's basically a suite of applications letting you do the most common things on a computer - read and write Email, browse the internet, read news feeds and newspapers, write and print out documents, read and listen to books, as well as play music. The menus are incredibly simple to use based around a task system. so they're presented kind of like a phone menu with prompts like ""To read your Email, press 1.

It's very possible to do even with 5% vision though it might depend on your condition.

You climb up big color coded rocks that don't move that you feel with your hands and feet. It helps to have someone call out where the next holds are for you, for example: ""Hey, you have a foothold to your right at about hip level"" but even sighted climbers like having holds called out for them.

All I have is a little bit of functional sight and the top left of my left eye which adds up to about 5% vision and I've been bouldering alone for a year-and-a-half now. I love it.

Is it a portrait, photo, or artist rendition?

I  spent my transitional summer between high school and college at a guide dog school, and launched into my freshman year with her by my side.  Working with a guide is simultaneously rewarding, liberating, occasionally frustrating and a lot of work. It is the complete opposite from working with a cane; instead of finding each obstacle, your guide does it’s absolute best to avoid them and often times you navigate so easily that you don’t even realize all the things around you that the dog is avoiding. You have to be very confident in O&amp;M skills for the most part in terms of being able to read traffic safely, navigate stairs and curbs, etc. 

In regards to college, do you plan to live on campus or commute? I lived on campus and this gave me the familiarity and space to take her on long walks around campus, explore new areas and generally increase my independence. Dogs are a lot of responsibility though, and you have to be able to manage the little every day tasks along with your schoolwork. These are things that will become habitual to you if you do get one, such as building in relieving times, finding the best feeding schedule for the both of you, and of course, going to the vet at least once a ear for annual checkups. (I’d like to add here that for the most part you are 100% financially responsible for the dog e.g. food and vet visits. However,  there are some schools that will assist with vet costs) With a dog, there is a noticeable increase in the amount of attention you will receive, in my opinion. People often stop me to ask about my guide, to ask if they can pet her, to comment on how they also have a dog, etc etc and honestly it gets tiring after a while but I do my best to ignore it. I find the benefits of having my girl out ways this inconvenience by a million. During classes, she slept right under or beside my desk and caused no problems, and the professors loved her or didn’t make any fuss about having her in class. Living in a dorm went well too, as I was lucky enough to have a suite where I had my own room and space for her to roam around if she liked.

By far the most clear and straightforward answer is to just use the number sign if at all possible.

There's another way to write numbers: Nemeth code, which is used for math. Numbers look like the same dot pattern but dropped by one dot, and then no number sign is required. Of course if you have nothing other than a single number at each position it'd be unclear whether it was dropped or not.

I know I can build something, I just don’t think I’m quite in the right headspace now. I’ve lost my motivation.

Eventually I was able to see again but it plateaued and I still have issues, I'm nightblind and the static gets in the way of seeing fast moving things, periphery, small things, and I have impaired 3D vision).

I played just fine. I wasn't able to see the spin, or where the ball was a lot of the time outside the point where it hit the other player's racket. But I still managed to even get better. Since I'd played over half my life at that point, seeing the time the ball hit the paddle and the way the paddle moved was enough. It even helped me since I was able to watch the other person and not be distracted by the ball.

I've since quit since I'm on a medication that makes it illegal to play without Olympic Committee approval, and I just didn't want to go through that process.

I am Red Green colorblind and my research is based on a problem that colorblind people have distinguishing a lot of colors in the grocery produce section with myself included.

I can try my best picking out a ripe banana without spots and instead pick out the greenest one out of the bunch. It is very difficult to receive what I intend to get without having assistance.

Instead, there was a department in the college that handled so-called *accommodations* for students with disabilities. In practice, these departments mostly served students with mental-related disabilities rather than physical or sensory disabilities. They had little experience handling the types of inaccessibility that someone with a visual impairment, for example, would come across. They never seemed to have anybody who could reliably scan, OCR, edit (many hours of boring but detailed work), and save in plain text all the materials I needed in a reasonable amount of time. I could honestly do a far better job at this conversion work and doing it myself allowed me to do research faster. Sometimes it would take me a week to get some material and process it myself, only to read it and find it useless except for a couple references. Turnaround time is important. 
Anything is better than PDF, but I personally think plain text and HTML are timeless, non-platform-specific formats that maximize accessibility and for archival purposes will definitely still work in 50 years.

I have a friend who is nearly fully blind, and she works as a federal employee. It takes awhile for new coworkers to even realize she is vision impaired because of all the tech she uses.  The key is helping your kid gain independence, social skills, and navigate finding work that works for him.

b7701663-ac9d-48f3-a415-759fa7bd74cc,1554219653,"So I believe that you've been receiving pretty decent responses, so a lot of the things that I'll say might just be reiterating some of them. I still wanted to go ahead and add my perspective as someone who was born totally blind and still lives that way:  

First, it's perfectly ok for you to be upset. You didn't expect this to happen, and I definitely understand how this--in some ways--might be a devastating result for you. But as others have said: I promise, promise it will all be absolutely fine. There are definitely moments in my life that having no vision can be frustrating or limiting, but conversely, I also feel that I've so far been living a very fulfilling one.  

It seems that people have already been doing a good job of reiterating this to you, but don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that just because your kid can't see doesn't mean that you should raise them any differently. I might even argue that maybe there even needs to be even more tough love in your parenting style--because you will need to do your best to make sure that your kid knows his capabilities for independence. My mother never, ever helped me accomplish a task unless I had at least tried to do it myself, and I honestly can't think her enough for that. By the time I was 6, I could prepare little meals for myself, clean the kitchen somewhat, was in gymnastics, and when I was 9 I almost skipped a grade--but none of that would have been possible if not for my mother's absolutely unwavering belief and certainty in my capabilities.  

Conversely, you will need to do your best to acknowledge your kids differences--in the multitude of ways that that might manifest. They are going to struggle with self-esteem and conditions of self-worth. They are probably going to face bullying at some point in their schooling. They are going to struggle with experimenting in their independence--what will that mean for them? How much help can or should they ask for? Their development as a person is definitely going to be shaped by their disability, and if there is something that I wish the people around me had been more conscious of, it's definitely that. Growing up, I was constantly told that the only things I'd never be able to do were drive a car and fly an airplane, and that's patently untrue; I wish that the people around me not only would have been more aware of my limitations, but more comfortable expressing them to me. There's nothing wrong with recognizing that.  

At the same time, I can't express the importance of raising your kid to be someone who will strive to test those limitations. Personally, I am so incredibly grateful to my support system for not sending me to a blind school--even though the one in my state is one of the best in the country, I believe that going to a public one really gave me the tools to interact with others. It also helped me learn how to be a self-advocate--a skill that definitely became more and more important as I went off to university; one thing that can be said for blind schools is that they are definitely more accommodating and receptive to one's needs, and while that can be an advantage in some ways, it doesn't prepare a blind student for the sort of experiences they will have to navigate in the real world.  

Lastly, and I'm sure you've already gathered this from others but: despite all of this confusion and hurdles to navigate and considerations to weigh, he's really just your kid, so just treat him like one. There are going to be people trying to tell you how to raise him--whether because they are ""blindness experts"" or your mother who can't believe that you're letting that poor little boy run around by himself like that! But really, you'll know what's best--trust in yourself. And you'll make mistakes, and he will too, and if he gets into sports, he'll probably bust a tooth or sprain something (both of these things have happened to me), and you'll probably feel bad about it, but all of this is just life. When it comes deep down to it, his life and the way you raise him doesn't have to be terribly different to anyone else's.  

I'm sending you the deepest love and support, and I can imagine that things probably still do seem daunting, but know that you have community here and around you as well. You don't have to take this journey by yourself! You've already done great by reaching out to the blind community here--please continue to do so if you have questions.

If they’re like they are in the US though, I would opt to send my kid to public school. There should be something in place to make sure they get the accommodations they need for public school, so no hopefully no worries there.

The thing about blind schools is, at least in the US, they tend to be sheltering. The kids have very mall class sizes, and don’t get as much social interaction with new people that they would in public school. A lot of the kids I’ve met coming out of a school for the blind have been years behind their public school peers, in terms of maturity, social skills, education, and preparedness for the world at large.

This is just my experience with the US schools for the blind though, it’s quite possible that the schools for the blind in Europe are better. I would visit and look around them and maybe try and do some research about them.",,,5,0,0,

As I'm sure you can imagine low vision and color blindness presents alot of challenges working on cars professionally. The first obstacle I ran into was getting my license luckily I was able to get a bioptic drivers license but the process took for fucking ever and by the time I got it I had already lost out on a couple jobs because of it. But I was able to find a job after I got my license and working in the field I've ran into alot of obstacles stuff like color coded wires, missing stuff on inspections because I just flat out couldn't see it and one that embarrass me alot is asking someone to double check jumper cables because not all of them are labelled positive and negative. But I ended up leaving the dealership I worked at for a multitude of reasons and got a job with my local county working on their fleet of vehicles thinking that I'd get good benifits and that theyd be fairly accomadating.

Where I used to live, I went to a tae kwon do school because I'd heard that the teacher believed that martial arts was for everyone. He had no trouble adapting things, but I found out quickly that he was an exception. When I moved here, I went to a local martial arts academy that offers muay thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and assumed they would just turn me down right away, but when I asked what they thought I should join, they told me to try the Jiu Jitsu class, saying that me being completely blind isn't a problem. I've been training there since August. My advice is to just bang on different doors, until you get someone perceptive. I got lucky, but there must be others, since even when I've gone to seminars with other teachers, I have no trouble once they figure out how I work. It happens that grappling sort of requires you to feel your way through it anyway, and all the training is done with a partner, so very often the instructor just uses me to demonstrate the technique. It turns out to work better than you'd expect. The TKD class was slightly more difficult because not being able to see incoming strikes, or how to move yourself around safely is tricky to learn, but I had a perceptive teacher and he was very good at helping me to become sensitive to a lot of things. So I'd say that you can make it work, you just need to be a lot persistent, and get a bit lucky in finding teachers that are willing to do things a bit differently. Just show up at different places and see what you run into. And once they agree to teach you, show up to as many classes as you can, because I have found that being a regular presence helps for some reason. And do your best not to get discouraged. The community tends to be quite encouraging, I have found, but it can be a bit rough when you start, because the learning curve is a bit steeper than for some other activities, but I quite enjoy it, and it'd be worth persisting until you find something.

What do you do about it?   Report what you can.   Don't expect results but be on the lookout for allies.   They're out there and can be a refuge.  Learn self defense.  You're not trying yo be Dare Devil, mind, but that little bit of self confidence or spatial awareness can mean a fall doesn't result in a cast.    Seek out clubs or groups with common interests in and out of school.   Often, we crips find a niche in groups of folks who've grown out of these behaviors.   It doesn't reduce the bullying but, again, a refuge from it can be a lifesaver.

Most importantly.  Persevere in your studies.   Your success will be how you leave them behind.   Plan a future that makes you joyful and go after it.  

My worst bullies are either in jail, under surveillance (one's an RSO) or living their lives doing whatever they're doing and I have no idea what that might be.  How freeing that is!

Life is good, about to go for a walk in this beautiful 17° weather, going to grab a coffee at the corner and take a stroll downtown
I think it does get easier, as I said in 1 of my previous comments, I and I find with my clients as well, struggled with more of the emotional aspects of vision loss than the logistics.
That is to say that I think the physical side of adapting to my blindness wasn't anything compared to the emotional changes I had to make.
Things like
how to approach women/people without being able to make eye contact
how to enter a store I'm not familiar with, how do I find the counter as well as gaining the confidence to ask for help
how do I cross the street when there is no audible signal and facing anxieties around unsafe travel conditions such as mounds of snow
how do I put my hand up in class to ask a question and facing the and certainty of not knowing if my name would be said when I was being called on. This was just an awkward thing in the beginning, now I'm so used to advocating for myself and confident that these uncertainties do not bother me nearly as much as they used to. I can't claim that all of the anxieties are gone but I would say that I think they are at a reasonable level considering the fact I'm navigating without site.

Work at it, it's a very good sign you're asking for help, reaching out is something we all need to do whether cited or not. You're going to need to get used to asking for help more often. This is fine. You will still have a meaningful life and be able to contribute if you wish.

You will only be bored if you choose to be. There are so so many things you can still do. Going out is just as fun. I love reading/listening to books and podcasts, going out and talking to friends or lying in bed listening to read it.

01e8566a-fe1f-4e02-a201-85383af3d1ef,1554492520,"&gt; Who specifically are you wanting to serve? (Who is the person who will love your site the most?). 
These are two completely different demographics (people), actually. 
Imagine a 70 year old construction worker who has just lost his vision and has only done very basic things on the computer like emailing grandchildren... 
vs. 
...someone who lost vision very young and has 15 years of experience with technology in a school situation and is skilled enough to have completed all the entrance work for college and take classes and keep up. 
These 2 people need very different things in assistance and tutorials. 


People I am hoping to serve are young people who are either in college or wanting to pursue higher education. It would be difficult for me to help the older folk. The person I am targeting would fall in the middle, not the 70 year guy, but not advanced computers either. Someone who is in the middle and knows little but needs that extra skills. 



&gt;Great. Having someone sit by your side is a great way to learn. And you don't need a website for this. What you really need is connections with the sources who would recommend you to your students. 
Remember a website sits and waits for someone to find it. People don't know your website exists yet. They don't know to search for your website in order to know about you. 

That is right, my website would pretty much serve as a supplementary resource after I’ve met the person in person. I thought the website would make me more “legit” for lack of better word.  

Where do you think I can get other links, I already have the library I visit. I can distribute brochures advertising the service in libraries. 

&gt;I love your mission here. I think it's great! Try to narrow your mission down to something that you can become known for. ""Anything accessibility related"" isn't even possible. You probably aren't going to include every piece of accessibility equipment with reviews or talk about accessibility coding standards or deal with how a VI senior manager can use accessibility equipment to navigate complex budgeting spreadsheets, right? 
Instead, focus on what you really, in your heart, are doing. For example: I help VI adults get up to speed on confidently using the internet and social media with assistive technology, for the very first time. 

You are right my mission is vague and broad. The narrower and precise my mission is, the more likely it is marketable and useful. The people are entry level employees who are new at assistive tech or beginners. 


&gt;When you say professional, do you mean very formal, like you would use on a job interview for a management job? Or do you mean that you will be factual but in a kind voice and using an everyday vocabulary? Or do you mean that you're talking as an expert and authority and they are the students who should not ask questions, just follow along? 
FYI: I'm asking this for a reason. Each one of these would influence a different website name. :-D 

That would be the second option; factual and I’ll be using everyday vocabulary. The tone would look like the one written in tutorials. 


&gt;AWESOME! I really love this. 
What type of careers would you help with? Is it... Someone who is in a loading dock situation and using proprietary software. Do you help with that? An accountant would also have very specific software. Are you helping them use assistive technology no matter what software they're using, or are you specializing in MS Word, for instance, or Chrome browser? 
When you say you'd refurbish laptops, it makes me think that these people you help can't afford their own or don't already own computers. Is that correct? 

I really appreciate for taking the time to ask me these questions, because these kind of questions would crystalize exactly who is my target student or client. To be honest, I have to think about what class of people I am trying to reach. My initial thinking was to target the beginner, someone who doesn’t know how to use screen readers, knows little bit of accessibility software in the market, doesn’t know about braille note takers, can’t read websites through screen readers.  

Yes, people who don’t own their own computers, but own a computer but doesn’t know how to navigate the web through speech. 


&gt;I think this last sentence where you talk about it being an extension of the local training is a great reason to come to your site! 
This could be the continuing education part of your work or where you provide additional resources to complement what you've taught (like workbooks) or even where they come for help and you could have a community where they ask questions. 
Which one seems most interesting to you?

I would lean on the side of the website being a supplementary resource. The reason I want to start this kind of project is that where I live (the states) when I went to college, it seemed as if professors haven’t met any visually impaired person before in their classes. So, my thinking was this website would serve a supplementary resource for student who fined themselves in a similar position.

So I'm trying to be as accurate and faithful as possible on every account.

Interesting, so your brain would process certain objects, but would just omit unfamiliar or can't remember what you saw before? That's quite spooky if you were in somewhere really new to you. So is this your brain not having the object permanence, or that your vision is affected with blurriness or just ""objects being missing""?  

However, my blind character doesn't have any faculties to her eyes whatsoever: she's completely blind from her Optic Nerve Hypoplasia. Her hearing hasn't been affected from ONH as having loss of hearing can be a symptom of ONH.

bf9834b7-fe84-40ba-bd99-5cd965966913,1555668075,"Hi there,

Something no one is probably going to tell you. It's okay for you to grieve. You didn't know this was going to happen and everyone is probably going to tell you to be strong and that it's not very good for your children to know that you haven't excepted them the way they are. The thing is, you most likely have but you are dealing with an unexpected situation. My mum read a piece talking about how it was supposed to be a trip to Italy but you landed in Holland. I don't know where to find this piece but she talks about it when talking to other people about the first days of having learned that I was blind. I think it is called welcome to Holland but I'm not sure.

One of the first things I would suggest is to get yourself some counselling from someone who understands. Get some grief counselling or also some help from someone in the field of vision impairment and blindness. 

Teach your child all the little things. If he wants to learn to cook with you, teach him. If he wants to do the dishes, stand him up on a stool and show him how. He might take longer but it will be something he can do later in life. Make sure that things are in places where he knows where they are if he needs to find things later in life. Even a little bit further away from where it was a person won't find it as easily. 

Something I see is very important. Educate your child about his body and his physical responses. Tell him the proper names for all of his body parts and explain about consent and people are only allowed to touch you if you have given them permission. Of course, hospital stays will be a different problem altogether. Make sure that when the time comes, your child has access to blind friendly sexual education. It is really scary when you have no idea what to expect because everyone else has seen everything and you have no clue what is coming up.

Okay, I think this has been a very long post but I hope it is helpful to you. Please let us know how things go with your little one. Best regards.",,,1,0,0,

I've been to the same specialist in MI and he's really good, but since I don't live there I've bounced around a lot of them in my area (which is Southern California). And have found a really good retina specialist who works at UCLA. His name is Colin A. McCannel if you wanted to look him up. But as for any advice, you really can't do much about it other than regular visits to a specialist. There isn't any preemptive stuff you can do with it really. The most I could do when I was a kid was just tell my mom whenever I saw something weird, when something changed in my vision. But there were a couple times when it was out of my line of sight and the only way we caught it was because my doctor saw it when I went in for my visit. I believe usually, when children are diagnosed with it, it shows signs within 10 years or so. I doubt you'll have problems until she's able to talk. And when she can, be sure to let her know how important it is to tell you about any changes.

As for my vision, my left eye is legally blind, but I can still see the peripherals on the left and bottom. My right eye is a-okay. So it does the heavy lifting when it comes to sight and my brain has figured out how to see with only my right eye yet still use the peripherals on my left. However, because my right eye is basically essential, it has to be watched really closely by my doctor and whenever anything seems a little off we correct it right away, with laser surgery or possibly something more drastic.

There is a chance that nothing will end up happening to your daughter, I believe it's something like 41% of people diagnosed have the mild version of it, which means there will be no vision loss or any other symptoms. So lets hope for that.

If, god forbid, she does end up having symptoms and it isn't the mild form, you're definitely gonna be in for the long haul. I've had quite a lot of surgeries, somewhere near 15 or so on my eyes, all ranging in risk. Anywhere from laser which takes like 20 seconds, to Cryotherapy (which hurts quite a bit) and takes a few hours. But for the past few years I've been pretty stable and my doctor says there's a good chance I'm done with all the problems, so yay.

Hope I helped at least a little bit, and I also hope your daughter is alright. Sorry for the long ass message.",,,2,0,0,

If someone is asking this question, the answer is probably yes.

&gt; Where does training take place?

I’m not familiar with the system across the pond, but I’d guess you’ll probably start around the neighborhood or something.  Your instructor might ask for your input about where you want to train.

&gt; How long does training take

I got about 20-30 hours of training total.  Most of that was just supervised practice.

&gt; What if family/friends make fun of me?

It might be awkward at first, but they’ll get over it.  Educate people about what it is and why you need to use it.  You don’t have to put up with people calling your cane a “stick” or challenging if you really need it, so correct them when necessary.  The hardest part of learning to use a cane for me was getting over my self-consciousness about using it.

&gt; Is this the right age to learn?

no you hadn't previously messaged me after my original reply.
To answer your questions:
I was born with partial vision. It is a hereditary condition pass for my mother to me and my sister. It is called optic nerve atrophy plus.
It resulted in my losing vision during my early years and when I was 17 I had a rather abrupt loss which brought me down to almost no vision at all. On top of that I have the neurologic effects of the condition which result in spasticity in my legs. So as well as the vision loss I have difficulty with balance and a little loss of mobility.

I totally travel around independently. If you learn the skills of getting around without site you will be set. Take the orientation and mobility skills lessons when you are offered them. If they will start training you before you lose all your vision that's great to. You can learn proper cane technique. ""Proper"" cane technique will help you get off the ground then you can adapt it to what works best for you.
I'll tell you a little bit about my morning. As I believe I said in my previous post I attend a large university. I had an appointment there this morning that I had totally forgotten about. I was not sure if it was scheduled for 9:00 AM or 9:30 AM. I woke up at 740 and realized I would be late if I decided to take the bus. So I quickly showered and cleaned up a little around my place as I have people coming over later. I live in a condo so I went in the hall locked my door and grabbed an elevator to the main floor. I booked an Uber on my iPhone ""the app is fully accessible using voiceover."" I waited outside with my beats on pumping vertical horizon into my ears. I hadn't turn my phone off so it updated me on how many minutes my Uber was away. When it said it was 1 minute away I walked out the front door grabbed the handrail and went down the steps. A car pulled up and I said who are you waiting for. They said my name I knew that the car was parked directly in front of me so I just grabbed out and found the handle, I had to fumble around a bit but that's all haha 
anyway I got to my appointment early. I had 15 minutes so I went downstairs and grabbed some timms. I had been shown previously how the lineup in this Tim Hortons works so I went into the Tim Hortons the way I had been shown previously. I have done it so many times now it is just automatic. I found the end of the line I tapped someone's shoe with my cane and knew I was there ""sometimes if I'm not sure I will face where I think the person is and ask is this the end of the line."" Anyway so I waited in line for a while and I could follow the people in front of me from the sound of their steps ""if it's not their steps then I followed the sound of people talking or I will have to ask, not a huge deal you get so used to it. I got my large ice With a shot of espresso and my farmers wrap with sausage. I felt my way over across the Tim Hortons where I know there is kind of a bar. I stood there and ate my food as I did not have too long of a time until my appointment. After I ate I wasn't exactly sure where garbage was so I packed the garbage up and shoved it into a pocket ""where my meeting was I know where the garbage can is there so I used that. I still had a lot of icecap so I carried that to the elevators. I went up the elevators, most of them have braille in this university, accessibility is a really big thing now in the major universities and colleges. I went up the elevator and tapped my way down the hall until I reached the reception area ""the reception area is at the end of a long narrow hall which there are offices along, I know I've reached reception when I hear people on the keyboards and stuff but also I can tell when the wall opens up on my right. I found my way over to the desk and told them I had appointment with so and so for counselling. They said okay sounds good take a seat. I said which seats are available while I was turning around, the seat is right behind reception so I usually just turn around and go straight forward while asking the people at reception if the chair is free. If the one right in front of me is not they will say slightly to the left or the right. If I didn't feel comfortable with this I would ask and say could you show me which one. ""You just have to get used to asking for help sometimes, it won't have to be all the time. I sat down for a few minutes then was called in for my appointment. I tapped my way to word where I know the offices are. I know how many office doors down my counsellors is, two doors down from the left. I had a great appointment. Went back to reception to make a follow-up and then doubled back to where the elevators were. I had to go to the washroom and I know it's conveniently located to the right of the elevators 2 doors down. I went to the bathroom and met a buddy while in their washing my hands. We exchanged numbers because he sounded like a cool guy, ""we were in the disability Centre so he was telling me that he works for the alliance of something something, can't remember hahaha he is in sociology though and sounded like an interesting dude.
I decided I had enough time to take the bus, I know several ways where I can walk to the University bus system. I walked to the bus and stood at the front of the queue where all the buses must stop. I chatted with an older gentleman who says he sees me there often, so I asked him what bus he was taking. He was taking the same one is me and said he would let me know when our bus was there ""this isn't entirely necessary anymore because as of a few years ago our buses call the bus number out every time the door opens, but it was a nice gesture on the part of the man. So I took the bus home. It stops a few blocks away from my place. 1 of the 1st things I learned before and as I moved in was the location of the place making sure that I knew the way from the bus stop. So I'm home now and have plans to meet a friend for coffee around 230. I live downtown so I only have to walk about 3 blocks up. I will need to cross the street. All of the streets I am crossing have audible indicators, so when I press and hold the button to cross the street for 3 seconds it will either chirp or beep depending on which way it is safe to cross. This is very cool and I have no hesitation in crossing the streets anymore since I know them fairly well. I will meet this friend at 230, we are both blind. After we have coffee we will walk down the street 7 blocks to a place we were previously employed, we have evening meeting there. But before we get to the 7th block I will stop at the 5th block and tell her to carry on and I will meet her in a few minutes. There is a weed shop we will be passing across the street that I want to visit and see what it's like in there. I will pop my nose in and say hello or listen a 2nd to see if I can hear where the caches. If not I will ask someone where the cash is and I will go up there and ask them to tell me what the store is like and what kind of strains do they offer and will I be able to buy a glass pipe there.
I also might pick up a gram of a nice Indica for tonight.
After attending my meeting at work I will either walk home or take the bus partway and walk the rest of the way. It's starting to get warmer here, just a little wet out.

I am so excited about the weather getting nicer out. I'm taking 2 summer courses which are intensive so I only will be able work part-time. I was employed last summer at an agency that involves disability as well as lots of work relevant to my field of study.
Is going to be pretty cool because 2 of my buddies are taking the same course as me in May and June. I'm taking a biology course and a natural disasters course which is online.
The online course will hopefully be 100% accessible for me on the computer. ""I use a program called NVDA on my laptop, stands for nonvisual desktop access
it reads things out to you that are on the computer screen. You click on buttons/links via the keyboard by 1st finding the link or button via some kind of key command and pressing enter to click on it.
So I will need to make sure that it is accessible. It not being accessible means it might not be able to read certain things out to me that are on the screen. Pretty quickly I know or anyone in general can sense if an application is inaccessible because you will have difficulty moving around the screen and receiving feedback via the voice talking to you when tapping away at your keyboard.
I would say my life is pretty average. I enjoy the things I do and don't feel limited most of the time. 
The place where I feel the most restricted is school. I function well with academics and the style of learning our professors provide.
There is a Centre for students with disabilities that I use to get my books translated into e text which is easily read aloud via my screen reader on my laptop.
Sometimes this centre that helps with accommodations is not quick to respond. ""You must really be your own advocate and speak up if something's not working, most common example is students not receiving their textbooks in a reasonable amount of time.

I hope this wasn't too boring lol my day-to-day life contains all of these elements. Busing, meeting up for coffee with friends, walking downtown is nice, smoking a joint while listening to a good book or comedy. Attending lectures, asking prof's questions when I'm particularly interested in a subject up for discussion. Meeting and talking to nice acquaintances in my classes.

1. Lack of headings or landmarks before important info, or overuse of headings at improper levels. As a great example of this, I recently found a CNN article with a level 1 heading for the article, 32 related articles under level 3 headings, and then the start of the text, with nothing before it. This forced me to choose between scrolling through every heading or going to the last one and hoping it would get me where I needed to be. Things like &lt;main&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; are also helpful.
2. Don't make unlabelled bits of text and stick an onclick event on them. This can often cause problems, and it takes away information such as seeing which item is selected in a list of possible options. It also makes it way more likely that dropdown menus won't populate their contents right below the button that opens them. This kind of thing is where Aria roles can come in handy if you really do need to use a regular &lt;span&gt; or similar.
2.5. Clicking something on one part of the page shouldn't cause another part to silently populate itself with something new. If you have to do this and can't find a way to make the content show up after the button, perhaps consider a pop-up dialog box that keeps focus inside it until the user chooses the right option.
3. Something important to the page content should never be an image with no text label. (I know this is probably an obvious one, but I have to include it here.)

6e2571d7-7e7c-4458-8ac7-e3eb28d7ef90,1554624576,"Firstly, congratulations.
Secondly, it is really encouraging to see parents like you on Reddit asking questions. I think you've gotten a lot of information at this point, and most of it somehow manages not to be conflicting. But I wanted to add some of my own and a bit of personal experience on the way.
I have been to both public and blind schools. Personally, I think blind school comes with many benefits but you will be severely limiting his expectations of himself, his social life, and his ability to advocate if you send him to one. At best, it will be a perfect utopia where he only interacts with people he can relate to because they're all blind, and where everything is accessible so he doesn't have to learn how to speak up and tell others what he needs (and thus, you won't either for that part of his life). At worst, he might not graduate with a diploma or receive a proper education. Blind schools have the target audience of students who can't be easily educated in the public system, and that is simply not true for him. It is going to be harder, and sometimes the teachers will resist you or tell him he can't do something, and sometimes even the professionals who are supposed to know how to work with a blind child will limit him, but all of that would be worse at almost any blind school. More importantly, he's not going to go to blind college. He will transition from a small school with all blind students, potentially sheltering staff, low expectations, and fully accessible materials, into a large campus where he is essentially on his own and held to the same standards as everyone else. (Sure; disability services is there, but mostly to bridge the gap with inaccessible materials and exams; he has to recognize a problem and speak up about it before they step in.)
That said, I think it is important that he interact with blind people sometimes. One of my most memorable experiences in early childhood was meeting other people who also couldn't see. They are the reason I learned technology at such a young age, and I think many of them helped encourage me to be more independent simply by existing and going about their lives. There are probably summer camps and local chapters of various blindness organizations near you.

As for travel, he will absolutely be able to play outside and travel independently. I grew up in a remote area, and the school district still somehow managed to find a specialist. One of the most valuable skills I think a blind person can learn, (and one many of them have not learned because of bad instruction), is what many of us call ""structured discovery""-- in other words, learning how to navigate new and unfamiliar areas based on sound and exploration. Many orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) specialists will simply teach the student how to walk to new places without really getting them to examine their surroundings, except perhaps at street crossings. This lack of emphasis on using your surroundings to navigate will make the student dependent on the instructor to find every new place, and make it much harder to recover from getting lost. It may seem like a small thing to some people reading this, but I think it is absolutely essential and something I will always wish I had started learning earlier in life.

My mother found a comfortable middle ground where she didn't always force me to participate if I didn't want to, but more often than not she would push me into something I wasn't entirely certain I could do. She did her research well considering I was born pre-google, and she found a network of parents of blind children, blind professionals, and others who could help her strike that balance. At the same time, I can't recall a single time she told me I couldn't do something. Sometimes she was visibly nervous, but she let me make mistakes, run into things, and eventually learn not to make those mistakes. She stuck up for me when school staff tried to put me with the mentally impaired kids, take me out of class for something the teacher wasn't comfortable adapting, or restrict me more than the other students. She made sure I had the best and earliest Braille and travel instruction possible. I would not have believed myself capable of everything I do now if she hadn't supported me and helped make it happen when I was too young to make those choices myself.
There are going to be many people who tell him he can't do something. Your job as a parent is to decide whether that's true and crush those ideas before they worm their way into his head. Your unwavering support might possibly be the most valuable thing you can give him. You will let him make mistakes, and sometimes he will make them, and sometimes he'll be a stubborn kid who just doesn't want to do something. If he is capable of learning, letting him off the hook will just teach him that he is less capable; that his family thinks he is less capable; and that he can get away with not doing things even when he's capable. Essentially, it spells the difference between forming his identity as either a blind person or just a person who happens to be blind.

I know this might all sound like a lot—I kind of wrote a wall, but I hope some of this made sense and didn't come across as me trying to tell you how to parent. It is ok to grieve about it, but please don't let the fear control the way you parent. Reddit is probably the smallest community of blind people; there are Facebook groups, local and national blindness organizations, and countless other resources. You'll need to discriminate against the ones that don't encourage independence or offer support of some sort, but there is a lot for you. And if you decide you want none of it, he's still going to be fine.

I wish you the best of luck, and even though I'm surely not the first to offer this, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns or just thoughts. ",,,2,0,0,

It's the comfortable middle ground between surprising the employer and allowing them to say no to even that. They might develop some assumptions in the meantime if they're not the type to do their homework, but those assumptions can be put to rest. Often, the more important and more difficult question is how to put the employer at ease. I think walking in with the knowledge that you can do the job is a huge one. Get good at interviews; find a friend who is sighted and can be unbiased and arrange a mock-up if you have to. Remind yourself you can do this, frequently if necessary. Learn how to talk about being blind as though it's just a minor speedbump you have to get over once. Don't be afraid to draw a bit of extra attention by letting the employer know that it's okay to ask questions; they are either comfortable with you being blind or painfully aware of it, and no bad can come from inviting the questions after you've had a chance to talk about yourself as just another person, or if you feel like the interview is tense. Much of this knowledge comes from interacting with regular people and learning what does and doesn't make them comfortable. I think I'm a somewhat socially awkward person, I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves, I definitely don't naturally look interview-ready, and yet, people listen to me if I act like I know my stuff. I think this is because I don't let myself view blindness as a barrier, so I don't go in looking or sounding uncertain. Rejection can happen for a huge number of reasons. Some of those reasons will be incredibly shallow and misguided. Sometimes, we will have the power to change their minds.

1. Use headings, and use them well: There are too many sites which either have no headings, or have everything under an h1. There is nothing worse than a news site with a heading for the current article, 25 more same-level headings for related articles, and then an abrupt transition to the article itself without a heading or &lt;main&gt; in sight.
2. Alt-text on graphics with contextual meaning. Blank alt-text (alt="""") on decorative images.
3. Never use a regular piece of text for something that's clickable. If this is necessary for some reason, research aria roles. This causes countless problems. If it's a toggle, we usually can't tell if it's selected because it restyles itself rather than reporting its state. If it's a dropdown, items within the dropdown might appear on a different part of the page that makes sense visually but not at all in screen-reader land. Under certain conditions, we may not be able to properly click on it at all. There are very rarely reasons why something can't be a link or a button or a dropdown with the same onclick event.

HTML 5 and CSS were designed to focus exclusively on symantic meaning and visual style respectively, and I find there is often too much emphasis put on CSS to present that meaning, which leaves out anyone who can't see. The best thing developers can do is learn to think about what they're really designing. Don't ask yourself what it will look like when it's clicked until you can decide what type of control it is.

I am only a newbie developer, so if someone wants to come yell at me for getting something wrong, I would welcome the feedback.

Lastly, I like to remind people that there is a screen-reader built into modern operating systems now. Windows 10 (Narrator), Mac OS (VoiceOver), iOS (VoiceOver), and Android (Talkback) are accessible out of the box, and besides allowing us to buy a brand new device and set it up, it also allows developers to test their websites easily. Narrator is still rough around the edges, but it works with Edge and is gaining support for the Chromium engine in preparation for the switch.

6e2571d7-7e7c-4458-8ac7-e3eb28d7ef90,1554622139,"Hi,
First, thanks for caring.
NVDA has two modes with specific purposes.
Browse mode allows the user to arrow up and down through the entire page, and use navigation commands like pressing h for the next heading and k for the next link. This is what most people will use most of the time on webpages because it provides a virtual rendering of the page. The tab key works here, but other than that, none of the keyboard commands really correspond with normal windows commands.
Focus mode is what we use to navigate sites like Reddit which have their own keyboard commands built-in, or to fill out forms. In focus mode, we generally tab through the page, and the letters and arrow keys work normally, allowing us to fill in any text boxes or select things in lists. We don't expect NVDA to read every single thing on the page when tabbing through it, since browse mode will catch those things.
You can toggle these by pressing nvda+space (nvda being either insert or caps-lock depending on your settings). If you hear a high beep combined with what sounds like a key press, you're in focus mode. If you hear a lower beep with nothing else, you're in browse mode.
So, if the primary purpose of a page is not data entry (such as a registration form), the user is probably going to be navigating with browse mode, meaning they'll be arrowing through the page and having NVDA read its virtual render of everything. In that case, it's not really important for the tab key to read everything, though it's good practice to try and make the tab key at least move to and highlight every control that someone using only a keyboard might need to access.
I hope this helps; let me know if you have any other questions.",,,1,0,0,

I don't know very much about the other  accessibility settings on Fire OS. An iPad would definitely do what you want, and you could probably get an older used model that is comparable to the kindle devices. I am very biased toward iOS since I use it primarily, so don't rule out Kindle as an option.

If you choose to go the doctor route, you are almost guaranteed to be certified as having a ""print disability"", which qualifies you for things like Bookshare and NLS Bard. You could then use these on a tablet and have access to a huge selection of books in audio and text.

9bc4d41b-e0b7-424b-ba83-c470a076617e,1554214376,"Sure! The way it was explained to me is that infants learn a lot through context clues. 
A child with sight may be interacting with their mother and the mom may say,  ""Where did my glasses go?  Oh There they are!"" The mom may point to the table where the glasses are.   Even if the kid doesn't know what glasses are,  they learned from observing that those things might be glasses. The child without vision missed that. 
You want to give your child opportunities to make these connections too.  So let's say you are making a cup of tea. You are going to describe everything as you do it. 
""Mommy wants a cup of tea.  First I have to fill up the tea kettle from the sink.  Now I'm putting it on the stove. Opp! I hear the kettle whistling! That must mean the water is boiling and ready to make tea! I put my tea bag in the tea cup and pour hot water from the kettle. I have to be careful though.  I can see steam so I know it is very hot.  I better wait a few minutes before I drink from it.""
You won't have to talk this much during your child's entire life,  but the younger years is a lot of concept development and you don't want your child to miss out on that.  Assume that if he didn't hear it or get to put his hands on it that he missed it. 
If children aren't given these experiences a lot throughout their lives it can result in adults that don't know that dishes need washed, that your feet don't hang down like a carnival ride on airplanes,  or that the insides of apples are white,  not red.  Some of these things don't really matter in the long run, but you don't know yet what your child will want to do with their lives,  so the more info now,  the better.  It also helps cut down more on learned helplessness when your child knows more about what is happening in the world around him.  ",,,3,0,0,

First off, congratulations on your baby boy! Your house will be filled with so much joy from now on.   Make sure you take time with your family and friends to enjoy all the things your baby boy is doing and can do.  It's easy to get caught in a trap of feeling bad and down about the situation.  You need to grieve,  but you can't let that grief forever place limitations on your son.  He has the same potential to fly as high as any other child,  but he might need more support and tough love from you to make it happen.  
You will find very quickly that society will want to tell you and your son about all the things here cannot do.  Don't listen to that. 
Some random person decided one day to say that 80% of what we learn comes from visually observing others.  While the number hasn't been scientifically proven,  the amount we learn from watching others is quite high.  This means that our children with visual impairments are at risk of falling behind if we don't recognize what they need to learn and teach them in another way.  It does NOT mean your child is much more limited than anyone else in what he can learn.  He just has to do it in a different way. 
If there are three pieces of advice I could give you for the coming months it is to,  verbalize everything you are doing now and forever so that you're child learns what is happening beyond his sense of hearing and touch.  Set your expectations for your son high.  Other people will try to crush his dreams.  You don't have to be one of them.  Stay positive and practice saying yes to everything.  The only way your son will learn is with lots of hands on practice,  which means he will make lots of hands on mistakes.  Mistakes are wonderful mini lessons.

The dogs know how to do their job, but your time together training as a team is only just starting.  You will need to consistently reinforce your dog's training in order to make sure your dog continues to do its job.  The school will show you how to do that.  Make sure you do what they tell you to do.  
There are rules in place for a reason too. Many guide dogs are ruined by learning to jump up,  bark, lunge,  or beg for food.  That behavior can be learned at any time.  

Make sure your home is dog proof to help keep this behavior from developing.  Don't leave food out in spots that is easy for a dog to access or things that are fun to chew in places where you can't monitor the dog.  

Over time you will develop a great bond and learn which rules you can bend or break.  Some handlers let their dogs sleep in bed with them.  Others let their dogs be petted in harness.  Don't get too excited to break the rules too early because you can do irreparable damage.

An added bonus is that when pitched near the edge of camp, it can also act as a shoreline or boundary. I have gone out with others in hammocks, we pitch in a ring formation with a fire in the center. This gives everyone space, equal access to the fire, and a boundary so I can't get out of camp without some effort. As for cooking, I recently started using the Biolite Campstove 2, it's a small form factor stove that burns wood, so easy to find fuel. It's about the size of a small can of oats. It's also thermoelectric, meaning it uses the heat from the fire to charge an integrated battery, so I can charge my phone or tablet while I'm cooking. It also has an automated fan/blower that supplies oxygen to the embers, it helps maintain an even temperature and heat distribution. 
 Assembly is easy, you mount the battery on the side, fold out the legs, and you're ready to start adding kindling. It has led indicators on the side for charge level, fan speed, and heat level to show how much power your fire is producing. The sole button on the device controls the units power, and fan speed. You can cycle through the four speeds of the fan pressing the button, and holding the button will turn the unit off.

I like that the unit is small, and self contained, so there's less risk of the fire spreading, and doesn't put off much light if I don't want to draw attention. It also comes with a small usb light that can light up the cooking area. My hammock, underquilt, topquilt, stove, cookware, and other essentials all fit well enough in my pack that I still have room for some amenities, such as extra tarps, or a projector that attaches to my phone if we want to watch a movie during dinner.",,,3,0,0,

I use a refreshable Braille display, like many others, and it took a great deal of effort to learn the skills necessary to do so. In my opinion, my challenges are much the same as my sighted colleagues, such as parsing out verbose structures, and tracking down redundant coding. Someone learning Braille first has to learn Grade 1, then move on to Grade 2 (contracted), then learn Math coding. For some of us, we had to reteach ourselves a few years back, when Unified English Braille was implemented. I feel that after all the hurdle jumping I've had to do to get proficient in coding to this point, an additional system would be ice skating uphill. A lot of work, for little gain. If you plan on creating a new language, think about function over form, anything you would do to help yourself program easier, is most likely going to help other coders down the line. And as a general plea to all coders, please stop putting stylised images in your code, it's no fun trying to analyze code for two days, just to find out the part stumping me was someone's attempt to be cute and put breasts in their code.",,,10,0,0,

The only time she gets to cuddle is when I sit on the floor with her, at least everyday, when we play fetch.  I place three toys around the room and she has to get the right one to be cuddled after 3 months we were toy perfect. 

I have a strict no petting rule and she wears a coat that says that, she also has a small rucksack that carries her water and treats so I always can find them.

Generally speaking, straight lines are preferably, although a winding path can still be used if there is something to follow along (a wall or a railing). The side you walk along would probably be more strict (if there isn't a formal rule regarding that), to limit running into other people (in the same way that cars drive on the right in North America). 

Narrow or wide halls wouldn't matter as much, unless it is too narrow for two people to navigate past each other. Then that becomes an issue.

One big question would be, what does someone use to sense things at a distance? In the modern age, we mostly use hearing and tactile feedback via a cane. A church may be identified by a ringing bell (hopefully not so loud to drown other sounds out), or perhaps a tactile post near the path.

It can go up quite high, to 20/4000 or so, although at a high enough number, it isn't useful. At that point, it switched to Count Fingers (being able to count the number of fingers at a set distance), Hand Movement (being able to see a waving hand at a set distance), Light Perception (able to see shadows, bright lights and such) and No Light Perception (generally unable to see anything).

For the senses, it is better to think that the person uses them more, and that practice makes them better at it. I think a good analogy would be someone playing in an orchestra. They don't have better hearing than average people, but they've practiced enough to discern more details.

If supernatural powers are involved, you probably have a bit of leeway in how it is presented. I remember a story many years ago about a swordsman who had been blinded, and he learned to hone his hearing so he could hear the noise of muscles, bone and moving blood of his opponents.

Another option as well is using echolocation. Some people make a clicking noise with their tongue, while some others use a mechanical device to make a click.

It's totally fine to ask for help! Your date wants to meet up and learn about you, and some of the quirks that come with vision loss is that you'll need a little help here and there which is very easy to provide. 

Research the menu before you go, most menus are available online. If not, no worries, just ask your date what's on the menu. That inspires discussion about what foods you both like and dislike and is a great icebreaker. Give your date a little run down on sighted guide, explain that you'll need to touch/take her elbow when you need to move to a counter if that's the kind of place you are going, otherwise don't worry about having them read the check when it's delivered, plus you can do things that will make them think about quick forms of accessibility like creasing a check for you along a signature line so there is a tactile demarcation where you need to sign when paying with a card. 

Don't be afraid of these things. I lost my vision 5 years ago and it definitely didn't stop me from dating. My dates know up front that I'm blind, and the people I meet are curious or don't mind it at all.

If you keep fretting about your misgivings and fears, that's going to grind the date to a halt.

This happens to everyone, blind or not, so just be prepared to accept it and move on to another match.  You can do it, go out there and get some experience! Have fun!

I am fully blind and code in Python, Swift, and build sites by hand with HTML and CSS. I do it all with TextEdit or Xcode. VoiceOver has an option that will read out the number of repeated punctuation characters which quickly allows me to figure out indentation levels of my code. I build in my own comments so I can use the VO-F search feature to jump to specific areas in a long program, or use the Jump to Line feature in Xcode to navigate around. I do everything by listening to the code and having all punctuation announced so I don't miss any important syntax; I can go character by character, word by word, line by line very smoothly and have adapted to those languages fairly well. Thereisn't much you need to do as long as the language can be written and understood in a basic text editor and make your manpages accessible and don't skimp on accessibility in online training tutorials or videos. If the language can be run in a Terminal environment, all the better.  Honestly, the worst thing about learning coding is dealing with indentation and how syntax is presented in training. The code element in HTML sometimes doesn't account for whitespace so the screen readers won't read that back making it hard to figure out the correct indentation while learning something new.

I prefer it because it's smoother, not as clunky or as buggy as Talkback,  feels much more designed rather than just engineered, has braille screen input and live screen OCR with media descriptions when encountering pictures in apps, and the voice synthesis options are much clearer and more pleasant than the Android voices. 

The only issues I have with VoiceOver is when apps aren't designed correctly or don't take accessibility into account, making it impossible to use a screen reader with the app. It's easier for iOS developers to tweak code and make elements accessible compared to fixing issues in Android, so updates are more frequent and developers tend to be a little more responsive on the iOS side.",,,4,0,0,

1. The future independence of a child is up to them. I have friends who rely entirely on other people and can’t do anything alone, then again there people like myself or my father who can lead mostly normal lives using technology. 

2. A child under 12 probably won’t have enough enough O&amp;M skills to go and play by themselves. Again, this is a situational thing, and maybe an O&amp;M teacher can enlighten you on it. 

3. Inclusion and SPED. Depending on your state and school district (do you research now while the child is still small) there are going to be a few things to think about. If there is a Visually Impaired program within the district that offers VI or Orientation and Mobility training, I would recommend enrolling your child in that as part of their SPED program. Wether or not the child can be “mainstreamed” in a public school depends on them and their abilities and social skills. I know for example in my district, these training programs have helped my independence, and allowed me to interact with both the disabled and able bodied communities. Based on whatever services are available through your state and school district is what should determine where you send them. If a child goes to a school for the blind and turns out very independent, transferring to public may not be a bad idea

Access to location services comes with similar (perhaps worse) trade-offs.  But enabling or disabling access to it is user-choice.  Why shouldn't users get a similar choice for this API?  I would prefer that it turns into a permission-based API everywhere, not just on the web.  Currently, Windows xp and all later versions of Windows, most versions of Android, and most versions of IOS and OS X, will hand this info over to any app running on the device.  You don't get asked, and you have no setting to turn it off.  Why should apps get this info when websites don't?  I'm sure the facebook app is recording the status of voiceover on your device and reporting back to facebook.  In my opinion, getting this API on the web, and making it permission based (allow/block every time it's used) might serve as a stepping-stone to get this info locked behind a permission prompt everywhere else, too.

Use cases are easy to find with just a few minutes thought. All Google products have a screen reader setting that I have to turn on in every browser. An API could let this happen automatically.  Video websites could provide either audio description or captions to those who need them, without us having to dig through menus and settings to figure out how to turn the darn things on.  The fact that you wouldn't find these things useful or helpful doesn't mean they're useless to everyone else.  

&gt; trade-offs, which do not go away even with a permission-based alert.

How do they not go away? Don't want to share, click block.  So long as the website can't tell the difference between ""blocked"" and ""no disability"" no extra information has been shared, while user choice remains in tact.  

&gt; assistive tech detection of any kind needs to be a flat no. 

Sorry, I still don't think you've justified this position.  Why shouldn't those of us who don't mind sharing get a choice?  You haven't convinced me that your opinion on the matter is so important it must be dictated to everyone.  As well, when most developers want this (that's why we have the same conversation once every couple years) and many users don't mind it, standing in the middle and screaming ""FLAT NO!"" doesn't seem to be a winning tactic.

#AMS

Schipol (AMS, Amsterdam in the Netherlands) has consistently provided excellent service from very courteous, friendly and well trained staff. It has a comfortable waiting area reserved for disabled people while you wait for your connection, which in combination with being whisked around on electric buggies and priority boarding makes you feel like a VIP. The waiting area is near enough to other eating and shopping areas that if you have a guide or are feeling bold you can have delicious pancakes and coffee before getting gobsmacked at how much you can pay for a handbag. WiFi was fiddly to connect to but was available from the waiting area. On our last trip returning through Schipol we were put on a special bus to take us to our plane. At Schipol most regional flights don't connect to the terminal by an air-bridge but require passengers to ascend / descend stairs at the aircraft and take a crowded bus between the plane and the terminal. The special bus for disabled passenger is an Inspector Gadget class of machine. You can board it at ground level along with wheelchair users and when it reached the aircraft it raises itself on stilts to give level access to the aircraft door! 

#KLM

If you are flying via Schipol then this probably means you are flying with KLM who staff are also friendly and well trained. However (1) their code-share partners may not reach this high standard so check who is providing the plane when you book, and (2) there were no audio-described movies on our last flight with KLM..

#DXB

Dubai (DXB) is typical of many other international airports with the staff trying to do their best with limited facilities. You end up waiting for your connection in a somewhat bare and stark waiting area feeling more like luggage than a person. At least water and washrooms are available. I'm not saying avoid Dubai because if you are there your are (1) probably on your way to somewhere really interesting and (2) you probably arrived with Emirates on an Airbus A380 which is the most comfortable big aircraft I have travelled on. You may need some assistance to use the entertainment system on the A380 but on our journey they had a good selection of audio-described movies.

#LHR

London Heathrow (LHR) was forced on us as our hub recently due to high winds in Schipol forcing us to rebook our flights. Despite our journey being at a more body-clock friendly time of day our experience was dismal. This may have been due to our domestic flight leg being transferred to another airline who weren't partners with our international carrier, and with having to transfer from one terminal to another. Having made excuses on their behalf, if my VI partner had been travelling alone I don't know how they would have coped with finding washrooms, taking buses between terminals, getting boarding passes, finding electric sockets to recharge gadgets, and getting through security checks. The staff, as is usually the case, were trying their best but the systems and facilities were just not in place for them to do a good enough job. 

#Tips

You may need to explain at every turn that you don't need a wheelchair.

Talk with the other disabled people you are travelling wit. They often have the best stories of any travellers. You are from the USA so talking to random strangers should come naturally to you. 

Try and be conscious of when its the system and management letting you down (it usually is) and smile until your jaw aches at the front-line staff trying their best. 

Have a pocket or folder in a coat or bag exclusively for passports and boarding passes which have to be produced frequently and another exclusive location for tickets and visas and other travel documents that may only be needed once on the journey. I do this as a sighted person so I don't lose anything else as I pull my documents out again and again. When using assistance we are constantly asked for our boarding passes, more than when travelling alone.

In other words, force yourself to use them and, just like using a brand new browser, you might get familiar enough with them to get through a work day. Tough, I know, but if you want to do development, try.

&gt; We were developing embedded software, and there were constant issues with getting the hardware I was developing for to connect properly to the VM. The IO on the iMac was inadequate, and the networking complications of a VM made it really hard to get things working properly. I’d worked super hard and exhausted all the options I could think of.

Yes, that is hard. Embedded software connecting may actually have issues with a VM. That said, you can always develop and compile on different machines. Yes, get yourself two machines, one to do regular development on and one to compile on. I've been in similar situations myself. More generally, there was one situation I remember where it took me 2 weeks to figure out a really small but really critical thing (in Java) to develop an encapsulated package for an external team. And I wasted a lot of a co-worker's time since she knew Java way better. All that time, I also kept getting pushback from my manager every few days telling me to kill the project; and I pushed back every time telling him I was almost there and just need more time (both of which I felt were true). In the end, I succeeded and this critical problem for us was solved; but I could just as easily have failed and I would've looked like a fool. The moral I want to leave you here is give it at least a full one or two weeks; and turn to co-workers, old professors, anyone you can think of for help; or post on StackExchange, SevenForums (people on this forum helped a lot with another issue I had), or other forums; and keep trying.

If you're in this situation again, I recommend you do not leave. I recommend talking to your manager and asking him to give you some time to figure out how to be productive in such a new and unfamiliar environment. Tell him you will problem-solve your way out and that you need some time. As well, if a co-worker really has abandoned you then that may be something you should bring to your manager or the HR manager (office politics can be hard, so you will have to judge whether it's better to tell your manager or to confront that co-worker; but also remember that that co-worker probably has tons of work to do himself and if you aren't able to use the tools he's familiar with, you shouldn't expect him to spend days or weeks helping you on his own time...).",,,1,0,0,
84a33205-efea-4269-a041-a23f59acd2da,1554238714,"Wow, thanks so much for the info. I have been poring over articles and pages on typography over the past 2 months as it is one of the most important aspects of the site I am now trying to design. I did not run into The Nielsen Group in all this time, so now I have more reading to do. Thanks!

&gt; And yet, the current website and software design trend for the past 5 years has been medium-light gray fonts on white background

I was guilty of this in the first draft of my design--this pattern just *looks* so darn neat in the right places/contexts. But, of course, once I started paying attention to accessibility, I realized I had made a mistake.

Designing is hard. Designing for accessibility is even more so because you are constrained by certain things. As far as typography, I am, right now, walking the fine line between selecting the right fonts to convey what I want to convey; and making sure they work extremely well, designwise; and also making sure that they are legible to a majority of people who land on my site.

Would you mind if I contacted you for feedback on the typography/font selection on the pages when I am done? You seem like you have a great deal of experience in this!",,,2,0,0,

84a33205-efea-4269-a041-a23f59acd2da,1556090033,"You had a job? You got a job? You had a job!

Look, you had a job. First of all, learn from that experience. Get your hands on a Windows PC and figure out how to use it. Alternatively, you can still use Windows on a Mac by installing a virtual machine and running Windows off of it (I don't have experience with this as I don't use Macs but I believe it's fairly easy--look it up!). I also don't know if all the accessibility features will transfer over to the VM but you should certainly give it a try; and you can then also see if you can successfully run Windows accessibility software inside the VM. Seriously, you need to up your game here and get some basic familiarity with the platforms most companies require you to be able to navigate: Windows, Mac, and Linux/Unix.

Second, read up on agile development. Get familiar with the practices. The reason agile is so popular is because it works well in a lot of development environments. Just because you felt lost with it on day 4 does not mean you will still be lost with it on day 40; or on day 400. It does take quite a lot of effort and work to sort of understand what's going on if you're brand new, but that is how it is in any job. Trust me, the first 2 months of any job are just spent learning and getting used to things. You are expected to be lost the first 2 months! No one expects you to hit the ground running, sighted or unsighted!

I have hired people and I usually allocate 4 months to bring the person up to speed, even the smartest and most gifted of individuals! In your case, you are fresh out of college, so I (or any hiring manager) would usually allocate 5 to 12 months, at least. Due to your loss of vision, a manager might even add a little more time. You have to have confidence, honestly, and know that time is on your side. But you also have to put in the extra hours, ask questions about everything, and ask for help whenever you need it. Don't be afraid, don't be shy.

Now, as soon as you've gotten yourself familiar with Windows and thoroughly read up on agile development, please go back to the manager that hired you and beg him to give you a second chance. He hired you the first time and he may give you a second chance if you beg like a crazy person. And if you do this professionally enough, it will also show you are a go-getter: you took the initiative and went out and solved your problems for yourself, in your own time. It shows you are serious, will work hard, and that no one will have to babysit you.

In the meantime, I suggest you also keep building up your resume. Look for those online sites where you can do small projects/tasks for webmasters. They don't pay much and it's kinda hard work, but you get to build your compentency in small tasks and get reviews. Just take on tasks that you know you can do well and that you can put on your resume--yes, you can put such small projects on your resume! Concurrently, find some local non-profit organizations, hospitals, libraries, senior citizen homes, etc. that need technical help and offer your services. Something small, something simple, something you can put on your resume, i.e., maybe some help with their website; or teaching computers/phones to seniors; or teaching a 1-hour class on Excel or something at the library. These will not pay but they are great resume builders and will show you haven't just been sitting at home browsing Reddit the whole time you were looking for work...

start watching/reading biographies on famous blind people. sure all these people are one in a million but they are out there so its proof of what a blind person can achieve. your child will probably never be the basketball player or surgeon that you hoped for but there is still a good chance they can be a musician or lawyer or a long list of other really exciting things. they might need some help with certain tasks but they can make very valuable contributions to society.

recognize that the worst part of any disability is the emotional baggage and social stigma. physically, your child will probably learn how to get by in life far better than you will expect without being able to see but the emotional side of having a disability is very challenging. its going to be harder for your child to develop healthy self-esteem. it might be good to make friends with adults and children who have vision issues to help give support. in general, please keep this in the front of your mind so that you can develop strategies to help your emotional development.

i don't know if you are a dog person but imagine if you could hold a good conversation with a dog. if you could tell them about how poor your sense of smell is compared to theirs, they would be mortified. they would shower you with unwarranted pity and support. at the same time you have to realize that dogs actually have really poor sense of vision. they hardly depend on their vision at all and yet somehow they get by rather well. no one pity's them for it. your child might learn to perceive the world much differently than we do but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.",,,5,0,0,

A guide should be used just about every day for at least two half hour trips, if not more. If you rarely go out, or only go short distances, a guide isn't great for you. Being in school though, if you use public transit you'll absolutely be keeping your dog trained.

There are different trains of thought in teaching at various schools. Evidence shows that positive reinforcement should be the primary, so keep that in mind with your choice of school. You don't need the closest school, or the one that trains the breed you like best, if you want the best chance at having a guide that doesn't need retraining.

Even the best dog can get bad habits, and you absolutely need to keep up your cane skills in case your dog gets sick, traumatized, or just out of sorts. If your guide isn't guiding properly, you want a backup.

Some schools pay for things after you graduate, so definitely keep that in mind as you pick a school.

Good schools will offer a Juno walk, where an instructor gives you a handle to hold and you can use the walk to see how it feels to use a guide. This is extremely important, as some people understand better with a cane, and some understand better with a dog.

The biggest thing is, people will absolutely fall all over each other trying to get at your dog. If you cannot be assertive, you're gonna have a bad time.

That said, it's absolutely a partnership that can be rewarding. It's faster, for many people, as well as giving more pertinent information instead of all the information, like a cane.

I also highly recommend doing the longest length of training possible, so you can be firmly acquainted with your dog and see if they're gonna be good as a guide, as well as good for you.",,,4,0,0,

As for risk of transmission, it depends completely on what she has. RP can be autossomic (recessive or dominant) or linked to the X chromosome, each with a different associated risk of transmission to children. The first step is to find out what she has, then, if possible, do genetic testing to know which genes are involved in the condition (if any) and then do couple genetic testing to know the chances of you guys having a child with the condition.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the details about this subreddit from that group's sticky post:  


## Sticky: So You Have an Eye Problem

&amp;#x200B;

This subreddit was created by ophthalmologists and optometrists due to a flood of patient questions in other related subreddits about their own ocular health. Ideally, we will have professional eye care providers volunteering their time freely to **assist** those with the most concerning-sounding symptoms or histories. However...

**Online advice will never replace an in-person medical exam, ESPECIALLY for ocular concerns**. Symptom description is often too vague and physical exam findings are extraordinarily specific, and too microscopic for you to see or even usually for you to take a good picture of yourself. Also, our advice **is not and can not be construed as true medical advice, given that there is no physical exam or real way for us to follow up/through on your problem. This subreddit's purpose is NOT to provide direction, advisement or recommendations for your problems**. In a legal sense, that is impossible. But there is a high demand for help, and we will do what we can.

At the current time, we will still welcome layman questions about general eye topics in other subreddits such as [r/ophthalmology](https://www.reddit.com/r/ophthalmology). However, if your question is in regards to your own eye problem, it will be redirected here.

Please understand that given the high legal liability of telling someone ""Eh, you're probably fine, don't worry about it,"" that even the most innocuous-sounding complaint may not receive a satisfactory answer.

**Physicians and optometrists:** we welcome and are grateful for the volunteering of your time here. Back in [r/ophthalmology](https://www.reddit.com/r/ophthalmology), if you would like to be recognized for your volunteer efforts in [r/eyetriage](https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage), please send me a PM and we will first check to verify your volunteer activity on this subreddit, then discuss it from there.

Best,

&amp;#x200B;

And I like /u/f4d31ddc-e267-4833-9aef-9cdb992f3387 's answer, but I differ just a bit.  I think chivalry is being charming, polite, and kind.  Thoughtful, too.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to driving, I think it's enough to say with genuine feeling, ""I really appreciate you driving tonight.  I'm so glad we're doing this!""

&amp;#x200B;

As for other things you can do...

&amp;#x200B;

When you're at a door together (like going into a restaurant), you can absolutely still usher her in (hold the door, allow her to go first).

&amp;#x200B;

You can treat her as your very, valued guest.  So if a waiter come for your order, ask her what she'd like to order before you say what you'd like to order.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically it's everything you'd do for someone you care for and want to make their experience with you just amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

This translates also to conversation where you're genuinely interested in what she says, in learning more about her, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

And in a world of equality, she will also want you to feel the same way.    She will be equally interested in you and look out for your welfare.

&amp;#x200B;

And I know that some of this (hold doors open, be interested)  is cultural and regional, but I do these things for everyone, man or woman.  If someone is behind me, I hold the door open for them, no matter which sex they are.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;•	Who specifically are you wanting to serve? (Who is the person who will love your site the most?).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;The person I am targeting is someone who recently lost sight, and adult students in college.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;These are two completely different demographics (people), actually.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine a 70 year old construction worker who has just lost his vision and has only done very basic things on the computer like emailing grandchildren...   
&gt;  
&gt;vs.   
&gt;  
&gt;...someone who lost vision very young and has 15 years of experience with technology in a school situation and is skilled enough to have completed all the entrance work for college and take classes and keep up.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;These 2 people need very different things in assistance and tutorials.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;If it is possible, I would make an appointment with them in my local library to learn how to type fast, help them if they have some questions about accessibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Great.  Having someone sit by your side is a great way to learn.  And you don't need a website for this.   What you really need is connections with the sources who would recommend you to your students.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember a website sits and waits for someone to find it.  People don't know your website exists yet.  They don't know to search for your website in order to know about you.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;The website will be mainly text based, and I will post different tools to use at home for people like us who are visually impaired/blind. I will also post YouTube links to watch for those who can. The website will be mainly educational and will consists anything accessibility related.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I love your mission here.  I think it's great!  Try to narrow your mission down to something that you can become known for.  ""Anything accessibility related"" isn't even possible.  You probably aren't going to include every piece of accessibility equipment with reviews or talk about accessibility coding standards or deal with how a VI senior manager can use accessibility equipment to navigate complex budgeting spreadsheets, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, focus on what you really, in your heart, are doing.  For example:  I help VI adults get up to speed on confidently using the internet and social media with assistive technology, for the very first time.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;The tone would be strictly professional, precisely because comedy is not my strong suit.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When you say professional, do you mean very formal, like you would use on a job interview for a management job?  Or do you mean that you will be factual but in a kind voice and using an everyday vocabulary? Or do you mean that you're talking as an expert and authority and they are the students who should not ask questions, just follow along?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;FYI: I'm asking this for a reason.  Each one of these would influence a different website name. :-D  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;I would focus, at least in the beginning,  how to use assistive technology and how people  use the tech  for their careers. I would refurbish some laptops and train people ( if they can’t afford it) how to install NVDA.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;AWESOME!  I really love this.    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;What type of careers would you help with?  Is it... Someone who is in a loading dock situation and using proprietary software.  Do you help with that?  An accountant would also have very specific software.  Are you helping them use assistive technology no matter what software they're using, or are you specializing in MS Word, for instance, or Chrome browser?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When you say you'd refurbish laptops, it makes me think that these people you help can't afford their own or don't already own computers.  Is that correct?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;That is really a good question. My hope is that they’ll come to my site to learn more about techniques, or skills, that applies to us as blind/low vision people. This website would be dedicated to educate people, and the site will be an extension to the local training I would offer.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I think this last sentence where you talk about it being an extension of the local training is a great reason to come to your site!    
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;This could be the continuing education part of  your work or where you provide additional resources to complement what you've taught (like workbooks) or even where they come for help and you could have a community where they ask questions.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Which one seems most interesting to you?

&amp;#x200B;",,,1,0,0,
15ea4fba-7d87-495e-bedd-f14685007e06,1554521451,"Okay!  Here's how I'd sum up your responses...

&amp;#x200B;

You serve VI/blind high school and college graduates who are ""lifting off"" for the first time (college, first job) and need help getting up to speed with accessibility software fast.  You provide customized/personalized accessibility education, mentoring, and tutorials to make mastering needed technology easy and painless, so that your clients do more than keep up with their sighed peers--they excel!

&amp;#x200B;

It's like you help people start up their lives and get to where they want to go, by providing the needed accessibility skills to live life on the ""big stage,"" being  amazing at whatever it is they want to do in college or their first job.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I get this right?

&amp;#x200B;

The people who would appreciate this services are the actual high school or college soon-to-be graduates, their parents, their schools, and their employers.

&amp;#x200B;

But the people who will value what you do don't know that you offer this.  So how will they find out?

&amp;#x200B;

Probably through the connections they've already made: low vision clinics, ophthalmologist's offices, local chapters of blind and accessibility organizations and groups, state funded services for the blind (especially job placement and training programs), OM trainers, online groups (like FB groups), public and private school programs and counselors, and even local media, perhaps.

&amp;#x200B;

To succeed, you need your first 10 students.

You don't need a website (yet), because these students don't know to look for you.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll get these students though referrals from connections that you develop.  (So you'll want to start with the connections that are easiest for you to make, introduce yourself and what you do, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

But you do need a great name, and you can build your website over time, as you teach and mentor your first students, and as you begin to create the supplemental material for them.

&amp;#x200B;

And that leads us to the purpose of your website, which is primarily to provide supplemental materials for your students.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondary purposes are to let people know what you do and provide contact information, provide information (on your site) that can be forwarded or shared with friends and family (so your network groups), and to help people you'll never meet.

&amp;#x200B;

TIME TO BRAINSTORM NAMES!

You need a name that is in alignment with the following things:

* captures the concept of dreaming big and taking your first steps get the degree, the job, the life you want.  Love the term you used ""entry level.""
* indicates the audience is VI/blind and needs  to meet immediate challenges of tech accessibility to step up in life and do essential work.
* Makes it clear you offer mentoring, instruction, tutoring, education.
* Mostly work in person.
* Your tone is factual, straight forward, and everyday language.

&amp;#x200B;

But the name doesn't have to address everything.  A good subtitle or tagline can do a lot of communication for you.

It could be something as easy as **VisionMentor: Your personal tech mentor for the accessibility you need, whether it's for your first college semester or your first career job.**

&amp;#x200B;

Or you might like something clever like **Eye Guru: Screenreader ninja skills for college students and entry-level job seekers.**

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe something with more of a mission feel because you hope to eventually include more people who do what you do.  You you might like something like **Project Accessibility: Bringing the best in accessibility software mentoring to college students and first-time jobseekers so that nothing slows them down on their path to success**.

&amp;#x200B;

So take some time to see what resonates with you, brainstorm names, picture using the name, and see what you come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you find that the name you like is not available as a domaine name, remember you can be very creative with your business name by shifting it slightly.

&amp;#x200B;

For Example, maybe [ProjectAccessibility.com](https://ProjectAccessibility.com) is taken, so you decide to use [ProjectAccessibleEye.com](https://ProjectAccessibleEye.com) or [MissionAccessibility.com](https://MissionAccessibility.com).

Please post and let us know the name you select!

15ea4fba-7d87-495e-bedd-f14685007e06,1554126395,"I have a huge passion for fonts.... and i have to say I find sans serif fonts much harder to read.  There's a reason book printers have used serif for years.  The little feet guide the eye across the line.  (I'm legally blind, few degrees of vision.)  


I have some ideas on fonts for you, and I'll talk you through what I personally need in a font.  Then others can chime in with what they like best.  


I do love that APHont has larger punctuation.  That's really good.  


Anyway, the biggest thing that helps me with a font is the ability to clearly distinguish the shape of the word.  Our brains do a lot of work based on shape and filling in expected details.  So if I see a word like ""would"" I can figure it out, even if I don't see the o and u as separate.  I have the starting and ending letters, the length, and the tall l and d.  This is called Readability.  


(I've lost  **Legibility,** which is a measure of how easy it is to distinguish one letter from another in a particular typeface.)  


In addition to this, no matter what font is chosen, the ability to read it depends on contrast (font color vs. background color), font size, letter spacing, and leading (which is the space between lines).  Everyone needs a certain amount of ""white space"" to read well, and with low vision, I need even more.  


But it can be tricky.  Contrast, point size, and leading matter most.  If you put too much space between letters, then I lose the shape of the word.  Most fonts, I've found, don't need additional expanded space between letters, at least for me.  


All that said, if you're looking for a font similar to APHont... you might try...

&amp;#x200B;

If so, and if they've seen the interactions (and I'm assuming all the interactions were really positive, with appropriate interaction, affection, handling, etc.)...  


Here are some other things rescue groups look at:  


1) Where will the puppy live?  Will that change as the puppy grows?  Who/when will the puppy have access to go outside and potty?  

2) What is the puppy's outside environment like?  Is there a fence? What type of fence?

3) Have they met the whole family?  If someone is missing, why?

4) Is the puppy a gift?

5) Does the family have a vet?  Will they agree to get the puppy spayed or neutered?

6) How will the puppy be trained?

7) What is the family's past experience with pets.  What happened to all the past pets?  Were any pets lost or re-homed?  How long did the pets live?  Were there any issues?

8) Are there any other pets in the home?  What is the family's relationship with that pet(s)?  Who takes care of the pet(s)?  Why are they wanting to add a puppy to their family?

9) Are they prepared for a pet of this age/breed/temperament?  What will happen when the puppy mis-behaves?  How knowledgeable/realistic are they about what to expect?

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on how you answer these questions, I'd approve you or disapprove you. ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that flags for me is that you have kids living at home(???) over 18.  Is that right?  

&amp;#x200B;

Are they living at home because they need additional assistance?  (Lots of kids over 18 live at home because of money or college, and I get that!)

&amp;#x200B;

If your kids have different abilities (beyond vision), how are they when it comes to balance?  Little puppies go everywhere and can trip of people who have balance issues, like seniors.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, puppies have razor sharp puppy teeth.  So is there anyone who wouldn't be able to understand that (and get hurt)?

One thing you can do is talk to the rescue group and tell them you'd like to get your family ready in the future for a puppy.  You know you weren't approved here,  but you'd like to know what you and your family can work on, or what type of pet they think would work with your family.

&amp;#x200B;

It could be as simple as, ""We think your family would do best with an older dog.""  Or, ""we never approve families who don't have a fenced backyard, so that's what you'd need to work on.""

It's just communication.  She asked for something.  He agreed because he loves her and didn't want to say no.  First communication issue.

TL;DR    Since this is a longer comment, here is a TL;DR summary: fonts affect a lot of people (over 40, tired eyes, elderly, low vision). In the computer world, how humans interact with screens is called Usability.  We've had standards and research for decades, and yet some developers and designers are still doing what doesn't work.   [Is Serif or Sans Serif font better?  We don't really know](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts-hd-screens/) scientifically speaking, but we do know some important stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, let's chat about fonts on the screen.  

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing to know is that just because we scientifically can't prove for the average user whether Serif or Sans Serif fonts are better (see above link), doesn't mean someone with a vision impairment wouldn't have a strong personal opinion about what works in daily life for him or her.

&amp;#x200B;

If you'd like to dive into online fonts more, here goes.  


I'm a total geek for this subject, and you can practically hear me gush when I say...   


There's a field of study called ""usability"" that developed in the early 1980's, as personal computers (software and the internet) started to go mainstream.  Fonts are a very important part of something being usable.  

&amp;#x200B;

Jakob Nielsen (The Nielsen Group) is at the forefront of that research and guidelines for how people actually use and consume input/words/links on the computer, visual design that works, and what makes finding what you need easy vs. hard.  


Think of is as ""sanity for computers,"" where finally things are built the way humans think and work.

&amp;#x200B;

Nielsen looks at everything from screen resolution and size to fonts used to placement, hot zones, and speed of ""deciding this isn't the right website"" when search for results.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few things that Usability experts know about fonts for a couple decades.  


* **Screen technology and resolution matters.**  Early on, computer monitors were pretty blurry, font smoothing wasn't perfected, and often serif fonts weren't displayed as well as sans serif. But that was then.  

* **Font size matters,** and you should let users adjust the size.  (Early on in computers you couldn't just use a browser to zoom in and websites and software developers were hardcoding the font size.  That was in the 80's and 90s.  Today many sites and apps still are not adjustable.)  

* **Font style is important,** as is color/contrast, using all caps or all lowercase, using condensed versions of fonts, leading, and unfortunate design elements like flashing, blinking words.  (Having access to crazy fonts doesn't mean you should use them.  Hot pink on a yellow background and stuff like that is just awful for regular vision, and no matter which font you select, you must provide enough contract between the font and the background.  And yet, the current website and software design trend for the past 5 years has been medium-light gray fonts on white background, which is scientifically proven as awful for everyone over 40, those with tired eyes, people who work long hours at the computer, and--oh yeah--those with low vision.)  

* **Placement matters on the screen.**  Developers and designers tend to put a ton of data (navigation, text, ads) across the screen, and yet one of the biggest differences of being on a computer is that we don't read. We scan to see if we're on the right page, if we're interested, what we need to click next, or if we should spent time reading.   This scanning occurs in a certain pattern, depending on the language you speak.  (This is very hard to do with low vision and screen readers, even with a good font.)  

* **Since we scan,** the white space, readability, short paragraphs, and use of organizational techniques (headers, subheaders, bullets, graphics, etc.) is essential.  


And that brings us to today.  **Now that we're using smaller and smaller screens to interact with software and the internet (think smartwatches) in smaller and smaller sessions (maybe 15 seconds total), fonts are even MORE important.**  


[Nielsen just put out a great article on this topi](https://www.nngroup.com/search/?q=easy+to+read&amp;searchSubmit=Search)c, which is about an MIT Study of Glanceable Reading and Typography, how it's impacted on small devices, etc.

I want to stress that these are what work for me.  There's plenty of research that says, sans serif fonts work best for low vision.  I'm always stunned by this, because, unless they're headlines (huge + few words), I find them much harder to read.

Also, I can work on the computer very well (except for spreadsheets), but can be working for weeks without realizing a much needed feature is available, because I've never seen that part of the screen and didn't even know it.  My focus is on my giant cursor.  Not the fact that every time you arrive at a new screen maybe the sidebar has changed... or someone has decided to put a tiny message in the upper right-hand corner....

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm constantly losing more vision and having to adapt.  So  I seem to always been in the space of ""why can't I make this work because I have in the past!"" But really, all that's happened is that I've lost more vision and must adapt.

I did rescue work for a couple decades, including working with several organizations, fostering, and doing home checks and checking references.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't include a lot of details in your post.  How old are you children?  What type of dog were you trying to adopt?

&amp;#x200B;

Rescue groups are rehoming a dog that has already lost at least one family.  They're incredibly careful so that the dog doesn't go through the loss of another home.  In addition to that, they avoid situations they know lead to returns or a bad life for the dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example: most rescue groups won't adopt out a large breed to a home with small children, even it it's a wonderful home.  What happens often is that the dog's tail knocks over the toddler, and the family returns the dog because ""their kids got hurt!""

Anyway all I can really add would be that teaching an appreciation for proper spelling is going to be extra important for a blind person that will probably use a screen reader later in life, and that you should start the kid with braille as soon as possible as the older you get the harder it gets exponentially it seems.

Learning touch typing skills on a computer and telephone keypad is also a useful skill, though they may not be ready for it until they are like ten when it comes to the computer keyboard at least...

If your kid ends up with a cranky old vision teacher and comes home upset every day, and it's beyond just the difficulty of braille as a concept, then try to see if you can get a new teacher ASAP because it seems that the worse the teacher's attitude, the worse the attitude towards braille later in life can be.

Cane and auditory skills are also very important at an early age, just don't be surprised if your kid starts threatening other kids with their cane when they get picked on, because it's pretty common LOL.",,,3,0,0,

If it would help, show your mom this post.  [u/MARCVS-PORCIVS-CATO](https://www.reddit.com/user/MARCVS-PORCIVS-CATO) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm legally blind, and while my reading vision is okay, I basically have severe tunnel vision that makes finding things on counters difficult, especially if it gets moved or if it's small. That being said, I get by just fine with a few extra tools like  a magnifying glass, a larger screen for the computer I use, and a tray like you might find at a cafeteria to keep pills from rolling away if one tries to escape.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're counting pills to fill prescription bottles, you should know that some pills are going to be super tiny. For instance, I was on one cholesterol med for a while where each pill was like the size of a single grain of rice. If it would help, see if your employer would be willing to provide or let you bring in a large magnifier with a light to help with tiny pills like that. This can be compounded by having to wear rubber gloves which can reduce your tactile feedback a bit, but it isn't an insurmountable obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

As for other stuff like reading labels or using the computer to process prescriptions, I'm fairly certain that's something you could do with the right combination of assistive tech suited for your vision. Whether it's one of those cameras hooked up to a TTS program so you can snap a pic of the bottle and have it read to you, or just a CCTV magnifier or whatever works best for your particular eyesight problem.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things my pharmacy does is pill boxes for nursing homes, where you have to prepare a week's worth of meds for a patient according to the instructions on their pill bottles. When a worker, sight-impaired or not, finishes a box, it has to be inspected by a pharmacist to give the okay, so if you wind up with a similar arrangement, you can tailor your tasks to your capabilities.  


Based on my experience, if you can count to ninety, are capable of asking for accommodations when you need them, and are willing to do what it takes to become a certified pharm tech, go for it. So long as they don't expect you to be the one driving to make deliveries to nursing homes or whatever, I think you'll do fine enough. But it's also important to recognize when mistakes happen, and talk with your coworkers to see if you need more or different accommodations or if it was just a flub like sighted people make sometimes when they're tired or stressed or distracted by hearing that one coworker's story about how their cat threw up in the ficus again.

**Unforged iron is brittle.**

My dad has worked with metal all his life, (sheet metal and other welding projects n' such) and he told me that when I was 12, just after I was diagnosed. He wasn't trying to teach me about adversity, but the words stuck. Without putting iron through the process of hammering, forging, tempering, and re-forging until it's just right, it's not going to be ready. It's not going to be strong enough to handle stress for long.

Unforged iron is brittle.

OP, ***you*** **are the iron**. School is hard. It's hard for everyone. It's harder for you in ways that none of those other goons will ever understand. And yes, it's going to continue to be hard. But no matter what shape you take, what task you build yourself up to take on, it's the work you do at this *very important* part of your life that will help you in the future, where they might crack under the strain of something new and unexpected later in life. 

Because unforged iron is brittle.

Right now, you're being tested in ways they're not ready for. But it ***will get better,*** and you will carry the iron in you into adulthood. You'll be stronger and sharper than they expect. You'll be able to bend and not break like others might. It's a terrible, awful thing for any child in school to experience, but you can make it.

In all seriousness, I don't think that it's accurate to say that one person *should* be driving, other than the fact that one of us just...cant. I get that there's the social stigma of being the navigator, or even just driving so she doens't have to worry about wearing heels, but these days, if you're without other options, the best thing is to just ask your date to drive. 

In general, I feel like attempts to be ""chivalrous"" isn't really needed. It's a bit outdated to treat a date like she's some delicate glass sculpture, which is what the term chivalry boils down to a lot of the time. You can be charming, polite, and kind to your date without having to dote on them. I mean, it's not like we're in the days of horseback riding where ladies aren't supposed to straddle a saddle without improperly hiking up a skirt in public or whatever.   


Taking time to clean up, dress nice, communicate, listen, be honest, and take interest in what your date has to say are great things to do on a date that are possible regardless of vision, and considering those are the important skills for a relationship, if your date gets upset because you can't drive, pay for the Uber/taxi and ham it up like it's the chauffeur experience.

Plus they fear  lawsuits. If you live in the US, I think the ADA laws actually made  things a bit worst for people with disabilities to get jobs.  Lots of  lawsuits. 

In a way, I kinda see what you mean, but I feel like the only way it made it ""worse"" is just make the discrimination you face more silent and harder to prove. It's just like any other discrimination. Rather than say the illegal thing of ""I won't hire/promote you because you're a minority."" They just go the route of just not hiring you and not saying why like for every protected class that still gets screwed over despite laws trying to protect them.  


Also, there's the perception that a person with a disability is more of a liability or will cost more to train or get acclimated to the job. Or the perception that if they have to make a reasonable accommodation for things someone can't do, they're not getting their ""money's worth"" by hiring someone who can't do 100% of the tasks they want them for, or who is limited in what other responsibilities they might be able to take on later when the company pulls the ""promotion and extra work with no raise"" crap.

My best friend is fully blind, with a little light perception. His retinas detached too when he was an infant, 


And let me tell you, from both my experience and my friend’s: things will be okay. We both go to a school for the blind (I still go there, he graduated last year) which allowed me to do quite well school wise. I prematurely did my English exams last year, which I passed with the highest grades of the school. My friend is currently in law school and doing quite well for himself. Public schools are possible, but schools for the blind are an amazing option. 


As for your concerns about your kiddo having a normal childhood, I can’t speak from personal experience,  as I’ve only been visually impaired since I was 14, but I know from my friend and other classmates that were VI from a young age, I can assure you again: it will be okay. Some stuff, like playing sports, might be hard (Maybe look into Goalball when the time comes? It really helped me and it’s super fun) but there’s so much that’s still very much possible. 


Cheesy as it may sound: Being blind isn’t a death sentence. On the one hand, I am legally blind. I take braille lessons, have mobility training, can’t safely cycle anymore (And I’m Dutch so you can imagine what a big deal that is) use a cane, constantly lose stuff, break down every once in a while, bump into random things, and am in hospital way more than I want to. But on the other hand I am also just a teen, who works out three times a week, goes to school, loves to bake, plays DnD and piano, lives and breathes memes, and is generally… quite happy. I know it’s hard to believe right now but there will be so much more to your life and your kid’s life than his disability. There are amazing resources out there, and you will find them.

But it seems many people here express the same feelings about blind schools as you do, in that they're sheltering the kids too much. I think part of that is because there are not many blind kids, and also because in public schools you have to stand up for yourself and learn to get by in an 'everyday situation', from which blind kids can profit.

15a5c45f-9339-4bec-840d-0d3197a60fc9,1556494097,"This is indeed a sad question that I have myself thought about many times before. And the very upsetting truth is that, realistically, us blind people will end up almost certainly getting slaughtered. I mean, I don't want to be the party pooper here but it would be naive in my opinion to believe we had the same chance of survival as sighted people. I hope that by being aware of this, I would manage to panic less and keep a cool mind if I ever get into such a situation.

As for concrete advice: I'd say this depends on whatever the particular situation would be like. As a nearly-blind person, I would certainly try to use my ears to gain an advantage over the attacker. For example in a school shooting you might first hear the attacker giving off some shots in a different hallway. This might give enough time to run to the exit. I'm not a student anymore but as a tall, big guy, hiding is not really an option for me. It can work if you're small but it's also quite a dangerous strategy in my opinion. If you can, find some other people and put an obstacle between you and the attacker. For instance in a classroom there might be a heavy piece of furniture that you can drag in front of the door.

Also, you might find this a bit tasteless but as a last resort you should always keep pity-begging as an option. If hiding and running both didn't work and I suddenly stood in front of the attacker, I would totally tell him that I'm blind and try to make him feel some pity. I would probably feel shitty doing this but hey, if it's a matter of life or death, I won't hesitate.

In the end, it's important to remember that, while we have a huge disadvantage to sighted people in this issue, surviving a terrorist attack is always partially a matter of luck. I recently watched this fascinating interview of a married couple from Germany who survived the tragic Luxor massacre. On November 17th, 1997, a bunch of islamist terrorists entered the popular archeological site of Deir-al-bahari in Luxor, Egypt. They were armed with half-automatic weapons and immediately started shooting at the tourists. Many people had no chance; entire families were brutally slaughtered, or parents in front of their kids, kids in front of their parents etc. This was inside a closed building (an ancient palace) and the victims didn't have any escape routes. Some tourists managed to run to an adjacent room. However, they soon heard the terrorists walk after them and in panic they realized they had walked into a trap - this room was without any doors or windows. The husband in the interview said that back in that moment he stumbled over something and when he looked up, he saw a little wall. It was mainly coincidence that he had seen it, no one else had noticed it. It wasn't very high, maybe 4 feet, but enough to crawl behind. So he grabbed his wife by the arm and they jumped behind that wall. Seconds later they heard more shots, as all the other fellow tourists in the room got killed by the terrorists. Then, there was a moment of silence. Suddenly the couple heard one of the terrorists step closer towards the wall. They were insanely lucky because he stopped a few feet before the wall, turned around and walked back again. Had he stepped just one or two feet closer, he could have easily looked over the wall and he would have seen them hiding there. They were later rescued and belonged to a small group of tourists who made it out alive. 62 people were killed that day. So, in some cases physical abilities don't even matter... sometimes you also just need a good amount of luck.",,,3,0,0,

15a5c45f-9339-4bec-840d-0d3197a60fc9,1554958087,"I was born legally blind and my vision further decreased over the years, hence driving a car or even a motorbike was never an option for me. I remember as a I wanted to get a license for a small motorcycle really, really badly but it simply was not possible. That was very painful.

Fortunately, I am from Switzerland where we have perhaps the best public transport system in the world. Especially trains are extremely popular in my country and even the tiniest mountain village has its own little train station and good connections to the nearby villages and larger towns. On top of that there is a very dense network of busses and trams (mostly within cities), post cars (between villages), publicly operated ships on the lakes and funiculars in the mountains. Because the country is relatively small and the public transport system is so good, it is very common for Swiss people to live in one city but work in another one. Or live in the countryside but work in the city. For example I live in a different city than the one where my university is located and I commute whenever I need to go there. The bus stop is a 5-minute walk from my apartment away. From there it takes me 8 minutes to the city main station. Depending on the train connection I choose, it takes me between 20-25 minutes to the other city. There I get off the train and walk another 5 minutes to the tram stop. The tram ride takes about 10 minutes. When I get off the tram, I'm standing pretty much right in front of my university. It's very convenient, also for me as a blind person.

There were times in my early 20s when I was incredibly frustrated about the fact that everyone around me was allowed to drive a car while I was excluded from this fun activity. However, I don't feel that way anymore. The truth is that owning a car in this country is rather useless because there is no single location, no matter how remote, that I wouldn't be able to reach by public transport. In fact, I am now married and my wife has never bothered to get a driver's license despite being fully sighted. Not owning a car has become kind of a trend among millennials in Switzerland; it's now almost considered cool to use public transport. I'm very happy about that because it means the government continues to fund our public transport system well. Contrary to the US, public transport is not something exclusively used by poor people in Switzerland. Everyone travels by bus, tram and train here. Even our Federal Councils (equivalent to the President in the US) use public transport to go to work (I once sat nearby one of them on the train to Bern).

I must say that living in the US would be extremely difficult for me already for this one reason. Sure some cities have good subway and bus systems but still, there are so many places you can't go as a blind person. Or you just have to pay yourself to death by using taxis all the time. It feels quite discriminating to me to be honest. I know it's not intended to be discriminating against blind folks but that is the effect. It makes me sad to think that Woody Guthrie sang ""this land is for you and me"" but if you're a blind person in, say, Wyoming or Montana, you're just screwed. You have to depend on the kindness of other people to drive you around and that really sucks. At least I know I would really hate that.",,,2,0,0,

I've had a similar situation on the bus just the other day, when a woman asked my wife whether I wanted to have her seat. My wife replied by saying: ""No thanks, he's okay"". For the next 20 minutes or so I felt incredibly miserable and I couldn't quite pinpoint why. Then I suddenly realized that this was not the first time this had happened. In fact, people talk to my wife ALL THE TIME when they have a question about me. Whenever I'm out on my own they ask me directly but whenever I'm out with my wife, they only address her (although the question usually concerns me). This is extremely hurtful. It makes me feel like I'm some dog or something like that. It's super dehumanizing. I just don't understand why people do that. I later talked with my wife about it and it was an enlightening moment for her too. I was legally blind for my whole life but my vision has become much worse during the past 3 years to the point where I'm practically blind. So all of this stuff is still quite new for her and me. We have agreed that she will try to react differently next time this happens and simply tell the person to ask me directly.

If it's a cartoon... sure.

Practical makeup can't make someone white look black and vice versa. I think if you write a character that's black you need to hire someone who is black.

Blind is totally different. If I put on a blindfold I can now understand what it's like to be blind.

I'm losing my sight but I still have probably 50% or so left (it gets worse every day). You bet your balls I can imagine what it's like to be 100% blind. For lack of a better term this is just some ""SJW trash"".

Like I said in other responses they were probably pulling their hair out looking for a blind actress who fit the character. Can you imagine the positive (and free) PR?",,,1,0,0,
