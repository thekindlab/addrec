I don’t use a cane, and I don’t read Braille, and I think I have a pretty unique situation? I’m in a weird spot where I can barely squeak by as sighted, but it’s very difficult. Print is very difficult for me. It’s hard for my eyes to focus, and it’s also blurry. I have a small blind spot too. It just removes detail, and is like a blend of the colors around the blind spot. When objects are in motion, or when there is a moving background behind a stationary object or print (like subtitles) I find it very difficult to read. Larger objects I consider to have a clearer image, but I don’t necessarily trust my definition of clear as I didn’t know what that truly looks like. Finer details like text are much harder to see. Painting are a very good example of this. I can never tell what the picture or painting is unless I’m right in front of it.",,,1,0,0,

I completely agree, a child born blind won’t know any other way of living and wouldn’t be so affected by a “loss of vision” because there was no loss. But to lose your vision suddenly, I can’t imagine how difficult it is to relearn everything from square one. 

I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me to share their individual journeys, I’m ashamed to say I was ignorant and never realized how many different eye diseases there are that could result in blindness/visual impairment. Yours particularly fascinated me, with the geometric patterns and colors that cloud your vision. 

Something I’ve seen consistently stated here is that people suffered from a lack of support and counseling. I think this is just awful and there should be more resources available to people who are blind or losing their vision, as it’s such a drastic change of pace. The lack of support often leaves people feeling like they have nothing to live for. Being here and seeing how many people have come out on the other side is inspiring. I’m hoping to start an outreach club at my university for students who are blind and need help accessing helpful resources and counseling to address their emotional needs.

06dc7ed2-a581-469b-ac67-f5055dc61789,1568506716,"My first thought is that 'blind' doesn't always mean everything is black. Decide what kind of blind you want your protagonist to be. Would she see fuzzy shapes and colours? Perhaps just light and dark? That's going to impact how she functions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; what would be her most important means of taking in the world? 

It's a common misconception that blind people have better senses. It's only true in that we train our senses to help us. Most people have a primary sense they rely on for a particular task, but humans use every tool at their disposal. For example, when filling my water bottle I use a combination of sound and touch to know when to turn the tap off. Humans don't use their senses in isolation.

Most blind people have their own unconscious tricks they develop to help them perform everyday tasks, but for full efficiency we often undergo orientation and mobility training or something similar. If your protagonist doesn't have someone to train her, there may be some interesting inefficiencies in the way she does things, so factor that in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How far can could she hear or smell things from? 

It's hard to get specific here so I'll go with my experience. I have pretty good ears naturally, but because what I hear is so important to me, I can't actively tune out sounds like a lot of people can. In a crowded place I will struggle to hear the person talking next to me, but that isn't because my hearing is poor.

I use my hearing as my primary way of crossing roads. Traffic has certain patterns to it that you can train yourself to recognise. Sound like that is very directional and you can get a pretty good idea of how far away a vehicle is by the frequency of the sound, but that took years of effort to perfect and I still don't always get it right.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is, how good your protagonists' senses are depends a lot on how much effort she has put into training them.

 

&gt;What can cause misunderstandings simply because someone with sight wouldn't think about it at all?

Facial expressions, bumping into people, shaking hands, not recognising someone you should be able to recognise. Most blind people wouldn't look blind if you took away their cane/dog. I sometimes get whispers about how I don't look blind at all. Blindness doesn't have a 'look', so your protagonist might encounter some of the same ignorance that we deal with. If your society is feudal or patriarchal she might encounter a lot of ablest thinking - you can't be doing that, you're blind/a girl/a blind girl!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How would she explore a new environment?

Depends a lot on her character. Would she ask for help? How important is it to her that she appears normal? If I'm going to a new venue I usually turn up early and scout the place, touch everything, walk the perimeter so I know where my hazards are. I don't particularly like doing this in front of people.

These days I'm more secure in my disability and will typically just ask someone if they could show me to the bathroom, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What should I take into account all the time when writing?

Consistency. She's not just blind when it suits the plot, she is blind all the time in every situation. I would recommend keeping notes on little nuances as you would with any POV character and check each scene against those notes.

A good example of this done poorly is when a protagonist's power is established as x. If they  suddenly display x2 powers to defeat the BBEG without having undergone some training or transformation, the victory feels cheap to the audience. But if they are threatened by a situation we know they should be able to overcome and they just flop over like a wet tissue, it feels frustrating.

If you establish that your protagonist can safely cross a busy street 90% of the time, and then have her get run down by a horse when she's being chased, that feels believable. But if she just gets run down out of nowhere because the plot requires it, that's going to feel pretty cheap. I don't think I'm explaining this too well, but I hope you get the gist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And most importantly, what am I completely missing because I lack the perspective of a blind person?

Good question! How doe she know who someone is? Is she good at voice recognition, and if so how long does she need to spend with someone to get their voice down?

How does she choose her clothing if clothing is important? I went through a phase of wearing the same outfit day in and day out when I was 12 because I had been made fun of for my terrible fashion sense.

How will she navigate crowds of people? If she lives in an era where a cane isn't recognised, people wouldn't move out of her way.

Her friends will often forget and might, for example, point and say 'look at that' only to realise a moment later. Seriously, like, my mum still does this after 28 years.

Unless your society is super enlightened, people will look consciously and unconsciously either pity her or even revile her. People these days sometimes try to take advantage of me by, for example, cutting queue in front of me and in a couple rare cases trying to steal things from me. I'm certain that I've been taken advantage of without even realising it.

My boyfriend regularly plays tricks on me or jokes about me and sometimes it's funny, and sometimes it's downright depressing and that's someone who loves and respects me.

Bottom line here is that, although her disability doesn't define her as a character, it will define a lot of how she interacts with her world and her people. In my opinion the most important thing to get right about a blind protagonist is to strike a nice balance between superpower blindness (Daredevil) and being a completely helpless damsel (every other media interpretation of blindness). If you can manage that you're doing pretty fucking good.

Good luck!",,,10,0,0,

I walk with my left arm slightly extended because I find walking in a straight line impossible. My hand will contact any wall before my shoulder will which lets me avoid painful collisions.

The water bottle trick works well for other objects. Where sound doesn't work, I slip a finger on the inside of a surface to where I want to fill. Somewhat dangerous when making tea but better than spilling boiling water all over the bench.

When eating I use my knife to feel out the food before attempting to get it on my fork. Doesn't work so well with peas or mushy food.

I find the entrance to buildings by following the sound of the biggest crowd of people and/or looking for a bright sign if there is one. It's not fail proof but usually works. One time I ended up at a rally for something because they were gathering outside a local mall.

I wash dishes by feel. I actually get them cleaner than most because a lot of grime and grease can't be seen, only felt.

When going somewhere new I look it up on maps and count the number of turns. For example, 3L, 2R, 6L means I turn left at the 3rd street, right at the second and left again at the 6th. I also have landmarks, like I couldn't tell you a street name or address to save my life, but I can tell you to turn left at the big IKEA sign. Wouldn't work for your protagonist but she might navigate by sound or scent landmarks, like wind chimes or a bakery.

Also worth noting, I'm very clean and tidy by necessity. I can tell you where everything is in my home because it's always in the same place.

Once they had all required documents, it took maybe four months. I ultimately based my decision on factors of research, word of mouth from O&amp;M instructors and, to a lesser extent, because they got back to me quicker.
 I elected not to have a preference in breed, as what I wanted was to be paired with The best possible option as seen by the trainers. 
Ended up with a medium-sized black lab. 
I have nothing but good things to say about my experience at Leaderdogs. Staff was lovely, trainers were excellent, comfy and nice lodging. 
Being from Florida, I thought it was a real treat to do mobility in Michigan during winter. It was also nice meeting and getting to know a bunch of other dog handler’s over the training period of about just over three weeks. I made some friends whom I still keep in contact with. It was, all in all, a very lovely experience.
That being said...

Having a guide dog is a major responsibility. You have to work them often to keep their skills sharp, exercise their bodies and stimulate their brains to keep them healthy and happy. Hygiene maintenance is also super important.

1) I need to be careful to keep an appropriate facial expression up. If I'm really focused on something I think about, my expression just goes blank/slack, which people interpret as sad, tired, unmotivated, even angry.

2) At the same time, people always talk to me louder, which makes them sound angry/annoyed by default, and I automatically respond by being defensive.

So, for me, it's an absolute yes. People overinterpret my lack of facial expression or body language, whilst I feel like they're constantly yelling at me.

We should be clear this is just a super basic introduction to allow people to get around the house and be guided safely. I always have a sighted helper (often my longsuffering partner, thanks Phil) to make sure nobody is going to go home limping.

Obviously you start with basic verbal instruction and body position stuff that I can just feel. For actual travel their left hand goes on my left shoulder, their right hand over mine on the cane so they know where my body is pointing and where the cane is going. I'm tiny so it's not awkward. We go down an edge then maybe someone puts out an obstacle then we go find it together a few times. Then they go in front and I can then check they're not drifting or over covering which is the big problem most people seem to have. We graduate from them hearing the obstacle going down, to not knowing where it is. When we do kerbs and steps we go side by side, me on the left because I can travel left handed better than they can, then we go find the kerb. One thing I do that will make O&amp;M people scowl is have them pick a hand and mainly stick with it. What if you're carrying something etc.

Lots of attention is paid to how to guide someone but I am big on how to be guided. I get my partner to guide and I tell them to treat him like someone they don't totally trust, and develop their ability to find stuff they're about to be walked into, especially steps. I also do a lot of the doorway thing because that's also training for whoever they live with.

I think the most important thing is not even really technical. I make sure whenever we go out and about I always have my cane, which makes it OK for them to have theirs. Often we're both being guided by my partner and obviously with him I wouldn't bother with the cane, but I make a point of having it out so that in the very early days they get that it is normal and okay and not freakish. Maybe that sounds really remedial but that's the sort of level we've been at.

Does that make sense? I hope nobody has any huge objections... yikes.

Here’s my perspective causing me to hold such a stance and my evolving view of it.

So over the last few months I’ve been finding many posts on Reddit are faked to get karma, like in TIFU, NoStupidQuestions, and relationship advice. This blind post set off some alarms triggering my skepticism.

Namely:
1. Tone of the post, and judging that looking at poo being gross when such a concept is not guaranteed.
2. Accuracy and speed of typing. Nuanced hand typing done quickly with little to no mistakes.
3. Use of visual emoticons like xD :) =)

Several things have changed my mindset over the last week or so.
First OP has been consistent and persistent, so I’m doubting it is someone faking at this point.
Second, /u/8bf4fe53-7c88-4dda-8e08-438c2f011c93 an older account that has been replying to comments with more details triggered me to reflect.
Third, all the above alarms suggesting a fake are not proof positive, each can be explained away.

However, this is done without first looking into the existing technology and issues with it (which blind people have written about extensively), the wishlist of actual blind people (which may not be for an annoying noisy cane so much as one that is sturdier, lighter, folds better, or whatever). While you’re right to want to learn from actual users (rather than just inventing something useless with no input at all), there’s a downside to just jumping in and quizzing blind people without doing your own research first. 

Keep in mind there is, essentially, survey fatigue. People may get tired of being asked the same questions over and over every semester by some new student or students, but never getting followup, never seeing technology, never even knowing if their feedback was used or ignored. 

Remember, you’re not paying people for their time to do this user research, so you should at least do everything you can to do your due diligence first. I think the pushback you’re seeing is largely that not using the proper term for the most basic and common of tech (and the tech you’re doing your very project on) suggests you didn’t do any background research. There are hundreds of YouTube videos about cane use, thousands of websites about the tech, about O&amp;M (please google that abbreviation, it’s orientation and mobility), etc. You can learn a lot before trying to reinvent the wheel or improve on it with a fancy new square smartwheel.

Regular check-ins, keeping us in her site and sometimes cheap 2-way radios all serve their purpose as she gets older, and of course this will progress to her own phone or GPS-based watch as she ages.

While we eventually got a touchscreen Square POS, we used talking cash registers before that. As for stocking and inventory, we used bar code scanners and apps on our smartphones, which are extremely fast and accurate.

In fact, there are blind people all over the States who operate their own food service businesses on their own. While many choose to hire line cooks, some do all the cooking themselves. What's more, all of them independently manage their business—including payroll, ordering, and vending machines.

In short, with adaptation, blind people can do damn near anything our sighted peers can. The largest obstacle is ignorance. Unfortunately, the only frame of reference many people have of blindness are dramatized depictions of blindness in popular culture.

Consequently, many people look at us with some form of pity and infantilization. We're perceived as less capable overall.

Even the simplest achievements —like walking to a nearby coffee shop—becomes this tear-jerkingly inspirational accomplishment for no other reason than the fact we're blind.

So, OP and any other sighted person, my challenge to you is that you conceive of blindness as a mere attribute, like brown eyes or curly hair. Yes, we can do many of the things required of us at lots of jobs. We just have to find nonvisual ways of doing them.

Lastly, I'd encourage any newly-blind or any blind person to seek out training so you can develop the confidence and skill to handle any work-related and non-work thing that comes your way.

I grew up using notetakers, albeit the older Windows CE ones from Humanware. Today, I code for my job every day, plus do some DBA work and server admin tasks over SSH. I haven't touched a notetaker in about six years, because my phone and standard computers do so much more. The simplicity and ease of notetakers is their big selling point, and they're not bad machines at all. My BrailleNote was my best friend from sixth grade through college, after all. But I didn't use it for serious coding. Hacking on JavaScript using a notetaker was a wonderful learning experience, but that was all self-taught, not part of any class. Learning Python, or PHP, or how to manage a server, or most anything beyond the very basics simply can't be done as well on a notetaker as on a computer. The sooner your student learns Windows or macOS, the better off he'll be. If on Windows, by the way, use NVDA as the screen reader if the school/state doesn't want to pay for Jaws. NVDA is free, and even written in Python. I've used it as my primary screen reader for years, even at my job, and it does great.",,,1,0,0,

f2b3a667-f5d5-4b8a-9cec-7aaf28706f8a,1567530099,"Thanks for the feedback, and this is exactly why I wanted to ask! I gave very superficial context in my post and probably wasn't as clear as I should've been, and I apologize for that. I'll try to address both your comments in this one. I'm on mobile so I can't look back at the other one while writing this, but I'll make edits if needed. 

I promise you I am trying to write her as a person first. To clarify something, the story is NOT about her getting her sight back, and she's not only getting her sight back just to see. She's doing her best to live and train despite her blindness.

To add more context, at the start of the story, there are only two species introduced: human and eladrin (think elves). Humans are very weak, having minimal amounts of magic compared to the eladrin. The eladrin are incredibly powerful, boarding on demigods relative to the humans. However, they act as protectors from the perspective of the humans (wink, wink).  

The strongest (read: with the most magic relative to their brethren) humans are conscripted into the Eladrin military where they act as infantry. This is seen as a great honor and almost every human dreams of this. The greatest achievement a human can fulfill is becoming a member of the Eladrin's honor guard, for lack of a better name yet. Lesser honors are being chosen for other skills and allowed to live in the eladrin city. 

The character's father and brother were both taken into the military, cited as having immense power, for humans. As such, this character, despite her lack of sight, believes with her ""obviously"" high magic reserves will be taken in anyway and her sight will be restored, fulfilling her dream of being in the military and potentially the honor guard. 

So, her actions are as someone who views themselves as temporarily blind since she'll obviously be chosen and since she's so strong they'll obviously restore her sight, except she has almost zero magic within her. 

The plot device, while giving her limited sight, is very valuable in this world and is proof of the eladrin's real agenda. It's more like she finds this thing that sets her off on a journey to find the truth while giving her the ability to see the flow of magic and that ability will play into the overarching narrative of the journey. 

Her lack of power will make her come to terms with her blindness. And, taking some advice from you, I'm thinking of only allowing her to see the magic when she's either holding or actively using the plot device (it's a weapon, naturally). This way she is still blind *most* of the time. 

I understand writing to try to ""fix"" her is offensive, but in a world of magic, it's not out of the ordinary for eladrins to perform great acts of healing. Another idea I'm throwing around is the chance for her to be healed, but refusing to go through with it due to fear of losing the magic sight. 

I hope that's fixed a few things. Please let me know if I'm on the right track or if I need to completely scrap this idea. Thanks!",,,2,0,0,

Certain parts were of cooking and cleaning are also difficult, but there are ways to make it easier, either with specific equipment or trusting my other senses.

My advice is that we blind and visually impaired folks are already pretty well served when it comes to adaptive technology (a.k.a. gadgets).

So, I can't say I have faced any similar situations as you on reddit, but I wanted to comment anyways. I read through your post and a lot of the comments were pretty frustrating, to be honest. I can understand that a large majority of people have never interacted with or even thought about blind people for any real length of time, so all the questions like ""how do u even use internet??"" are expected. (But annoying). However, a lot of people seemed to just straight up deny that it was even possible for a blind person to respond to so many comments, or use emoticons (as if blind people don't have emotions?). Those comments were the worst, because obviously they have no idea what they're talking about, and they can't fathom that it's even possible to do things without sight.

It really sucks that you have to explain to so many people what seems so basic to us.

To answer your question: What probably gave the most pause to people was your use of emoticons and the way you structure your comments. You are very expressive with your text in terms of capitalization, punctuation, and emoticons. I'm guessing that people just wouldn't expect that from someone who can't see? Or, again, they're just really dumb and don't think blind people can use the internet in the same way sighted people can.

I saw that you edited your post to explain your setup and I think that was a good idea to help stop those comments, although with how much that post blew up I don't think you could've done much more.

Either way, it's not your fault and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. However, I'm glad you got to educate some folks, and hopefully they'll pass that knowledge on to others.  Hopefully others can chime in with some better advice.",,,9,0,0,

Some people have internalized issues with weight gain, and it has nothing to do with their eyesight. I know some blind people who are as fatphobic as some of the most fatphobic sighted people out there.
Blind people have ideas of what they find attractive just like anyone else does, and the idea that they do not is a misnomer.

Slightly off-topic, but related to this question: the BMI scale is absolute bullshit. My weight has fluctuated quite a bit over the years due to a few different forces at work, and I have noticed one thing. BMI does not take into account pretty much anything. It doesn’t take water weight or the weight of your muscle into account at all, for one. For another, there can be large deposits of fat on your body that are just going to be there, whether you like it or not. People with larger breasts come to mind.
Also, weight distribution makes different amounts of weight look different from person to person. I weigh about 150 pounds right now, but, by all accounts of the sighted people I am in close proximity to, I look maybe 125.

My right eye has the same problem with intra-ocular pressure, but although it was enough to kill my optic nerve it isn't enough to cause corneal dystrophy.

Blindness is hard to tackle in my opinion.  Your comfort zone shrinks dramatically and in my case too much to have the critical mass required to regrow it back, which means that although I've been blind for 5 years I am yet to adapt and accept.  This is caused by the fact that I used to have very narrow yet deep interests in coding which are severely hindered by my inability to see.  While I can still code I can only do so at a very superficial level and only under extremely favorable conditions, so I can't work on just about anything like I could before.  I think that we are living in a golden era which is the worst time ever to be unable to fully enjoy life due to a disability.

Regarding Braille and other skills in general I contacted the national blind association here in Portugal (ACAPO) when I went blind and they directed me to the only rehabilitation center in my country which fortunately is not too far away from where I live.

I have a Mac and an iPhone so I use VoiceOver on both which is a screen-reader that comes built-in MacOS and iOS, and when for some reason I have to use Windows I rely on NVDA which is the screen-reader that I was trained to use in rehab.  Beyond screen-readers there's also dictation which helps a lot on mobile since at least I type very slowly on the on-screen keyboard compared to when I had sight.

I never had many friends, and all my friends were people I met online who shared my passion for coding, and although we used to meet in person from time to time most of our interactions were online.  Going blind made me lose contact with these people, and apparently without me the group ended up disbanding.",,,1,0,0,

Thankyou for replying, and I totally get what you are saying. Though, if you train someone and they fall down a flight of stairs they're just as free to try and sue you as me.

Begin rant. I have very mixed views about RNIB.

Every person I have seen had given up on RNIB. I don't blame them, I did the same. Most RNIB people are well meaning but it can feel as if you are being metaphorically sent to a crappy nineteen seventies psychiatric hospital which smells of cabbage where people talk at you slowly and kindly. This happens at a time when you are clinging super hard to normality and the instituational feel is just horrifying. Is this your life from now on? It's like ice down your spine.

I also have a feeling that RNIB policy is made by people who were born with little or no sight. There's this weird propaganda that there's no reason for anyone to be unhappy about sight loss. I guess we probably agree that it's not about liking it (I don't LIKE it). It's about handling not liking it in a healthy way. But when you are new it is frightening to realise the experts don't seem to understand that distinction.

I think I am being sent the problem cases. Naturally I am totally keen to do everything I can to do it as well as I can but I've actually been quite hard put to discover what it takes for someone to become a mobility trainer or even if it's possible for me to do it, or even who controls that.

Sighted person here, but maybe I can still lend some perspective on this.

There's a few things to untangle here:

1. First and foremost, people are idiots.
2. Apparently, blind people on the internet getting accused of faking is a thing, unfortunately. Molly Burke, a popular blind Youtuber, still gets accused of faking to this day in the comment section of her videos. It makes no sense, and trying to understand what motivates these people is wasted time. Don't even bother arguing with them, you don't need to justify yourself to anyone. Feeling that you need to address or respond to personal attacks, slander, misinformation or anything like that is actually part of the problem. It's fine to let those dumb comments stand - anyone with half a brain will put them in the right context when they read them, and realize that you just didn't feel the need to dignify them with a response.   
3.  We sighted people can ask some pretty dumb questions of blind people, and be ignorant about how self-sufficient many of you are. It can honestly be quite surprising for us to see how well you use the internet for example. We rely on our vision so damn much that it's mind-boggling to us how well people can manage that lack that sense. It also took me a lot of reading, listening and watching to realize just how independent blind people can be. So, sighted people then react differently to this: Some with wonder and astonishment. Others unfortunately jump to the conclusion ""I don't understand this, it can't be true, therefore they must be faking"". Don't mistake genuine interest for accusations though: Tone doesn't come through well over the internet, and often it's just us asking a dumb, but sincere question.
4. There's some really strong groupthink on Reddit, at least in some communities. Unless you fall in line with that, you're always going to get some level of resistance, antagonism or controversy. It requires a thick skin, but it can be worth it for the 5% of awesome people or ideas you might find. But you need to develop a skill where you can quickly identify comments that aren't worth your time, and quickly brush them off. I imagine that this might be more difficult with text-to-speech though.
5. You'll always notice the ones that sting more than the positive ones. Dramatically so. It's unfortunate, but this applies to pretty much any internet media, be it Twitter, Reddit or YouTube. You may just have read 10 positive comments in a row, but that one that hurts you just stings. We all have that bias. But being aware of it helps a lot with moving on quickly from those.",,,3,0,0,

With NVDA 2019.2 and the German 8-dot braille table it comes with. those characters are shown as follows:

* ĝ: dots 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8.

\- Make sure you have walking shoes that you really like. You are going to be walking a lot. A broken in spare pair is a good idea.

\- Bring a lot of books or a tablet for videos, you'll be waiting around a lot.

\- Be very open with the instructors about your thoughts and feelings about how it is going. They do listen and the sooner you say something the sooner it can be answered or resolved.

\- Be sure you are very clear abut what your needs are before you go as this will improve the quality of your match. It will also let them correct any unrealistic ideas you have about what a dog can offer. The field reps, instructors and non-instructor support staff all work together as a team to make sure you have the best preparation and experience possible.

\- When you ""graduate"" you are not done. The learning will continue for both you and the dog. Try as much as you can to stick with the rules. You can relax some of them eventually but don't do it too quickly, you and the dog will both be better off in the long run if you adapt slowly. The dog's guide work will continue to improve over their career, as long as you continue to provide the right environment and consistent support. 

\- Remember that the dog is yours and your responsibility. Family members should defer to you regarding the dog and limit their engagement. These are young loving dogs and crave interaction. That interaction should be primarily with you as they should always remain focused on you. They will work better for you if you are their primary support. Feed the dog, relieve the dog, exercise the dog, play with the dog yourself. Don't depend on others to do these things unless you are physically unable.

\- Enjoy your dog! Bond with it, play with it, snuggle it, love it. Enjoy your new mobility and freedom. Zoom through a crowded transit station! 

\- Talk to other people with guides including your classmates. Everyone will have something to offer.",,,9,0,0,

That probably depends on their age when they lost their sight and the degree of blindness.

My sight loss was sudden at the age of 40.  1 minute I have perfect vision, 2hrs later I have no peripheral vision, charles bonnet syndrome (geometric patterns/colours over everything I see) and have trouble reading anything smaller than 18pt print.  The cause as a stroke during heart procedure.

For it to happen suddenly and so late in life was devastating, especially as for the first few weeks I had no depth perception either so preparing food or navigating my flat was very difficult.  It didn't help that I got zero help or support from health services for at least 2 months and even then it was minimal.

Suicide was something I considered more than a few times during the first couple of months and I did indeed feel like my life was over.  I already had mobility problems so now being unable to drive basically confined me to my small apartment unless my gf took me out.

5yrs on and things have improved dramatically as I'm 100% adjusted to the situation, but I can't honestly say I'd feel the same if I had gone 100% blind - especially with how dire blind services are in my area,",,,3,0,0,

2acc85db-19ab-4772-8e20-f968a9247d7a,1567430206,"so my 12 year old daughter is legally blind (completely blind in one eye, some useable vision in the other) and I use the word blind for her sometimes because its a heck of a lot easier to say shes blind or legally blind than to stand there for 20 minutes and explain that no, glasses won't actually help her to every stranger I meet. 

She can get around fine most of the time. She has enough vision that you might not notice right away that she's visually impaired, she runs around the house like any other 12 year old, but I find that when we are out and about, she's totally different with her cane and without it. Without it, she clings to my arm, or stops every time the ground changes to stick her toe out to make sure it's not a curb or a step up or down or a puddle (with no light perception in one eye, she has REALLY bad depth perception.) With her cane, she just moves so much more confidently. I think having a cane and learning how to use it are super important things, and if you just stick it  in your backpack or whatnot, no one even needs to know you have it unless youre in a situation where you want to use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for your parents. That's a tough one. I have a lot of friends with different issues who use different mobility devices and a lot of times their parents have trouble accepting that they need them. I pushed for my daughter TO get a cane and instruction on how to use it, but for several years, my family wasn't okay with it. ""I can just hold her hand"" might work at 8, but not so much at 14. This year she went on vacation with her grandmother and I was VERY pleasantly surprised to see her cane in some of the pictures. I don't know how much effort they are willing to put into learning, but you could try showing them a video like  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM8WPrl8aI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM8WPrl8aI)  to see if they'll start to understand how much a cane would help in high glare/uneven ground situations.

You have two options, as I believe you live in California. AB422 (1999) allows your DSPS office to convert your book including the online exercises in to Word® or what ever you are most comfortable using. It will be somewhat difficult for them but with time they will be able to get the content directly from the publisher and to generate the format you need. Your Prof will not be able to help in this scenario, it will have to be through DSPS. 

Second, you could ask for your money back and work with your prof on getting some alternative assignments. The problem is, of course, your prof will likely not be inclined to do that. Ultimately, this kind of situation will need to be resulved at a much larger level. Your school should have an EEAAP (equally effective alternative access plan) developed for this product it knew was not completely accessible at the time it was procured, but, as you are at a community college, I suspect they do not and are relying, unfairly I might add, on the DSPS office.

And honestly, most people that call 911 for a minor reason could just be driven to the hospital but they do it because of lack of public transportation at the hour or they can't use it and no one can take them. They also think they'll get seen faster but sometimes that isn't the case. 


But definitely for the people who truly need to be evaluated asap, they're usually already scared so just telling them what you're doing helps with conversation and easing their nerves for sure! Something as simple as saying I'm going to put some stickers on your chest can get a small smile from them simply because stickers is usually related to kids but the electrodes for the heart monitor use those stickers to essentially take pictures of your heart to show the rhythm it is beating in. Not a medic so I could have explained that poorly but that's what I usually go with. Lol.

I would recommend looking into something based on ubuntu or debian personally, because they're the most common and therefore it's easier to find software packages for them. 

Basically, with Linux, you can customise the UI and font sizes as much as you want. You don't have to worry about that stuff like you do with Windows or Mac. If you find that a program won't allow you the customisation that you want, then you can just uninstall it and replace it with something else. Even if a distro doesn't seem accessible at first or is missing something that you need, you can just replace it or add what you need. I should note that large amounts of customisation can be a hassle, so while it does give you the most freedom to make your system as accessible as possible, don't aim to just build your whole system from scratch if you're not familiar with Linux.",,,2,0,0,

But the pragmatics involved mean it’s generally not a great way to help actual people who are blind. When you get feedback from actual people who say “this isn’t the way to help”, it may be worth listening and not doubling down. 

Others with vastly more resources and expertise have created tech likely better than what you could create alone (like the Brainport lollipop of electrodes that gives tactile feedback to the tongue), and others are working on directly stimulating the visual cortex for very simplified “visuals” or trying to create artificial retinas that can be implanted at the back of the eye. But those projects can take million+ dollar grants and years of work from teams of experts with PhDs, and they aren’t guaranteed to ever see the light of day or provide day-to-day improvement for anyone, even with all those resources invested. Long run? Sure. Today? Good luck.

Usually the best way to “help” people is not to come up with an idea first and then try to convince them they need it. Instead, ask what barriers currently exist in their life and work to dismantle those. And those barriers might end up being legal (want to do some advocacy?) or social (want to do some education? some self work?) rather than technological.",,,3,0,0,

My daughter has FEVR. She was born without any sight and had two operations at a few months old to make her eyes as comfortable as possible for her. Shes now 7 and I'm telling you, these kids are robust! Shes in a mainstream school, uses a brailler, has best friends and gets around really well. She has a 1.1 braille teacher that assists her in class. She loves everyone in school and the other kids go out of their way to include her in everything.

She also figure skates (since January of this year) and has no fear of the ice. She has her second competition coming up and loves showing people what she can do.

If people tell her she cant do something, she will prove them wrong. Shes very independent and very stubborn.

Unfortunately I cant give you any advice on what may happen due to my daughter having no vision from the start. My biggest advice is, although it's scary, FEVR comes in so many forms and affects people differently, let her be as independent as possible as she grows up. It's hard as parents, we want to cotton wrap our children and make sure no harm comes to them. Let her explore, let her have those head bumps (of course help stop the big injuries), let her make mistakes and learn, let her discover her own way of doing things.  I wish you the best of luck, and as a fellow  FEVR parent - you've got this!",,,1,0,0,
afcdd2e6-242a-4f28-9fab-17c1d6f61767,1568669271,"I have a question about greeting. I'm from Europe, so it's quite common to greet people with a hug and/or cheek kisses (also when meeting them for the first time, 2-3 kisses if they are e.g. friends of friends). 

I once saw a doncumentary about a guy with no arms. He explained how people are more likely to hug him as a greeting, because (as he explains it) they don't want him to think they are uncomfortable with the situation, even if it would be more appropriate to give them a hand shake (e.g. for business meetings). He explains that he is also not always comfortable with hugging random people (which is understandable), so a preferred greeting is apperantly    a Squeeze on his shoulder. 

I'm wondering right now, is there a general way ""blind"" people (in any degree) prefer to be greeted or a way that is common to greet between not fully sighted people. I imagine getting random hugs from people when you are not expecting it can be a little surprising. 

I am happy for all the responses in this thread :) I personally don't know any ""blind"" people and I'm curious. When I see a person with a service dog and/or a ""blind stick"" I always try to cough or make myself present so they know I'm there. I learned from the blind youtuber Molly Burke, how scary it can be to walk around without seeing everything. It seems kind of obvious, but I think now I'm actually more aware of this. It's interesting to know more ways to be considerate without being patronising. There is a lot to learn! :)",,,4,0,0,

It’s also useful to consider that we are all pretty sensitive about being sold things now that the NDIS is here  - that is - it feels like sometimes service providers are putting the hard sell on to hit NDIS revenue targets.

There are multiple techniques and methods for chopping safely as a visually impaired person which already exist and require no extra tools, but knuckle guards and non slip cutting boardsare already soled in the mainstream market if they are helpful.  
&gt;  
&gt;Burns are similarly quite easy to avoid with common sense and patients in most cases.  Yes, it takes training or trial and error, but even touching most food while it's cooking shortly doesn't cause a burn, and touching even the inside of a hot pan unless it's full of extremely hot frying oil rarely does mroe than cause a slightly painful singe that is forgotten within a few hours at most.  
&gt;  
&gt;Grippy tongs, long silicone oven mitts with textured hand grips, dual handled frying pans, splatter guards, these things already exist and can help us augment our other skills and techniques if necessary.  
&gt;  
&gt;So designing new tools isn't really what's needed for the most part, unless your making what already exists cheaper and more available, such as talking thermometers.  No what we really need are simple improvements to existing devices.

&gt;Touchscreens with no raised lines or small dips/bubbles to feel when you've moved from one button to another, and dials that spin for ever and have no stops at either end can fuck right off, along with those controls on some ovens where you don't even touch them but use gestures near the surface.  
&gt;  
&gt;When changing a value such as temperature, there should always be beeps for each press, and ideally, different sounds/pitched beeps for reaching the minimum and maximum setting.  If you can use easily differentiated tones for other controls so that you don't get them mixed up, that's even better.  E.G. temperature and time sound different from each other in some way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having long alert beeps for preheat temperature being reached (even if the oven was already on and you've since changed the temperature) are also important, and a clear way of knowing when the oven has been turned on or off is vital for safety.  
&gt;  
&gt;Click stops for dials are great especially if it's only for common increments such as every 25F past 250.  
&gt;  
&gt;Having a physical pointer embossed into or shaped into knobs, witha clear difference between one end of the pointer and the other (such as a sharp taper) really helps too.  
&gt;  
&gt;With flush stove tops which have no traditional burners (such as on induction cookers) having a tactile ring helps us to center pots.  It doesn't need to be anything much, just something we can feel like a dotted line or tiny ridge around each one, nothing tall enough to truly interfere with the smoothness.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ideally, the most important settings/numbers around the outside of the dial (the non moving part) would be engraved, have small dots or raised lines, or even better, have braille labels on them, which should be allot mroe common than it is with the advent of 3D printing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of these things apply equally to toaster ovens, microwaves, ETC as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;Standardizing the use of braille on measuring cups and measuring spoons (such as on the handle just before the bowl part) is a long time coming, but still isn't there yet sadly.  
&gt;  
&gt;When ever orientation is important for proper usage, any orientation markings, arrows ETC should be tactile as well, and preferably located in an obvious place on the device.  
&gt;  
&gt;Any physical buttons/switches should have their identification symbols made tactile, either via engraving or raised print.  
&gt;  
&gt;Packaging should be marked when possible in some way to show which side should be opened, as it isn't always obvious.  Standardizing the marking/location would help with this allot.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can't think of any more right now but I know I'm only just scratching the surface.  Look at what some countries in Europe are doing and you will see how pathetically far behind other supposedly civilized countries are.  At this point, these things should be a standard part of the manufacturing process chain, and not even questioned at all, but apparently stamping out the likely insignificant additional costs of doing this is worth the time of corporate lobbyists and pencil pushers, and government officials are willing to take their word for it instead of funding research on the issue for them selves.  Yes, not all materials necessarily make this possible, but more than you might think, and with people actually bothering to try I think we could find alternative methods.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, the most important thing is to get experienced blind cookings to do in depth physical testing for you, weather at home or in test kitchens with a range of scenarios and vision levels, and to take their advice into major consideration when developing solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your interest and good luck.  I doubt your work will change anything as it's been this way for far, far too long, but even if I just educate you and possibly cause you to become interested in helping solve these problems, it's worth my time already.

For instance, for your specific hardware idea, from the outset something like the 'tile key finder' seems ideal, you can attach acoustic tiles on your important objects and then use your phone to make them ring and hence make them easy to track and find. But I've not yet heard of a blind user of these, in my interviews this kind of technology is viewed really holistically - e.g. knowing of the tech, the process of getting the device, spending money on it, maintaining it / charging it, learning to use a new app, remembering to use it, and actually using it has to be seen as a better experience than the alternative (e.g. just remembering where you left objects). Also in the home, 'finding' objects regularly isn't usually the main issue, and you can always lose objects you forgot to 'tile.' Your friend will likely learn to adopt behaviours and strategies that negate the need for this kind of assistive technology in the first place.

In my own line of work (sensory substitution) the devices that gain the most enthusiasm tend to be 'digital canes' like the sunu band, enactive torch or EyeCane, which are simple to use and can paint out the 3D space around them giving the walls a real presence and it can be an enjoyable experience. Anything more complicated than that tend to drop off a cliff adoption wise, still there are lots of potential options between the digital cane and full 'vision-into-sound' technology, and I would say I'm more optimistic on this technology than u/jrs12 is, as there are excellent distance sensors, thermal cams, and computer-vision algorithms that have not yet made their way into everyday assistive tech. I've had blind users get extremely enthusiastic about thermal cams for instance.

Also aesthetics are very important, whatever it is, you have to make it enjoyable to use, if vibrations on the skin doesn't sound super fun for you, then it probably isn't for anyone else.",,,1,0,0,

They are able to speak and communicate in settings where they are comfortable, secure, and relaxed, such as at home. People with SM experience such severe anxiety in the aforementioned social settings that their vocal cords become paralyzed, making speech impossible. It feels like the words are stuck, and no matter how hard you try you can’t speak. And if you do try to speak, no sound comes out. 

Elective mutism however, is deliberate and voluntary. Elective mutism is actually the dated term for SM. Until the 1990s, it was called elective mutism because psychologists thought people with SM chose to be mute. But then they realized that’s not true by any means, so they changed the name to selective mutism. The word “selective” doesn’t mean choice, but rather “certain”.

Other options include NVDA, and JAWS I would caution  against JAWS simply because it costs money to upgrade any version and the original license is pricey.  Make sure that her computer is newer say less than 3 years, just because of how hard the programs are in the hardware. 

If she is willing  to switch or open to using a Mac, go to a Best Buy or apple store and let her play around on one. There are hundreds of nuanced settings for VI users. A Mac Mini is $600 and will have all the accessibility features of any other Mac so price isn’t too bad there. 

If she is an avid reader there is a fantastic app called BARD mobile. It is created and managed by the library of Congress. 

There are also a bunch of OCR apps to help with reading written text, determine what kind of dollar bill you are holding. Even some for gps instructions that are designed around VI users.

&gt;And her big driving goal still seems to be to get sight back. Even if it's for some other reason, the implication that she can't be a strong fighter or member of society without sight is still very much there. Is there any reason why she can't be an aweawesome fighter without sight?

Exactly! She wants to get her sight back in order to be this fully realized warrior, but that's at the beginning/middle of the story. I want her to grow to realize her being blind is what's allowed her to see the magic that flows through the world. That's going to be her truly unique power. I want her to finally realize this isn't holding her back, but has allowed her to perceive like no one else has. 

&gt;If seeing is so crucial to military enlistment, why would anyone give her a chance at all if she has to have a magical device in order to fight?

She was supposed to be exceptional due to her immense magical reserves like her father and brother, but she wasn't born with it. Originally, she believed if she presented great power, they'd restore her sight because it would be a waste to leave her blind. I know that sounds bad, but it's supposed to be. I want her to have this twisted view on her own blindness. Like it's temporary. Once again, her whole story isn't going to be about this. She'll just be dismissive of her condition at first.

&gt;And how does she feel that someone has decided for her that she should have this limited device that only works in one setting and not in any other practical way?

Nobody decides it for her. She stumbles upon it by happenstance, and it turns out she has a unique interaction with it. No one else can ""see"" magic like she can.

She'll actually be quite similar to Toph since she'll only see the magic, so she won't be able to read and will be effectively blind even with the weapon if she isn't around objects with magic, like a stone prison.",,,2,0,0,

aa2318f9-a94d-4dca-9ae3-a83ab5f27bc0,1568336490,"I had to do some digging to find the experiment my professor was talking about. 

Basically this man was in a car accident and suffered damage to his visual cortex. His eyes however, were perfect. Doctors were puzzled as to how he could not consciously see (this was before they knew so much about the human brain and how it processes images). 

So the experiment went something like this: the man walked across a room (no string) and made it across. They hung a string across the center of the room and asked him to walk back to the other side. When he got a few feet away from the string, he ducked down. He told the doctors that it was almost like a reflex, he didn’t consciously know what he was doing. 

His eyes were functioning so his brain could see that there was an obstacle, but because of the damage to his visual cortex he couldn’t consciously see it. Instead he was guided by his own unconscious visual cues. It’s called blindsight, or subconscious sight. 

I’ll admit that I was wrong, and that example is a completely different situation when talking about a progressive eye disease or blindness due to some type of dysfunction in the eye. That’s my bad! Thank you for debunking that myth for me.",,,2,0,0,

6503e39d-af19-4467-93b7-16db19223437,1568822198,"Losing your sight is one of the most difficult things we can deal with, I am so glad your sister has someone working with her on this. There are resources available, and lots of good advice already posted- here are a couple more things I've found helpful.

First, a blog post from an individual who lost her sight, and what it was like coming to terms and learning to live with blindness. It was a powerful read, and the author is someone I really enjoy: [https://tink.uk/losing-sight/](https://tink.uk/losing-sight/)

Second, I don't know where you're located, but here in the SF Bay Area we have an organization that helps people ""learn how to be blind"" and offers all kinds of support and information. They are called ""Lighthouse for the Blind"" ([http://lighthouse-sf.org/](http://lighthouse-sf.org/)). Maybe they can help you find some similar entity in your area if you're not in the SF Bay area. 

I've found there are lots of tactile tricks and techniques for living without sight. Coming up with strategies for storage and organization that are based on feel rather than sight can be challenging at first, but often a simple trick or low-tech solution can help. 

Rather than bringing your phone into the shower and trying to read the labels of your shampoo and conditioner, a simple rubber band can help you distinguish between them quickly and without ruining your phone. 

Folding money a certain  way based on whether it's a five, ten or single is another technique I know that lots of individuals who are blind use.

Certainly learn about computer accessibility, and start sooner than later. It is emotionally exhausting to lose your sight, and I believe the challenge of learning how to use a screen reader is much more easily met when you are able to practice with some sight remaining. 

One practical aspect lots of people miss is the ability to touch type- or more accurately, keyboard. Have her memorize the keyboard, get one of the typing tutor programs, and go beyond the alphabet, help her learn the function and memorize all the other keys as well.

Most importantly, just continue to be loving and supportive. Patience and kindness will go far, as will a heaping helping of forgiveness. It will be a long journey, and your sister might not always remember how lucky she is to have you. Be strong, and she will find her way to independence and enjoying life. Good luck!",,,2,0,0,

My best friend who is totally blind, is also pretty stoic - so he doesn’t have facial expressions, besides laughter. He went blind about 9 years ago, so he certainly learned facial expressions before that and just chooses not to express himself that way. No one has a problem with it.

I have two cousins born blind, zero sight, and they get little smirks and smiles and laugh all normally. I’m not aware of anyone teaching them this, but we described movies pretty well, so maybe they picked up on it.

I don’t think it matters. We (the blind) still have tone, and people can adjust to our individual mannerisms and personality without too much trouble. (Some people are expressive, some aren’t - and their brains already handle that). But if it’s really important to you, by all means practice with a friend or family member.

When you grow up with lectures and guilt trips, you get a messed up perspective of healthy boundaries. Needing a ride, or carpool, is not a big deal with the right people, or it shouldn’t be. It feels like a weight because you were trained to think of it as a burden. But you’re not a burden.

I can spray paint my leather too, so I don’t miss painting!

I also get some enjoyment from cooking. I make up my own recipes like Snickerdoodle Cheesecake :-D it’s so good!

My family is large, I have 5 siblings. Everyone had gotten together at Disneyland for a sort of reunion. One sister had 3 kids and busy, another sister had gotten engaged the day before. So when I sat down after a ride for hours, no one even noticed I was gone. My retina had torn. I had worked for an eye center for awhile, I knew these symptoms were bad, and I kept trying to remember what they meant. I called my eye dr, and they won’t say anything (in the US) without seeing you, so I just sat, confused and in pain. I didn’t know I was in shock, and I didn’t know what to do at a theme park. We were staying at a beach in tents, no roads, I hadn’t used Uber or Lyft yet.

My brain just got stuck in a circle. I couldn’t get them to go home early, and I didn’t even remember planes existed. I was rushed into surgery as soon as we set foot in Arizona, on a weekend! That seemed to jolt my family into an apology, but it is still a terrible experience. They were always negligent parents, but definitely outdid themselves.

The initial surgery went well and I could see out of that eye for 1 month. But a vein (a cell from the outside, muscle part of the eye) started growing (in the inside of the eye) and muscles contract. It ripped the retina open again, and my right eye hasn’t seen anything since. If I’d had surgery right away, I don’t think the vein issue would have happened.",,,1,0,0,
9b89db52-bd9b-406c-adcc-508d61142ee1,1568314127,"I have been going blind slowly for 9 years. I am now legally blind, and only see clearly a few inches away - in one eye (other is gone). I didn’t notice any change to other senses at first, but I absolutely have the best ears in the world now. Someone can shut a car door down the street and I think someone is in front of MY house. 

Extra:   It’s always been odd to me that my brain improved my ears, but didn’t auto-adjust to the new distances. Why can’t I tell the noise is 100 ft away? Or maybe my brains working on it.

There IS an extra sense I can’t explain... like I’ll just KNOW when I’m about to hit my head on something...  (and no, no hair brushed on anything). I just stop in my tracks and look / feel around. I’ve just sort of thought it was fairies - I literally have no other idea what it could be, and have never mentioned it before.

Extra:   Same goes for when I’m looking for something. Scissors for example. I just had them, where’d I put them? It could be in multiple rooms... and I just outloud say “anybody see my scissors?” And every time I’m pulled toward them. I just KNOW where-ish to look. Again, I thought it was fairies.

Mental Images:
I have a (fully) blind friend who remembers colors and everything, but I’m losing faces and things. I’m remembering sizes and shapes okay... but I have to work hard to pull up things I used to remember - people, places, fav movies. This concerns me since my vision isn’t even all gone, but it’s been bad for years so I guess my brain is weeding it out.

Or, another possibility is my blindness comes with PAIN. A lot of pain. The interior of your eye has no nerves, but I have a great deal of horrible light sensitivity, and my eye muscles also become inflamed. I can’t take blood thinners (to help) as that could worsen my vision (interior bleeding). So for years I’ve had lots of bouts of mind shattering pain, and that definitely causes some memory loss - at least for me.

Stigmatism:
So far, no one has been unkind to me, even strangers, about my loss or limitations. However I have been very unkind to myself. I’d been an artist, so my identity was absolutely lost as the vision. That takes years to re-build. I lost my job a month ago, and that re-awoke a lot of inner turmoil as well. I’d always planned to kill myself at this visual level - not out of anger, just because I don’t believe this world has anything left I’m interested in. It’s hard to explain via text without sounding suicidal - it was just a decision I’d made years ago.

However, I just got married. He makes a lot of money so I don’t have to feel guilty. He’s shockingly good at describing the world around me, the couples, colors, interactions (his mom is an author, that might be why). And now I’m having a baby. So now I can’t just die, and I’m trying to accept the anger at my limitations instead.

So my point is, you might know a lot of happy, capable blind people - but don’t assume that’s normal, or easy. Pain, personality, support, adaptability....  it’s going to be different for everyone. If I hadn’t been an artist, it would’ve been easier. If my family had believed in my illness, THAT would’ve been easier. But if I’d been an introvert who didn’t know how to ask for help? That would’ve made all this a HELL of a lot harder.

2.  Age sucks in general. Bad back, arthritis...  bad vision is just one more thing to adjust to. And fortunately, there is a lot of support for age-related vision loss :-) I know cuz I was excluded from a LOT of support groups cuz I’m not old, lol!

3.  I don’t know how hard it will be for you to adjust. It was hard for me, but I’m still going through it. Keep good friends, get some hobbies that don’t need vision (like audio books, a musical instrument). Especially friends though. Having a support network will make everything easier.

4.  Practice. You can close your eyes or wear a blindfold RIGHT NOW to get used to what you can / can’t do! Don’t be afraid of it, especially when you can prepare right now! It’s not like losing a limb or throwing out your back - you can develop skills now.

5.  Lastly, let yourself feel emotion. If it’s sad, hard, or angry, don’t freaking bottle that up! You’ll turn into a beast or poison. Journal. Sing. Get some therapy if you can - get yourself right, or centered.

No, and I really wish this myth would die a death. Granted I was born blind rather than lose my sight later in life, but having known way too many people who've done the latter, still no. I do think we learn to pay attention to our other senses more, however. You may dismiss something as background white noise, whereas to me that's a detail or clue about what's around me. People who've lost their sight later in life are potentially still developing that skill. Like any other skill, not everyone--whether born blind or gone blind otherwise--will have the same level of capability. End of the day, it all comes down to observation/perception skills. If you're not an observant person, you'll miss details. It doesn't matter if those details are visual or auditory.

&gt; Do you have any instincts or reflexes that you’d expect only someone with vision to react with? (Inherently knowing there is an obstacle and being able to avoid it)

You could say that. I call it facial perception. Other people call it spacial awareness. Either way, I can tell without making contact with a wall that there's a wall there. Certain objects (note: not string, sorry prof) I can tell will be in my way and can try to avoid them. The same ability allows me to know when aspects of environment change--for example, when a hallway widens up into a more open area. If I know an area well enough (my apartment, my parents' place), I can navigate with no mobility aids at all and just rely on things like that facial perception.

&gt; Are you able to remember what things, people or places look like with mental images? Or do your other senses paint a better picture?

This is a tricky question. Never having had sight, I've never known what people, places and things look like--not in the same way you do, at least. But after 30+ years of being blind, I like to think I've gotten pretty freaking good at developing my own ideas of a place based on what's available to me. For instance, when I first moved to this city, there were two exactly identical apartment buildings next door to one another. My key opened the front doors to both buildings. I walked into the wrong one by mistake, and knew almost immediately. don't ask me how, because I couldn't tell you, but I got about a quarter the way down the hall and something felt slightly off. When I went next door, I knew why. Also, mental maps are a thing. Go to a particular place long enough, especially if you usually take the same route to get there, and you'll begin to pick up on particular details that come in handy as landmarks. Say you and a friend are walking to the bank for reasons. You're chatting away, and you pass by a parking lot with a water fountain in it. If you've done that route often enough, something in the back of your mind will ping very loudly and remind you that gee, perhaps you should have made a left when you passed that. Or perhaps that's just me.

&gt; And finally, do you feel there’s a stigma surrounding blindness? I hear a lot of people say that if they were to suddenly lose vision their “life would be over” but I’ve seen so many people adjust really well and in most cases continue living their normal everyday lives. What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

It's easy to not comprehend how you would do something without sight if you've never had to do something without sight. Putting on a blindfold for a day just doesn't count, as much as some folks would like it to. Life's hard. It's harder still when 1: you have to relearn how to do pretty much everything (this doesn't apply to me), and 2: you have to have the exact same arguments/conversations/discussions/whatever you want to call them with people who are as convinced you can't do X, Y and Z as you are they're wrong (this applies to me in so, so many ways). As you can imagine, this definitely translates to a stigma of sorts. And it's all over the place--including, depending on the jurisdiction, in education. But not just. Employment, accessing government services, daily interactions with people in general, it's really never very far away. What that looks like depends on the situation, but always comes back to a perception of blindness as being incapable. I've always said I don't suffer from my disability, but from people's perception of my disability. I believe that to be entirely and completely 100% the truth. I've had two jobs, and been to college. Those are probably my 3 biggest challenges--in all 3 cases, step 1 was overcome people's concerns about how well I'd do not being able to see. Unfortunately, this is a stigma that isn't helped by members of the very blind community it affects. There are lazy blind people. There are blind people who either choose not to do for themselves, or who've never been shown they can do for themselves. There are blind people who have never worked a day in their life, and couldn't do a job if you paid someone to hire them. And there are blind people who are perfectly happy being part of that group. I like to think they're a small minority, but it only takes one. I had to work against a member of that minority when I took the college program I did. He took that program previously, and expected people to instinctively know how he needed accommodating. This ended as you would expect--he flamed spectacularly out of that program. But because of their experience dealing with him, they were concerned about me. Once I established what had them so concerned (what I said above), it was incredibly easy to blow those concerns out of the water. I completed that program, with decent grades, and after semester 1 didn't hear so much as a word about the person who took the program before me. I'd like to say the story ends there, but it really doesn't. Every day, someone new needs an education. Some of them are willing to listen. Others not so much. I can't do much about that, and that's I think what irritates me more than anything else, but the ones who are interested in learning are usually the easiest to work with. The rest of them aren't worth my time. If more people even thought about the kind of questions you have in your OP, I'd have fewer headaches.",,,2,0,0,

I saw the video by the way, how blind People use Reddit and it was quite interesting. I thought the voice in the video was a bit robotic though and I wish you could hear my text with more emotion. Maybe that could be invented? I mean GPS systems use different voices all the time.

I love cats, I relate to cats and have a cat picture as my reddit picture. But if all I saw all day were cats, I don't think I could handle the real world too soon. It's okay in small dosages, but it shouldn't be pages of pages of pages. That is how you lose connection with how to comfort yourself in hard times. Not able to think about the seemingly tough issues we do need to think about because they get too afraid.

Think, question, never stop asking questions. Never stop seeking answers. And never stop looking for the source of your information. Because like you say, a good intent can turn really harmful, real quick.

I could tell that the martial artists there were chill when I was little but they were all adults because I just couldn't be in the kid group and no teenage group was available.. I could sense that the adults thought I was strange for being there though, not in a bad way, just like.. unique? Also I'm a girl and I don't think I remember many woman there unfortunately.

Edit: I have always imagined that you who are blind can see the world for what it truely is.

We are all feeling it yes, but you are putting such a huge existential crisis thought into a movie in my head that I didn't even know I could have there. I imagined it in a way I never have. But you put words on the reason why I am having trouble sleeping at night. We need to change our ways. I don't know if you can listen to or read any of my posts because they seem to be hidden for everyone but me for some reason but this is what I want help pondering. 

How do we change for the better? How can I do anything to change anything for the better?

I have been feeling myself relate more and more to you humans who are treated like you have disabilities. But personally I feel it should be said more like: you have these abilities = (random strengths you have that others don't, also ofcourse weaknesses but you got to give and take, like a video game, there is a finite number of points and you sound like you put yours in imagination and at the same time honesty. This is what I meant with I think you who are blind see the world for what it really is. I can be fed images over and over and over, TV, commercials, instagram, blablablabla, and now suddenly I will have been brainwashed to think a ceratin way.

But you seem to have skipped the brainwashing part (I have too because I don't watch TV, commercials, social media, etc) but I chose to. Some don't even know that maybe they should choose not to. Maybe if everyone starting thinking for themselves instead we would be in a much better place as you say.

I see what you are saying, if I romanticize you I will putting you further away from me and you want to be treated as you are, human as anyone else. But I'm not. I do these for every person, I try to see their strengths and weaknesses and listen to what they have to say. Thank you by the way for this incredible text. If it's okay I will be saving it on my PC with my own texts, but not to steal it or anything, I just want to bounce my own similar ideas off of them.

It's good that you are trying to make me aware, I am on the same wavelength there. Awareness is the key. Really listening to someone, even if it might not be easy to hear what they have to say. 

I have never talked to or met a blind person before today so I know what you mean with the division. I may be considered able bodied however but most neurotypical people would see me as not able brained. Or abled of emotion is probably the right word for it. I was always told growing up that since I have aspergers, since I was so stubborn, since I always caused upset wherever I went that I must be unable to understand peoples emotions. That is the opposite. I read about new research yesterday that goes perfectly along with my entire life experience, me, I am actually too emotional, thinking too much, unable to stop. But since I would make people angry with the way I was always honest and making people worried with how I showed emotion so intenesely. My little kid brain decided that I would just not speak and put on a blank mask, escaping into my own dreamworld. I never played with the other kids (only my best friend at the time because she would let me be myself and she didn't bat an eye while truely accepting who I was), I never hung out with my family. I just wrote, text after text, drew picture after picture. Trying to escape into some sort of safe bubble, but I ""escaped"" into a prison. An echo chamber with my own thoughts. And now when I love myself enough to have set myself free, I decided I am going to speak again. No more filter, no more mask, no more bubble. But it is having it's downsides too.

Like when I was small, people will be angry with me if I speak the truth. They will expect me to never cry, then when I have a breakdown and bawl from the pressure, they will be worried and ask if I am mentally unwell. 

It is like this frustrating dance of me, the kid who wasn't a kid on the inside, having to tip toe around every other adult and child who just wouldn't look the truth in the eye. Never looking in the mirror. I see now why, I see now why. They mean no harm. They mean well, but they arent used to seeing the world in certain aspects like someone like you would for example.

Basically people aren't used to raw, real, reality. They need it to be sugarcoated and filtered and prettified and numbed down by sugary drinks and action flicks who keep their minds occupied from the fact that we need to do something.

We need to look at each other with honest hearts and just fucking do something. Something positive. Change. Stop being fed what they want you to think, is all I want to scream. I don't know how I have this tiny bit stronger resiliance against it, I always have, but it has kept me unable to lie, I would just not speak at all if given the choice. 

I want to know how to convey my only well meaning wishes to people without them taking offense or becoming uncomfortable.

That is my quest, I think the key is the images we use, the language we use. And the compassion we try to convey them with.

It must be hard to learn, I tried a little bit earlier today with covering my eyes and putting on cricket sound in background and I couldn't ""see"" anything, no echo location. But I am honestly interested in trying to learn somehow. I have always had to find my own way of learning things, like now, I am brain mapping every thought and idea I come up with so I can connect the dots instead of them getting drowned out in the hurricane inside my head.

Maybe there is a specific noise, frequency, tone needed to send out the proper sound to sense objects. Maybe the bats who can echo locate have a clue in there. Okay I have to stop now, because I will keep going to late. xD

Deniro's acting was pretty good, I believe he actually went to a rehab facility to observe how people were trained. Keep in mind that the training is a bit different back then it is now.

His portrayal of his skills is... open to interpretation. Some people pick up the skills incredibly well, while others don't. His character is supposed to have been in the military for quite a while as well, so his experience and discipline in training would explain his relatively high skills. 

The one thing that seems unlikely is his ability to identify various women's perfumes. It isn't detection that I think is an issue, but recognizing a perfume is that exact one. Unless he sniffed a sample of each one and then committed the name of that perfume to memory, it seems a bit unlikely (and not a skill most guys pick up).

&amp;#x200B;

What it takes is practice. Don't try long flights at first, just do short ones and listen to the thing. Can you hear the air coming out of it, and if so, does it seem to be coming the same way. What you're trying to do is see if the trim is set right. If it isn't, this is gonna lead to you crashing all the time because the thing will drift to one side or the other. This is the first thing I recommend you focus on, because it will make your flying experience so much better if you get it set right. If yours has a knob, just try to turn it in slight increments, if it has buttons for the trim, press once in the direction opposite it drifts, so if it's drifting left, hit your right trim to balance it out. Do this until it's relatively straight, don't worry about tiny drifts.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, you want to start working on realizing when the thing is near stuff. Don't worry so much about crashes. The little guards around the blades will take your impacts.

&amp;#x200B;

Try not to fly too high. If you hit the ceiling, just throttle all the way down and let the drone fall. The reason being is that when the blades get too close to the ceiling, it's creating this suction force that yanks the drone up to the ceiling and it will stick there. When you get more advanced, you can start messing with throttling down all the way, then adding some power once the drone starts to fall, but for now, just let it drop.

&amp;#x200B;

Start playing with varying degrees of input to make turns. See how much it takes to say, turn the drone about 90 degrees or so. Avoid a lot of input, it just takes gentle manipulation to make it start forward or turn. If you give too much input, you will end up turning much harder than you want and probably will end up crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

When you notice a lack of power, land the thing. It's needing a new battery or recharge. Don't hold out until the last second, you've got enough to bring it in gently and don't need to just cut power. In fact, other than the ceiling thing, I wouldn't recommend cutting power in the air, you'll just incur unnecessary crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

Buy a cheap one. Don't worry about quality or anything like that, you might end up breaking it, but you don't want to buy an expensive one and bang the hell out of it at first. That's why I wasn't heart broken when mine burnt out. It lost the one blade motor,. so it couldn't fly because it had only 3 working blades.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I can say is do not fly it outside even if the one you get says it can handle outdoors flight. You will lose the thing. Wind currents will push it off course and you might not be able to get it back to you. Once you get comfortable with flying, if you want to risk it, I mean that's your business, but I wouldn't recommend this at first. The drone that I got was a little microdrone which could handle it and I did it outdoors and it really went flying even at the slightest wind.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and be careful how you insert your battery. Don't leave hanging wires. When you take out the battery, be damned sure you do not pull on the wire from either end. These are soldered right in there on the board and will break without too much force, so always pull on the connector to unplug the battery. You'll maybe have to get a nail under where the two connectors meet and pull out, but always put that force on the two connectors which are made to take the stress, not the wires.

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing regarding the transmitter. First of all, always turn that on first before you insert the battery into the drone. This is a safety thing because if something happens, you can just bind and throttle down. Secondly, if you do have buttons to operate the trim, some transmitters let you reset it by pressing both the left and right buttons simultaneously.",,,7,0,0,

How can we unlock the higher levels of being where we can shed our corporeal bodies and travel the multiverse in all its forms and dimensions. How can we learn to manipulate the space around us, to travel faster than light, to learn to manipulate time. Maybe FTL is really beyond possible, and we would need to concentrate on something like space folding to traverse vast distances. What if all that we are is like one big nexus to all that we could be?Everything we do, say, or even think. Everything we do creates millions of forces and counterforces. Then, we need to face the possible reality that every decision we've ever not made has been made by someone in a parallel universe and all the universes form the one large multiverse.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming back to the nexus, can we learn how to control our thoughts? Can we learn to unite the people of Earth so that our purpose becomes one. If so, how long will it take. At a 100 years I would estimate, but that's fairly generous and it will probably be more.

&amp;#x200B;

We cast ourselves out into space with our instruments. We probe using our telescopes out into other galaxies, nebulae and other solar systems. We want to know why other life is not presenting itself to us. But who are we that makes us important enough to warrant attention. If someone new moves into your neighborhood, maybe you go over and welcome them with a box of cookies or a 6-pack of beer. It's a nice gesture, but it isn't required. What if they don't want to know us. Would you want to know us in the state we are now if you saw things from the outside looking in? Give us a thousand more years maybe, but right now, even at the best, we're still half savage.

&amp;#x200B;

From their point of observation, centuries on Earth may pass as seconds for them. If so, could you still not see the savagery? It's funny that we fight to cure things like cancer, but our species is the cancer right now. Think about it. Cancer is invasive to the body and the immune system doesn't know how to effectively deal with it because the cancer cells are tricking it to think they are friend when they really are foe. Now, imagine you, as the lifeforms we have never seen. You are at your post on a station that's been made invisible to the Earth people. You see things on your screen passing rapidly by. We go from the roman days to gladiatorial combat to the early 1800s, and then you start to see the technology. Look at the explosion of technology from 1900 to 2000. We actually learned how to fly and the first automobile came out in mass production in 1903. Imagine that a bit differently. A baby learns to crawl and walk in the same day. Give it a bit more than a decade and our flying machines are being used to shoot down other flying machines. The same will happen later on in the 40's as well, but then, we learned to split the atom, and we dropped bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at the concrete encroaching from your post. Look at the animals forced from the habitats and having to either fall back or learn to adapt and survive in an urban environment. The Earth is the body and we are the invaders. So, now your supervisor calls down to you and puts the decision in your hand to make first contact with Earth. Would you do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the meat of the post. OP, is this what you wanted? Because I'm hardly the first to think along these lines. Just because I have a visual impairment doesn't make me some oracle of wisdom. You're not going to find magic in lack of sight. The magic has always been here for you to find in yourself and around you.

&amp;#x200B;

When you romanticize blindness or any other disability, you're essentially narrowing your own horizons. You're saying that there is an archetype for blind people, physically handicapped people, deaf people, mentally challenged people, and so on. You're also saying that we should fit within the parameters of that original pattern. Any derivation is just... not permitted.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't think that's your intent, but I wanted to make you aware of how that comes off, at least to me. Most of us are just doing what you would do, living our lives. We have good days and bad ones. But at the end of the day, there's more commonality to be found between the blind and the sighted than there are differences. For a long time, there has been this gulf dividing our two groups. Yours, the able-bodied is much more massive than ours. We live in a world where we get by only because the sighted have decided to put together resources for us. We still have to fight for new things. It's a battle for every bit of legal precedent that is set, or every new right that you all say we can have. But really, there doesn't have to be this gulf separating us.",,,3,0,0,

I've linked above to the relevant point in the video. 

The following description is from the beginning of the video:

A drama teacher (Lionel Richie] is teaching a class of students, his eye is constantly drawn to a pretty young woman in the class.

Through the video we are told that she is very talented, acting - music - sculpture - dance, and less subtly that she is sight impaired, clumsily walking with a short white cane someone gives her (I think her tapping technique improves later),  eventually we see her reading a large book of braille which drives the point home. 

At the same time the teacher (Lionel Richie) sings of his unrequited love as he watches her in various classes and tries unsuccessfully to get closer, even speechlessly calling her at her own home. I think you could call this stalking nowadays. 

This is the point the link above jumps to.

The teacher is summoned to the sculpture classroom where he finds the young woman has completed a life like bust in red clay of the teacher.

""I wanted you to see it so many times, but I finally think it is done"", she says.

""Tell me what you think of it?""

He responds, ""Oh, its wonderful.""

""This is how I see you!"", she implores as she reaches out and feels his face.

There is a hiatus as the guitar sings and weeps.

Suddenly Lionel pulls her hands from his face and starts singing again, ""Hello. Is it me you're looking for?""

I found this thread on the Times Educational Supplement (TES) forum [Calculators for visually impaired in external exams](https://community.tes.com/threads/calculators-for-visually-impaired-in-external-exams.501639/)

One interesting suggestion is to use the Texas Instruments ""Viewpanel"" device which is meant for displaying calculator screens on an Over Head Projector but someone suggests it might work for direct viewing with a white background.

TI also make a device called the [TI Presenter](https://education.ti.com/en/product-resources/presentation-tools-how-to-use) which will output the calculator display to a TV or other video device via a composite video connection (usually a yellow coloured connector on a co-ax lead).

For both these solutions you need either an adaptor cable for a student TI calculator or the ""teacher"" version of a TI calculator.

This doesn't help with the need for big buttons.

Another option the thread comes up with is using a locked down Ipad and a Ti-89 emulator or a [talking scientific calculator](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talking-scientific-calculator/id411433609)

&gt; But since exam boards do approve iPads (when properly locked down, obviously) for candidates with various other SENs, I can't see this would be impossible.

1.  The thing is that our other senses give us context too.  I assume it's gross because of popular media, smell, and texture giving us a vague idea of what it must look like.  Plus descriptions we may have come across such as on Reddit.  Some people like to get really colorful with their adjectives... LOL

I imagine it's easy to assume that if you can't see it, it can't exist in a way, after all sight is the most vercitile and used sense.

2.  People who are capable of doing so will ofter learn to touchtype instead of using the hunt and peck technique.  We can use the raised tactile dots on the F and J keys, as well as the number 5 on a telephone/calculator style keypad to center our selves and then from there we just move our other fingers to reach other keys.  These things were originally made for multitasking secretaries, but they now serve us well too.  Anyone can learn to touchtype, it's just more vital for us.

Of course that said, cheaper keyboards such as many laptops come with often have the problem of the bumps waring down over time, and odd keyboard layouts or oddly sized keys mess us up.

3.  As for emoticons, it's about context.  We don't understand what they represent, but we do understand how theya re used,jsut by context.  Plus, it only takes one sighted person to fill a blind person in and then for that blind person to spread it to other blind people for it to start reaching all of us eventually.

As for actual emoji, the screen reader she uses ""Voiceover"" has very good emoji support and can read any of the standard set, which is now massive.  Not all screen readers are so lucky though...  Most can only read a fraction of that, though ""Talkback"" for Android is nearly on par and ""NVDA"" for Windows is usually passable.",,,1,0,0,
9d9314ec-be0b-49a0-a37d-1b124bc6c581,1567610246,"Knife guides are possibly valuable for newly blind people who still wish to cook, but they should only be considered a temporary crutch if it can at all be helped.  There are multiple techniques and methods for chopping safely as a visually impaired person which already exist and require no extra tools, but knuckle guards and non slip cutting boards are already soled in the mainstream market if they are helpful.

Burns are similarly quite easy to avoid with common sense and patients in most cases.  Yes, it takes training or trial and error, but even quickly touching most food while it's cooking doesn't cause a burn, and touching even the inside of a hot pan unless it's full of extremely hot frying oil rarely does more than cause a slightly painful singe that is forgotten within a few hours at most.

Grippy tongs, long silicone oven mitts with textured hand grips, dual handled frying pans, splatter guards, these things already exist and can help us augment our other skills and techniques if necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So designing new tools isn't really what's needed for the most part, unless your making what already exists cheaper and more available, such as talking thermometers.  No what we really need are simple improvements to existing devices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Touchscreens with no raised lines or small dips/bubbles to feel when you've moved from one button to another, and dials that spin for ever and have no stops at either end can fuck right off, along with those controls on some ovens where you don't even touch them but use gestures near the surface.

When changing a value such as temperature, there should always be beeps for each press, and ideally, different sounds/pitched beeps for reaching the minimum and maximum setting.  If you can use easily differentiated tones for other controls so that you don't get them mixed up, that's even better.  E.G. temperature and time sound different from each other in some way.

Having long alert beeps for preheat temperature being reached (even if the oven was already on and you've since changed the temperature) are also important, and a clear way of knowing when the oven has been turned on or off is vital for safety.

Click stops for dials are great especially if it's only for common increments such as every 25F past 250.

Having a physical pointer embossed into or shaped into knobs, with a clear difference between one end of the pointer and the other (such as a sharp taper) really helps too.

With flush stove tops which have no traditional burners (such as on induction cookers) having a tactile ring helps us to center pots.  It doesn't need to be anything much, just something we can feel like a dotted line or tiny ridge around each one, nothing tall enough to truly interfere with the smoothness.

Ideally, the most important settings/numbers around the outside of the dial (the non moving part) would be engraved, have small dots or raised lines, or even better, have braille labels on them, which should be allot more common than it is with the advent of 3D printing.

Most of these things apply equally to toaster ovens, microwaves, ETC as well.

Standardizing the use of braille on measuring cups and measuring spoons (such as on the handle just before the bowl part) is a long time coming, but still isn't there yet sadly.

When ever orientation is important for proper usage, any orientation markings, arrows ETC should be tactile as well, and preferably located in an obvious place on the device.

Any physical buttons/switches should have their identification symbols made tactile, either via engraving or raised print.

Packaging should be marked when possible in some way to show which side should be opened, as it isn't always obvious.  Standardizing the marking/location would help with this allot.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can't think of any more right now but I know I'm only just scratching the surface.  Look at what some countries in Europe are doing and you will see how pathetically far behind other supposedly civilized countries are.  At this point, these things should be a standard part of the manufacturing process chain, and not even questioned at all, but apparently stamping out the likely insignificant additional costs of doing this is worth the time of corporate lobbyists and pencil pushers, and government officials are willing to take their word for it instead of funding research on the issue for them selves.  Yes, not all materials necessarily make this possible, but more than you might think, and with people actually bothering to try I think we could find alternative methods.

In the end, the most important thing is to get experienced blind cooks to do in depth physical testing for you, weather at home or in test kitchens with a range of scenarios and vision levels, and to take their advice into major consideration when developing solutions.

Thanks for your interest and good luck.  I doubt your work will change anything as it's been this way for far, far too long, but even if I just educate you a bit and possibly cause you to become interested in helping solve these problems, it's worth my time already.",,,6,0,0,

Talking to rehab centers and blind schools might help allot as most of them have cooking elements incorporated, but I'm not sure how far you want to take this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess another thing I could add would be that, when possible, the recipe published online and on the product packaging should augment visual indicators of progress (when you see small bubbles popping every few seconds for simmering) or (when crust is golden brown) with tactile and audible indications such as (crunchy  texture) (soft bubbling sound) ETC.  I know this would cost more to print extra, and that sometimes it wouldn't fit well without shrinking the print to unacceptable levels, but online instructions wouldn't have those limitations.

Speaking of online product recipes, they aren't always easy to find for certain products.  I think at this point it should be required that they be easily findable if the company is big enough, even if a more central database needs to be built.  This would help everyone, not just people who have trouble reading the packaging.

As much color coding as possible for things like silverware trays or storage containers would be useful too.  I know it's pretty common already and that sometimes it would mess up a coordinated set, but it could still be more common in certain places.

Tactile fill lines, not just on the outside, but much more usefully on the inside of the container are important too.  It can be done with most materials as a simple raised up line.

When ever possible, things should have large print instead of regular font.  I know sometimes it takes up too much space, but if it won't, then why not right?  I'm talkinga bout use instructions on devices and warnings on packaging.  Expiration dates where are already cryptic and overly hard to find, left/right indicator symbols and degrees.  I know that already is the case allot of the time anyway, but making it more standardized would probably help.

Additionally, the color of the writing should not blend into the material it's on when ever possible.  I know that most manufacturers wouldn't do this on purpose (they don't want people frustrated with their product) but making it an important guideline could help bring the point home.",,,1,0,0,

Between Siri in your pocket and a device like alexa in the home you have a massive range of possible interactions many consider those home assistants like Google or amazon's echo quite the help. If she does have an iPhone the watch that goes with it is also fairly helpful if you can figure out its use. It can make your phone beep for example so that should you misplace it you can follow the noise and recover it, a very handy feature, it can also track nasty falls and notify family, handy if she gets stuck on the floor and you can speak directly to Siri using the watch so you are not tethered to a phone that will run away on you.

She may wish to begin learning braille though not eveyone feels the need to do so. 

How does your sister get around? It may be worth looking into a service animal from a local charity or learning how to use a cane. 

Really though the most important thing you can do is just be there for her. If she needs help give it. If she instead wants to trip over the coffee table 10 times til she figures it out herself let her, cheer her on but don't coddle her. She is an adult after all her body is just a little uncooperative. 

Some other things you can do is to not move stuff about. Minor things can be a headache to find when someone had moved them. Leaving shoes or bags in the walkway can be a dangerous and unexpected trip hazard. One big thing will be building her confidence, from what I know of what you have described here a minor trip, slip or error could have significant pain and danger attached to it.

The one question I can answer for you is that, yes, there is  a stigma surrounding blindness. This is one of the rarest disabilities and what most people know about blindness comes from myths,  stereotypes, and whatever the latest Hollywood movie is making up about us today. People think that going blind means you magically acquire mobility skills and advanced senses when none of that happens. We get mobility skills through being taught them and our senses don't compensate, we just practice with them more. 
I think your teacher might have been thinking of a study where the senses of some blind people were taking over their visual cortex.

Having her narrative so focused on getting sight is a really negative thing for any blind readers and it's not something any of us think about on a daily basis. And suggesting that sacrificing her vision that she's questing to get back does kind of spit in our faces; if I had a choice between sight and helping a friend, it's not even a question that I would help the friend without even considering getting sight back. Your blind protagonist knows how to live her life as a blind person; if her big focus is to just see again, that dehumanises everyone who can never see or will never see again. 
I'm trying to be a bit less harsh but I'm afraid I run into this kind of thinking and these kinds of plots a lot and it's miserable. The only good blind characters I've read or seen in fiction in 30 plus years are Toph of Avatar (who isn't seeing, she's using her body in a way living blind people do) and Terezi from Homestuck (she doesn't give a hoot about being blind unless she can make a joke at someone else's expense over it and she uses tools like a white cane to get around; she even regrets getting her sight back at one point and purposefully blinds herself again).

And her big driving goal still seems to be to get sight back. Even if it's for some other reason, the implication that she can't be a strong fighter or member of society without sight is still very much there. Is there any reason why she can't be an aweawesome fighter without sight? If seeing is so crucial to military enlistment, why would anyone give her a chance at all if she has to have a magical device in order to fight? And how does she feel that someone has decided for her that she should have this limited device that only works in one setting and not in any other practical way? I think the idea still needs some work but it's got some interesting bits to it that aren't over done negative stereotypes. If it helps, blind people,  especially anyone who's been blind from a young age, learn to navigate life in other ways. Toph is a good example of this; people say she ""sees"" through the earth but that's really not what she's doing at all, she's rather using another sense combined with everything else she has to get around and do a lot more than just fighting. Toph doesn't see the world so much as she feels it and even still she misses things that sighted people would catch, which is part of what makes her such a relateable blind character. You can do something similar with your character but it will mean thinking way outside the box. I think the Avatar creators themselves said that they wrote Toph as a bratty kid who has great power and happens to be blind and you can see how that impacts her through how bitter she can be towards sighted people who underestimate her but also in how much she plays up the idea of the helpless blind kid expectation to get her way as needed.",,,2,0,0,

Yes you can still be a chef! You might have to take things a bit slower but most of the adaptive techniques for the kitchen are a matter of practice. Work on chopping stuff without looking and, if you don’t do it already, organise your kitchen and work space so you know in general where stuff is. You might want to get some skills training to learn kitchen safety and how to tell what’s going on with things you’re cooking without looking. I use fairly simple tools like a ceramic tile that rattles when water is boiling, talking timers and thermometers, and braille labels or puff paint dots on stove/oven knobs. 
You don’t need to change anything in your house unless you just want to. Put some puff paint or raised dots on your washer and dryer and dishwasher so you know where the settings are and that’s really it.

 But every decision I make I make with the knowledge that I have to accommodate my eyes. I am not defined by my eyes, but they have made me the way I am today. I have had to deal with something terribly hard at a very young age. So I am able to put things into perspective. And I often feel alone in life and that I am a burden. Yet I still wouldn’t change myself. 

It has shaped me and I have grown into someone who always thinks of others because no one thinks of me. And if I can help other people because I am looking out for those who feel like I do, then it is all worth it to me. Even if life is harder for me then for others. 

And my problems are out in the open, other people berry theirs, I can’t. And I think that’s a very good thing. Because I have to ask for help and that is not something I am good at. So I am growing and learning how to ask for help when I need it.",,,2,0,0,

Yeah, that's part of the idea, forcing myself to do something really different from before. I'd probably use sound as the most important sense, as you wouldn't really want to smell stuff in the middle ages and taste and touch are kinda hard to do at a distance.

&gt; the blind woman would be begging on corners

I wouldn't want to write such a story, and can't even begin to imagine what it would be like. I personally think someone that's been blind for their whole life would have some serious problems adapting to suddenly having vision.

It's a small possible plotline I have though, my MC somehow getting trapping by an illusion, and then escaping because she knows its not reality, though depending on the character that could be real evil, so I'll have to think about it.

Such a storyline would be possible but pretty pointless in my world. Magic works by emulating beasts, so if she's trapped in said beasts illusion she could just copy the illusion(if she manages to escape and capture it), and trap herself in a reflection of the world around her, so there would be no real struggle or conflict.

&gt;I forget to describe how characters look completely and I don't know if that's an issue with readers or not.

I can imagine that's a very hard thing to think ofA, hell I can see and forget describing half of my characters. Even those that get an actual look are usually cut down to race, hair color(if there) and eyes.

&gt;Big buildings, for example, just have a presence to them

That's interesting, and could probably be exaggerated by the presence of magic.

&gt;I can usually tell which friend is taller than me and which is shorter by where their voices come from when we're talking.

&gt;what kind of blind you want your protagonist to be

I'd make her completely blind, something like being born with extensive damage to her optic nerve, rendering her completely blind, though she has some innate sense for the souls around her, due to the location of her birth, so she'd know when she's near living beings.

&gt;when filling my water bottle I use a combination of sound and touch to know when to turn the tap off.

That really helps, because I do the same when its dark but didnt think about making a connection to, so coming up with stuff like that shouldn't be as hard as I imagined.

&gt;If your society is feudal or patriarchal she might encounter a lot of ablest thinking - you can't be doing that, you're blind/a girl/a blind girl!

I hate patriarchal societies in fiction with magic, because it makes no actual sense for people to treat someone differently for being weaker physically when that same someone could set you on fire, though general discrimination against blind people would certainly be something that would probably happen far more often than in our own society.

&gt;Most blind people have their own unconscious tricks they develop to help them perform everyday tasks

Could you name some of these tricks?

&gt;Facial expressions, bumping into people, shaking hands, not recognising someone you should be able to recognise.

Those help immensely, I didnt think of a single one of those points, thanks.

&gt;Would she ask for help?

Probably, she's pretty shameless, and still a child at the start, and because her village is so small she doesn't actually know many people of her age, so she has a skewed perception of normal.

&gt;Consistency

Yeah, that's really important, but also the hardest to do, though my characters themselves are among the most consistent things in the world, though sometimes their magic reserves conveniently conform for the plot, something that won't be possible in my new world by the nature of its magic.

&gt;How will she navigate crowds of people?

Badly, she's from a small village and will only visit a big city later in the plot, so she will be completely out of her depth at first. It won't get better, as the society will be pretty backwards in this regard too.

There's also the small detail that sensing that many human souls will completely overload her soul-sense.

&gt;Bottom line here is that, although her disability doesn't define her as a character, it will define a lot of how she interacts with her world and her people.

Yeah, I think that will be a hard line to walk.

&gt;Good luck!

Thanks.",,,3,0,0,

Airlines like Alaska will have a dedicated hotline to request assistance. Others like Southwest are a bit better and will let you request assistance from within the app. Doing this will sometimes get you some extra perks. When I flew on British Airways I was able to reserve my seat for free which was nice. Carry-on is best but if you do need to check a bag then they should also be able to help you retrieve it as long as you give them a description of the bag.

The flight attendants and crew are usually super helpful though if you have a wheelchair they may often grumpily clear out the wheelchair closet they were using to store their stuff. The airport staff that get you to your gate can be a toss-up. Sometimes they're incompetent like LAX and send a wheelchair even if you only, and quite explicitly, requested guided assistance. Sometimes they go above and beyond like LHR and have dedicated waiting rooms and toilets. Sometimes they're just okay like MCO and get you to your gate and nothing else. You won't really know until you go. Oh and any accessibility equipment you bring on board doesn't count against your cabin baggage allowance.

That said, you should try and learn proper cane technique as best you can. They're the standard because they work well, and you don't want to pick up unsafe habits. I would look for some books on orientation and mobility and cane travel technique. O&amp;M is more than just cane travel, it's also about learning to use other environmental clues to orient yourself and navigate the world.

You could start with this article from the NFB: [https://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr15/issue1/f1501tc2.html](https://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/fr/fr15/issue1/f1501tc2.html)

The main thing will be to really focus on establishing good technique from the beginning and then practice, practice, practice. The biggest ""risk"" is that you end up practicing an incorrect technique and train yourself to do something that is unsafe. Bad habits can be really hard to unlearn.

See if you can get a sighted friend to study up on it and join you when you go out with your cane the first few times. It won't be the same as having a qualified instructor, but a good friend to accompany you as you learn and to make sure you're safe when doing so could help a lot, for moral support and peace of mind, if nothing else.

**Edit:** Oh, and as for the cane tip, personally I think the rolling marshmallow tip is a good place to start and then learn the constant contact technique (it seems a little easier). Your cane length should be at least up to your armpit, many people like them longer.",,,7,0,0,

* Many people do not live close enough to state or local services to benefit or even apply (or live places without public transportation or Uber or even cabs). And if you are close enough.... it's weeks and weeks to get to orientation, and then weeks to get to an interview and then weeks to get to acceptance (all with trips to the office, plus being sent to see a doctor).  Why is this stuff not done online, and by stuff I mean orientation, interviews, case workers, assistance?  Most folks have Internet or connectivity... or know someone who has it.  Heck many insurance companies now offer low-cost doctor appointments via online.  Just saying. 
* With today's technology, it should be a no brainer to safely navigate any intersection crosswalk, period.
* I'd love to see personal and family therapy offered through State and local services, to help blind/VI humans have the best skills possible emotionally, psychologically, spiritually for handling something that most people really don't understand and can be stressful at times.  Again.  Online and phone should be an option.
* As I lose my vision I'm constantly surprised at how many things have no accessible options out there, especially when it's software, of all things.  But as we go more and more graphical and drag-and-drop, that's what happens....  Yet drag-and-drop is just the latest stop on the technological timeline, bridging the gap to voice.  In 10 years, people will be all ""why do I have to sit down and drag this stuff around, when I can just say, 'follow this decision process with an element for the account module, and pull in the record ID and account name.'""  All that dragging and clicking will go away, and the company that can build a universal voice layer that sits on top of any application and maps to every single piece of functionality will have a very good business indeed.  (And, of course, we'll then need adaptive software for those who don't have vocal ability or are hearing impaired.  The future will remove the barriers to software and internet interaction simply because all humans want to access things through the channel that makes sense personally.)

Depending on the disease or condition, solutions are closer or farther away.  For example, if you were born without eyes, solving this issues is further away than, say, curing macular degeneration.

These pivotal scenes often were part of a major plot turning point (learning to finally communicate or finally falling in love), so they make a huge impact on the audience.

The real challenge is--that since cities won't pay for anything to be installed--what exists already that could be leveraged augmented cheaply to help the blind and visually impaired.  Could something that is currently used become smarter?  Could something that is ""dumb"" be easily and cheaply turned into something that is smart?

For example, crosswalks.  As I lose my vision, how will that work?  While the technology for audible sound has been around forever, it was installed in VERY few locations.  And what was installed is garbled and speakers for both directions are located on the same pole, so you can't tell which crosswalk is safe.

But what if every crosswalk light could have an identification (like a bus stop does) and be connected to your phone?  Then the traffic software could be enhanced to send an alert depending on the crosswalk's signal condition?  


The key here is  speed, of course. But basically this is the possibility of the Internet of Things, right?

As to common prejudices there's one that is unique to the twenty-first century context the ""you're so brave"" idea that blind people are exceptional for doing what sighted people do on a daily basis, whereas in your medieval world the default thought would probably be that the blind woman would be begging on corners and if I were writing that's where the character's journey would start off and then have her gradually realize her own worth and talents.",,,2,0,0,

When I was her age, I didn't know what I was missing.   I took every adult's word as law and didn't know I could push their limits.   If no one said anything about the blocks I could see sitting on a table outside where I was told I could be, I didn't acknowledge them.   They thought I couldn't see them and I KNEW I wasn't allowed there so I didn't tell them I knew.    It's a developmental thing, partly brain function and admittedly trauma/abuse, too but I've seen this pattern in many children without the trauma experiences.    What I try to teach parents is that the right words and supports from her trusted adults can squash any perception of dependence or existence through permission she may have picked up and give her the option and skills to find/expand her own limits.   This is a big part of self-advocacy, too.   

It sounds like you aren't thinking outside her vision limits. Ie: if no one tells her it's on her desk, she won't know because she can't see it.   She has hands.  She can and should use those to augment her field of vision.  Tell her what area is hers and encourage her to develop her own strategies for finding out what's there.  This is humongous at home where her life is far less constrained than at school.   Reinforce to teachers that they tell her when they've added something and where it is, yes, but this is her desk.  It's not hers through permission or description of someone else.  See the difference?   
She will not have a shadow facilitating the placement of every object in her life.  She will need this skill and it will boost confidence immediately.    There's a game I play. What Can You Find?  This isn't drudgery, btw.  It's a puzzle game.   Lay out some items on a table and let her discover and explore them.   It gives you ideas about her current skill level and where she needs encouragement.  It also teaches shape, texture, placement descriprions, direction, methods for distance measurement and gives her confidence in new situations.   You can level up with impromptu stories about the items or interactive play, too.  Remember, it's a game.  

For you parents, once she's made a space hers, respect it.   Leave things where she puts them.  This is huge.   We use muscle memory for finding things and that few inches can make a big difference when it's a pair of scissors.   It doesn't mean she gets to never put her toys/school stuff away, again.  It means she can find what she needs and put it where it belongs as prompted.   I was a meticulous room cleaner even when I was her age. 

She's going to be fine.  She has parents willing to ask and learn and advocate for her.",,,2,0,0,

I was paired with a fantastic Golden Retriever and if I ever apply for another one, I would highly prefer another one. There tempermetns are great in my opinion. I know that GDB doesn't train German Sheps anymore and I heard that was due to aggresion issues with certain dogs that graduated. I do know that Seeing Eye still trains them, and they are a very respected organization. I had a teacher back at one of my rehab schools that refused to go anywhere but Seeing Eye and had several dogs from there. As others have said, the breeds will have different temperaments and some might suit your needs better than others. It also will likely increase the wait times drastically if you specify a certain breed, though I'm not certain if any school will guarantee a certain breed if requested. 
I would also consider which school is closest to you. It's probably not the biggest deal, but it's pretty convenient to be close to your school if you ever need veterinary services, etc.
Also, this is just something I've wondered about, I mean no offense by it, but I'm curious if German Sheps would be refused service more or less frequently than say labs or especially Goldens. Goldens are known as one of the friendliest breeds out there and Sheps have a bit of a bad reputation. So I wonder if there's any issue with the publics perception of them at all.",,,2,0,0,

Definitely listen to and follow the suggestions for introducing them to your home and keeping their training sharp and their behavior good post graduation. It's pretty easy for many teams to slip up and start letting bad behavior become a habit (such as begging, etc).
