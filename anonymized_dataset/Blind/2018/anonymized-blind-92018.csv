3048ef7a-4615-4ce7-b945-f96dff200e13,1537279457,"Hi friend. I was also born w/ congenital glaucoma and have begun really losing my sight aroud 20 years old. My vision is about 20/400 best corrected in my left eye on a non cloudy vision day and no light perception in right. 

Since the cloudy vision (mines causes by dry eye) has taken over, most of my vision is unreliable and so I rarely ever wear my glasses anymore. 

If your cloudy vision is caused by dry eye like mine is, I'd suggest finding some good dry eye drops. Those clear up my vision the most when my dry eye isn't too bad. You should also checkj your pressures because I know when mine get high, my vision gets bad. 

As for adapting to blindee life, I'm sort of in the same boat. I can't work either and am getting my SSI sorted. I suggest getting a white cane for going out if you don't already have one. The rolling tips work best for those of us who still have some sight. 

I have also purchased some raised sticky dots that I place on appliances around the house so I can use them by feel. (Ex: Dot on 5 and on buttons on microwave.) 

Losing the ability to play video games and watch anime, my main hobbies, was getting me down, but I am slowly adapting to finding new ones. I can get free audiobooks through BARD (check it out if you're in the US. Bookshare is also good if you're a student.) Netflix has shows with audio description that describes what's happening on screen (most movies in theaters / on DVD have this too if there recent.) 

I would also suggest learning to use your phone and computer in it's screenreader mode. Braille would also be a helpful skill to learn, as being born w/ glaucoma means we may go blind from it. 

Ultimately, you should try to look up your state's (if you are U.S.) or local blind services, adult rehab services or whatever. In Texas we have our services through the workforce commission and can get into a rehab center that helps us adapt to blind life. They also provide training in white cane skills and other technical stuff. When I'm ready to go back to school, they will also pay for my tuition. 

I hope some of this helps. I would love to chat more if you ever want. I've never met someone else w/ congenital glaucoma. ",,,2,0,0,

""Hey, can you pick me up at 8?""

""Oh, I'd love to, but I'm visually disabled, so I can't drive at night. Happy to meet you if you want to though!""

I never really had anyone stand off. I probably wouldn't go, ""Hi, I'm penguin\_rider222! I'm blind!!! Want to go out?""

It was never a big deal, honestly. Girls I dated always drove, no one ever really had issue with it. Plus it gave me a great excuse to initiate physical contact. ""Hey, it's really dark in here, I have a hard time with that. Mind if I hold on to your arm?""

Hell, during college, I dated quite a few girls of really different personality types, and it was never an issue for any of them. The big thing is to just softly set boundaries. It's going to come up, and you may find someone you're going on dates with uncomfortable because they don't want to be rude and pry. But I treated it like an elephant in the living room kind of thing, and made sure if they wanted to talk about it, they could ask me anything and I wouldn't get offended.

My blindness arose from a congenital genetic disease, so it was neat to get to educate people about a disease they'd never heard of before. I also was a very independent person, but I was really masking. Thing is, when you just start dating someone, you have to reassure them that you don't need someone to take care of you at some point. Just be sure to get to know them as a person, and make sure they see that you're a person, not a disability.

If my marriage is any indication, though, once you get married you'll need to constantly remind your spouse that your every whim doesn't need to be catered to...

Edit: But seriously man, you're overthinking this a little, and it's probably leading to perceived failure of dating. My brother is deaf (we won the genetic lottery), and he had the exact same concerns you do, and he let it cripple him relationship wise because he was so scared of getting rejected that he didn't start dating until he was 26. It's just a part of who you are. Some people are blind, some people are deaf, some people think that Seinfeld is funny. You'd be surprised at how many people won't even give it a second thought.

In all seriousness, welcome to the club. I'm assuming you have RP? I do, so apologies if I'm projecting. Dating can be tough, but don't beat yourself up. First off, dating isn't hard because you're blind, it's just hard. It does get easier, though. Some tips from my own experience:

First, it can be a great conversation topic, because blind culture is a thing, and like it or not, it makes you unique and stand out. You just want to avoid coming off as pitiable. But trying to mask it is going to make your life much harder. Trust me, I masked for 10 years, and I wish I just would have been myself.

Next, having a wingman (or wing girl) is always a good idea. That's good advice for the sighted anyway. 

When it comes to just meeting people, that's just a thing that everyone does. But I get the feeling you're looking for what to do once you've got that first date. 

If that's the case, if you're not driving, believe it or not, that's okay. It's going to come out sooner or later that you're going blind. There's nothing wrong with asking a special lady friend to drive. Just because you can't see doesn't mean you can't enjoy others' company in dark places (be careful getting drunk at bars with stairs, I learned that the hard way with a visit to the ER).

When I first started dating my wife, she liked to go to the movies, which I hated, because I can see a small part of the screen. But we did it for a couple months, and I finally told her. She felt terrible for making me go. I think you'll be surprised. If someone likes you, they'll accommodate. And quite frankly, there's nothing stopping you from making the first move. 

I'm rambling at this point, but the point is to be yourself, don't mask, be honest and assertive. Ladies dig confidence, and quite frankly, whether you're blind or not, the confidence is most important. Source: married to a pretty lady for 10 years with 2 kids.

They always deny the first time. It's a thing. 

Are you in the US? Here we have State Department of Rehab for every state. You need to take your medical documentation to them, don't worry, they will fill out the forms for you. 

Call them to see what days they do intake. 

DOR will get you technology training, and the things you need to get a job. They will actually help with that as well. 

They can also hook you up with the closest blind center and they will give you the training as well as life training classes like mobility and orientation. When it starts, they will often come to you and meet you for cane training.

Most cities also have training for riding the bus and taking the dial a ride, if you call them. This is a service that they offer for all disabled persons. My bus pass is free through that service program. 

I went through all of this, and after several years without any hope I am doing pretty well now. I have a job that I like, and DOR kicked in to make sure I had the equipment that I needed to do the job. 

The first two years I was going through this, I was suicidal. I had the oxy stash and I just knew that the day would come when I would just know it was time. 

As I met with other blind people and got into the training, it really lifted my spirits. I am pretty tough now, and I know I can overcome anything. They will also probably have a support group at your local center, and I highly encourage you to attend. You are not the only person going through this. We have your back. ",,,7,0,0,

ed0776cb-0218-4be6-97b2-92c8de993c2e,1536790205,"Got a few recommendations...

1.) You’re totally right about Braille. Learning it with your eyes isn’t going to do you much good, you need tactile resources. I’d suggesting checking out Hadley Institute for the Blind. They run correspondence courses that I believe are cheap or free for people with vision impairments.

2.) You should make contact with a state agency ASAP. Many states have a Division of Blind services or something similar. Try to make an appointment with them and get in the system. It could open up a lot of doors to training programs and assistive technology.

3.) You should definitely get a cane, but you’ll also need orientation and mobility training to use it as safely and effectively as possible. Where I live (Florida) O&amp;M training can be obtained through the state, local blind associations or advocacy groups like the NFB. This might be bias, but I’d strongly suggest starting with a pencil-tip cane.

4.) Braille is well and good, but we live in a high tech world. It would be good to get acquainted with a screen-reader like ZoomText or JAWS for your computer and Text-to-Speech for your phone. It’s an intimidating prospect at first, but very doable with a bit of training and lots of practice. Once again, the state, blind associations and advocacy groups are your friend.

5.) You have a really good attitude and I respect that, but a bit of honesty here. Almost everyone who loses their sight struggles with it emotionally. You probably already know it better than I do, since I was born with my disability. Just realize that the helplesness, anger and sadness you may feel are completely valid and try not to beat yourself up over it. Joining a blindness advocacy group like the ACB or NFB could help. A lot of people there have gone through the same things and can commiserate or offer advice.

Best of luck!",,,2,0,0,

If many students are special needs or disabled in any way they need to be considered. They probably can't 'deal' with a dangerous situation appropriatly like a similar aged student could. They may not be able to wander alone in severe cases and you can't expect such a student to flee alone. 

If a good chunk of the class in unable to scatter and flee it should definitly be a hide in place plan and the schedules of the classes that are set to hide in place should be known and given to emergancy responders. Kinda like if a class doesn't make it out in a fire, firefighters are told where that class was. 

Police should in a general situation try and prioritise the escape of these set classes or ensure the area is safe near them given they cannot flee until they can zero in on the perpetrators location. 

The emergancy plans for disabled and special needs students needs more care. Fuck I remember a friend of mine in a wheelchair during a fire drill everyone knew was a drill got made to walk down the stairs and missed school for at least a week because of it.

Another option would be the KNFB reader, which can be set up to have a lot of help offered as they use it to read. It's something that could honestly be picked up and used first try, even if they aren't comfortable with their phone.

Would they be more comfortable with a keyboard or a list of commands? I have a link that I practically spam in here because it's *really* helpful.

I'm not big on audio instructions, I prefer TTS personally, but if they like audio, a pen friend could be very useful. Then, you could make a row of their stickers and put each command onto one sticker, and your family member could play them back at their leisure.

If I'm not confident about myself, then I can't really reassure girls that they won't need to care for me. I've also been set back by a few bad experiences. Things like bumping into people at bars and having them aggressively try to fight me, or girls thinking I'm leering when really I'm just staring blankly into a corner too dark for me to see. 

I've been trying to overcome this, but it's hard. I wish there was a group of young people like me who could be mentored by older people like you, but I guess our disease is too rare. I tried checking out some blind centers, but it's not the same experience if you are born blind vs becoming blind. I guess I'm kind of a yuppie (do they still exist?), and it's hard to find a support group of mid-20s yuppies with RP to talk to. ",,,2,0,0,
a779d46b-f05e-4441-83a8-2da6ae9bd8ef,1537272329,"Alright, here are some games to start with:

1. **Pandemic** - Plays 2 to 4 players. This is a cooperative game where the players are trying to prevent diseases destroy the world. You work as a team and try to solve an evolving puzzle. Games last 40-60 min. You can read my [article for more details](https://sightless.fun/Pandemic-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/).

2. **Camel Up** - Plays 2 to 8 players. This is a betting game where players are betting on racing camels. The winner is the player with most money at the end of the race. It involves some luck, some strategy, but overall it's great fun! I've had great success with this game and casual players. I have written [an article for this one too](https://sightless.fun/Camel-Up-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/).

3. **King of Tokyo** - Plays  2 to 6 players. In  this game each player is a monster (Godzilla type of monster). You areall battling each other by rolling dice. The dice rolling mechanic is similar to Yahtzee! where you can roll up to 3 times and keep the dice that you need to perform an action. A sequel to this game which is a little bit more advanced is called **King of New York**, but I suggest you start with **King of Tokyo**.

4. No Thanks! - Plays 3 to 7 players. This is a very small and light auction game, yet can be highly entertaining. Games last 10-15 min.

5. **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** - It is played with 1 to 8, but I recommend playing this with 2 players. This is a coopoerative game where you try to solve a case. I'm assuming you are sighted, so you will be required to do most of the reading, while your SO can take notes. For example, you arae presented with a murer case, and now you need to go to the crime scene to see what clues you can find, then interview witnesses, check alibis etc. The game can be as long or as short as you want, but in my experience solving a case takes around 90-120 min.

6. **Sheriff Of Nottingham** - Plays 3-5, best with 5 players. This is a bluffing game. In each round, one of you becomes the Sheriff and must decide whether the other players (merchants) are tryring to smuglle contraband to the city. It has great player interaction.

7. **Coup** - Plays 2-6, best with 5  or 6. This is another bluffing game. You may need to mark the cards if your SO cannot distinguish the characters on the cards. There are a total of 5 different characters, so just putting a sticker or some transparent tape on different corners for each card should be enough to distinguish by touch.

All of the above are intro / gateway games, so you shouldn't have any issues with complicated rules.

Let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help! Happy gaming!",,,3,0,0,

If you like to walk fast, a longer cane is going to be your friend. Of course, speed comes with time and skill. You might have to slow down a little to get a good technique down before being able to walk safely at your preferred pace. The type of tip will affect weight (ceramic, pencil, and metal glide tips tend to be the lightest), and canes can be made of lighter materials if the weight is really holding you back.

I find that the lighter the tip, the speedier I can be with either constant contact or two-point touch.

All in all, the biggest thing is probably going to be time and slogging through the adjustment period. Like scales on an instrument - it might be slow at first, but eventually you can zip up and down the notes in a flash.",,,6,0,0,

He spent 90 minutes with me, actually made up test frames And kept working at it until we got the correct prescription. It was much more complicated than my previous prescription, different PDSP for my close-up vision and then from my distance vision. I can’t see as far as I used to be able to see but I can see everything close up much better. Basically my previous prescription was like having binoculars.  It took me about a months to get used to the new prescription but it’s a fraction of the strength of the old one, I can actually afford to buy multiple pairs of glasses now which is quite pleasant after spending between five and $800 a pair for the last 20 years

I've been unfortunate because I can't get O&amp;M training right now in my area, so I've had to read and find videos to try and apply it.

4. Finally, look for programs for lower-level jobs or talk to employers that don't need skills training. This is not ideal for us, though, as low-level jobs tend to have more inflexible requirements and you have lower leverage to ask for accomodations.

It's been around longer, is much more robust and integrated, plus the whole experience has been properly designed while everything Google makes feels simply engineered. Typing and overall interaction is much faster on iPhones, the experience is much less buggy, iOS handles web content much better than Android, and all native iOS controls are immediately accessible when used in an app. iOS connects to braille displays easier, has braille screen input, faster navigation and action controls with the Rotor feature, plus the experience directly mirrors how it works in MacOS. 

Hand me an iPhone and I can get VoiceOver up and running on it with my settings in a few seconds. Give me an Android device and it takes about 30 minutes just to get it somewhat functional, and that's if you happen to have someone with vision around to get it started for you initially. There are ways to get Talkback up and running when first unboxing a phone, but if it's turned on and set up without accessibility set up first, you always need someone to help. Samsung Voice Assistant is even worse if you are unfortunate enough to get one of those.

First off - you need long cane training.
Your local authority is obligated to provide it however there’s often a waiting list and you need it now.
Your local authority can outsource it to a provider such as Guide Dogs Association who do this as they have fully trained and funded mobility instructors and it’s a source of revenue for them. Other charities also donir. It should be free to you.
That’s the first step.
The school run with a long cane is totally doable.
I am registered blind and I do it twice a day with either my cane or guide dog - I find it relatively stress free. I started using a cane when my daughter was 2yrs old and my guide dog when she was three. They are life savers.
Also, go into the school or nursery and ask for an appointment with the head. Ask for a care plan to be written up for you so that staff have a guideline o. How best to support you.
Tho gs you might want to put in it include 
They locate your child, coat and bag and hand them over directly to you in person
They email any letters Home to you,
They inform you of any signage that may be up on walls that you may miss. 

Ask your local authority for a full care plan that undertakes every aspect of your life. It should be carried out by a social worker with knowledge of sensory disabilities. 
You need support with daily living tasks, personal care and social inclusion.
By personal care I mean knowing that clothes are clean and matching, no toothpaste on tops etc, not actually getting washed and dressed.
They can provided a PA in your care plan to assist you for a few hours a week - and maybe a cleaner to help you with household chores. 
Apply for PIP if you haven’t already. 
If you aren’t working you need enhanced ESA.

I promise you it is all doable and you will find solutions. 
Yes it’s totally overwhelming and devastating right now but taking some of these steps will get you going in the right direction.
It’s all daunting so I definitely recommend contacting charities such as RNIB, Action for Blind People, Henshaw, Galloway or whoever is your local organisation, and also the Citizens Advice Bureau to help you with all the logistics of getting support put in place, 
You are not alone, and you will be ok.

What I'm seeing, however, is that many employers are able to work around laws, and that discrimination is still rampant. I'd love to discuss with you a bit more if that's okay!

4c599c73-eb99-47ac-98de-f3c593a62583,1537843626,"So some people will definitely balk at this, but the NFB canes totally changed my traveling.

If you're not familiar, the National Federation of the Blind canes are made from either carbon fiber or fiber glass. Instead of being the standard black, white, and red, they are all white from handle to tip.

Additionally, the tips are made from chrome, so they won't glide quite the same way. Instead of sweeping it from side to side, you use what's called the open palm technique. That's gonna be very hard to describe via text, but I'll try.

Basically, you're gonna hold your cane in the palm of your hand with your palm facing the ceiling. Then, you'll move your cane from side to side by opening and closing your hand. This is supposed to reduce the strain on your wrists, preventing fun things like carpel tunnel. It's very similar to the two-point touch technique, and you can definitely use that one if the open palm feels too strange to you at first.

I like the NFB canes because they're just a solid white and don't look so much like a medical device. They're also the lightest canes I've ever used, and since I've switched, I am never going back.

If you're interested in trying one, you can get a rigid, i.e. non-folding cane for free [here](https://nfb.org/free-cane-program).

If you find you like them, NFB also sells a folding cane and a telescopic one, too. The telescopic ones are great when you have to open your cane on a crowded bus or train.

I've met quite a lot of people in the US who use an NFB carbon fiber or fiberglass cane as their primary. They do break differently (and can't be bent back into shape like aluminum) but they're definitely not meant for light duty only. 

https://nfb.org/independence-market will ship internationally, but postage may be prohibitive. The canes themselves range from $10 to $45, and metal tips are $2. 

Keep in mind that metal tips aren't especially suited to constant contact, and here in the US generally people will use tapping based methods such as two point touch with them. 

If cane weight is an issue, there's a couple of other options worth asking your O&amp;M instructor about:  

- The jumbo roller is heavy. Switching to another style of tip suitable for constant contact might help. I'm pretty sure the marshmallow roller is lighter, and certain the ceramic tip is. 

- If you have a fiberglass or aluminum cane, Ambutech's regular graphite is lighter weight. 

- Ambutech makes a ""slim line"" graphite cane that is significantly lighter than their standard graphite cane. It is meant as a ""light duty"" mobility cane, and is definitely not as durable as other cane models.

If you think a cane would be of some benefit for you, it's worth a shot. However, if it were me, I'd want to make sure to get some training from an O&amp;M teacher.

I got my first cane at 11, when my vision was much better, but I was still bad enough to be Legally Blind. It didn't really help me with social interractions at school, since carrying a big reflective stick seemed to make me more of a target for the crappiest kids at school. 

I really don't care if you use one to help you, you shouldn't be worried about using it if you feel you could benefit. But canes can be a hassle, and you should be ready for that.

I was in a pretty transitional state like you are in now. Just do some stuff to get out of your own head, you'll be a lot more attractive when you're doing something actively, whether it's dancing or feeding animals at a kennel or teaching kids chess. Work on yourself, go lift some weights, sign up for events, throw a party, make some dough...just live in the world and you will pop out as a 3D person in people's lives. People will be drawn to you.

Vision loss is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. Furthermore, where was Cosby’s sensitivity and mercy when he repeatedly raped women he had drugged? Where was the leniency when his victims could not see during his malicious assaults upon their persons? Cosby certainly didn’t give a shit. Being blind doesn’t negate his maliciousness or the fact that he’s a raping piece of shit; I see no logical or legitimate reasoning that justice should be tempered to Cosby’s preferences just because *now* he’s blind. Perhaps he’s scared, which I find to be quite pertinent to this situation. Karma’s a bitch, and now it’s Cosby’s turn. ",,,11,0,0,

I’m about 5 foot 10 inches. I prefer a cane at about 56 to 60 inches long. That’s just to match my stride though. I walk slower with a cane though. I tell my students that the cane should reach their armpit. Some say the bottom of the breast bone, but that’s really short for me. Other camps like the NFB say it should go up to your chin or your earlobe. It’s really personal preference at that point. 

I prefer really light weight canes because I have wrist issues. I like graphite or fiberglass. Choose your material wisely. Fiberglass will shatter in cold weather. Also, that jumbo roller really adds weight to the cane. Try a smaller tip like the regular roller or a basic pencil or marshmallow tip. I tend to use a touch and slide technique to stick with the shoreline very often.

Paul Schroeder strode through the aisles at Wegmans in Columbia, tapping a walking cane in front of him and reaching for the iPhone in his shirt pocket.
The 55-year-old Silver Spring resident, who has been completely blind since infancy, was shopping for cherries, cereal and some frozen dinners, and had just discovered the store was selling sugar melons, a type of cantaloupe. He typically shops with his wife, who is sighted, or, when alone, asks store employees to help. But that’s not always ideal.

“What that takes away is that sort of serendipitous fun of just kind of wandering and browsing and looking,” Schroeder said.
Wegmans offers Schroeder another option, free access to a new mobile app that helps visually impaired people live more independently. Aira, the brainchild of San Diego-based tech entrepreneurs, uses smartphones or smart glasses to connect people using the app to trained agents, who can see what the blind or low-vision person cannot. Agents offer round-the-clock assistance using live camera streams, GPS, maps and web-based information.

Agents guide Aira users through shopping, traveling, cooking, reading mail or documents or countless other activities or tasks. Aira sells the service as a subscription with plans ranging from 100 minutes for $89 a month to unlimited for $329 a month.
Wegmans, which has eight stores in Maryland, is the first U.S. grocer to offer free access to Aira.
Any customer, with or without a monthly subscription to Aira, can access the service for free in all 97 Wegmans stores in six states, said Linda Lovejoy, a spokeswoman for the Rochester, N.Y.-based grocer.

The access complements other services Wegmans offers customers with disabilities, Lovejoy said. The chain installed hearing loops in stores three years ago, enabling people using hearing aids to hear more clearly at the store pharmacy and at checkout.

“Anytime you provide more access for people who have disabilities, they realize it and they want to go use that place, whether it’s a park or a mall or a grocery store,” Lovejoy said. “It creates more access for people to enjoy their lives. … This opens another tool for those who are blind or low vision to have a great experience in our stores.”
Schroeder and other Aira “explorers,” as subscribing customers are called, describe the app as life-changing. Schroeder has called on Aira agents to read menus at restaurants, help with computer problems, read labels on canned food in his pantry, find exhibits at conferences, direct him to a precise building or just describe the shops he passes walking down a block.
When he first used Aira, “it just blew me away,” he said.

Schroeder, who used to work for the American Foundation for the Blind, recently became employed by Aira, where he develops programs and policies to make the app more accessible.
Aira was launched about three years ago by Suman Kanuganti, an entrepreneur looking into augmented reality applications that could help a friend who was losing vision. He teamed with tech entrepreneur Larry Bock, and they launched Aira in 2017. It has grown from 200 beta testers to thousands of users in the United States, Australia and Canada.
The service has nearly 60 access partners like Wegmans, including universities, airports, municipalities, tourist destinations and individual employers. In Maryland, the Baltimore-based National Federation of the Blind is also a partner. Aira is in talks with Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport to offer access there.
In such partnerships, the business or organization agrees to pay for Aira services within a certain geographic area. The company employs several hundred agents in all 50 states. Agents start at $15 an hour and work in scheduled shifts from their homes.
“We’re about building an accessible world,” said Amy Bernal, Aira’s vice president of customer experience. “Our goal would be that we work to make every place accessible for everyone, providing that instant access to visual information.”
The app does compete with other service, including the free Be My Eyes, which connects users via video calls with volunteers.

Ronza Othman, an attorney at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Woodlawn who has had limited vision since birth, has been using Aira for about two years. The Baltimore resident recently has relied on it more after losing some of the useful vision she’d had for much of her life.
“Aira in general has absolutely changed my life and has made it much easier for me to interact with the world and independently access things that people who are not blind can access with ease and take for granted, like shopping,” Othman said.
Aira doesn’t replace in-person assistance, she has found, but “it does make the shopping much easier and expands the options for me when I need to be able to get things like a gallon of milk or a head of lettuce,” she said.
Before Aira, she said, “routine things people who did not have disabilities would not think twice about would be a tremendous challenge.”
Besides helping her buy groceries, Aira agents read mail or documents, find the proper size clothing at stores and navigate airports. Agents have guided her to airport departure gates and to empty seats at the gates. In the past she would have asked someone around her.
“The problem is you don’t always know if people are willing to help or can help you appropriately,” she said. “You’re interrupting people in their lives. … This way, I can get assistance without being disruptive to other people.”
For grocery shopping, Wegmans has become an attractive option because, she said, “Wegmans has invested in my using Aira at their business.”
During Schroeder’s trip to Wegmans, he used the VoiceOver accessibility tool on his iPhone to open the Aira app and was connected with agent Joanne McIntyre. He has gotten to know McIntyre, who lives in Bangor, Maine, through the app.
“She is calm and doesn't get ruffled by what’s going on,” he said.
Starting in the produce department, McIntyre described the cherries’ color and packaging.
“Take two steps to your right,” she said, leading Schroeder next to bananas and helping him choose a bunch that were not overripe. She then directed him to the cereal aisle, describing a multi-grain variety with oats and honey. “There’s whole grain that’s right in front of you. If you reach your left hand out.”
In frozen foods, Schroeder used his phone camera to capture an image of frozen lasagna. McIntyre could study it more closely that way and read ingredients. The agent said she has worked for Aira for more than a year.
“My friends ask me what I do and what kind of calls I take, and I say, ‘I don’t know, what did you do today? Think of everything you did today and I could have have helped somebody with that,’ ” she said. “We do a lot of mail. We do a lot of travel — trains, buses, airports. I do a lot of grocery shopping.”

Schroeder said the partnership between users and agents is one of his favorite aspects of Aira.
“It’s not about a sighted person telling a blind person everything that’s around them,” he said. “It’s about the blind person saying, ‘This is what I need information about.’ ”",,,4,0,0,

ed0776cb-0218-4be6-97b2-92c8de993c2e,1536787261,"Got a few recommendations...

1.) You’re totally right about Braille.  Learning it with your eyes isn’t going to do you much good, you need tactile resources.  I’d suggesting checking out [Hadley Institute for the Blind](https://www.hadley.edu).  They run correspondence courses that I believe are cheap or free for people with vision impairments.

2.) You should make contact with a state agency ASAP.  Many states have a Division of Blind services or something similar.  Try to make an appointment with them and get in the system.  It could open up a lot of doors to training programs and assistive technology.

3.) You should definitely get a cane, but you’ll also need orientation and mobility training to use it as safely and effectively as possible.  Where I live (Florida) O&amp;M training can be obtained through the state, local blind associations or advocacy groups like the NFB.  This might be bias, but I’d strongly suggest starting with a pencil-tip cane.

4.) Braille is well and good, but we live in a high tech world.  It would be good to get acquainted with a screen-reader like ZoomText or JAWS for your computer and Text-to-Speech for your phone.  It’s an intimidating prospect at first, but very doable with a bit of training and lots of practice.  Once again, the state, blind associations and advocacy groups are your friend.

5.) You have a really good attitude and I respect that, but a bit of honesty here.  Almost everyone who loses their sight struggles with it emotionally.  You probably already know it better than I do, since I was born with my disability.  Just realize that the helplesness, anger and sadness you may feel are completely valid and try not to beat yourself up over it.  Joining a blindness advocacy group like the ACB or NFB could help.  A lot of people there have gone through the same things and can commiserate or offer advice.  

Best of luck!",,,2,0,0,

e55f3cfe-aa08-42e1-9441-8fb6d1fe174e,1535937518,"There are ways to help manage, though your eye condition will indicate which strategies may work better. Are the cataracts your only eye condition? If no, environmental lighting and general fatigue can cause fluctuations in vision. Often fluctuations is due to visual fatigue. 

Some strategies for reducing visual fatigue: 
- use sunshades when changing lighting environments 

- regularly wearing indoor tints can be helpful too

- try changing your focal distance every 20 mins for 20 seconds (sometimes closing your eyes completely can help), 

- use a color modification on screens (like inverted colors or overall tints) to delay fatigue 

- use audio when print reading isn’t necessary 


As far as explaining to people fluctuating vision, that’s an art. Many people do not understand low vision. They think either someone sees nothing or they just need better glasses. Finding a way you’re comfortable explaining your vision loss can help. One tip I use is to ask people to imagine being in a dark room. The dimmer the light gets the less clarity there is and the harder it is to distinguish colors and objects etc. Or they can think about when it’s raining and light bounces off everything differently making it harder to see.   Low vision can be like that except it’s not coming from lack of lighting or the environment but from the eye condition. 

Howl that helps! ",,,1,0,0,

The National Federation of the Blind has a free cane program along with some basic cane usage instruction on their website if I recall correctly.

But thanks to [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org), I don't need it.  The internet and the open source software movement have empowered blind people to help each other out directly, in ways that were never possible before, without being beholden to government support or sighted charity.  Even if we manage to get all the assistive technology we need, the prices these companies charge mean that purchases can generally only happen through government programs.  This removes the ability for blind people to make our own purchasing decisions; instead, some sighted government functionary decides what technology it will fund for blind people. That's why in my mind the most important thing is working to bring the price of this technology down, rather than working to get more government funding.  Because once assistive technology becomes affordable to the average person, it means we get to make our own purchases, and decide on our own needs.  It also opens up the possibility of free market competition improving products for everyone. Right now the assistive technology companies know blind people can't afford there software directly. So they're selling to governments and large corporations; we're not even really the customer for the stuff we're given to use!

I have a few friends who's cane handle is blue, but that's a matter of personal preference. I've never heard of green denoting a visual impairment before, but that could just be me. My cane folds up into four sections, and the bottom section is red, followed by the next section being white, and it alternates like that. If you're getting a cane for mobility use, I don't think you'd need to get an ID cane. ID canes are usually used just to let the general public know you have a visual impairment, and aren't usually used for actual cane travel as they can be less durable. It all depends on if you want to use it for mobility or just for ID purposes.  That's just from my experience though. :) I hope this is helpful!

Some instructors prefer the clients start with a longer cane until they get comfortable with scanning with it, so it doesn't go too far to the sides. Others prefer to start off slightly longer (they can scan more per sweep), but it can gets unwieldly.

You mentioned pain from the grip. Don't grip it extremely tightly, that puts more stress than you need. A relaxed grip should be sufficient.

If you aren't used to the weight, I usually recommend practice scanning while watching TV or something. That lets you do it without focusing on it. I usually suggest starting off with the commercial breaks, and as you get stronger, switch to doing it during the shows.

Also, a big one... don't put your hand into the elastic strap. It seems convenient, but it's a safety issue. If your cane is hit by a car and gets tangled up in it, the elastic strap will drag you along with it. If you are holding it in your hand and a car hits the cane, it would just take the cane out of your hands.

* she moved from small needle knitting to large needle knitting

1. As other comments have said, it really bogs down your PC, and overall just feels clunky. 

2. Its harder to navigate when zoomed in so much, you'd have to constantly zoom in and out to know your place, and it's a real pain having to move your mouse back and fourth to read a web page. 

3. I'm very near sighted, so getting closer to the screen is always MUCH clearer than looking at a zoomed in image from a foot away. 

Ultimately, the solution I found best for me is to have a monitor arm so I can pull my monitor close to me, and maybe making some things bigger. And if I need to use a laptop or something, the built in Windows magnifier is sufficient. 

One thing I have noticed though, whenever I use a Mac, I enjoy using the built on zoom on macOS much more than the one on Windows or ZoomText. I'm not really sure why it's so much better, maybe it's the smoothness?

ee9d2a71-ba8b-4787-aac4-d6ea571441ac,1537376102,"I can completely relate to everything you are saying except for the dating part. I haven't been single since 2010, but that doesn't mean that I don't deal with very awkward social interactions. I try to accept that social interactions can be awkward for anyone. That's kind of part of the fun of it. I am also at the point where I have a couple of symbol canes and a full-size cane for when I need it one day. I always tell myself that it would be helpful to use the symbol canes, but I could never bring myself to actually use them. I bump into stuff fairly regularly and most people can't tell that I am going blind until they get to know me. I have been losing my vision from the center out so my peripheral vision allows me to get around fairly well, as in I commute by unicycle. The awkward part is that I tend to look off to the side to try and see anyone. This makes it very difficult to meet anyone new in bars or clubs. The best way that I have found is to just get out on the dance floor and bust a move. This is how I met my wife and my previous x before her. Dancing usually gives you enough time next to other people to tell a little about them and gives you a moment between songs to make small talk and probably say something awkward of course, but then you dance it out again LOL. At some point I will usually say something like, ""BTW I am partially blind so I probably won't be able to recognize you again so holler at me if you see me. It takes me some time to get to know your voice and the way you move. That is typically how I recognize people."" I try to keep the blind conversation short and sweet, but there are definitely those people that are extremely curious about you at this point. Sometimes it can be a decent icebreaker that can steer the conversation to somewhere else interesting. Other times people just don't get it and this can be awkward, but I see it as a decent filter for the people you want to keep talking to or not. To sum up, going blind presents a lot of challenges and socializing is no exception. So I actually find it quite refreshing that you have the courage to post about this unique challenge of going blind. I like what other people have said here about just be yourself, but I also know firsthand that there are many circumstances of being partially blind in certain settings that make it difficult to be fully yourself when you are very confused about your surroundings and who is around you. It is very difficult to tell when someone is talking to you or the person next to you in a club or a bar when everyone is just talking loudly and you can't tell if they're looking at you. Then you try and respond, of course having a hard time looking at them to let them know that you were talking to them, and they don't respond because now they are confused. Then people just think you're strange, and in my case they are probably right, so back to the dance floor LOL. But yeah, the awkwardness is real. You can explain this to people, but the conversation would be kind of a downer, and ultimately most people would not quite understand if they are not going through it themselves. So I appreciate the openness here. So if you can relate to a lot of these experiences and would like to know more about how I deal with them, please reach out to me. It would be a lot easier to talk about these things with people that get it first hand. Also, there is a lot to learn from those who are fully blind, but there is a spectrum of blindness and being partially blind where others cannot tell is a unique position to be in.  My sister is also going blind and her vision has progressed further than mine, so she uses the symbol can pretty much on a regular basis. So between the two of us we get this spectrum of blindness fairly well. Also, finding a hobby that you can do in a group setting is probably the best way to meet people. Try something like acro yoga. You can get a lot of one on one interaction with someone where you really have to build up some trust. So it's a quick and easy way to know if there can be something there. Just don't let dating be the reason you go to something like Acro yoga, because that can really mess with the vibe and trust building.  Good luck, and feel free to reach out. ",,,3,0,0,

\-Services. First thing I would do is request a meeting with your IEP team. You want to express the difficulties you are having and you would like to be assessed in those particular areas to determine appropriate services. You might not need particular instruction, but you might benefit from the assessment process to have a better understanding of your condition. At the meeting you can request having the state agency involved. You can ask for a separate meeting with them, or have them at the same one. With then you can request transition services. There you will most likely find a group of students going through the same situations you are. There you might be able to receive some of the services you might need. Again, this all depends on the original assessments you are going to request. 

\-Parents. I would have them attend all these meetings. Maybe just talk to them about getting checked and having professionals explain what is happening. They might need someone else to confirm what you are going through. The world of visual impairments is very small. Not a lot of people have had contact with us, so it's hard to understand how you can see some things, and how you are not seeing others. Be patient with them and with yourself. It's a matter of finding the appropriate tools and outlets to make things happen. 

\-I think you might be overthinking this. Allow yourself to go through the experiences before reacting to them. You are recognising that you need help, and you are seeking it. It's just one step at a time. ",,,3,0,0,

When I was 18 I lost my sight for the first time, and since we lived in a small coastal town in Florida, my ophthalmologist was located in Orlando (about an hour’s drive away). We had a rhythm to those visits: schedule the appointment for as early as possible (less waiting room time) get a bagel on the way, and then after the appointment lunch + a fun/relaxing activity. It made an already stressful and arduous situation less difficult. 

Anyways, one day for our post-appointment activity my mom took me to the Florida Mall (which is huge) and after her guiding me around for a bit we decided to get coffee. My mom left me at the coffee shop so she could go to the bathroom. It became very crowded, so I slowly moved backwards in order to get out of people’s way and have my back to a wall. I had my sunglasses on, but no cane, and I bumped into a woman who had stepped behind me. She was not happy, and snapped out “What, are you blind?!?” quite sarcastically. I apologized for my clumsiness and said, “Yes, I am. I’m so sorry - I’m not used to it yet and I didn’t know you were standing there. Again, Im so sorry”. This lady was *mortified* and very remorseful. She apologized repeatedly, bought me a coffee, and guided me to a nearby table and waited with me until my mom returned.

And I live in a really diverse area where a lot people don't speak english so I'm in the habit of using ""blind"" so it's easier for them to understand, especially if I'm in a rush and don't really have time to explain my condition because a lot of them won't understand ""I don't see very well"" or ""I'm visually impaired."" Sadly when I say things like that people usually respond with something along the lines of ""why don't you get glasses?"" 

As for what visually impaired people are capable of, I stand by what I said. Just because we don't do things the same way sighted people do, doesn't mean we can't do them. Humans are very adaptable creatures. We use our phones with screen readers. There are even apps that let you take pictures of text and have it read it to you. I play baseball and hockey with several people who are completely blind. One of those friends works for the local police and has actually fired a gun at a range before, and driven a car on a frozen lake. A few of us have even driven go karts before. Really the only thing a sighted person can do that a visually impaired person can't is see things normally. It might not be nearly as easy for us to do everything a sighted person can, but with the right adaptations and attitude, we can figure anything out.

I think the solution has got to be some combination of off-the-shelf equipment. An android watch for reporting, a high end android phone for processing, and some sort of cheap simple mount to let you wear your phone on your chest

That would mean around $1000 of equipment in total, but I think people wouldn't mind, because most people will have or need the phone already.

But the problem next is software development. It would cost around half million dollars to develop this software. But how many customers would I have? How much would I have to charge for the software?

I always text ahead to say that I’m blind and won’t be able to see their car/read the license plate and for them to call out to me or call me when they arrive. I’m not good at explaining where I am, so I find myself trusting the phone’s gps a lot. (Sometimes works, sometimes not.)

I’m legally blind and have some usable vision. Sometimes this works to my disadvantage, because if I’m having a good eye day and am not using my cane, drivers will sometimes leave before I can find them, even if I text/call. 

At night especially it’s difficult, and even when I text, call, and wave my cane in the air when the app says the driver has arrived, I miss the ride because the driver doesn’t want to get out of the car or speak loudly enough that I can hear them. Sometimes they end up on the opposite side of the street and refuse to turn around and come to where I am. 

I don’t think it’s appropriate for the drivers to expect someone who’s blind to cross a busy street where there’s no crosswalk when he/she/they can take two minutes to make a u-turn. It’s happened more than once. 

I’ve had a lot of good experiences, most of the drivers are fine, but the bad ones tend to stand out. I’ve never had a problem getting charges reversed if he driver charged me for a ride I didn’t take.

Also I hope this doesn’t make you uncomfortable, but if you’re having financial concerns with getting  one I would be more than happy to get one for you :-).

First and foremost, you should hook up with your local agency for the blind. In my state it's BESBI, I think that's CT and NY, and a lot of other states have Comissions for the Blind.

From there, you should be able to recieve a starter cane, and later different canes depending on what works best for you and what you like, and orientation and mobility training to help make it safer for you to travel independently as you learn to use your cane safely and properly.

I'm personally a fan of the NFB canes for little stuff where I just want to avoid hitting my shins off of stuff, but I don't like it for navigating. I prefer a 4 piece aluminum, or graphite, cane with a marshmallow tip. I kind of hate the roller ball, assuming you mean the tennis ball sized one, because IMO it turns the cane from looking like a tool to looking like a child's toy.

My phone battery is getting low and my boyfriend has my charger, but I'll include a few more things, and hopefully my phone won't die before I post, lol.

The blind mice megamall, an online site, is really great for picking up a lot of blind-based products. I'd hold off on the big ticket items, like the very useful $200+ pen friend, until you know that your state will not purchase it for you. Seriously though, the pen friend is great for both labeling and taking notes.

I'd also check out Maxi Aids and the things the Carroll center sells. If you have the means, and your state won't pay to send you, I highly recommend the Carroll Center. I learned *so* much in the three months I spent there.

If you have an iPhone, mac, or other apple devices, I recommend checking out applevis.com. They have a lot of guides and great forums.

There's also app reviews, which is really helpful.

Say you, like me, are right handed. When you push your right leg forward, you want it to push your right arm and cane forward to sweep out to the left. When your left leg goes forward, your cane is pushed back to sweep right while your right arm is kept more or less in line with your leg.

At first it is a conscious thing, you focus on a step forward pushing your cane forward. Just walk around focusing on that rhythm. The more you do it though the better you'll get and the more it'll become second nature.

The scenario being depicted isn't some unattainable goal that we can only dream about. It is almost certainly in inevitability that will likely happen some time in the next decade.

Statistically autonomous cars are already safer than humans. Then again most people likely haven't done much research on the subject. I can imagine giving up control to a machine is a terrifying prospect for most people.

Maybe this video isn't for me. It seems like it's more for people who aren't sold on the idea yet. It's for people who are still wary about a car driving itself and haven't really thought through the enormous benefit it would bring to those who can't drive. Based on the comments in the video I imagine most people haven't thought about the prospect of letting the disabled move around more freely.

Tesla is quickly advancing autonomous driving. Currently their cars are between tier 2 and tier 3 which is good. If they can keep it together they can likely push up to tier 4 in the near future which is where we'll finally be able to get them to ride around on dedicated lanes. Even if they disappear we've still got most of the tech giants working on it as well.

As a teenager, I would go for days without sleeping properly, because I could only sleep during the day, but I had to go to classes during the day, and would then be awake all night.  However, as an adult, I've had to find better ways of coping, in order to be part of the working world, and uphold my adult responsibilities.  I'm 30, and only in the last couple years have I managed to get into, and stay on, a semi-regular sleep schedule.  

The first big step for me was realizing that something, in fact, can be done.  It's only recently (in the past five years or so) that people have even started talking about the sleep disorders experienced by the blind.  Previously, many people in my life didn't believe me about how serious the issue was.  And, of course, that lead me to doubt myself; maybe it's just me. Maybe I need to just get over it.  Those are, of course, not useful coping strategies.  

Later on, this evolved into ""this is just my sleep schedule. It's just how I am. It will never change, and I can't do anything about it.""  I suspect this might be where the blind person in your life is now.  He's just accepted that lack of sleep once a month is just how it is.  

That's not true.  I'm not a doctor, so I won't give medical advice. But I can say from personal experience, that with hard work, trial and error, and some lifestyle changes, it's possible to get on a regular sleep schedule that varies by only two or three hours.  If you'd told me that five years ago though, I'd have laughed in your face.  Oh, it'll never be perfect. The weeks around the time changes twice a year are pretty much a write-off for me.  But it can get better.  

I think the best thing you can do is encourage him that it doesn't have to be this way.  For me, a combination of Melatonin, increased physical activity, a sleeping pill once a month to help reset my sleep cycle when it's drifted farther off than I'd like, and a strict bedtime routine (to give my brain queues other than light level that it's sleep time now) has helped a lot.  However, his mileage may vary.  But today there are medications specifically designed to help with the problem, and doctors and sleep labs are actually aware of the issues.  The condition is generally called non-24 sleep disorder; having an official name is a big step forward from the days when it wasn't even recognized as a thing.  

If you're willing to support him on the journey, it's likely his sleep quality can improve a lot from what he's dealing with now.  ",,,3,0,0,

I think becoming blind gradually adds another dimension. You have to deal with changing how you live your life, which is harder as an adult compared to as a kid. You also have to explain yourself to people while you are in the intermediate zone - not blind enough to need a cane, but blind enough to accidentally run into a baby carriage at night only to have the mother spit at you because she doesnt know you are blind

I'm sure you've had that feeling where you turned your head, because you thought you heard someone call your name, or you thought you heard a voice you knew in a crowd.  Or you've woken up in the middle of the night because you thought you heard something.  However, you have sight, so you probably don't notice these auditory illusions as often as blind people do, and you probably pay less attention to them and ascribe less meaning to them than blind people might.  

If I believed in the paranormal, sure, there are some places I'd probably assume were haunted.  Especially when it's quiet, some rooms just give me the overwhelming impression that someone else is in the room with me, even when I know that to be impossible (everyone's gone, the door is locked, etc).  However, it's probably a combination of the air flows in the room, sounds carried in from other places in the building (perhaps through walls or pipes), background sounds caused by the ventilation system and the materials of the building expanding/contracting, etc.  Especially in one friend's basement, it all just ads up in a way that convinces me that someone else is standing in the room with me.  I know it's just a trick of the senses, but never the less, I won't stay in that basement alone, just because it makes me uncomfortable.  If I could see, I suspect this elusion wouldn't be nearly as strong, because I could glance over and see nothing, and so my brain would stop connecting random sensory impressions into that pattern.

1. Make sure that if the person is nervous to allow them time to breathe or to try to relax.
2. Allow people, (not just blind people,) to bring our phones or some kind of device to listen to music/a podcast/whatever it is we are listening to to take our mind off things.
3. Don't be demanding. We might no that we have holes in our teeth and telling us would be a good idea but don't demand harshly that we come back. Thing is, we know that if we don't go to the dentist that our teeth will hurt/rot/fall out so reminding us of that would just make people who suffer from anxiety feel worse. I don't exactly know how to get around that,  I mean you could ask but then how do you ask without making someone panic?
On the other hand, if you see that the person is blind and has someone with them at the appointment, do not make hand signals indicating that they need work without telling that person. I had that happen to me.
The guy was very nice. I only found out because I asked my nan one day about the dentist and she told me that the  guy was giving her hand signals indicating that I need work done on my teeth.
I understand what he was doing, but it made me feel less than human for a while.
4. Get rid of the dental smell somehow.
5. For those of us who are nervous, waiting around is terrible. If we could get in and get out, I think we'd appreciate it, I know I would.

As modulus said, you don't just need a cane. You need orientation and mobility training. If you're in the US, this is typically arranged through your state's agency that provides rehabilitation to blind people. What it is depends on your state, department of rehabilitation, commission for the blind, etc. Orientation and mobility isn't just learning how to to move the cane, but the skills of safe cane travel for all the types of travel you might do.  

Cane tips, lengths, and types are part preference and part what your needs are. The NFB sells folding and non-folding canes for people who like a lighter metal tip cane. Ambutech is a major supplier of a variety of cane types and numerous different tips, including rolling balls and metal tips. Your O&amp;M instructor can help you figure out where to start personally. Many of us own multiple canes and tips now for multiple types of situations.

Some people go to comprehensive training programs for blind people which are live-in programs that teach you a variety of blindness skills (cooking and housekeeping, cane travel, computers, job skills, braille, etc.) If you're especially motivated to learn a variety of blindness skills as quickly and comprehensively as possible, and can take several months off work or other obligations, this is potentially a good option to consider. I've heard good things about the nfb-affiliated training centers (colorado center for the blind, blind inc, and the louisiana center for the blind,) but haven't personally attended them. 

Some get these services locally or in home. Your state might send out trainers, or contract with an organization that serves blind people where you can go in-person for classes. It's quite location specific. Signing on with the state is usually the first step to access a variety of things (training, education, technology funding.)

Your local NFB chapter, ACB affiliate, or another local blindness group might be good for putting you in touch with local resources. 

Learning braille is useful, but it definitely isn't a priority to start working on if you don't have hearing loss IMO. You might be able to get training locally. The NFB independence market also sells some books for adult braille learners. You can also do a distance braille course through https://hadley.edu/braillecourses.asp

I would personally say the two biggest things initially are getting orientation and mobility training, and getting training (which you can start doing independently) on using your computer and smartphone with a screen reader. Without knowing what you use, there's too many to list. https://www.nvaccess.org/ for windows 
and https://applevis.com for mac and ios devices are top of the list. 

Also, I personally recommend looking into finding therapy through a local blindness organization, or with a therapist who understands disability issues, if you haven't already. While it is totally possible to live a full and happy life when you're blind, it's also completely normal and expected that there's going to be issues with losing sight. Having someone to work these things out with and taking care of your mental health is huge for a lot of people. 

We have a fantastic community here, and if you have any questions or issues that come up, there's probably someone here who can help you sort it out or point you in the right direction. If there's any way I can help, let me know as well. ",,,10,0,0,

1. You asked once, and that's fine. Generally speaking, if we need help, we'll say so. You didn't assume, which automatically makes you smarter than the average bear.
2. Don't take it as offence, or get offended, if your offer of help is refused. IT's very possible he/she hasn't done that route before/often, or it's changed in some way that he/she needs to get used to. We don't generally refuse help out of spite (well, we try not to, anyway). However, often times doing it ourselves is how we figure out that oh yeah, we meant to turn left way back there. If you help, he/she might not figure out where they might have taken a wrong turn, and the next time they're in the area they're going to need to figure it out again, and you're likely not going to be there. Also it depends on your definition of ""help"". IF I ask you where this room is and you tell me I passed it 3 doors ago, you've helped.
3. What would you do if you still wanted to get to know this person and they weren't blind? Ask yourself that question, and then do that. It could be as simple as ""Hey, your class is on the way to mine, mind if I walk with you?"", or as u/Finishedschool said, an invitation out for coffee. If you want a friendship with this person, then be friends with this person. He/she may ask you to help with this or that thing on occasion. Or, you may find you need their help with something. That's normal.
4. Please, please, please freaking please don't use a sentence containing the word ""inspiration"" where this person is the subject. If this person is anything like me, you're the 75 millionth person to say so and it gets really old really quickly. You may not mean anything by it, but I've been called an inspiration for walking out of a Starbucks with coffee in hand. I've been stopped on the sidewalk by people who just wanted to say they have mad respect for the fact I can do what I do every day. And that's wonderful and all that. But if your mad respect for my ability to do the exact same things you do without thinking about it causes me to miss my bus, I'm going to be mildly annoyed. I'm not going to say so, because I'm only an asshole to people who deserve it and you not knowing better doesn't qualify, but still, mildly annoyed. Possibly slightly more than mildly if my having missed that bus requires I make ""sorry I'm running late"" phone calls.

Beyond all that though, try to remember he/she is pretty much exactly like you, and approach them from that perspective. You, and they, will feel much less awkward about it. And you'll probably avoid putting your foot in your mouth more than you think.",,,5,0,0,

When people turn round they see the cane and although they may be startled, they are t going to blame you. The cane explains it. It’s like a very fast communicator that lets people know to move out of your way. 
Benefits wise, please get in touch with your local citizens advice bureau and ask them to help you work out which way you should go, and help you fill out forms if need be. Most of the charities I mentioned also have Welfare Officers who hare experts in this field and will help you with eligibility and forms.
With regards to being registered blind - it is absolutely not difficult to be registered blind. It’s a simple matter of your eyesight being assessed by a consultant and they have a criteria whereby they say you are Sight impaired or Severely Sight Impaired (SSI). They state this on a firm, you get a copy, and a copy goes to your local authority.
You need to go to your GP and tell them that you need a referral to an Eye Consultant as a matter of urgency, because you’ve had a big deterioration in sight and it’s quite probable you need to be registered as sight impaired. 
This registration is a gateway to s lot of other support, including getting a concession art travel pass. Lots of things that my brain can’t remember right now.

I have a few questions in addition to what you've said. 

Can a cane been used with a pram? My youngest is only just turned one (last month) and I use a buggy board for the 3 year old. I have a bugaboo so it's a bar handle and easy to push one handed. 

I'm not registered blind and have been told it's very very hard to get certified, do I need either or both to apply for any extra financial aid? 

I'm currently on income support, but 1st November my partner is moving in, however he works 4 days on 4 days off and when he is working it's 6.30am till 8.30pm so for those 4 days I am essentially a single parent. 

I have spoken to social services and Essex care limited for rehabilitation and sensory training, however for both theirs around a 2-3 week wait, should I call guide dogs too? 

Is a dog something that would be available do you know? Would one be able to aid and guide the pram? 

My brothers a graphic designer and has made a sign for the pram from perspex that indicates I'm a visually impaired parent with the visual impairment sign. 

So I was discharged from the hospital with I kid you not a shrug and a ""you just have to get on with it."" This has caused a great deal of stress and anxiety, making me feel completely lost and on my own, and essentially lost. Would you put in a formal complaint? 

Thank you for your time again!! ",,,4,0,0,

Lightweight - using one all day can be tiring.

Affordable - because I don't want to have to spend 100 bucks every year or when mine gets caught in a revolving door.

Durable - doors, people kicking/stepping on it, etc. accidents happen. The point is that it happens to the cane and not me.
replaceable parts

Doesn't rattle - Maybe more of a pet peeve of mine, but when the cane starts to rattle or jiggle when it's assembled, it bugs me to no end and makes me less certain of whether I'm detecting something or it's just the metal smacking around.

Affordable - seriously, if it's more than 30 bucks, no.

Different options for cane tips. Skinny, marshmallow, rolling, or snowball. They need to be options. And they all have to fit and not fall off.

A good grip - Look at golf clubs. The cheap rubber handles will do fine, but those will also wear out as the rubber is exposed to wear and tear.

Affordable - Do not put an app or electronics in my cane. Do not pull any needless gimmicks like laser engraving or whatever. 

Bad ideas for canes:

Lights - This isn't bladerunner.

speakers - HEY LOOK THAT GUY HAS A TALKING STICK!

electronics - Aww man, my 200 dollar cane got wet and now the GPS and bluetooth don't work anymore. At least it still has a headphones jack! Suck it, smartphones!

Hidden compartments: You mean like that golf club you're supposed to pee in?


Just give me a folding cane that won't break itself, my wrist, or my back account.

Try to see what you can come up with for cane tips meant for different terrains rather than sidewalk/cement only. There's a very interesting disc-shaped tip that's very useful on sandy beaches, for instance. I'd like to see what people can come up with to navigate ice and snow, whether or not it ends up being practical. I just like to see ideas being generated and hearing what people come up with.",,,4,0,0,

Even if you use OCR to  convert it to text there will probably be a large amount of errors.  OCR is notoriously iffy.  Those parts with shaded panels wouldn't even convert at all.

The only way to guarantee screen reader users could read them and be error free, would be to type each one manually.

I appreciate you wanting to make them accessible, but this could lead to a mountain of work for you.

I suppose their plain text OCR version would be better than nothing, but i would maybe note for the readers that there will be errors due to the conversion  process.",,,2,0,0,

Insofar as drawing graphs goes, if she's any good with MS Excel I believe it has some graphing functions she can use. Alternatively some form of electronic graphing calculator that allows her to print out the results. You're quite right, though, the actual drawing of the graphs may be a no-go, depending on her challenges. Again, the only person who can answer you definitively re: that is your student.",,,5,0,0,

0126fbf3-af99-4a9e-b3ad-fb4b7a416565,1537277900,"I started recently using a cane, and I have a similar situation to yours (significant peripheral vision loss from RP). I advoided using it for a long time because my acuity is really good, and didn't want people to think I was faking it.

However... the past six months I've barely left the house. I get nervous in crowds, because people popping in and out of my visual field is really disorienting. I run in to things a lot. I don't  see when people are trying to shake my hand or hand me things. I trip over things a lot. If someone points to something, nine times out of ten their hand is back down before I see where they pointed. If I drop something, it can take me a full minute or two before I see where I dropped it, and thats only after I've stepped back a full ten feet.

Needless to say, I had to do something. I've only been using the cane about a week now, but man I can already see a difference. I'm much more confident in public, and no one questions me about it. I don't dread leaving the house, i find myself actually enjoying going out. I don't run in to things, and people know to avoid me. I haven't been able to find O&amp;M training in my area, but I've read up on cane best practices and I'm making due.

The point is, it's a personal decision, and the benefits can definitely be there even if you don't have total vision loss. I'd recommend trying it out and seeing what works for you.
