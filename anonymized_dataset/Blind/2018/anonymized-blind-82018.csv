The other players can help guide me and complete any tasks I might get stuck on, but it’s ability to have a fully supportive audio app has honestly made it an absolute pleasure to play. I highly recommend getting yourself a copy and having a look at how it’s worked into the game play. (It even has sound effects!)

As for QR Codes, I almost feel like you’re on the cusp of potentially designing a whole new game/gaming method. :) There’s a lot of potential out there!! And, I will (not do humbly) say we are very  under-represented and underestimated in our likes and wants/needs when it comes to gaming. I understand there are many facets to the diagnosis of “blind” and we’re not all “round peg in round hole”, but surely some things can be somewhat easily changed just to make it easier for those with visual impairment to join in.

ea0b0f60-58de-4bbe-8b8c-a8edd76054d2,1533117825,"I'm a visually impaired student who just graduated high school last year. My high school doesn't offer AP World History, and I had to self study AP Human Geography (really fascinating class by the way), but I did take AP U.S History.

My vision isn't as bad as your student, but I hope I can be of help. 

The other posters have covered the stimuli used in the curriculum, but do you know what assistive technology your school has access to? If she isn't completely blind, would using a device known as a CCTV to enlarge text and images help? Contact the publisher of the textbook you use and ask them if they can convert/have a copy in braille.

My history teacher liked to put walls of microscopic text on her lecture slides that I couldn't see despite sitting in the front row. But it wasn't a problem for me because she read everything out loud. I resorted to listening to the lecture and writing down everything she spoke out loud instead of trying to read the lecture slide. Please be very descriptive about everything. 

I used a large print copy of the American Pageant textbook. It was the bane of my existence and took up the entire bottom row on my history teacher's bookshelf since it was bound into 8 separate volumes.

Is this the student's first time taking an AP class? You didn't say what grade she is in. 

I would also keep in mind having to arrange testing accommodations for the AP exam, if she hasn't done so already. There are detailed instructions on the College Board's Services For Students With Disabilities website. Keep in mind that you have to request accommodations at least 6 weeks in advance of the exam, and that's if everything goes smoothly. The AP exam, if ordered in an alternate format (mine was large print and I had a large block answer sheet, for example) has to be ordered separately from the rest of the school's shipment and also comes in a separate box. If testing accommodations are required, please remind whomever it may concern that a Nonstandard Administration Report (NAR) has to be filled out for every SAT and AP exam taken. The special education director at my high school did not know he had to do that and so my AP exam scores were delayed for a month one year. 

If she hasn't taken the SAT yet, I'd suggest getting accommodations for that ASAP because once granted, accommodations can be used on all College Board tests (PSAT, SAT, AP). I applied for accommodations through the College Board before I took the SAT, and I was given an ID number that I simply entered each time I signed up to take the the SAT, as well as when I registered for AP exams in the future.

Whoever is in charge of services for students with disabilities at your school should know how to request accommodations through the College Board (unfortunately I had to walk the special education director at my high school through what to do). And whoever is in charge of coordinating testing needs to know about the AP exams that need to be ordered in an alternate format well in advance of the ordering deadline so they arrive in time (my high school's testing coordinator was very familiar with me by senior year).

My heart goes out to you. I took 7 AP classes and 10 AP exams (self studied 3 classes) and many of my AP teachers were...taken aback, I suppose. 

They accommodated my needs well and enlarged my papers and read aloud or handwrote things down that I couldn't see for myself and were always more than willing to help me.

However, I was always surprised by how many of my teachers admitted that they never had ever had a visually impaired student in their AP class before. I vividly remember when I asked my AP Biology teacher if she knew anything about getting testing accommodation on the AP exam, she told me that in her 20 years of teaching AP Biology, I was her first visually impaired student and apologized for not being able to help me much.

I was very surprised and slightly put off by those comments. Not that it's a negative thing, but I was simply surprised by the fact that more visually impaired students do not take AP classes. Everyone praises me for it, but sometimes I wish I wasn't so alone. 

Best of luck to you. I know things are stressful with AP World History, especially given the course redesign this year, but I believe in you. And although your student may not say it, she believes in your ability to help her the best you can. I know I always did, in all my teachers.",,,1,0,0,

How heavy is the device? If the device and its controller are too heavy, that might not make it usable for certain people.

What is it like to use it? Do you have to keep it charged? Are there settings? What's calibrating the whole thing like?

What are the options for the glasses? Colors, shapes, etc?

Is the implant just in trials or is it more openly available? 

What's the battery life on the external device like? What chargers/cords does it use?

*How expensive is this thing?* 

*Is installing one covered by medical benefits programs for the disabled?*

Does this allow him to read, even large print?

Further, articles like these tend to strike me as someone going ""Look! You can get your eyes fixed, now you can stop being disabled!"" as if I am somehow the problem and not the fact that society is built around the assumption that someone will be able to see.

Trust me, I consider myself a pretty competent person, but it hasn't always been that way, and even still I will often get corrected by others impulsively even though they know I have my own way of doing something. Just remember the important thing is it gets done. If you have your own way of doing something, own it and make it yours. Practice it until you can walk yourself through the steps front and back in your head. Internalize a rhythm for it. Soon, it will become second nature and you'll be doing it while you listen to music or a podcast or whatever you enjoy.

For example, even though I have proper mobility training and have always managed to remain safe, crossing the street, particularly a busy one, never fails to raise my anxiety several levels. It used to be that every crossing would be a mini panic reflex. But repetition helps internalize what you need to do.

I think everyone has felt this way at one time or another, and I'm sure we all will feel it again in our lives. It's just believing in what you can do and not caving into what others believe you can do. ",,,1,0,0,

Where I work, it's a pretty common way to accommodate older colleagues who whine about needing reading glasses to be able to answer a phone call.

But, it also works in your favour in terms of working around how vision impairment makes the use of a smartphone horrible, as long as you can actually see the screen.

So, if you feel that you can almost rely on your vision to operate a smartphone, consider making things flip over in your favour by getting a larger screen to your phone.

I have just one more question to ask.

I understand that you are socially very active and capable, and comfortable finding new people whom you can interact with - regardless of whether they are blind or not- but, for others who do not know such opportunities exist, or share the feelings that only blind can share, I think, is important. 
Maybe on this platform you could even suggest and teach that there are different ways to interact and make new friends to others.

* There are a lot of talking devices: scales, thermometers, etc. I'd strongly recommend pricing comparisons. Very often the specific blind products are very expensive and one can get cheaper on Amazon or wherever.

I have currently only been able to think of one potential issue(not being visually impaired myself) with the cane ( I understand they come in different forms in regards to length colour and material)
My current idea is that the cane handle could incorporate an alarm and a bright light - an alarm should a visually impaired user fall so it may draw attention when a button is pressed in and  a light to not lost help draw attention when the alarm has sounded but also for users who need bright light to see.

I would like to ask r/blind for issues that are faced with visual impairment and I could feasibly solve in a secondary school (high school about age 14/15) workshop ?",,,1,0,0,

I'm able to handle cash because I live in Canada and our bills are 
 different colours, which is huge for accessibility. I'm a bit slower than the other cashiers, but I'm usually not on till during busy hours anyway. One of our computers is set up so that I can see it, so I don't have any problems with that, and if I do have trouble with something, there's always someone to help me. 

Since I'm sure someone will ask: Yes, I've had people try to slip me counterfeit money or fast change me, but I'm blind, not stupid. 

When it's busy, I usually just assist customers in finding things. The type of store I work in is laid out in a way that makes it very easy to orient myself and find things. I wouldn't be able to do it if I didn't have any vision at all, but for someone with low vision it's really easy.

The one problem I have is putting stock out. I can't see well enough to reliably put things away. Other than that, I'm a regular employee with different strengths and weaknesses, and I'm treated and paid the same as everyone else who works here. I dropped off resumes and was interviewed the same as everyone else, and I was hired because the interviewer felt like I would be a good fit for the position. I've never felt discriminated against by anyone I work with. Customers can be shitty, but customers are shitty regardless of what hand you've been dealt in life.

​

I'm not thrilled with either company. Uber in particular feels soulless and trashy. Their automated customer support is mind numbingly terrible. I also feel like drivers and riders are increasingly antagonistic toward each other. Drunk riders don't respect drivers and act like jerks. Drivers play games with riders (starting trips before arriving, driving in circles until the rider cancels, adding false charges, etc, etc). This cheapens the experience for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

It can be difficult to locate drivers, especially late at night or in crowded, downtown areas. Riders only have a minute or 2 to find their ride before the driver cancels or extra charges begin. I often text drivers, but many of them don't receive or read the message.

​

I don't like spending a lot of money on transportation. It feels like I'm throwing away money, sort of like paying $15 or more for meal delivery. It's a lot of $$ for a fairly insignificant transaction (one ride somewhere or one meal). I used to take Uber to work every day, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was throwing away money, even though I gained time and convenience. Obviously, YMMV.

This would be an awesome feature. I have had drivers leave and charge me when I can't see their car. To be fair, Lyft has gone the extra mile to make sure I don't get charged for it by giving me a credit... but if you are late to work, it's not good.

When I was in college I used to play a lot of pick-up soccer with people from all over Africa.  They would tell me stories about the balls they'd made as kids.  Rolling up a bunch of clothes into a ball was common.   You just need something that makes a noise to attach or put inside.

For example, I once saw someone blow up a balloon and cover it with layers of tape to make a soccer ball.  Put a small bell (or anything that jingles) in one of those and you're good to go.

You could do something as simple as taking a soda can and putting something metal inside, then taping over the hole at the mouth of the can.  It's not round, and it's not really a ball, but its good enough to kick with your brother, it's cheap, and it's loud.   You can always make further improvements as you go (e.g., make it more round).

Be positive.  Be creative.  Keep trying.

I can see shapes and some colors (mostly blues but only on the outside. The middle sees no color).The rest of my vision in that eye is just grey. (Like really thick frosted glass.) I also have a couple black spots that scare the crap out of me every now and then because I think it's a spider lol. 

I have terrible vision in the other eye due to astigmatism. It's blurry but glasses help on that side. Glasses do not help the other eye and I can't wear them due to trigeminal nerve pain. 

I can see better in the dark since light just makes everything washed out, and it's also pretty painful.

Things that help me.

Painters tape- since I can see blue it's on every corner and on things I lose a lot. I also use neon puffy paint for things I lose a lot. They make so many colors now. Have her pick out her favorite. That way you know she'll see it. I have 0-10% depth perception so it helps me a lot. I ran into a lot of walls before this.

High contrast everything and huge- it's the only way I can see text.

While she's young you might want to think about having her learn brallie now. I do not use it, but to me that seems like a good idea if you like to plan ahead like me. But again I know 0% about it.

I would also suggest occupational therapy. It helped me out so much.

If they refuses to fuck off for some reason, then I’ll firmly (and if necessary, loudly) insist that they get their hands off of me.  Usually that will get someone to stop, or at the very least attract outside attention.  If all else fails I guess it would be self-defense time, though I’ve never had to use that.  De-escalation and escape is almost always preferable.

I replaced the red marbles in Potion Explosion with brighter red marbles. I could paint the potions as well if needed with higher contrast colors. For lost cities (a card game) I printed a set of high contrast large print cards with just the color and number,  no artwork. I printed on regular paper using playing card size and then sleeved the paper with a real playing card for rigidity. Another game that I think would work even with no vision is King of Tokyo. It's simple enough that it would be easy for a sighted person to state what was happening (e.g. You rolled a 3, 1, claw, and two hearts, you have 12 health and 3 points, the monster in Tokyo has 5 health.)

I know how he feels as far as accommodations, even after getting them at 18, I tried to refuse a lot of the more obvious stuff, like a CCTV in class, until I absolutely couldn’t do without it in my math class. I’m slowly becoming more and more color deficient, so I started to label a lot of my stuff recently (pens, markers, etc). I’d be legally allowed to drive if I tried (i barely pass the DMV vision tests and my acuity is still alright), but I refuse to do so because it’s a danger to myself and others, I just don’t have enough functional vision in daytime driving hours. I’m great at night though lol! 

I actually very recently got an electric, seated scooter from Razor that goes ~20mph max, and I’ve been using it to get around my neighborhood and general area. There’s a lot of stuff that is relatively walkable near me, but it takes a 40 minute walk into a much more reasonable time frame, which lets me get stuff done more often. It’s also just really fun to ride LOL. It’s the Razor Ecosmart Metro :) Definitely doesn’t replace the help of people driving me to work/school/etc, but it lets me take some of the responsibility back! 

I’m sorry that he’s dealing with it as well, but it also weirdly feels good to know I’m not alone. The specialist I’m seeing at Duke is really good, and he mentioned that there is a drug in clinical trials that *might* be helpful, down the road if it gets approved, so hopefully we can all look forward to that! He also suggested some supplements to slow the progression, he put through certain brands his own testing with a few other specialists in the field to see if they do what they claim as well as if all the ingredients are safe (since supplements aren’t regulated). They don’t need a scrip or anything, we just got them off Amazon. If he’d like to ask his own dr about them to find out if they’d help his case at all, I can PM you the names and specific brands, I just have to go find the bottles lol.

I had a very hard time learning to walk, as a child, only managed to walk up and down stairs without stopping at every step when I was 8 or so. Definitely make sure her vision is not affecting her basic mobility. You'll want to at least consider orientation and mobility training.

Is her vision otherwise corrected? Consider getting her glasses so she can learn to read and write in print as well as in Braille.

Sunglasses and hats are good for photophobia. You can even prescription glasses that darken on their own when exposed to bright sunlight. Just because lights bother her, it doesn't mean your little girl can't enjoy the outdoors.

One thing you'll need to remember, particularly if she just end up with low vision, is that you should use concrete words to describe things instead of pointing and directions. Don't say ""look at the doggie over there,* say ""look at the white doggie across the street, to your right, walking past the red fence."" Don't say ""the cookies are on the table,"" say ""the cookies are in the glass jar on the kitchen table, close to the fridge."" I hope that makes sense.

Say “ hey bro, come with me, take my hand I’m going to take you outside show you some things”. 
Then tell him to take off his shoes
Let him feel the grass on his toes
Bring him to the hose ( if it’s warm out) feel the water.  If he’s interested some small water play. Water tables with all different shaped animals on them... etc
Tell him you were thinking that you want him to feel comfortable outside the house. If he doesn’t have a walking stick yet, ask him to just hold your hand. Tell him what to do to navigate.
Tell him “( name ) you can still live a amazing life, but you can’t be afraid to feel the world out.  Let’s just take a walk so you feel the sunshine.” Just the different smells alone are a whole other experience.
Ask him what he hears, then tune in yourself. Describe what that noise is
And what it looks like.

I understand describing a bird without using color or shape is difficult.
Maybe just name things for now. At 6 he is already very smart. Does he go to school?
You can order shape books off amazon or just get him very realistic collection of animals. 
I wish I could find the set I had working with special needs kids.
It was birds, turtles, snakes, rabbit, and different patches of fur for all different kinds of animals. 
Once he is comfortable leaving the house.
Take him to a petting zoo
Let him pet and touch the different animals. 
I knew a 9 yr old ( the brother of my friend)
He loved the wind In his face
I drove him on a scooter he had a smile for days.
It sounds like he needs some encouragement. Mental mapping
Or work with him on navigation, 
So there’s really no reason he can’t do
Things the other kids are doing right now, as long as someone is with him.

I would definitely get him to walk with you each day. Just opening his mind, and building his confidence will lift his spirits.
Has he ever gone swimming?
Obviously I don’t mean laps or the ocean
I just mean kiddie pools, sprinklers or shallow water? 
You can get him magnet letters
Teach him the shape of the letters
And the sounds they make.

Brail is entirely different. There is fun in all knowledge though.
If none of this sounds good, or he’s fearful.  
Try some crafts.  You can make slime with him. You can get different shaped beads and have him string them on a thick piece of twine.
Music is amazing too
Get him to explore music on you tube.
Just sitting with him, and asking him to listen to some music you like is bonding.
You can talk about different music and instruments to bond with him. He seems to be knowledgeable in that area so go with it.

2. Training - work with a local blind organization to offer courses for blind students.  Basic programming courses in Swift, Python,  etc can build confidence and understanding.
3. Work with existing projects that provide quality software for free or low cost.  A great example would be NVDA.
4. Ensure in your work and workplace wcag is followed.

I know you are looking for a specific project and these don't really fit but are often valuable.  Here is a tangible specific software idea as well.  Braille literacy has been correlated to rates of blind unemployment.  Correlation is not causation but I believe it is a factor.  Writing a program that teaches UEB and works with a braille display may be valuable.  Here is a link to a UEB typing teaching tool
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/braille-tutor/id1082934024?mt=8

It would be nice if something like this worked with ios on-screen braille keyboard and braille displays.  An easier task than you might expect.  A similar program that reinforces reading braille contractions would be valuable as well.

The issues of unemployment amongst blind people are huge and difficult to address.  Educational neglect, pervasive low expectations, expensive tools, hiring discrimination and institutional barriers as well as many other things contribute.  ",,,6,0,0,

But I can offer some encouragement in regards to relationships. Particularly that this wasn't the best relationship of your life. The best is yet to come.

I know that sounds cliche, but hear me out. Relationships are about acceptance. There was a song lyric I heard a while back that stuck with me, because it is absolutely true. ""If you're worthy of my strengths, you're worthy of my weaknesses."" Meaning, of course that if you're not worthy of my weaknesses, then you're not worthy of my strengths.

And remember that everyone has weaknesses. You are NOT, in any way ""less"" because of yours. And no, that's not easy to internalize, for anyone. It takes a lot of work. The first step, though, is understanding that it's true. The first step is understanding that you are a whole and complete human being.

Once you accept that as true, you can work on internalizing it. There are various ways to do that, and there's no shame in getting professional counseling if you need it.

There's nothing spiritual about it. It's common sense at the most very basic level.

3. a. I go outside and socialize? I have no issues and meet people daily. I get out and about. I am very extroverted. I mostly hang out among sited people. I am pretty popular on my community college campus.

b. yeah, there is blind communities, but I am not part of any of them.

Instagram is okay, but it's mostly photos anyways. Reddit itself is not accessible, but bacon reader is fantastically accessible. I really enjoy using it. Facebook is 80 to o90 percent accessible. twitter is fully accessible and I love twitter clients. All the others I use seem to be okay. I can use it right.

6. I gain information in all sorts of ways. Internet is actually a huge parts of them. Google is  wonerful isn't it? There are some nice sites out there with wonderful information. I go to scholarly sites. I like databases. I love the ibook and kindle stores. I read veraciously. Form posts are good too and discussion forms like this.  I also watch a lot of speeches interviews and presentations other youtube users put up mostly by famous scholars or public official. I read the news through twitter a lot of times.

I have things like bible gateway u version.

I talk to people and find out about things. I engage in online debates.

7. I love online friends. I have more of those because it's hard to find people like myself in real life. I don't mean blindness. I mean personality and interests. I have no problems with socializing, but feel like people do not get my mind in real life. I am ambitious and scholarly.

8. I tho a blind social media is a bad idea. Great concept, but pragmatically it's a awful aide. There's many. I am on cafe random, vorail, use to on be zonebbs before they shut down, out-of-sight, use to be on blinknation before they too shut down, and there's others. There tends to be a lot of blind drama, infighting, much shallow topics, gossip, and backstabbing. It just  isn't a good environment with just blind people. I prefer sites with blind and sited alike.  ",,,1,0,0,

The real problem is that I think too many parents coddle their little precious blind kiddos, who can break, because extra fragile. And then later those adults come out and have absolutely no idea what to do with themselves. They don't try, feel that they lack skill or can be or worse should be coddled for the rest of their lives. I absolutely think blind schools are the worse ideas. I favor integration, because we live in the real world where unfortunately you have to adapt to learn, and you will never be able have a blind only world or society. nor will you be able to be coddled all your life. Learning welp, some people maybe mean about my disability and I have to learn to speak up about it and say it's wrong, is paramount. As parents have to fight the school for materials, and keep on top of them, but it's doable and I think it's important. You can not ignore reality and hide amongst the blind. Kids can be mean, they don't understand, but adults don't either.  By shunning the issue it's not going to help. You have to be assertive (not aggressive) as a  a blind person if you want to get anywhere. Help her understand advocating for herself. Regular school is absolutely possible, there is so much tech. Everything from audio equipment to braille screens to braille materials. I whent through public school, and am studying for a political science degree some say it's one of the hardest. I am doing fine. I've done a lot of  school and it's absolutely possible. Yes, have her learn braille and a screen reader.

I just got the adaptive devices and went with it.  There are also local agencies that can come to your home and work with you in terms of independence training, and there is no need to go through the NFB crapshoot!!!! I’ve managed without either organization pretty well. If you need to talk this through, I’d be happy to help, I am a very independent blind person who can give you more guidance. I am usually asked for advice on this stuff anyway.

As to your phone voiceover works phenomenally if you can learn how to use it, mostly of course, I’ve found a few minor hiccups, but nothing to effect daily use unless you were a student trying to. Sight out of ibooks. Or something like this. You don’t even have to work off of a screen, but for this to work you’ll have to learn some extra stuff. I work a lot off of a bluetooth keyboard with the phone, especially typing long explanations like this. The keyboard and iphone screen. Itself are both excellently accessible. I say the iphone is much more accessible than the android. Apple has done such a great job at designing this screen reader and it cost just about zilch dollars after you buy the unit. In my experience apple devices last a while. The mac is a good choice. I have a 4 years old computer and it is like I just purchased it yesterday. I mean the screen is a bit dusty the unit has been here but the workings is still great. My friend has my 6 years old or nearly that macbook pro I bought for 1500 I believe but it’s 2018 and the mid 2012 model still works like it was new! He was just telling me how well it stil works in gratitude, but the point here I am trying to make is this computer is so worth your investment. I don’t think Joel’s computer my old computer will break anytime soon. 5 years and still counting!!
! It just made up for the 1500 dollars that was invested in it. The better news screen. Reader is free, plus you have excellent hardware. Besides that, windows has NVDA as mentioned. Windows can be an expense because after a few years you need a new unit. I have old windows pcs and they need replacing desperately, but fortunately my main OS is Mac. So I am not too worried at this point. NVDA is good for windows if that’s how you choose to go though.

I do like maxiaids I have bought things from them and the NFB has nice free canes and slates so that’s very helpful. Their canes are not too bad either for purchase. I’ve done this as well, but as stated before I won’t join them.

I would say my preferred medium is braille but by a braille display. I don’t read audio books wel. I don’t tend to pay attention to the details there. I just gloss over and listen for the main ideas. So if I really want to do that book any justice I read it.

Yeah, a braille book can be large. My favorite comparison  is of the bible. Go look at one, I don’t care if you are not religious. You know what a regular bible looks like right? Well a braillebible takes up three shelves of a bookshelf or three levels. So, it’s huge. Imagine 20 books of a size of a family picture album. That’s a bible for us. Quite portable no?

The sites attract similar crowds the online blind community is  small. The others may not know about it, or just aren't interested. The question is advertising and what you do to get them to join. You'll always get a similar online crowd they advertise whereever  and those interested join, as mentioned a standard crowd. Now how do you proceed? How do you reach these others there are people who wants to be part of each site and not want to be part of others.  Others are not so inclined and don't really want to join them. Others are just not motivated, or have not tapped in the blind community online. They don't want to, they have not looked, or they lack motivation. So how do you get it to them? These platforms are all over the internet. People are sharing it rapidly across facebook and twitter. But, those others who don't know, aren't connected. In my experience usually older people or not interested in the blind community and not connected with other blind people anyway. anyway, the younger crowd dominates these places. How do you get an older crowd to be interested? They don't usually want to join, and the younger crowd don't want to mix with them. They are less informed with technology, website, just get on facebook occasionally, are limited to facebook, and just their regular contacts. They don't reach out to get to know other blind people or have a desire to search for it. The ones who have has found these various sites. Vorail is dying, but they are attempting to reach out to a older community. But, not succeeding. They are looking to make their own portable audio social media device that older people can work to, but it's expensive, and have not made it to the right hands. I suspected there is not much advertising to the right crowd. They are chasing both sited blind. Tom had this vision of older people joining, but for the sake of money has abandoned it. They are looking at offline blind conventions to spread the word. The blind members have done a lot. They bring it up in real life, and at their blind organizationso and when meeting up with friends. However it's still not reaching. You propose we do what? We can go find them maybe at these blind places and you can talk to the elderly, but you can risk them just saying no, and not being interested. Most of them can't use technology or get online anyway. And, now what? 

Also, let me kind of tell you what others have found out who have ventured down the road of this market. It's not a market and not profitable. How do as sustain. Vorail is struggling, and so was something like the zone. Developers lose inerest. There is something like out-of-sight, but I am a little confused with how to join. I did join but they never approved my membership. I don't know too much about them. They are reaching similar crowds maybe., but they do a fair job I think. They're still around, but have not been on in a long time. I have an account with them somewhere. Have no idea what their administration is like, or their struggles. The sites Ive taken interested inand massively more popular just had issues and didn't last. The vorail thing is still well and alive, but I wouldn't say without it's struggles financially.

First  thing first. I would get this book in hard copy large print or braille. I refuse to do math  any other way. Get a lot of paper or a brailler, it will be your very best friend for this class.

I would talk to the adaptive technology specialist or the person in charge  of converting or ordering your book a semester in advance. Do not go talk to them 3 weeks before the semester starts and say, ""I need  help!"" And expect fast results or them knowing what to do. This is the most frustrating thing for them. I am the model blind student whereever I go and ideas usually get ran past me when it's a blind student, anonnomously of course. This is important because of the next advice.

I suggest a traditional math class. Take the  classes that does not involve a online math portion or uses software.  A lot of people like stuff like Alex. It's more fun, interactive, and the plus for the teacher is that it's easier to grade. Problem? Alex and such math ' software is inaccessible. So, either a  teacher that teaches traditional and use no tech to teach their classes or someone who will modify their class for you and give  you the alternative assignment that requires no online work.

The disabilities office can indeed help you do this and  get your book in large print. But they can not do it three weeks before a semester and not stress and be a little short. It may be a tough process to find but they will find one for you.  ",,,1,0,0,

What I suggest is to have her learn adapting strategies and be quick on her feet to change. Have her brainstorm creative and interest adaptations with you will be helpful. Something I've always  been able to do. Let her try different experiences without holding back, even things you think a blind person couldn't do. If it directly requires vision, maybe not, but we can do most anything. Be positive and don't give up. Have her be able to be open and verbally  able to share her perspectives on things, and be open to questions about her blindness. Do not be sensitive about this. The more open the better. As a blind person you are always the teacher about what blindness is. Teach her to be open to asking for help and there is nothing wrong with it if appropriate.

This kid would be playing with her toys which made a lot of noise, and she would play with them in a noisy way, no shame either or no discipline from mom. Also, I once stayed after to ask her a question. This kid is five. She wanted a candy bar. Her mom was still answering my question, and she got on the ground and threw a little tantrum. Now, I am not criticizing the kid, that’s what kids do right? Maybe they can have a bit more discipline and respect, but maybe if you know your kid has such tendencies don’t bring her to class? Just maybe? Maybe that’s logical? I felt sorry for the kid, but I also needed to talk to her mother, my professor. I was also younger and didn’t know how to mediate the situation. I was 19 I think? Maybe 20. The kid wanted the candy bar badly. Hahaha! She also once showed up late. About half an hour. After 15 minutes all the students left. I was actually late that day slowly lugging up my breakfast. I had woken up and got breakfast and it was a full lowed. I did this just to get to class. I wasn’t going to lug it back down, no sir. But still no teacher. I was going to eat breakfast there and then go back to my room and study or do my thing. So, I dug in and ate. The other student in the classroom who didn’t leave was a friend of mine at the time. She was studying. Half an hour or 26 minutes after class was supposed to have begun professor walks in. She was apparently stuck in traffic. The auddacious thing was this. She opened her mouth and said where is the class? Why didn’t anyone call or e-mail me? I was shocked. I think my friend was as well. What? This class is your responsibility. Maybe you should let us know that you are late, but why are you 26 minutes late anyway?

Unfortunately it is a well known private school.

I enjoy learning alright. I call myself nerdy/academic. I would stay and teach but you need a doctorate or masters at least for teaching post-secondary here. At a two year community college you need at least a masters but a four year unless you were some sort of low level lecturer which is a bit difficult to find work for academia is hard to get in to under a doctorate. Master seems fine but I hope I have the money and stuff or aptitude scores. I have a good mind, but for apptitude testing, I am quite horrible at. Normally tests are fine but those state apptitude tests are not my thing. I also have a feeling I wouldn’t score all that well on an IQ test. I am just not a good test taker in that regard. Normal testing as mentioned from courses are fine.

Yeah, Plato is fun, I prefer socratic stuff or aristotle. I like the enlightenement philosophers though. I also like people like scenica. Boetheus is fine. Kant is interesting. Plato is good, I just don’t agree. I like philosophy in general. I don’t agree with confucius but I believe I’ve read the entire analects and those are interesting. Haven’t gotten around to read mencius though. You give me anything with theory or requiring thinking and I am interested as long as it’s not mystical, I’ve been in to a bit of this until I realized I was in to it and in the wrong thing. I am a Christian and don’t agree with spiritual mystical teachings that’s not Christian. I was in to Jungian theory for a bit. In Jung I am an NT ENTJ as my name says. I score pretty high on proper big five tests when it comes to openness. I may not agree but I’ll give your idea a listen. No guarantee of no argument against your ideas if my own views don’t match. But something people don’t understand with me, argument or disagreement does not mean not open to it. I am willing to understand, but as a very moral and logical person I can’t agree with you, but no one said I won’t listen or understand. I love debates to understand and for fun. I can be a very deep thinker. I appreciate what you said though hahaha!

I have always gotten a and b grades in most 90% of my college education. I failed one course but because the teacher was awful and even the students who passed that class would agree with me. My friend passed and didn’t think much of the teacher. It was more like a I’ll give you the book and you go study on your own. We’ll talk about something fun and unrelated to your course but yeah. Furthermore I have a right to bring my very noisy child to class because I don’t know who else will take care of her. ETC.... Otherwise I’ve gotten a couple of CS in sciences like biology and geology. But right now to VR I am still a headcase because I am now in my 8th year. And still in lower division, but I am convinced I like this. This doesn’t seem like hard work much to me just fun, and teachers seem to be very accepting of me and my interest and ideas. I liked philosophy as well, but didn’t mesh with the way the discipline went. I loved reading the stuff. I like political philosophy more though. So, maybe I’ll go for political theory and think about working for a think tank.

Blindness doesn’t mean the end of the world. As a blind person who has had many opportunities and have done quite a bit I can say your life isn’t done being exciting yet. From traveling all about Los Angeles and Orange county, to being a very successful blind student, to working for the school newspaper and running around school promoting it, to having done a lot of other things starting from elementary school and running for AS b president to being the flyer gal for this blind organization after going on numerous things such as surfing and water skiing, and deep sea fishing, to being a political science student, studying a pretty vigorous subject. Maybe law school, but we’ll see, and at that I want to study for the hardest sector of law in the US, that being US constitutional law. Blindness is a mere lost of one sight not of one self and one’s ability. My motto is in a sense I have done it, it’s not special, so you go do it too. I want an A in life and I am sure you can get an A too, even if you’re blind. Life doesn’t get boring. You don’t need to be stuck inside. I am as I am typing this on the way to the coast in Orange county to enjoy it. You can do much of what you are doing as a sighted person.

To focus myself a bit I have a ipad for reading and writing and office type of work and my phone is for fun, but if I really wanted it, I could use my iphone for absolutely everything. The amazing thing is this. With the advent of ebooks and accessible e-readers I need stuff like specialized audiobooks books, specific blind library rendered useless, for the exception of textbooks because those can rely heavily on visuals and for some of those regular e-books can do, but if it’s picture heavy a specific service good at describing and scanning the book is helpful. If she is just reading for fun, any e-reading app is fine.

Amazon has an amazing kindle appp. I read a bit of a book on there and I flipped through nearly a chapter and a half on it, no problems. The only problem at the time was it was a sample book so I had to get it somewhere else, and then found out that you can buy books but not on the ios appp. If you just go on the amazon site and buy the e-books on there she can read it on her phone and account. You just have to buy it on her account. She could do it herself. I am totally blind and I have bought a book or two. I would buy more but I currently lack money and I have thrown more of that money in to ibooks. I think personally they are cheaper.

Apple themselves has an excellent e-reader on any ios device and even mac os. It’s called Ibooks. That sounds familiar? Yep, that’s 98 percent accessible, except a small feature which I don’t think you folks are planning to use. I believe they may be working on a fix for me, hopefully. The only feature that doesn’t work is copying text from the book with voice over. If you just want to read like she does, that’s absolutely no problems with it. Unfortunately for me though I am a student and have a couple books that I am reading and really enjoying, but unfortunately at the end of the day I need to cite from them! Yep, that’s the only real issue that I have with ibooks.

Because of these things I have now felt bookshare and nls is really unnecessary for me, and their collection because it’s so mainstream both kindle and ibooks is just really awesome and much better than any accessible library. I’ve found and read books that are not yet on those shelves. Yes they cost money but that’s your sacrifice for a more mainstream and accessible collection. I have so many books and I guarantee you if I wantted these on bookshare or NLS I won’t be able to find them.

I agree, cooperative games with open information are great for blind players. I'm currently trying to decide what my next game is going to be, so many good choices out there. I'm torn between **Burgle Bros**, a coop heist game, and **Dice Forge**, a competitive dice game where you can upgrade your dice faces as you play to win more resources/victory points. 

As for bluffing games, yes, you are at a disadvantage by not seeing their facial expressions, but I've found that I can pick up someone is lying by the changes in their voice :) But, in games like Secret Hitler or Resistance: Avalon, it doesn't matter too much that you can't see their face, you get a lot of information about other players from the moves they make in the game. 

I read that Power Grid can also be plpayed by blind players, and I really wanted to buy that game, but I'm not sure the people I play with would be into it as they are mostly casual gamers. But it might be something that your family/friends might be interested in, so check it out. The game is 'algorithmic' and it has no hidden information, so should be playable once you understand the rules. 

As for card games, those are usually a bit harad for blind players. I know there are people that use braille labels on the cards, but that's not an option for us who don't know braille. I've been thinking of a solution with QR codes, and a smartphone app that will read the cards for you through headphones, but I havaen't tested that out yet.

If there aren't people in big cities doing the job with public transportation, then you should either find a job in the same field or that uses the same major to shoot for that matches those criteria or you should consider switchingmajors. Remember that you can double major as a hedge against these eventualities in many schools. You might consider something highly employable if you can stomach it, such as economics, math, and CS. People will always tell you to chase your dreams because that's what they're supposed to do, but they're not the ones who have to deal with real consequences if you can't find a job.

My first day using it, I found myself adding a lot of whitespace by accident. I seem to be doing that less now, but I've noticed that blind people tend to add a lot of unneeded whitespace because it doesn't register in the audio when reading things back. Perhaps making double spaces and returns more ""visible"" (in the auditory sense) would help.

I've also triggered some weirdness where Flicktype seems to ""take over"" and I can't get out of it, even affecting behavior in the lock screen when I try to lock and unlock the phone to get back to what I was doing.

Other people's expectations have a massive effect on us. It's been shown that rats that are handled by humans who are told that they are stupid rats perform worse in maze tests. That is, even the low expectations of a human has an unconscious effect on the performance of a rat. We're super sensitive to what others think we can do, and low expectations or perceived low expectations has a huge impact on what we are able to do in the moment and also how we see ourselves.

Probably when you did the test, you picked up on the low expectations of the testers, or at any rate felt in your heart that they had low expectations. After all, the mere fact of a test presupposes in some way that the task must be hard. When your performance matched the low expectations, you naturally found the experience traumatic because your performance didn't match your own image of yourself as the capable person that it sounds like you are.

I second the sentiment of most comments here saying that screen size doesn't matter too much if you're going to be primarily using VoiceOver, although if you do have some functional vision then larger screens might offer some small additional benefit. I think you're really going to like the switch to iPhone once you get the hang of it, although I don't know much about Windows Phone accessibility.

Hey there, I'm the developer of the new FlickType Keyboard, as well as the developer of the original Fleksy Keyboard. I second the sentiment of most comments here saying that screen size doesn't matter too much if you're going to be primarily using VoiceOver, although if you do have some functional vision then larger screens might offer some small additional benefit. I think you're really going to like the switch to iPhone once you get the hang of it, although I don't know much about Windows Phone accessibility.

The ""weirdness"" that you mention is caused by iOS bugs in areas that are unfortunately completely outside of our control, ie outside of the keyboard APIs. We've had another couple of similar reports and have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to hunt such issues down. Even though we've eventually addressed a few of those successfully with some non-standard workarounds, we haven't yet managed to reproduce some of what you're describing here - we'll have to try the WhatsApp signup flow. At least it seems that most of the major issues are not widespread but rather happen under rare situations, so for the vast majority of people it works great.

On the spacing issue, this is a tricky one to resolve and seems generally low impact, but it's definitely on the list. I'm curious, what is your level of sight, and if you have some sight, do you have any comments on the visual feedback we provide for low-vision folks?

The three primarily materials used for a cane is aluminium, graphite and fiberglass. Aluminium is usually the cheapest and the most durable, but it is also the heaviest.

Graphite is lighter than aluminium, but more costly. I've found them to be less durable than aluminium, but weirdly, Ambutech lists it as *more* durable. Not sure why that is.... maybe a redesign?

Fiberglass isn't used very much in Canada, so I can't say too much about it (we don't even carry them in our store). The fiberglass ones I am used to are usually for light usage (indoors type).

You can choose pink for the grip, the tip and even the shaft if you so wish. Many people are surprised to find the colours don't mean as much as people think. There actually is no standard for white canes around the world (in Russian, they are usually black. In poorer countries, they take what gets donated, which leads to an interesting mish-mash). While white is the most recognizable, you can pick whatever you want that gets the job done (for safety to prevent impacts). Using a non-standard colour would make people less likely to recognize it, though.

There are two primary reasons why people have trouble seeing at night (although there can be many more). The most common one is the pupil has trouble regulating how much light goes into the eye, and the retina doesn't get enough (or too much, which can be why some lights are blinding at night). The other is the rods in the eye are damaged, and they are more sensitive to lower light conditions. When that happens, the retina itself isn't able to receive the light. 

You should talk to your doctor about the night blindness issue, they would have more knowledge of your medical history and (hopefully) explain it a little more. Depending on where you live, you should also talk to a Low Vision Assessor to see if they can discuss it a bit more and see what items may be able to help you (for some people, yellow tints on glasses help them see in low light conditions).

http://www.secondsight.com/g-the-argus-ii-prosthesis-system-pf-en.html

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_retinal_prosthesis

The system implants 60 electrodes into the eye, which connect to the retina. The camera is mounted onto a pair of glasses, which sends the picture to a processing unit (larger than a cell phone, but not too much), which send the signal back to the glasses. The glasses has a transmitter mounted to the side, which sends the signal to the implant in the eye.

For someone who is blind their entire life, it is hard to describe how low resolution those 60 electrodes are. When I described it to a family member for someone who was getting it, I described it like an old TV from the 30s... but much worse. 

No options for the glasses as far as I know.

It is now more openly available, if you have the money. Last I heard, it cost $150,000 USD, including the surgery. Not sure if the price has gone down. As far as I know, no medical benefit program covers it, it is still considered too experimental. I remind my clients who are thinking about it, that they are literally guinea pigs for this kind of thing.

For reading.... Of the two clients I've worked with who have had it, none of them were able to read. In theory, it is a possibility, but maybe two or three letters at a time. They were more able to see strong contrast (white sidewalk against darker grass background) and follow the line.

The Argus II is the first step in bionic replacements for eyes... but in terms of functionality, it is like a hook hand from the 1400's. It can do SOME things, but there is a lot it can't do.

Worked with the Department of Rehabilitation to get through all of that. Found that accessibility was a major issue with all the apps and sites I used to use with vision on a daily basis and started researching accessibility initiatives and programming. Learned the value of Twitter and how it can be used to advocate for ADA rights and accessibility issues with the right hashtags and callouts. 

I became a certified web accessibility specialist through the DeQue University online program, started hand coding my own websites as self-learning projects, and started getting into iOS app accessibility and learning how to give proper feedback. When Lyft updated their interface back in December of 2015, it broke everything in terms of accessibility and I was pissed. Lyft was a lifesaver while I was still learning how to get around on buses and trains with my white cane, and here they went and took away my mobility resource. 

I sent them an angry tweet and feedback, and they decided to bring me in to chat with the engineering team. I showed them how I used VoiceOver, and from that meeting they decided to bring me on for regular testing and checking in. I've been very part-time with them since February of 2016 and am potentially going full-time with them in the next few months as their Accessibility Specialist, making the app and site work for us and people with other disabilities, advocating and evangelizing for accessibility across all aspects of the company, and attending trade shows like NFB. I also contract with the Internet Archive and with Center for Accessible Technology for website testing. 

I learned a lot doing research studies and attending focus groups at the Lighthouse, networking with all the companies coming in with their apps for testing and drew back to my 4 years of product QA and tech support to help communicate clearly with their dev teams. It's one thing to say something is broken, and another entirely when you can explain how it's broken and how to fix it. 

This has been a major 180 degree life change for me as I used to be an animator and VFX artist before losing my sight. The QA I used to do was for animation and graphics technology, but those testing procedures carried over to the testing I do now.  Join meetup groups, attend conferences, learn all you can about accessibility, learn how to speak out and up when advocating, and be persistent.

6354e7fe-0049-4571-9486-a34df0fa42af,1533159236,"Just like reading printed letters, braille, after a while, becomes a bunch of patterns as you move your finger over the words. This is why people can read braille extremely fast. What this means is that if you have the letter *r*, for example, it blends in with the other letters of a word. This pattern-based reading would be lost with holes, because they feel different.

Another reason is that dots are more prominent, when compared to holes. The distance between dots also matters a lot, this can be quite confusing if not done right.

It is possible to read negatives, but the holes need to be deep enough (e.g. reading braille holes on the back of a one-sided braille paper is quite hard, almost impossible).

TL;DR: Make sure the holes are deep enough, and keep it short.",,,1,0,0,

6354e7fe-0049-4571-9486-a34df0fa42af,1534760458,"A lot of professional describers refer to time, such as _Now, a man walks into a room_, or mention things that break the fourth wall, so to speak. For example: _Our view changes, now showing a bald man, carrying a suitcase._
This is not present in your descriptions, which allows you to stay in character, without reminding the viewer that they are actually watching a video.

You try to add as much detail as possible, which is expected, if you describe something, however, it really shows that you have an intimate knowledge of what you are actually describing, which really helps. I'm not sure what it was, but I remember you explained a concept I wasn't familiar with at the right time. This is incredibly hard to do, because you wouldn't want to make it too detailed for people already familiar with the game you are describing, yet it should be easy to pick up for someone absolutely new to it. You really managed to find the right balance so far.

I was particularly pleased when you were talking about the landscape in your Witcher 3 video. People think that the interesting thing is what your character is doing, which is true 90 per cent of the time, but the scenery is just as important, especially on horseback.

You also focus on what can be seen in the distance, rather than just staying with the character, where it is relevant. This is great, for the same reasons as above.

Just to mention one tiny negative thing, it would be nice if what you were describing and the action itself would be a bit closer to each other. In one of your Fortnite videos, you inform the viewers that a shot rings out in the distance, but the actual shot happens 3 seconds or so later. As you are doing this realtime, I understand that this is not easy to sync up, but it might be something that can interrupt the flow of the video, since you already know what is going to happen in the future. To illustrate this better, imagine a scene from a horror movie, where the describer narrates: ""Suddenly, a zombie jumps through a window and lands on a woman."" A few seconds later, you hear the sounds for this, e.g. zombie moans, the woman screaming, glass breaking, etc. This is not going to be as scary anymore, its effect is lost because of the narration.

Having said that, I am really impressed, and I do think that these described videos are one of a kind. Thank you!",,,3,0,0,

6354e7fe-0049-4571-9486-a34df0fa42af,1535563987,"There are multiple things with this that just make me yell no.

First, and perhaps the most important is the delivery. Contrary to previous replies, I do not think you are looking for, or expecting a relationship between the proposal and braille or blindness, but are rather looking for an exotic way to deliver your important message.

I believe that this must be something intimate, something personal between you and her, and having a third party just read it out for her would not be really fun. Partly because you are there, you could just tell her what you want, and partly because the third person could just pretend, especially if they know what this is about. If you really want to go with this idea, do not tell anyone, let them actually read it. I would also make sure the person is a girl, because generally in an emotional situation, the delivery can be much better. This is just a personal opinion, of course, feel free to argue.

What I suggest is actually make her work for it. A lot of people do proposals like a treasure hunt. In a way, reading braille can be a treasure hunt as well.

Have a candle or a flashlight ready, make sure they are all right with it. It greatly enhances the atmosphere, think of dinners at candlelight.

Have a printed braille alphabet on you. It can contain the characters you actually wrote (make sure they are mixed up), or the entire alphabet, it's up to you. This way, she will have to actually find the corresponding symbol and look down the other column to see what letter it refers to. It's much more entertaining and dramatic, but personal at the same time, since you are the only ones who have a light source. No third party is required.

As for my thoughts on a diagnosis, you may be on to something with Stargarts. I know it’s rare, but then again, I know two people with it. It’s genetically recessive. From the way you describe your vision and the progression of your loss, it may be stargarts. Central vision loss is the main characteristic. Light sensitivity, night blindness, headaches and nausea... these all are very common side effects of vision loss. Eye fatigue is also a thing. If you notice more headaches after straining your eyes, that’s common. 
However, the only thing that doesn’t fit is the fluctuating vision. That is more of a CVI thing, if we’re talking about waking up with different vision. If your vision gets more difficult to use throughout the day,  that’s eye fatigue. However, CVI is usually diagnosed when there is nothing physically wrong with the eye or nerves, but the vision is affected. That doesn’t mean that you can’t have two things, but that would be rare.

- It's free

- It's on every Windows PC by default. This is very important for me as I can invariably end up using anywhere between 2 and 5 different computers a day (personal laptop, personal PC and when I was working I would use a couple of different machines depending on the task). I know ZT has a USB version (it's the one I had when I was using it) but even with this it's less than convenient if you're regularly switching machine.

- Windows Magnifier is a lightweight program. I found ZT to be a bit of a resource hog. It may have improved in recent years (last version I had was 9) but Windows Magnifier sits nicely in the background and doesn't require any startup time.

- ZT 9 didn't support multiple monitors. You could only magnify your main display. Secondary displays were left unusable. Windows Mag's support for multiple monitors isn't ideal either, and maybe ZT has added support now, I don't know.

- Finally, I think the main thing I like (or at least *liked* before Microsoft made a mess of it) is that it literally has the two features I need, nothing more, nothing less. Zooming in and out and inverting colours is all I need really. It's hard to justify the price of ZT for me because I know I won't use most of the features. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure ZT's features are invaluable to some people, I'd never say ZT is bad software or anything. It's just my use case means Windows Mag is more suitable.

Anyway, as way of a wrap up. I've actually found a work around for the broken invert colours shortcut a few days ago while digging through settings. Windows has an option to overlay a filter on the screen that you can activate with a shortcut. There's an inverted colours filter. So now I can just toggle the filter on and off for inverted colours.

&amp;#x200B;

This frustration in slow advancement is compounded by artificial stoppers such as law and legislature, corruption and other factors which have caused 1 year worth of advancement in any field to quite literally take 10 years to be realized, we can understand this the most clearly when looking at the iBionic Diamond Eye, created in 2014 and likely to finally be released in 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

This is also tech built to be scalable', meaning the Bionic Eye covered by insurance may be the low resolution 240 electrode model where the higher end will have realized it's potential as a 1024 electrode device.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a brave new world where your level of perception is going to depend on your income, I recognize no person wants to hear this but that is what it means when something 'Is built to be scalable to 1024 electrodes'

&amp;#x200B;

The 240 electrodes on the iBionic is a huge huge upgrade from the 60 which were used by Argus 2.

&amp;#x200B;

We will see a similar leap forward every few years, where a company will release something that seems hugely ahead of it's time but is actually right where it should be, due to the way data-info tech fields tend to double each year.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bionic eyes in pre-clinical trials now are already outdated, it is not going to be a situation where we slowly progress to better models.

&amp;#x200B;

What's going to happen is that in 2025, Bionic eyes that are able to resolve at a much higher resolution that humanly possible are going to reach the market and immediately render the Diamond Eye outdated on arrival.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point it's going to be another 5 years until the average/fortunate person can get true acuity bionics.

&amp;#x200B;

iBionics will be able to take advantage of this 5 year grace period to establish themselves as a proper next-generation bionics company.

iBionics is the ONLY player worth mentioning in this time.

Orion 1 is a very scary prospect as it's still using the same technology Argus 2 uses (old) but with an extremely invasive procedure attached to it.

&amp;#x200B;

We really don't know why the brain is able to convert ordered sound into visually represented data and don't know a lot about the conditions behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, the Orion 1 is also kind of unknown in that it's not certain whether the components will degrade or break, what that may mean, what a blow to the head with this implant places may mean.

&amp;#x200B;

More or less electrical stimuli is applied to it, what happens is observed and then noted.

&amp;#x200B;

We are really not acting on an understanding of the brain we are actually being taught by it... If we did have a strong understanding as a species we would already have the regenerative therapy to address most eye and neurological conditions in general as they are one in the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Only one human being has an Orion, i am unsure if it's been activated.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't post about the Argus 2 because the resolution is low and it is more targeted toward the elderly, only a certain type of person gets a 240 electrode implant: a person who does not have long left and is not concerned with improving their vision beyond seeing some undefined shadows and light.

My opinion is that people on Reddit are generally young and I do not want to give people a sense of false hope in thinking these implants are viable for them, I do not want to be callous and suggest something that will leave a younger person ineligible for better hardware that is less than a decade away from them effectively stealing their future as the damage that occurs during placement may require regenerative therapy further in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

The more damaged an organ is, the harder it will be to regenerate and in the case of the Eye we want it as close to undamaged as possible, if regions of the retina have died but are relatively undamaged regenerating it with basic regenerative therapy will be possible earlier than healing something that has been deeply sliced for example.

The future is regenerative therapy and bionics undoubtedly, but that future may arrive at different times depending on the persons situation.

The Diamond Eye implant is the only thing worth linking to, Argus 2 has been put on the backburner for Orion 1 as other companies are just making better retinal implants.

&amp;#x200B;

Orion 1 is just unconscionably dangerous in my point of view, I do not think it is a very good idea to explore this option as this does facilitate the creation and spread of prions which lead to degenerative diseases later in life.

&amp;#x200B;

We do not even know that it is important for the interfaces in question to be on the retina, the brain may decode what it decodes regardless of where it is placed. We need more research to know whether this is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

We can understand a few important things about this timeline, that indeed the electrode count does roughly double every year but that this doubling does not occur every year it occurs roughly every 10.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, while Diamond Eye can be scaled to 1000 electrodes, this doesn't imply an advancement in technology it implies people with more money will get a higher resolution implant, or also that size may be maximized depending on retinal function.

&amp;#x200B;

The higher 1000 electrode tier.. may not even be covered by standard insurance.

There are not really many clinical trials happening on this front.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming the Retina is usable, it's very likely the iBionics Diamond will be the first to restore truly usable sight in people.

&amp;#x200B;

The next generation of implants after iBionics will be a very big leap forward and will be the generation that restores visuality acuity completely with the caveats that the eye be usable and the optic nerve be undamaged.

&amp;#x200B;

Where does this leave people who have experiences Trauma to the eye or optic nerve?

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone junk an eye with prototype technology?

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the eye is useless it may still be salvaged as an interface, but to do this repeatedly is a no-go for a lot of reasons it should be something that happens just ONE time.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, you're right I do have a clearly defined preference because doing it this way with an algorithm is equivalent to using a 2000-5000 electrode implant.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I suggest someone use a 240 electrode implant that will junk an eye and then make them ineligible for the massive upgrades we will see within the next 10 years as well as the complications that may come with needing regenerative procedures as we still can't make an optic nerve and if that's damaged then all retinal implants are for the people who are afflicted by this condition, for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all electrodes may connect and the surface area may change over time too, so you will ALWAYS end up with a much lower number of electrodes than the device actually has.

&amp;#x200B;

Bionics cannot advance until restorative technology does in some sense.

Would it be bias if I only linked to Argus 2 or would it just be the only thing I could talk about since it's the ONLY option in the US presently as far as retinal implants go.

&amp;#x200B;

Encoding visual data and relaying it through another sense absolutely destroys Argus 2 in every sense, it is not even a fucking competition and this is still in it's infancy, with refinement we will be able to induce HD hallucinations that perfectly correspond to the encoded image but this will take a lot longer if people aren't aware this is being done!

You're just ridiculously callous and in my point of view probably are not too encumbered by your disability yet and may even be collecting disability and have perhaps even begun to draw on the power of what most people without a seriously serious disability consider a privileged class.

​

I have no nearly no central vision and have to use algorithms to relay data which allows my brain to create an abstraction to supplement my damaged eyes.

​

That's BROKEN.

​

Edit: For people wondering how this is possible considering the eyes are moving, a tone that is generated in the center of spatial awareness having a high structural fidelity upon travel in both directions (after refraction off objects) may allow a person to derive a sense of primitive spatial awareness parameters from it's return.

​

This tone is then interpreted by a 3rd party and visual stimuli is filtered using it as a context map, producing the visual stimuli you would expect to see in vOICe as the way the patterns are relayed is consistent and this is more important than the content in regard to the tone that occurs.

​

This may further be enhanced with color-coding and the association between color and tone may be created in individuals with any degree of prior color perception in theory? Everyone is different.

​

Right now we're really exploring what we can get away with in regard to inducing hallucinations that correspond to reality, personally I am most interested in synthesizing sound from haptic feedback,

​

I would prefer to talk about things like this, not to debate morality with someone who doesn't care about or understand my work in a zero sum game.

​

Do you even understand how dangerous it is to do this kind of work?

​

It is actually disruptive to people trying to make money and as our method of rendering improves so does visual acuity.

​

Don't be naive, if I had any degree of common sense I would walk away from this work entirely and wait for retinal implants and regeneration technology to advance and keep the fact that this is possible to myself.

​

The thing is though, not every person in the world shares your opinion and not every person in the world has money and opportunity, not every person has insurance and disability.

​

These people are effectively living in hell, what about them?

​

Retinal implants and regeneration therapy are the ideal, but this is the feasible option for the majority of people in the world that are blind.

​

An upgrade in acuity for them could be as simple as an expansion of the algorithms used to render visual stimuli, and that would be as simple as a software upgrade.

​

There are blind people in 3rd world countries that do not have any kind of social benefits, they would rather be able to perceive the world around them to help their families and to live.

For people to know that the prototype for this kind of technology exists right now and not in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

If we can determine better or more improved ways to encode visual information we can increase the visual resolution that this kind of technology can deliver to people.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, the resolution is very low but still usable in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of an improvement would be to determine tonal frequencies that are inaudible but will still be perceived by the brain, and how finely the brain can discriminate between frequencies barring pattern interference by other sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Can the brain use a frequency of 200.0-200.X to relay information or is the degree of difference too fine the brain to parse?

&amp;#x200B;

If we can determine this, we can ride the finest line, and reduce this interface to something barely worn.

&amp;#x200B;

If consciously hearing it isn't required as we expect, then it should be possible to transmit data at a much greater speed, determining the transmission speed as well as whether a conscious or subconscious implementation is most beneficial is also valuable data.

I could have started art school, or an apprenticeship as a tattoo artist, something I'd wanted to do since I was a kid, but I got real, real sick.

I was getting to high fevers, no energy, horrific pain, and it didn't let up for an entire month straight. Then, the vision loss started. In early February 2013, I started getting double vision. By April of that year, I couldn't read letters the size of my head, with any level of contrast, font, or color.

The rug was ripped out from under me, my art-related dreams dying almost instantly, but yet... I still had to go on.

Due to several disabilities related to how I lost my sight, some from negligence and malpractice, I am not employable. Instead, I aim to eventually make my income through writing, making my art in words instead of ink or pixels.

I'll be the first to tell you that the loss fucking sucks. No sugar coating, no bullshit. It's the short end of the stick, especially since you know and will remember what that loss feels like.

It's normal to grieve every step as you lose more vision, so try not to beat yourself up over that. If your therapist is someone you're comfortable with, discuss the feelings it evokes.

All in all, though, just remember that technology is shooting forward at a rapid pace. Five years ago, Braille displays were unreachable for most blind people without their state purchasing them. Now, for $500, you can have one that's on par with the more expensive models.

For example, the ""post new thread"" button is labeled as ""edit 20"" and there's ""overflow"" instead of ""more"" or something similar. It's not a huge deal, but it's less intuitive.

With the ""add comment"" button, I can only seem to get it perfectly at the bottom of a thread. Sometimes, I can get it if I three finger scroll up and up until the bottom of the OP is there, but not always.

As I'm typing, I remember more, so here's a few others.

- The button to open the main menu doesn't exist with a screen reader. It's not even just a blank button. I have to turn off Voiceover to get it open.

- The night theme refuses to stay on, but it'll stay on if it's night time. If I turn on dark mode, swap to another app, even if it's only for a second, it swaps back to black on white not white on black

- Posts with links only, like in /r/NotTheOnion, tend to be a PitA to open the article with a screen reader

- For some reason, bulletted lists, even with the two enters between them, merge into one line

- Also tapping a post, even if it has only one link, seems to only open the link if it's the first thing in the post. It'd be nice if there was a way to open links properly, especially for subs like /r/JustNoMIL where there's a comment with a ton of links to older posts. I have to hit share, copy link, paste it into safari, then go from there, and then head back into the app, my much preferred app, unless I want to hit ""view in app"" on every post.

- Also is three finger swipe right supposed to swap threads? It seems to trigger on 4 fingers as well, so when I'm sending posts from, say, an /r/askreddit thread, sometimes I come back to the app and I'm in a completely different thread, in a different sub.

- Also, being able to share images from the app would be nice. If I could just tap, hold, hit share, and share images into my OCR of choice, that'd make things much easier.

- Also pls to have an unread tag on notifications. I hate when I have 20 notifications, scroll through tapping them, and can't find the last one so I end up just reopening all the notifs and still can't find it, then just hit mark everything as read.",,,4,0,0,

e55f3cfe-aa08-42e1-9441-8fb6d1fe174e,1534470728,I totally understand what you’re saying. My experience is that people are generally patient while someone uses accessibility software to mitigate the vision loss. But I also know it can be hard to accept (or ask for) that patience. Another issue I bet you have is that people don’t understand low vision. They can relate to total blindness because they can close their eyes but don’t naturally understand why you can’t “just get glasses”  and see fine.  Sounds like you’re successful! Cheers to that!! And don’t hesitate to reach out to me or other rehab professionals to continue to maintain your independence. I’m a firm believer there’s always a way to get the job done regardless of function vision. ,,,2,0,0,
e55f3cfe-aa08-42e1-9441-8fb6d1fe174e,1534421516,"The answer to all your questions is yes! There’s SO much out there for your stepmom to mitigate the deficits from her vision loss. 

I’d check out [AFB’s directory of services](http://www.afb.org/directory.aspx?action=browse) and see if she’s interested in engaging services in the blindness community. 

There are 4 types of certified therapists for adults with vision loss. Low Vision Therapist (help maximize use of functional vision), Vision Rehab Therapists (teach daily living skills), Orientation and Mobility Specialists (teach using long mobility cane and how to move safely and independently in familiar and unfamiliar environments), and Assistive Technology Instructional Specialists. 

There are several sites that sell “stuff” for vision impairment. LS&amp;S, Independent Living Aids, Maxi-Aids, American printing house, blind mice mart. If there’s something specific you’re looking for I can suggest a site or products. 

This is what I do for a living and love it. Feel free to pm me of you need more specific guidance or have questions.

None of this stuff comes overnight, and you will face some challenges that are unique to you among your group of friends and family, but blindness is not a death sentence.
Now for some practical advice.
1: exercise. If you feel like you've lost confidence in your body or your ability to move, exercise can make this better. not only does it release feel good chemicals into your brain, it can give you a lot of confidence in your body and in your ability to physically affect the world around you.
2: learn braille! Audiobooks are great, but its really important to be able to read. Even if you only use it for signs on doors and the menu at cracker barrel, learn braille.
3: don't ever not do a thing because you're blind: DO chores, learn to cook if you can't already, and do all you can to be self-sufficient.
4: Even if its not in your nature right now, learn to say no. While its important to be able to ask for help, also know how to refuse it. You know your own abilities better than anyone else, and its ok to make that clear. If you need help, that is totally ok, but letting people know you don't want to be touched, guided, coddled, or overhelped is more than ok, its mandatory.
You are gonna do fine and you have a lot of good things ahead of you.

He had to have a breathing tube put in and the main focus was to get him stabilized. At this point the doctors didnt give a shit about his toe and his infection progressed. Once he was stable they decided to amputate half his foot (all his toes) but the infection was to far up and they amputated to below the knee. Now while all of this is going on(2 months total) he was supposed to be getting his functioning eye(1 eye was already a goner) cleaned by a specialist every other week to prevent his vision from getting worse but no matter how much we tried noone listened and it took a back seat. When he was released from the hospital they sent him to a rehab place for a week and then he was home. At the rehab center he was pumped with painkillers and he doesnt even remember that week he spent there or most of his hospital stay for that matter. This year he had to begin dyalisis for his kidneys which turned out to be a blessing in disguise because now he HAS to get out of the house 3 times a week for hours at a time and he is starting to make friends at the dyalisis center and it seems like he looks forward to it even though he feels like shit after.

I think it would also be unrealistic to expect blind people to learn two tactile reading modalities. If a person learns one, it will likely be braille. Morse code is no longer widely known; braille is standardized as the accessible tactile text in education and public signage. Braille is also much faster to read, with readers sweeping across words almost holistically, much like sighted people's visual systems parse text into whole words. Morse code is a strictly serial temporal code. The result is, as you said, Morse reading speeds of [~25-40 wpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code); that is an order of magnitude slower than common braille reading speeds, [sometimes &gt;200 wpm](https://nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/bm/bm99/bm990604.htm).

If you mean purely tactile Morse feedback without a braille display or any audio, yes, currently it's just a vibrotactile ""bump"" when the finger encounters a target area. The question is what extra utility this would offer, given the reasons u/AllHarlowsEve mentioned in this thread that a combo of braille display and/or VoiceOver is richer, faster, and as externally quiet as you need it to be. If you could code up an extension to that OS behavior where each ""bump"" becomes a morse code character string, it might interest some users. Conceivably deaf-blind users could find utility in something like a [fancier version of this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wbouvy.vibrationcontrol&amp;hl=en_US), since VoiceOver is unavailable to people who can't her it. You would still have to make the case that the impoverished information stream is worth encoding in the tactile feedback. And because accessible design has a way of ultimately benefiting everyone, busy sighted phone users might like having more granular control over tactile feedback.

Apologies if this is wrong, but it sounds like you haven't had a chance to spend a lot of time with a skilled blind person operating a smartphone. Try to do so! As a sighted person working in this field I initially thought that smartphones, lacking tactile keyboard surfaces, would be terrible for accessibility. From watching their adoption, I saw that my assumption was wrong as hell. The iOS and Android mobile ecosystems have hugely improved blind people's access to the firehose of online information, and it's been remarkable to see just how smartphones, earbuds, and/or braille displays go hand in hand. So, try to observe firsthand, including by playing with your own phone's accessibility features, and really suss out (1) what morse feedback adds to the current suite of OS tools, and (2) whether that added value is something the community actually wants.",,,4,0,0,

Watch that entire video. You can also do a web search for ""how to use TalkBack Android"" or ""TalkBack android gestures"" or ""Android TalkBack tutorial"".

You get the idea. There's a ton of information out there. There's a green ""highlight"" rectangle that moves around from ""clickable"" stuff and then the voice reads what the green rectangle is on. You double tap to ""press"" &amp; double tap and hold for a ""long press"". It works pretty much in an identical manner to VoiceOver on iOS.

You could argue in the past that iOS had much better low vision / blind support than Android, but I don't think that argument holds all that well in 2018. iOS is certainly a good choice as well.

Hope that helps!

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1534441755,"I think the single biggest thing that slows me down with Flick Type is spelling. I am not a great speller, and I often have trouble typing a word closely enough to get the keyboard to predict it. I think this is just part and parcel with the method flick type keyboard uses and I don't really blame the keyboard; someone with better spelling than myself would not have this issue. I just got pretty tired pretty quickly of trying to spell a word multiple times and then flicking through options hoping I would have finally given the keyboard something it could figure out; especially when the iOS braille keyboard has a very good corection system that almost always figures out my words. Again, I think this just comes down to the two different methods these keyboards use and I don't blame Flick. 

There are other things that slow me down, short words that the keyboard offten predicts wrong causing me to have to flick through options, passwords and other unique words that the keyboard would not know and I don't want to add to its dictionary, braille contractions that make typing in braille even quicker etc. I think flick type keyboard is good at what it does, and I very well might use it if I did not know how to type in braille.",,,1,0,0,

a31ded7a-b91d-4c92-85f6-b6c56d69a09e,1534872224,"So, this is something I have put a lot of thought into and had to deal with a lot back in the day. I went to a university in the deep south, and I was weekly approached on the streets by students who wanted to pray over me and heal me; no joke, I once had two separate students approach me during one 15-minute walk.

Before I get into my thoughts I just want to say that, for the most part, I am not talking about people who forcibly grab you. It is probably going to be best to just politely say no to such people and keep moving. Most of the faith healers who have approached me have been polite and have not touched me without asking. Also, what I’m about to suggest might not be an option for you, depending on your own religious background and what you’re comfortable with.

Now with all of that out of the way, here are my thoughts. For the longest time I responded with hostility and dismissiveness whenever people wanted to pray over me and “heal” my blindness. I do not believe in “faith healing” and I personally find the whole concept insulting and ableist. However, after one particularly nasty interaction I had with a well-meaning student, in which I know I hurt their feelings, I began to question my approach.

For one thing, I realized I was doing nothing to help explain to the faith healer how I felt about what they were trying to do. I don’t personally have an issue with someone praying for my general well-being, or for something other than blindness. For example, if I was working with a classmate on a group project and I complained about being overwhelmed with course work, I would not have a problem with that classmate saying they would say a prayer for me. When I stopped by the coffee house and chatted with the barista, complaining that I had a cold, I was fine if they said a quick prayer for my cold. Do I think these prayers do anything? I don’t know and that is beside the point. For me, the point is I personally have no moral objection to these kinds of prayers and in social situations I consider it a kind gesture when a Buddhist/Muslim/Christian/Hindu prays for me in an appropriate way; yes, I have received prayers from members of all of these faith groups, and for me it is pretty equivalent to when someone says they will be thinking about me. Of course, these kinds of exchanges normally happened with people I know, not total strangers on the street, but for me, it’s definitely the blindness healing aspect of the prayer that really bothers me. If a friend asked to pray about my blindness I would be hurt, but I would try to explain to them why.

So, I decided to try and make this delineation for faith healers I met on the street. I soon got my chance as I was rushing to a final exam that I was not feeling great about. A student came up behind me and started asking if he could say a prayer over me. I kept walking, annoyed for a moment, about the request and also that I was in a hurry, but then I remembered the new tact I wanted to try. So, without slowing down I began to ask him what specifically he wanted to pray about. He said he wanted to pray for me to be healed. I told him that I did not want him to pray about that, but I went on to explain that I was on my way to a test, that I was not feeling good about the test, and that if he wanted to pray about something that would help me I would appreciate his prayers for that. He started chuckling as he tried to keep up with me, at first taken aback, I think, but he said ok. So, when we got to a red light he said a quick prayer for me. When he was done I asked him what issue he had at the moment. He said something, I believe it was also school related, so I quickly said a prayer for him and his issue, and then I went on my way.

This experience was so much more positive then any I had previously had with faith healer types. I thought there was a small chance that the nuances of my issues and feelings about the topic may have come across better than when I had simply told people no. What is more, the interaction felt much more equitable then previous exchanges. When someone wants to “heal” you it implies that you’re the one with the issue and they are the one with the solution. As we were standing waiting for that red light we were both students, equals, worried about our course work, and we were both offering each other comfort.

I went on to use this approach for everyone who wanted to pray over me while I was at the university. I probably had the opportunity to do this at least six more times and every time the interaction went as well as the first one. Of course, this is just my own personal evolution on the topic. I don’t expect that everyone will be comfortable with this approach, especially praying for other people yourself. Maybe aspects of my experience will be helpful to others, maybe not. Whatever you decide to do I do firmly believe it is important for each of us to explore our reactions to things, and to consider when those reactions might not be appropriate. Above all, our default should always be politeness, weather or not our eye balls work.",,,1,0,0,
