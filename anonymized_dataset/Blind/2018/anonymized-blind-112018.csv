Take your time to grieve. You weren't naive! Losing your sight is fucking scary, sad, lonely and hard! 
Tell your loved ones that you appreciate them trying to make you happy but tell them what would help you. They don't know how to react if you don't tell them. Maybe you want to  scream and cry while someone is by your side. Maybe you want to eat a pound of ice cream. 
Maybe you just want someone to listen to you while talking about how unfair life is.
I would also highly recommend for you to look for other people in your area who have made the same experience. Nobody understands you really besides them. Also for me it was the best thing to see how their lives still go on and how they were so strong.
I don't know how this is organized where you live, but in my country we have private lessons for people going blind like cooking or walking with a cane. I am sure there will be some kind of organization that can help you.

2b85d824-0031-4755-9824-ea2ca723bb19,1541940500,"I cannot explain what they are, but I can explain how color adds context to what we see.

If you imagine an orchestra, there are many different instruments all playing together to make a song. Each instrument makes its own noise, and together they create a beautiful symphony of sound if played together correctly.

On their own, each instrument makes its own unique sound, like a violin or a trumpet. Some are more beautiful than others, when played alone. For example a violin can be beautiful on its own, but a tuba doesn't have much beauty to it without the rest of the band.

Colors are like the different instruments, you can see them just like you can hear the instruments, but the point of the colors is to add beauty and context to the world that we see. Each color by itself looks unique, but there are 3 primary colors, that you can mix together to get all the beautiful colors of the world. If we apply the primary colors to the instruments, you get the different families of instruments, so Red is Percussion (drums), Blue is Strings (violin, chello), and Green is Brass/Woodwinds (trumpet, flute). When you mix these instruments in various ways, you get various sounds and unique songs. This is how the different colors are made. You mix together the three different primary colors to get beautiful new colors, sort of like making a song.

Purple is a beautiful color, it simply looks pleasant. It is also rare in nature. That is why royalty throughout history have used purple, because it was not seen very often. On the contrary, green and blue are everywhere. All living plants are green, and the sky and water are blue. Red and the various shades of red (orange, yellow) are in fire, and blood, and some nature like apples.

You probably know about the color black, which is the absence of any color, so it's what blind people ""see"", basically no light at all. This would be like complete silence. Then if you imagine pure white, this is like the loudest jet engine you can think of right next to your ears, drowning out all other colors. It's absolute pure white, like pure noise. Where you land in the middle, between extremely loud and extremely soft, would be the varying color temperatures (darkness, lightness) and that adds depth and complexity to the world, because now you have a range of colors that you can make, but then you have varying shades, or levels, of those colors based on how much black or white is added. There are *about* 3 million distinguishable colors total, but the human eye cannot detect all these differences in color, so we only have names for a few hundred. Of course we can *see* the difference between a named color and a slightly close variation of that color, but naming all the variations would be impossible. This is analogous to C#, F#... humanity has settled on grouping sounds into scales so music can be written, just as humanity has settled on grouping colors into names so they can be written. Different cultures have affinity to different colors, for example the Chinese have more names for different shades of blue than we have in English, and therefore Chinese are better are differentiating blue variations in blue colors, simply because there are names for them.

The analogy of color temperature to music would be like using the music scales, A, B, C, D, E, sharp, and flat. Those varying tones allow the instruments to be played in a way that creates soothing sounds, because as you know music would be boring if it was all in the same pitch. By varying the colors and mixing them differently, you are creating a quartet of beauty, and that is what art is. Art is taking all the possible colors and shades of this world and mixing them together in a way that creates pleasing visuals for your eyes, just like taking various instruments and making a pleasing orchestral piece can do to your ears.

Hope that helps.",,,14,0,0,

It is also very isolating since you are unlikely to know anyone going through the same thing. Those feelings are valid and understandable, but, as you are doing right now, you must move forward so your child can thrive. Realize the main issue with blindness is mainly ignorant sighted people who can’t comprehend life without vision. 

I’m going to give you a bunch of resources but don’t want to overwhelm you either. Feel free to reach out to me anytime with any questions. 

First thing to do is reach out to your local school district. If you are in the US, your child is entitled to receive services now. (I’m sure other countries have the equivalent but I can only speak to US law). A teacher for the visually impaired will work with your child and your family. 

[Hadley School for the Blind](https://www.hadley.edu/showCourseListing.asp?program=FE)  has online courses you can take that are completely free. For example the Braille and Your Baby class helps you to understand the adaptations you need to make so that your child can have the same incidental learning that sighted children have. 

[The National Organization of Parents of Blind Children](https://nfb.org/nopbc-brochure) is a part of the National Federation of the Blind and has information and resources.

I'm a second year there now, and after I was admitted they basically let me have all sorts of accommodations that I'd been told colleges don't offer. Extra time on tests, alternate locations for testing, getting slides sent to me right before class, and even a lower minimum unit count, so I could take 10.5 units instead of the normal 13 and still be considered a full time student &amp; get financial aid, since with my visual impairment I've found it exceedingly difficult to take more than 12 units at a time. You don't even need to use all of the accommodations at once, and you can add or drop them as needed. The one downside I've had is that they sometimes don't have enough iPads during testing times (especially finals) but if you don't need that kind of accommodation than it should be fine, and they offer large print tests in whatever size font you need when that's the case as well. 

The only other really good school I know of is Cal Poly San Louis Obispo. When I was applying to schools I emailed them asking what kind of accommodations they offered, and they got back to me pretty fast! They had all sorts of stuff with adaptive technology. I think Davis does as well, but I don't use it cause all I need is my 12.9' iPad Pro. 

All of the California State Universities have fairly decent disability services as well, but they aren't as good or as Davis or Cal Poly as far as I know, and it really depends on what campus you're looking at.

Quite frankly, I am not happy with the accessibility of most writer-oriented sites, either, and there is definitely something in letting people discover your work, rather than sharing links via social networks and relying on people spreading the word.

Bridging would make sense in this case, since Quiller could become a writing hub that people could use to share articles to other platforms.

9bc4d41b-e0b7-424b-ba83-c470a076617e,1543343661,"I agree.  I think tech is easily a field which could be accessible if we all just tried a little harder. I hear what you are saying about certain teachers as well.  Some people have a difficult time stepping out of their own shoes and into someone else's.  
I think the answer lies in universal design.  These small companies for vision needs have high costs because they have huge overhead and low income compared to the cost to develop.  In our ever changing world of tech, these little guys can't keep up.  Take the iPhone for example,  it works so well out of the box because at some point in time Apple took a good hard look at accessibility.  They have the funding to throw into it and the market to support the development.  I think the best apps or devices are going to be things that work for more than just people with visual impairments.  
I've recently started playing with a wearable keyboard called a TAP. It was made for virtual reality,  but it also functions well with Voiceover and allows someone to type without seeing, one handed,  with a device you can wear all day.  I think it has potential because it's not just for one population. 
On an unrelated note, I would love to see short and practical videos about how you use the technology you use every day.  Programs like JAWS can be very overwhelming for someone to learn at first.  Some people might feel like Voiceover or Zoom aren't always needed. So how do you use for technology in practical real world situations? Do you turn things off and on a lot? Knowing what works for you in the small details helps me teach the best person who comes along that might be like you.  ",,,1,0,0,

I'm turning 29 in a few months and maybe it's because I'm approaching that 30 year marker that I've been thinking back on my life and evaluating my decisions thus far. But something that really struck me lately is that I've spent a lot of time and energy building up safety zones for myself. It's a lot of little things like my wife always doing checkout at a store because I can't really read the credit card machine screens. Or,  having people that are pretty much always available to give me a ride.  Or, just surrounding myself with friends and family that don't ask questions about my vision.

Now don't get me wrong I am incredibly thankful and sincerely value the support system I have around me.

There will days where you feel absolutely defeated already before you get out of bed. We all have those. But, keep pushing on.

ab93f241-d821-4d43-b54e-bf0e5b690ab6,1542905513,"If you're sighted, throw on a blindfold and reorient yourself to media.   Even a painting has aspects that a blind person can appreciate.  Brush strokes, paint texture, depth of media and how it all interacts can be just as informative as the mere colors on the canvas, for example.   Ink and paper can be an entire genre for someone interested in creating a texrure message. 

Other examples

Ceramics.   My mother and I both enjoye/d this media.  She'd build containers and texturize surfaces or make appliqués for them.   She experimented with using other everyday items to  texturize her work.  It became a Thing for people to try and identify what item she used for the effect.  Sighted folks were especially engaged.   She'd get an idea and draft me to make templates for bases or texturing tools.   Her ability to describe her wish was an artform itself. 

Woodwork  We did woodworking at sumner camp.   Sighted facilitators did the sawing and we did the rest.    Woodcarving, though, is a whole genre that a blind person can run wild with.   My hands aren't strong enough to use those tools but I have ideas...   

Mosaics   This isn't just tile, btw.  This is anything you can glue down.   I've used strung beads, tile, broken glass, plastic cut outs, instamorph shapes, whatever. (but let's please stay away from food on construction paper.  This is a serious artform.   Artists deserve to have their media be something as viable and respectful as any other artist.)    Paper or two dimensional media are a genre in themselves but we can leave it here in mosaics for a start. 

Textiles. Knitting is a thing and something blind people can definitely do.  Mom was expert at it.  I crochet but have never mastered knitting.   Don't scoff at knitting until you've examined a fisherman knit afghan.   That is artwork.  My mom made many of those.    But textiles is a world outside of yarn craft.  Weaving and making the media one wishes to weave are an amazing genre.    It's fascinating and implicitly a blind person's adventure.   Sighted folks might say that color is everything but they spend as much time on the feel of a yarn or overall texture of the product.   Why not us? 

Art is designed to interact with mostly sight or sound.   If we value only one mode of interaction over the rest, we've missed so much.  If we shift value to only touch because we perceive that as the only way a blind person can interact, we continue to miss the point.   Consider ways to encompass a minimum of two senses in an art piece.  Try to include a third.  Floor art, for example, can be painted, textured and designed for sound interaction as well.

I have an iPhone X which is great because it has the same screen size as + line of iPhones but it has the form factor of a regular iPhone. I love the quick access accessibility menue that lets you toggle on and off filters and section zooming and all that great stuff without having to go into settings to tweak.

You can pivot the position of the surface studio within certain constraints to maximize visibility. The screen is bright and vibrant and massive. I have used UI scaling so that the text and buttons within the programs I use get automatically scaled up.

Relatedly, this is why for some blind people at least one eye appears smaller than it should. My right eye is teeny tiny in comparison to my left. If they could repair the damage to my left eye I'd probably gain some useable vision. There'd be nothing they could do for my right.",,,2,0,0,

In a nut shell it causes men (and some women, but very few in reality) to lose most of their night vision at first, then slowly losing their peripheral, followed by most of their central, until they go completely blind. 

These types of questions coming from people that are not ""blind"" make sense until you start thinking about blind spots, because every human on earth has at least one blind spot. In my case, my eyes have multiple blind spots that grow in size.  Blind spots do not tell our brain to put a black splotch in our field of view because that would be incredibly annoying. Instead what happens is our brain essentially stretches the image across any physical blind spots to trick the eyes into thinking they are still seeing a full image, hence the name blind spot. Healthy human eyes have about 114 degrees of central vision (Google an ""obtuse"" triangle.), with about 40 degrees remaining for the outer ring of our eyes called the peripheral vision. My eyes have less then 9 degrees of central vision (Google an icosceles triangle with one angle that has 9 degrees.) This results in what's called tunnel vision, with maybe a single degree remaining for the peripheral vision.

How the haptic feedback thing, though?

Having a video camera on your head, or wherever. It would be connected to a vast array of little nubs stretched out over a patch of skin on your body somewhere. These would create a bit of pressure depending on the luminosity of each pixel - i.e. turn a normal image into black and wide, and just beam that directly onto your forehead.

I also think that it would be very possible to train an AI to know 'relevant' information. Similar to how they are training self-driving cars. When you go out, it might look for specific things like, if you're walking out onto a road, it will let you know. If there's a loose dog, it may tell you. It may know to tell you to contact someone who can help you, and live-stream what you are seeing to them during an emergency so that they can assist you/ tell you what you need to do.

Same thing for people on bikes. Maybe an old lady suddenly falls over nearby. 

Now that I think about it, I wonder if there's a business out there that provides a service like that - it would be costly, for sure. It would require one person to man a desk for up to 8 hours a day, and they'd have to be attentive. Get breaks. That's looking at least $150-$200 a day, plus another $100-$200 a month for data charges for constant internet service. 

Maybe you can pay for a few hours at a time, say, when you've no choice but to go out alone on a busy day. I could see that costing maybe $20-50, but it could be covered with insurance sometime, on-demand using a cellphone, stuff like that...

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/device-lets-blind-see-with-tongues/

Some people were good enough to identify a set of pre-defined objects (banana, cup) and to identify a set of signs. However, one important thing was the people were looking at a set number of items (four items) against a high contrast background, with no interference (a white mug or a plastic yellow banana against a black background). In real world situations, there was too much interference from the background to make it useable. Also, because there was only limited number of items to chose from, it didn't work well if you had to look at an item that wasn't one of those items. 

It is possible things have improved greatly, though. The design of the device now looks a lot sleeker, and it's been in development for many years since my wife worked on the project.

I think your best course of action next time you see your neighbor is to roll down the window and ask her what she would like you to do,  but I noticed a couple of misconceptions in your narrative that may give you a very different reaction if they aren't corrected.  
Here is some info that might help you make a friend out of this situation. 
1. I can promise you the guide dog is not reading what you are doing as a car and making choices unless you are about to hit your neighbor. Your neighbor went through a lot of training to learn how to get around town without her dog,  then even through even more training with her dog so that she and her dog could work as a team.  She gives the directions. Her dog walks in a straight line until told to turn,  and avoids obstacles.  He doesn't watch when is the correct time to cross the street or wait for people to wave him on.  Your neighbor makes all those decisions.  The only part the dog is in charge of when crossing the street is waiting for the forward command and disobeying if there is a car in the way.  What you see as the dog trying to make a decision is probably the dog doing exactly what it has been trained to do,  which is stop for the car and wait for the next direction from his handler. 
2. Sometimes people with visual impairments travel more slowly or take time to listen.  Your neighbor might look like she is waiting to cross the road,  but really she might just be waiting or listening with no intention of crossing. Keep in mind if she is clearly trying to cross the street,  that she might not be able to see you wave her on.  She knows how to keep herself safe. Your car idling could be telling her it's not safe to cross.
3. Your neighbor no doubt has opinions regarding how she would like to be treated.  The internet can give you their opinion.  Mine is not to stop for her unless she is in the cross walk and actually crossing,  but what your neighbor wants is what she should get.  ",,,8,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1541253683,"&gt; moment this is out of scope for Quiller, as the site is not designed to be a bridge.

The problem you're going to have is that sighted folks already have websites that do exactly what Quiller does.  It's just that none of them are accessible to us.  So I suspect sighted people won't move to Quiller, leaving it as an exclusively blindness oriented website.  I guess that's fine if those are your goals, but it's not something that interests me. I spend all my time on Reddit for exactly that reason; I'd rather be on a mainstream website whenever possible.  

&gt; I am not sure where it is at the moment, but I know that there are command/line scripts to publish directly to Medium from Markdown. I could look them up if you are interested.

There sort of are.  But they don't support a bunch of features last I checked, and are really awkward to use for anything but the extreme basics.  

&gt; volunteers who are willing to categorize existing, possibly public domain images. 

I wonder if you could work with someone like the internet archive on a project like this? They already collect a lot of metadata about the images they host.  Also, machine learning (like Microsoft's tools) could help a lot.  Then you'd just need to crowdsource sighted help to go from metadata and machine generated tags to real descriptions.  Or at least check that the machine generated tags are accurate; if I'm writing an article about, say, Christmas, an image tagged ""christmas tree, children, gifts"" is probably just something I could go ahead and use.  

However, this only really becomes interesting if you're bridging Quiller articles to other websites.  If Quiller is a website only popular in the blindness community, photos don't matter.  ",,,1,0,0,

The #1 key we learned was spacial organization and tactic navigation. We used muffin tins to separate parts like nuts, screws, washers, etc. to assemble the robots, then used the tins again for electronic components. To navigate around the breadboard we used tooth picks or bamboo skewers to feel each hole of the breadboard.

(If you're not familiar with a breadboard, it connects electronic components but it's a massive grid made up of holes smaller than a headphone plug. Rows connect components together, but each row is electrically isolated from all the others. When we tried assembling with black-out goggles on, it was difficult to figure out. Our VI friends suggested wooden skewers/toothpicks - it worked like a charm.

The programming was great since the software we used played well with the screen readers. And you're right, blind/VI are great programmers because you're used to modeling concepts in the abstract. Sighted programmers have to sometimes close our eyes to block out the added stimulus so we can concentrate on the logic.

It allows people to experiance the aspects of life they are missing in the best way that they can. I mean sure it may not be the same if you suddenly went blind and can't look at that pretty picture but I'm sure you would still like on occasion to know what the content of the painting is. 

Plus not eveyone is totally unable to see. Someone may need that description to tell them that the squiggle they are looking at is actually a moth, then they will realise and be able to see it. Others may need to have a specification on if it's just a misty setting or if someone steamed up their glasses (as an unrealistic example). 

Really it's exactly like subtitles on movies or shows. It's something that people who don't even need to use it can get value from and that in itself is reason enough. 

I can see but sometimes I miss things. Maybe I didn't notice that amazingly detailed bee in the lower corner because I was looking at the sunset. A description of the painting would draw my attention to it so I didn't miss it.

d0746cea-e74f-4cb6-bf10-abe83df8f974,1543442591,"Thanks for making the game accessible to sighted folks! It's important to include everyone, even those of us living with a visual dependency.

You mentioned the time frame of the game as being ancient. So realistic prostheses and a literal white cane would not work, but it would be fair to include some visual indications, and maybe the choice you make could be tangentially worked into the character's backstory with one simple sentence or reference in the intro or some dialogue. Clouded irises would indicate some particular family of etiologies -- cataracts, scarring from injury, etc. For someone with anophthalmia, where the eyes never developed, you could render the eye orbits as concave with eyelids closed. And it seems reasonable to equip the character with a walking stick or branch for walking around. I guess my take is that you can make it clear that the design choice was thoughtful rather than lazy, without too much effort.

Tangetially: If it's an animated figure, you can consider if it would be reasonable to make something like a ""resting animation"" (if that's the term) where they might incline their head to a side or sway their body a little bit. That can be tricky because you don't want to embody a stereotype, but I think a faithful rendering of postural differences could be a nice departure from the usual representation, which is ""blind person"" = ""sighted person minus eyes and plus cane, and that's it."" For many blind folks it's not just a mannerism, but a way of gathering kinesthetic and auditory information about their environment that isn't available visually.

Additionally: If it's within the bounds of your game engine and design, you could equip the character with stones or something else that produces sound (or the ability to vocalize clicks) for navigation, like present-day echolocation practitioners do.

Is your vision correctable with glasses? Have you gotten an updated prescription lately?

I am a high myope, which means I'm very nearsighted (-11.5 and -13.25 for my right and left eyes) but my vision is fully correctable with glasses. During the normal worsening of my vision until my prescription stabilized a year or so ago, it was normal for me to need a new glasses prescription every year because everything was just too blurry even with my glasses on.

It's normal for correctable vision to get worse until your mid to late twenties, and then later (usually in the 40s but can be earlier) for it to get worse again and people to need reading glasses (or bifocals/progressive lenses).

Also if you're worried about your vision, be sure to see an eye doctor - this may be a translation issue but in America opticians can only give glasses prescriptions and can't diagnose medical conditions of the eye, whereas Optometrists and Opthamologists can - be sure to check if there's something similar in your country and if so that you are seeing the correct doctor.  I also would be sure to see an eye doctor and not a general care doctor, since general care doctors don't usually have much training on eye conditions.",,,1,0,0,

The main way that I teach street crossings is on the absence of threatening traffic. This assumes that cars will maintain speed around the speed limit. By slowing down or stopping, you inadvertently lengthen the amount of time your neighbor has to wait to cross. 

If this is at an intersection with stop sign or stop light control, then I teach the person to go when parallel traffic starts to go. This lessens the risk of being hit when you begin to cross the street. 

So, if your neighbor is standing there waiting, she is likely listening for the flow of traffic and trying to determine when it is ok to go. ",,,1,0,0,

That's true I don't really have much time as this project is only about a month 1/2 long not a long time to do all the research, prep and final designs.

I chose the blind audience as it's either underrepresented or misrepresented in some ways, I also feel that blind people to be specific don't get equal opportunities and get discriminated a lot of times.

For me I can see what I can see - there’s no grey bits. The best way I can describe it is when a camera zooms in. The range gets smaller (the area viewed) but it still fills the screen. That’s ehT my brain does. To me I still have a full screen but actually what I see if a lot fewer than others can see. They get the pulled back 180 degrees image and I get the zoomed in image.

I guess what your asking is what totally blind people can see. The thing is it’s not like that. If your optic nerves don’t pass info to your brain, for example, then it’s not like there’s even blackness. The way you exist is different. The brain will still fill itself and give a rich understanding of your environment. How it does that will vary hugely.
Another thing to consider as a sighted person. When you close your eyes and think of the Eiffel Tower for example, or a memory from the past, some people will see a mental image. But other people don’t see a mental image. They see words.

Your perspective and determination are great to see. Blind people all over the world do great things, and I have never met someone for whom it's life-limiting to any great degree.

I had to tell him that basically all smartphones have a good amount of features such as voice over and tactile feedback and explain to him and his brother how to accsess the features and they were so happy. 

Ever since then I talk about those features to all of my coworkers and a lot of them are very ignorant and scoff or dont care but its honestly way harder from what I've seen for a visually impaired person to use a flip phone than a smartphone.

You need to find your closest blind education center. There will be several things that she needs to learn there.  Places like the Braille Institute. Many towns have smaller places connected to Departments of Rehabilitation. 

When I started to lose my vision, for the first year and a half  as it gradually progressed... I was suicidal. I had a bottle of oxy waiting for the day that I could not read a book any more. That was the day I was going to do it. 

I went to a blindness support place and my perception totally changed. 

I learned braille, how to use the technology, I can get around with a cane and I have a full time job.  I can even joke about it now. I learned life skills and put the combination of that together to volunteer to teach a safe and healthy cooking class. I can navigate anywhere on the bus, use a smart phone for orienteering. It took a while, but I met some of the trainers that were profoundly blind and they were inspirational to me. 

I asked one of my trainers about getting a cane when I started walking into posts. I was afraid that it would make me a target, like a perpetual victim. He told me, ""my cane is a weapon."" I swallowed the weirdness and learned to use it.

I am older and it was a huge adjustment for me to make. But my kids are grown and there is no one around to help out much. I have to survive. Everyone goes on and on about my being so brave, but to hell with that. I do what I have to do.  

There are a LOT of older people losing their vision now, mostly to diabetic retinopathy. This isolation thing is very common among them, I met some of them in the weekly group they had at the center where we discussed what we were going through. 

She can't discuss it with her kids and I get that. You don't want your kids to see you as weak or a burden. It's a pride thing and nothing you do or say is going to change that.

I was diagnosed with RP when I was 11, and didn't get help with the mental/emotional aspect of it until I was well into my twenties. Don't get me wrong, learning life skills and adjusting to a functional and happy life without eyesight is a great plan, but the teachers there are more likely to be equipped to help deal with the practical side, not the emotional side. I know there's a stigma against therapy in general, but if your mother had lost a limb after an accident or become unable to walk after a major surgery, a lot of doctors would recommend therapy to help with the adjusting process. I'm of the opinion that losing your sight is no different, and even just a few visits can be a big help.

It's clear your mom thinks her disability is something to be ashamed of, and I can't stress enough how much therapy has helped me accept the differences my sight makes in my life and help give me the courage to say that having a disability isn't anything to be ashamed of.

That has now been refined into the BrainPort, an FDA-approved device linking a webcam to a little patch of [actuators for the tongue](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/15/seeing-with-your-tongue).
&gt; has this been done before? If not, What are the drawbacks, and what's stopping it from becoming the norm?

People don't want to walk around with a thing in their mouth, and the resolution is very poor if you're comparing it to typical vision. There is no color and no depth information. Also, a few devices do fairly well at their narrow task, but cost is often prohibitive and the devices aren't always covered by insurance. As another commenter said, there is also a family of auditory assistive aids that translates a visual scene to some form of auditory soundscape.

&gt; something like one of those machine learning devices that reads off objects that it sees, describing what they are seeing to the user?

Your general idea is sound; machine learning is, I think, poised to make a really big impact in assistive tech. But accuracy and interface are nontrivial challenges. Consider a typical scene. It contains hundreds of objects. Would it be useful to have a device rattling off, continuously, a list of everything it sees? And the best AIs do...*okay* at identifying objects. Not spectacular. If you identified every 10th object in the wild incorrectly, it wouldn't take long before an error is serious. But incrementally, there are vision-based devices that identify products and read signage using AI. One example, [OrCAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__qk7RX74r4). And generally, accessibility features on smartphones, like iOS' VoiceOver and Android's TalkBack, have been game changers in opening up all the information that apps give to any smartphone user, rather than requiring separate dedicated devices.

&gt;What if it was a series of braille symbols that just had the 10 most important objects in vision, where you could request if objects are visible by asking it, through speech?

What are those 10 most important objects? And are you just asking out loud all the time, ""Is there a toilet in front of me?"" But computer vision translation to braille is an idea people are exploring. [Here is one incremental step](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/images/f/fb/Wearnavi-vision-icra2017.pdf).

There is also a burgeoning market of non-machine vision available in the form of apps and services that make human eyes available. Check out Aira and BeMyEyes, which use human volunteers/workers to guide a blind user remotely. Recently, a blind guy ran the [Boston Marathon using Aira](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/6/16610728/2017-new-york-marathon-blind-runner-wearworks-wayband-simon-wheatcroft).",,,2,0,0,

Basically a VoiceOver user can get to hear what you see and they can interact with their apps 99%(*) as easily as sighted users but a bit slower.

Also, visual rules apply to your best eye, and it has to be something that won't be correctable for at least 12 months. Not being able to drive isn't an automatic qualifier.

Talk to a social security caseworker. Your better bet is to get vocational training, will be much better in the long term than SSI benefits. Sounds like you could possibly benefit from some counseling too. Sitting at home on disability probably won't make you feel great in the long run, and there's lots of ways to adapt.

So I’m a university student and was walking back to my apartment from class. I’m still on campus when someone walks up along side me and says hi. I greet them back, and their next question really caught me off guard.

“So what happened to your eyes?”

I was taken aback a bit, but I’m not sensitive about it, and while thinking in my head that that was quite the way to start a conversation, I was outwardly present and started answering his questions about my blindness. He was pretty nice, and things were going fine, until this whole interaction happened.

“Well, my name is X and I teach biology here. Another thing I do though, is I like to pray for people. Would you mind if I prayed for you?”

Silly me, thought he meant in his own time, before bed or something. So I agreed. That was when he stopped me, and the first alarm bells started going off. He took my hand in his, and began speaking again. I was uncomfortable, but didn’t want to be rude, so I let him continue.

Him: “Great, what’s your name?”
me: “uhhh… Vicorin.”
H: “Well Vicorin, do you know Jesus?”
M: “No, I’m not really religious, sorry.”
H: “That’s ok, do you mind if I pray for you in his name?”

I was really uncomfortable now, but was frozen and didn’t know what else to do. I agreed, and, much to my horror, he put his hand over my eyes, still holding my hand in his other, and began to pray. He said, and I quote…

“Dear father, please cast the spirit of blindness out of this young man.”

And went on a whole prayer, asking for god to heal me. I was like a deer in headlights at this point, completely frozen. I stood there, immensely uncomfortable with having this guy’s hand on my face, and stiffly waited for it to be over. This whole time we were just standing in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking people. Finally he ended, and there was a expectant moment, where I guess he was seeing if I could see again. Spoiler alert, I couldn’t. Then he told me to have a good day and he left.

That was by far the weirdest interaction I’ve had because of my blindness.",,,18,0,0,

Drawing 3 dimensional objects is a practiced skill. It's not something one can do easily. It requires a careful study of light and shadow and perspective.

I know this doesn't mean a lot to you, but the point I wanted to get to is that there have been many artists who have used these things to draw optical illusions. Drawings that when you look at them, you can see them as two different things, but not at the same time. You have to kind of twist your brain around to see it as one thing, then to see it as another thing.

Also, there are artists who draw things that look almost realistic, except there's a glitch in the drawing that makes it an impossibility. For example, imagine a square. Imagine on each side of the square, there's a stairway. If you go along one side of the square, you're going down the stairway. Turn the corner, you're going down again. Turn the corner, you're still going down. Turn one more time, and you're still going down, but you end up back at the top of the stairway where you started.

Obviously, this would be impossible in a true 3 dimensional world, but it is possible to draw such a thing on paper. When you see something like that for the first time, it's kind of interesting and weird and confusing and unsettling.

One, which is also true for sighted people is that there are a lot of distractions when it comes to writing, on most sites. You have to focus on wysiwyg editors, for example.

Quiller is minimalistic, and is designed to provide what writers need most: a not bloated and quick interface, feedback and readership. This is also a reason why we don't have, for example, means to search for a specific title. You can publish your work in a matter of minutes and share via social networks, or be discovered through the very simple ratings system.

When it comes to writing, one of the most important elements you will use on the site is the editor itself. We made sure that the editor we use has specific ARIA tags where it is needed, so screen reader users should not have issues using what matters most. Should you not like the editor, we provide the means to disable javascript, which will provide even better compatibility with screen readers, and it is probably the quickest way to use the site.

Rattly ankle gear is a fun thing for all babies but blind infants can use them for fine tuning certain auditory cues.   Things with buttons or knobs are perfect, too raised lettering or even braille labels would be fantastic.    Most infant toys are integrated in that they're multisensory cued do you won't go wrong with the modern ituratiin if an activity ant or My Pal Al.  

As for being scared by noises, you are shopping for a human baby not some foreign zoo species.   (Yes, this is how some people approach any disability.  Strike it from your thinking whenever it appears.   Her parents likely have some adjusting to do but you can do a lot to help them by treating your niece like she's perfect and no different from any other new human. You will learn her preferences as she decides to share them just like any other auntie/uncle would. She knows as much about the world as any other new human so anything you can offer that promotes her learning will be a blessing. 

Things that rattle or squeak when discovered are just as interesting for a blind child as a sighted one.    Those noisy toys can be muffled.   Duct tape over speakers works wonders but giving her silent or muted toys drops her interaction level.     Honestly, though,  soda bottles with different rattly things inside them are great fun do you don't have to invest in VTech toys to help her along.  (sand, rice, small rocks, cotton balls and pennies are a good spectrum.   The 20oz bottles are great but you can use smaller pill bottles work well.   You can use any number of adhesives to seal the lids on.   Again, avoid latex.  I'm not a fan of superglue for these, either.  We had Houdinis who could get those open.

Getting connected with local agents to use for the blind at a young age is probably the best decision that my parents made for me as A completely blind individual.

I was the only blind child in my family, the oldest of six kids, and my parents and had no experience with blind individuals prior to me being born.

I started orientation and mobility skills around the age of four or five, these services were provided by my local schools.

I attended public schools all of my life excluding a two week assessment of the Oregon school for the blind, where it was determined that I would be better off in mainstream schools. My school materials were produced an alternative format, Braille  and audio.

I graduated high school 12 years ago, and in the past 12 years technology has evolved so much now that there is limited to know information that isn’t available to blind students, therefore I don’t see a reason why a student shouldn’t go to public schools, so that they can interact with sided peers.

This being said however, I feel experience with other blind individuals or those who are specialized in instructing blind individuals would be beneficial to a child, because this is something I lacked as a child and had to adapt my own ways of accomplishing some tasks. Which isn’t bad, but if you’re able to interact with other blind individual as you can see how they adapt A sighted  world for their needs.

As previously stated in this thread though, it would be beneficial for you and your child if you figure out ways to help them navigate a sided world as a blind individual.

One thing that comes to mind is as a child, my father would have me start in one corner of the room, and move in a straight line. Along the wall picking up all garbage and clothes. When I got to the corner, I did turn around and make the journey back to the other wall, continuing to do this across the living room so that I ensured I was picking everything up.

I hated it as a child, and absolutely despised him for making me do this.

Now however, I find myself starting in the corner of something I’m trying to clean, and proceeding to clean it in a grid pattern which ensures that I cleaned everything properly.

It’s the little things that make a big difference.



And my sided wife is thankful that she doesn’t have to worry about cleaning the kitchen for the most part, because I keep a clean kitchen.

Final comment is to teach her child to in brace the fact that they’re blind, too many people get offended in my opinion about blind jokes or people asking questions about blindness. I met my wife by sending her a text message that said:

“if you don’t want creepy blame people texting you, maybe you shouldn’t put your number on Facebook“.

Obviously this got a response, and the rest is history eight years ago.

The point though it is, if someone is blind, they should embrace that fact and allow it to be part of their personality.

If you’d like to chat more, or hear more about how blind people can use technology to be small business owners, give the your own pay podcast a listen and your favorite podcast app.

I guess I will tell you that life goes on with a visual impairment, and that most people in this sub, including myself, would be very thankful for the sight you have. If you're cleared for driving then your sight is actually quite good, at least by the standards in this sub. It means you can do almost all life activities normally or with small accommodations. With that said, of course you're going to be upset if your sight is declining. Find out exactly what is happening with your vision from a doctor. If you're feeeling anxious or depressed about your sight once you have a prognosis, seek out a local support group, an online support group, or therapy if you have the resources. Finally, I will say that changes to vision become easier to deal with over time. That is, the brain adapts to a decrease in sight and you will find it less noticeable day to day than you do now. It helps if you don't dwell on it or only dwell on it productively, i.e. to find out better ways of doing things. Do not use your declining sight as a crutch to shut down in other parts of your life and do not isolate yourself.

I have RP, and honestly the hardest thing for me is a helpless feeling of a loss of independence. When my wife is running errands and my son wants to go grab a burger for lunch, I just start getting pissed. Not sad or depressed, but angry. Angry that I'm basically a 14 year old who has to go do things on someone else's schedule when it's convenient. Guess what? That means I haven't fully accepted my blindness.

That makes forging relationships with people exhausting. It may not even be that he doesn't want to have relationships or go do things, but fear that he'll go do something fun, have a good time, and then only get to do it again if someone else decides he gets to. That's obviously not the reality, but people feel that way. 

The best advice is to have him find other blind people to talk to or connect with. I wish I could travel back in time when I was like your friend, put my hand on my younger self's shoulder, and slap the living shit out of my self, and tell myself to man up and stop feeling sorry for myself. I finally snapped out of a large part of it, but later than I'd have liked.

I think I may have a different attitude than others here, because I suffer from blindness and mental illness, and I firmly believe that I'm only as productive as I am now because I had people in my life to kick me in the ass and tell me to grow up on both counts. That helped me face it. Don't get me wrong, support is important. But holding someone's have and telling them it will be okay only carries them so far.

Based on what you're saying in your post, he's lying to himself if he thinks he's accepted it. He has RP. I can promise him it won't get better, and it doesn't get easier. But I firmly believe how you tackle blindness is a defining point in your life, and not just embracing it is counter productive. He needs to learn that blindness is a defining characteristic of who he is, and while it doesn't make him intrinsically special, how he deals with it will.

He needs to understand that he has people around him that care about his well being, but those same people have to challenge him. They have to push him through by showing support, but not tolerating self pity.

Again, probably not the most popular opinion out there, but I firmly believe in this situation you need both a carrot and a stick.

 At this stage, it's a bit early to be looking at schools, you still have time for that. I'm not sure where you're located but the Alabama Institute for the deaf and blind, and specifically the Alabama School for the Blind is exceptional. The number of commenters here have accurately summarized the deficiencies at some schools for the visually impaired and blind, but this school is an example of one of the best programs in the nation. 

If you have a Department of Rehabilitation Services, which you should in your state, start by contacting early intervention. A large amount of funding has been dedicated to servicing these babies with disabilities. These Services help prepare you and your child to enter into preschool or kindergarten, and can definitely Aid you in learning the ropes before you jump head-first into an educational setting. the majority of them do home visits and activities with children.

Take a look at the NLS transcribers handbook. Just Google that and you will find basic instructions for learning Braille. It's free and the curriculum will take you from being a braille notice to being a Braille master. I can't encourage Braille literacy and audio literacy enough. I also believe there are numerous Braille programs four children that will send you books via mail. And definitely ask your local librarian, or call a state librarian in charge of accessible media and ask about twin Vision books. which are regular books with plastic Braille overlays made for parents to teach children. 

Also if you live in the United States, individuals with a physical handicap or a reading disability can gain access to the National Library service for the Blind and Physically handicapped. There is a digital book player, that has access to hundreds of thousands of audio books, and there's also an app. I use the physical Digital Book player with my children daily, with audio books like Harry Potter, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Etc.

Secondly, I wonder if Quiller could start a stock photo collection where all the photos already have alt-text? That way fully blind people could pick photos to go along with our articles (thumbnails, cover art, etc) and thus compete on a more level field with sighted authors.  In the current environment, if you're publishing on any mainstream platform and your article doesn't open with a photo, you might as well just not bother writing at all.  This is true for anything from freelance journalism (thumbnail images are required to get clicks on facebook or twitter) to fanfic (without cover art nobody will even bother opening your fic).  It's the primary reason I don't bother writing for public consumption.  ",,,2,0,0,

There is some recent evidence that active reading (braille) improves comprehension and retention over passive reading (screenreaders/audiobooks), which is relevant in light of technology heavily favoring the latter. So maybe a trove of braille ebooks.

Finally, this isn't for everyone, but I know people have enjoyed guided adventures like skydiving, bungee jumping, parasailing, climbing, and so on. And it could be good to promote mobility since that becomes a big challenge as someone goes blind.

I would call your apartment office and ask when it's usually not too busy and try and go during a down time to explore if you feel more comfortable. Or asking them to give you a quick overview of what's there can be helpful. 

I think getting used to the auditory clues as far who is on a machine should come pretty fast. The weights rolling on the pulley, the bars and plates being pushed, can all give you an idea. If you're unsure just ask if anyone is using it before proceeding. 

As someone else said hand weights are a lot easier to do incorrectly where machines are more intuitive. Start with a weight towards the top (lighter) and add systematically. Explore the whole machine. All new gym goers hate figuring out how machines work, we have all been there but once you do it a few times you'll blend right in.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been legally blind since forever due to peripheral vision loss. When I was in uni I still had a small amount of that left, but now it's gone. On top of that my central vision has declined in the past few years and my colour perception has also deteriorated further too. There are a number of things I used to do that I can't now or find too frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you don't know till you try. For example, I recently re-installed SimCity 2000. I was so proud of myself for coming across the solution to install it on Win 7 or later, then I booted it up and things were not as I remembered. In my mind the contrast between everything was so much clearer, but now I'm struggling to see what's highlighted, identify zones from unzoned land or each other and so on. Then I got frustrated and annoyed. Then I gave up and felt pretty flat.

&amp;#x200B;

Denial, anger, melancholy, acceptance. The four stages of grief. And when you're losing your sight you experience that over and over again as you try to do something you used to be able to, realise you can't or it takes so much more time and effort than it used to, inevitably give up and feel garbage about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you do about it? well, the advice of talking to a therapist or someone is probably good. I don't, that's my choice and I know I'm taking the harder road. Doing things with others, asking for help, that's another thing you can and should do. Asking for assistance is a skill you need to learn, but when push comes to shove you just need to bite the bullet and do it. Out for tea? Ask whoever you're with to read the menu. Need to do some shopping? Get someone to come with you to find all the things they've moved on you since last time. That's life, you need to accept that and it makes it a lot easier to accept when you're not trying to do something that's much harder or impossible now and getting angry (""stupid f-ing deadbeat supermarket employees putting the stupid f-ing White King somewhere I can't f-ing find it!

My daughter has LCA. Get comfortable with acronyms. It’s going to become part of your standard intro to the variety of groups you’ll get involved in. IFSPs, EI, CVI, O&amp;M... Vision impairment has a language of its own. 

Get used to visitors. We have EI, a TVI, a PT, and are starting an OT specialist visit weekly. That’s on top of regular doctors visits, specialist, neurology (a lot of vision issues come coupled with neurological issues), and genetics. She also does an infant group, dance class, swim class... it’s a lot. These are your people. 

Be prepared to forget your kid is blind. It happens. Like you’ll forget there’s an issue and be focused on regular parent stuff, only to have the fact that the kid loses focus at story time if the book is too visual crash down on your world and bring you to the verge of tears. The waves will even out over time, but it still surprises you. 

Learn to advocate. You will have to be your kid’s voice. Sometimes that’s as simple as researching the local preschool and how well they deal with kids with visual impairment. Other times, it can be as hard as convincing the medical professionals that your kid actually should be qualified as blind. Books and the internet don’t help nearly as much as establishing a network. 

Learn to educate. Because it’s going to happen a lot. From the stares and whispers of complete strangers to the kid who outright asks, “why do their eyes look weird?” You can get mad (and you will) but you can also try and carefully enlighten another human to your experience. 

Finally, focus on the parent side first. Your kid is still a kid. A tantrum is still a tantrum. Our kid bumps into the kitchen table near daily. Yes, some of this is likely related to depth perception. But part is also her being under 2 and normal awkwardness.

Hmm. When I cut mine in the dark (yeah I can see so sorry if this isn't a great methold I don't mean to upset anyone) I just guide the clippers across my toe itself below the nail. Then round off the edges by stabbing my finger against it and clipping til it's smooth. You can tell by how uncomfortable the pressure of the clippers against the underside of your toes to tell how short it will go. It should feel a tad cold but not like your crushing your toe. To learn a ballpark you can squash your underside of each toe into the nail to figure out how long and how comfortable a trim will be. 

I was born with Hypermobility syndrome which is very similar to what you have and now can't bend the way I used to either.

A story... 
My mom was totally blind from early childhood.   She decided she'd get into pottery when I was in high school.   I was always her partner in crime so  she naturally commissioned me to make templates for some of her creations.   Her teacher didn't know I was legally blind, too, so when mom came to class with a star-shaped cutout she planned to use for a planter base, her teacher asked where it came from.  (Mom ran the kiln for the center, so all the staff knew her.). Mom off handedly said, ""I made my daughter do math.  She hated it, but it came out pretty cool.""  (I did vehemently dislike the math part but only because I wanted it to be perfect and my protractor skills sucked lizard toes.  I had my own demons and graphic arts and blindness were, in my mind, incompatible.  Mom didn't cotton to that mess so she dragged me through my inferiorities to my betterment.)      The teacher took they in stride and helped her do the parts she couldn't do and stepped back to let mom run with the rest.    Sadly, the project didn't survive the kiln, but her teacher never discouraged her.   The next project was 'winged Things.'.     I had so much fun.   Mom did, too.   ",,,1,0,0,

1dfffb69-622b-448d-bb41-55d98ce415c4,1543188901,"Hi there, 

It sounds like you’re anxious and scared about the changes you’re noticing. This kind of thing *is* scary! It’s happened to me a number of times throughout my life, and it’s scary and upsetting each time. 

There are two things going on. 

1. Your eyesight is changing/getting worse. 

2. Your anxiety and fear are taking over. 

For a lot of people, myself included, going to the doctor for a check-up and/or diagnosis helped me feel better, both because I now had a name for what was happening, and also because I was doing something about it. It didn’t necessarily make my vision any better, but I felt better. 

Therapy/support groups are also really helpful! Some organizations for the blind have therapists who’ve been trained specifically to work with people with low/declining vision or blindness (in its many forms). Even a therapist without that particular training can be helpful. That way you can talk about your fears/anxieties and get them out of your head where they will lose power. Might sound hokey, I know, but it works for some people. 

Losing vision in not the end of the world or your life. Millions of people deal with it every day. They’re doctors, lawyers, accountants, grocery store employees, parents and all kinds of other things. 

I’m 40 and have been legally blind since I was 25, with low vision my whole life before that. Since being declared legally blind, my vision has gone through 3 major shifts to worse vision. Each time I’ve adapted. It’s emotionally exhausting and scary and takes different skills each time, but humans were born to be able to change, grow and adapt, which I’ve done, and I know you’ll be able to do, too. 

Good luck! ",,,1,0,0,

What I struggled with at first: holding a conversation and still paying attention to what the cane was hitting.

What I struggle with now: resisting the urge to whip the tail light of the passing car that nearly hits me when I'm crossing at a crosswalk. Also getting weird looks from people who haven't seen a blind person and don't know how to accept my existence as part of their reality.

Tips for new cane users: Find a 2 or 5 pound hand weight, or fill a milk jug with a similar weight of sand or water. Rotate your wrist back and forth to exercise the muscles in your forearm that will do this with a cane. You can also use the same weight to raise the endurance of having your arm extended.

What is the distance of the holes/obstacles? 

Think about how blind people navigate and take in their surroundings. Our canes will find most ground obstacles and we have training and practice for street crossings. Rather than holding my camera up each time I'm making a crossing, how about an app that details out the crossing beforehand? Traffic direction, active lanes, parking lanes, if curb cuts are in cardinal directions or angled out into the intersection, if the intersection and crossings are square or at an odd angle, if there is a safer crossing with a beacon closer to my destination rather than the crossing I'm approaching. That all would be very useful when used in conjunction with Map turn-by-turn directions. Fiddling with a camera and listening to a phone will make street crossings much more dangerous and having to hold a phone while just walking on the street takes away the use of my free hand, hindering my safety and mobility should I encounter something my cane or the app misses.

From your history, you seem to be in the US, although not clear if you are in Florida still or not. (I'm in Canada, so our health care and rehabilitation is a bit different). I believe you should be able to contact your state rehabilitation agency regarding getting Orientation and Mobility training, as well as Vision Rehabilitation training (I'm not sure of the exact name in the US, in Canada we call it Independent Living Skills, or ILS). 

Hadley school also does some distance education (https://www.hadley.edu/Findacourse.asp), including Braille and technology. I haven't used their services before, so I can't speak about my personal experience, but many of my coworkers says they are good.

Getting training while you have some vision does help make things a bit easier. Do you have an iPhone? The iPhone has adaptive technology built into it, and you can learn the basics off the internet pretty fast. 

For software for PC, check into a screen reader called NVDA. For Mac, it would be VoiceOver (as well as on their mobile devices).

25d66876-1be0-43f4-8a86-0a7b3d39805f,1543331601,"The first thing to know is that sight changes, be it sight loss or gain, is different for everyone. What Glaucoma looks like for one person is likely not what it looks like for another person. It will look different for a person going from 20/20 sight than it does for a person who wears glasses going from 20/100.

That is the trouble with attempting to simulate sight loss through items. Sight is a spectrum, like almost all things, and there are various parts that make up the accumulated whole we know as sight.

There is distance-viewing, depth perception, color perception, night vision, and visual field. Any one of these is its own spectrum that determines how much any one person can see in each of those different areas. The compilation of those various spectra is what puts a person somewhere on the sight spectrum. This is why I have a hard time answering the questions ""How much can you see?"" and ""How well can you see?""

There is no short answer, and I generally give a short summary of each of the spectra I mentioned before.

I'll say something like ""I can't see clearly more than two feet. Anything beyond that is just color and moving objects. I have no night vision and no peripheral vision, so it's like I'm looking through a tunnel.""

This brings me to the simulation you viewed about the black circle with the growing border. The circle is not stupid. What it does is show you the mechanics of Glaucoma. Some people like to know the mechanics of how they or someone they know is losing their vision. Sometimes, it helps them better understand what they need to do in order to function with their diminishing sight. I will grant that the simulation of the mechanics does not show the actual experience of what it is like to lose your sight to Glaucoma. This is the question you want answered, and I've just told you that it's not the same for everyone.

That said, another thing to know about Glaucoma is that there are two types. There is Open-Angle Glaucoma and Closed-Angle Glaucoma. One of them is more common, painless and earning itself the title of The Silent Thief. The other causes pain, alerting you to the fact it is there, but likely not before it has taken some sight. I don't know which is the one that causes pain and which one does not.

Here is my experience, with perfect hindsight as only the past can give us. I had the painless type of Glaucoma. One day, when I was twelve, I crashed my bike into a parked pickup truck. I just turned away and kept on riding. I didn't notice anything different about my sight, but I, now, know that was the first sign of a loss of depth perception. That means I had Glaucoma long enough for it to steal away part of my sight.

When I was thirteen, I got a new pair of glasses. They worked fine when I got them. Several months later, I needed a magnifying glass to read regular print while wearing the glasses. This was another obvious sign of something being wrong, but I didn't know and my mother was too wrapped up in herself to pay attention when I needed her.

The next obvious sign was when I was two months shy of my seventeenth birthday. It was around Halloween. I began to have flashes where my vision would turn all white or all black, like flashing lights. I told my mother and she thought I wasn't eating enough protein, so she fed me chicken and told me to tell her if it was still happening.

It was by some chance of luck--for I don't remember why she was at the hospital, probably for my kid brother with Sickle Cell Anemia--but she ended up meeting a woman whose baby daughter was born with Glaucoma. She took me to the hospital that night and got me checked out.

One of the doctors said I would have been totally blind in three days if she had not brought me in. Three days, and there would have been nothing left to save. That is probably why I can't see out of my left eye. They did surgery on my right eye then waited days to do surgery on my left eye.

So, what is Glaucoma, mechanically? Glaucoma is the name of a condition where something malfunctions within the drainage system of the eye. There is a liquid-jelly type substance that gives the eye its shape. Without us knowing it, the level of the amount of that substance is regulated by a circulation of flowing and draining. This allows what is known as the eye pressure to remain stable. Think of it like a balloon filling with water and air. The reason a balloon pops when it is overfilled is because there is no way for the air and water to drain at a steady rate. The same thing happens with tires. If you put air in a tire and it feels full but the tire looks like some of the air has drained out over time or through use, there is a tiny hole in that tire somewhere that is allowing the air to flow out. With no air going into the tire as it is flowing out, the tire deflates. Same principle as eye pressure.

Normal eye pressure is between eight and sixteen. It's okay to be stable at four or twenty, but those are the limits and doctors don't want you to be outside of those parameters. Eye pressure is important because it is a sign of how well the drainage system of the eyes are working. If the pressure is too high, the eye will push so hard on the optic nerve that it cuts off the blood flow and begins to kill the nerve through blood starvation. If the pressure is too low, I imagine the eye begins to collapse and damage the retina or other parts of the eye.

You can have a different pressure number for each eye. When I had active Glaucoma, before the surgeries, the pressure in my right eye was thirty and the pressure in my left eye was fifty. It's a likelihood that there might not have been anything in my left eye to save even without the surgery, but there was hope. They waited a couple days to perform surgery on my left eye after giving me medicine they hoped would bring the pressure down to a safer level to perform surgery on.

Perhaps you might have noticed that the painless type of Glaucoma doesn't present many noticeable signs. It usually happens over a period of years with sight loss occurring in tiny increments until the loss or the signs are so obvious that you go to the doctor to get it checked out. By then, it's been too late for a long time. Glaucoma is something you want to actively be tested for on a regular basis as a preventive measure. The sight lost cannot be gotten back. It doesn't recover.

As far as I could tell, while losing my vision, I didn't notice unless I had to read something. I was born with cataracts and have had bad vision my whole life. I couldn't really tell something was wrong until I was thirteen, but I didn't know and I trusted my mother.
