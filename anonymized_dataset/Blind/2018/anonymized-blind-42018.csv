Counterfeit Monkey - Possibly not the easiest game to play completely blind, since it's in part about spelling. But an amazing game. You have to escape a banana republic with only a gizmo that lets you change items by changing one letter in their names.  
Kerkerkruip - Not an adventure game, more of a roguelike RPG. You have to defeat seven monsters in a dungeon while growing more powerful. The game changes each time you play it, and the order in which you kill the monsters is critical to success.  
Spider and Web - Just thinking about this game gives me chills. This game has the single best puzzle in any game I've ever played. You'll know which one I'm talking about after you solve it. Try not to use a walkthrough until the end sequence, which is fine but not as important to not ruin as the rest of the game.  
Superluminal Vagrant Twin - A weird game, in that the ""rooms"" are not rooms, but planets. The game is sort of zoomed out in a weird way that gets rid of a lot of clutter. Has some fun easter eggs and the writing is great, if spare.  
Treasures of a Slaver's Kingdom - The writing in this game is a take-off of Conan and is great purple prose. Some RPG elements. A good laugh if the premise appeals to you.  
Varicella - Most of these recs aren't very puzzle focused, but this one is. An interesting protagonist and some strange and memorable characters.  
Hard Puzzle - Don't play this game. I'm warning you!

For accessible text games, I'd also recommend trying the Choice of Games series if you haven't already. I've enjoyed the Lost Heir triology and a number of others.",,,2,0,0,

13ff2ddd-a7cd-42ec-a7a7-07a7eff76eb5,1523459028,"I've been on the same boat for the last 4 years.

I used to code back when I had sight but stopped doing it after going blind because it requires too much effort for too little return and doesn't flow naturally with me anymore, so now I sleep as much as possible and browse reddit twice or thrice a day to stay up to date with the news and complain about my blindness.

My sister comes over for a visit almost every day and that's usually the highlight of the day except on Tuesdays when I talk to a psychologist about the past when my life was great and get to introspect about what bothers me in blindness.  All my conversations either revolve around blindness or end up leading there, so you can imagine how annoying it must be to be around me.  Even here on /r/blind people are getting tired of me.  My friends distanced themselves when I lost my sight and rarely, if ever, contact me.  When asked about me some of them say that I've changed my phone number, which is not true, and this tells me a lot about their intentions.

I've tried to learn piano and was doing fine with the first grade songs, but as soon as the songs started to force me to lift my hands off the keyboard and I learned that I'd need years of practice before I could get it right I decided to quit because, again, music was no longer flowing naturally with me and unlike in coding there are no special techniques to get better at it other than training a lot.

Back in 2014, shortly before going completely blind, I fell to a railway because my contrast perception was already too bad to distinguish the edge of the platform and got hit by an incoming train but unfortunately didn't die, so now I have to endure this.

I'm not clinically depressed though, which makes things even harder since there is no medication to fix me.  I spend my days day-dreaming about what my life could have been if I hadn't lost my sight.",,,3,0,0,

I've actually joined Chicks in Bowls, which is a roller skate/quad group who skate at skate parks. Turns out skating in bowls and half pipes are awesome when you can't see well, once you figure out where the walls/ramps are, and repeatedly going back and forth!

I was telling my eye dr about old people questioning if I really need the cane, and Dr said ""Next time just hold up your middle finger and ask them if they can see how many fingers you're holding."" Hah!

Before I started using a cane, but was in sunnies all the time because eyes can't handle light,  the amount of dickheads who have to come up and give me shit because I'm wearing sunglasses, is extremely high. I used to explain about eye disease and light, now I just say ""I'm blind."" and they all start stuttering out apologies. Since using a cane, that happens far less though! 

Agree that drunks are dickheads to most people, I just think when you're the only person in a gig venue in sunglasses and holding a cane, you stand out more to said dickheads!

Good luck with the banjo, have fun! I started learning guitar in 2014 when Chris Cheney from The Living End said ""You know, you don't need eyesight to play guitar....""

I'm not saying you must be completely 100% aware of the exact location of your target. But you do need to possess enough awareness to be able to gage whether or not it's even doable without direct assistance in the form of a Uber or something. GPs apps are an option, yes--though perhaps maybe not blindsquare unless you already have a general idea where you should be. So is Google Maps. And if you make use of that before you leave it might even tell you how long it's supposed to take you to get there.

We don't know if guy just randomly decided to start walking to this place, or if he got off at the wrong bus stop, or whatever. We do know that he somehow managed to miss his target by 4 miles. If he just got off at the wrong stop, then rather than getting pissy about OP not walking him the 4 miles he needed to go, a point in the general direction of the bus going the other way would have sufficed. If he just decided hey, today's a good day for a walk, then he'll hopefully have learned to do a little bit more planning beforehand.

Also, while it's been a while since I've used Blindsquare, does it not tell you when you get to street 1 which direction you should be going when you get there?

"" I had 20/20 vision until I turned 30. I started to lose my vision so I went to an eye doctor thinking that I simply needed glasses. When I went, the doctor scooted back in his chair and said, 'whoa, I can't help you.'  He sent me to a neurologist, thinking there was something wrong with my brain. Many invasive tests later, he sent me to an optoneurologist. He knew once doing his test that he would not be able to help me, so 2 years in he sent me to a retinal specialist. All of my friends had doubted me, saying I should seek psychiatric help. The retinal specialist, after lots of Clockwork Orange style tests and dyes injected into my arms was able to determine that I have a rare recessive disorder called progressive cone dystrophy. It causes me to go blind slowly. Visual acuity is the first to go. Color vision changes, sometimes achromotopsia. It was a relief to get a diagnosis. I wasn't crazy. It takes a long time to adjust to losing your independence. You have to go through the stages of mourning over the loss of your sight.""

From my perspective, being stressed or scared is natural. but remember, you can't change some things and you have to take a roll with it approach. My wife and I knew each other for many years but didn't start dating until her vision started to go. I've seen her depressed at times over this, but you just have to go on. I think the hardest thing for her is her loss of her ability to find a job. She's on disability now. She also has battled alchohol abuse. Part of this is boredom on her part. Being blind is boring af. We still go camping, hiking and do other activities. It's obviously hard for a person who was previously sighted to lose their vision. For me, the only major change is that I have to read menus for her when we go out to eat.

First step, get him set up for VI services at his school ASAP as well as a low vision appt with an opthalmologist, if you haven't already. He'll need to get a functional vision evaluation and a learning media assessmentfrom a TVI. The FVE and the LMA will determine what his functional/useable vision is (not just in a perfect environment like the drs) and what media he will use to read and write in (print, large print, Braille, etc) 
He'll also be evaluated by an orientation and mobilty specialist and this is who will teach him how to get around school, the house, the community (if he's at that level- OM can be exploring the space in front of your face). The OM specialist will also determine if a white cane is needed and fit one for him if determined necessary/teach him how to use it.

Sure it's nice in theory to have someone who understands what it's like to be visually impaired, but there are thousands of conditions and everyone has their own unique experiences so really, whether you end up dating a sighted person or a visually impaired person they probably won't fully understand the nuances of your personal situation anyway, even if they have the same condition as you.

My grandfather also uses poles (plastic stakes or metal poles, that way you don't risk splinters) and string lines along the garden beds at the unit he lives at to help guide him. In the garden at his family home though (he and grandma moved to their unit 9 years ago) I don't recall him using them. I suspect that was because he was very familiar with the layout and the garden beds had larger edging (rock lines and low rock walls) that he used for guideance. He always uses gardening gloves from memory.

As for mowing lawns, grandpa may have mowed the lawn occasionally, but he'd usually get my dad or one of my brother's to do it. If he did mow it on his own (which honestly wouldn't surprise me, we're quite the same in that we'll just go ahead and try doing something ourselves irrespective of the challenge due vision impairment in my case and total blindness in his) I suspect he'd use the rock lines a guide. So he'd get in line (using feet to feel the ground) and mow slowly till he hit the rock line, then turn and head back. In the spots where it would have been possible to cross onto a path, it'd be pretty obvious and the mower blades shouldn't strike the concrete or pavers, so you should be ok.

I'm only maintaining two garden beds and keep weeds out my paving (it really needs to be redone), and I'm often lazy about it. But grandpa was maintaining a full size garden - front and back lawns, five separate garden beds, greenhouse, a vegetable patch with four or five beds - on his own (bar the aforementioned help mowing the law) and he'd be out there most days. It was the best kept garden in the street as I recall, and he couldn't see a bit of it!",,,2,0,0,

I don't mind at all if someone comes up and asks me if I want help. It's nice. Sometimes I'll say yes, sometimes no, and if they respect that then great.


I really do appreciate *offers* of assistance. I'm kinda bad at navigation anyway, even without the blindness part. Or when people give me a seat, or tell me about construction ahead, etc. A lot of the directions I get are kinda shit (_never_ trust a sighted person who says something is ""straight""), but that's why I ask more than one person, and at least they're trying.


What I really really do mind is when people randomly grab me (happens all the time), won't take no for an answer, or try to override my own decisions.

Letting me know e.g. that there's a shorter way to X is fine — I might not have known — but just saying ""don't go that way"" is not. Nor is it OK to get between me and a wall I'm shorelining, or tell me how to use my cane.

I was ten and it was also new for my family because there were no visual issues in my family history. Me being tested and diagnosed ended up helping me a lot when it came to school. I got accommodations that the teachers, for the most part, respected. The school system sent a tutor out to my school to teach me braille. The accommodations allowed me to be academically successful. 

I've also learned that self-advocacy is a great tool to have when it comes to being visually impaired in a classroom. I'm 18 and still struggle with advocating for myself, but I've learned that teachers will listen, especially if you have accommodations, a 504, or an IEP to back you up. The teachers sometimes just need a little nudge or reminder.

You have to make a good first impression, though, because there's hundreds of thousands of people to sort through. Based on the dating sites I've been looking through, a lot of sighted guys could use this advice, too.

For me? I like a guy who looks and presents himself as classy. Not arrogant or 'above other people'. Just someone who takes care of himself and has a professional look. I'm also into cosplay and such, so someone who is interested in or at least is neutral to partaking in the same hobby is a bonus, too.

I apply the same logic to myself. Recently I've decided I wanted to try dating, and I realized that I need to get myself in a place where I feel comfortable with that. I've gone to the gym, watched what I eat, and plan on making myself a new wardrobe soon - all before I've started making serious efforts in actually looking for someone. About 8lbs to go and I'll probably hit 19-20% body fat and be pretty darn fit. All in all, it'll probably about 8 months of effort in the end, but when you want a date you have to go in knowing you're not the only one and it doesn't hurt to stack things in your favor as much as you can. Fashion and fitness play a part in that.

The downside to this is that you can only download one movie at a time, they're using sendspace and while I had fun collecting my thousands of movies over the years, I don't know if he'd enjoy doing that. He'd need a laptop to do this as they won't download to tablets as far as I know.

If he wants all the Harry Potter movies or is interested in  a sertain movie or series, feel fre to PM me or if he creates an account on reddit, he can PM me himself.

I also have a huge and i mean huge collection of Harry Potter fan fiction. It's been collected over the years and is around 9.3 gigs of fan fiction, 3 point something zipped. You might be thinking that that isn't a lot, trust me; It is. There are 3665 authors, and thousands of stories all in plain text format. They can be read on any computer although personally, I prefer windows. If he'd like these, just let me know.",,,4,0,0,

First of all, they start off their video in an inaccessible way- like would it really be that hard to read out whatever text they were showing on the screen? I know its a minor detail but it immediately indicates that this is intended for a sighted audience, not a blind one. 

My next issue with this is their ""evidence"" that most blind people can't read braille. Yes, braille literacy is low, but that's mostly because 1. A large portion of the visually impaired population has some remaining sight and 2. the massive increase in screen-reading technology. Yeah, braille is really difficult to learn at a later age, and admittedly i read braille about as fast as a kindergartener reads any text, but attributing the low braille literacy to difficulty alone is just plain wrong. 

My next issue is practicality- when the heck could this ever be used? It seems like it would be much more difficult to learn to differentiate between at least 26 complex different symbols than it would be to remember the combinations of 6 dots. I can't imagine anyone reading this with speed and accuracy. 

And i know he mentioned that sizing is adjustable, but even at a small ""font,"" the symbols would probably take up just as much space or more than good ole braille. And we all know how bulky braille books can be. So an average book can still take up several large volumes.

Speaking anecdotally here- most people i know don't use paper all that often anyone. Most of my braille reading friends use braille displays to do their work. Can this company produce an elia equivalent? Or can elia ONLY be read on paper- thus making it mostly useless to tech-loving people

And what would people do if their printer broke down? They'd be out of a writing system (at least temporarily), unless this company can design and produce its own type of slate. 

I know this got ranty, but this really does seem like a silly idea through snd through

Is the protagonist going to be a total? Legally blind?

Is their vision still declining or is it stable now? 

Do they even know what their condition is? 

Are they in and out of the hospital a lot? 

How old are they and what year(s) does the story take place? 

I know a lot of people under 30 who never bothered to learn Braille because their screen readers have always sufficed. I know some people who are legally blind who don't use any adaptive technology other than large print books. 

How long have they been blind for? Were they born that way or did they lose their sight over time? Was it the result of an injury? When did it happen? 

What's their mobility like? 

A lot of people with Liebers don't bother using their canes in most situations but always carry it on them anyways. 

Do they care what other people think of them or their condition? 

I know a few people who are legally blind who don't use a cane because of the stigma around it. My one friend with RP will not leave the house without her husband because she refuses to learn to use a cane because she's afraid of being judged by her coworkers.

1. Tinder wasn't the way to go; or
2. I was dealing with blindness badly in my online chats, or
3. I was over-emphasising my blindness ( I don't think I am),

One side question I have; I have heard of your app, but I have not tried it yet. It's on iOS right? How would you run the pictures of the memes through it? If I'm browsing a twitter app do I have to click on the picture, and open it in your app? I'm only asking because such a process might take a little too long for me to use in casual situations. I know that what you can do in iOS is limited, do you have a Windows version of your service? An NVDA add on, for example, would be amazing.

Thankfully I've only had a couple of negative experiences myself, and they were only minor. Thankfully most people are very friendly and helpful - I absolutely know what you mean about people not paying attention though! The number of people that cut me off and then apologise when I whack them with my cane because they came out of no where!

With regard to your experiences with over-indulgers, don't let your sight hold you back from going to gigs etc. Unfortunately in those instances so described, my assessment would be that would be a familiar experience for many women, irrespective of whether they can see or not. It's behaviour we need to work together to stop, but drunken dickheads are drunken dickheads to all. I went and saw Anti-Flag when they were here in 2016 and I had an inebriated bloke across from me flicking beer he'd spilled at me and others. Thankfully his mate was very apologetic, but it's still rubbish behaviour.

Finally, I know it's not for everyone, but if you've any interest in cricket, I'd encourage you to get involved with blind cricket. I've certainly enjoyed getting involved and those I've met from WA have been good guys and they're really keen to get a WA team together (historically SA and WA have run a combined team due to lack of numbers). There are also other blind sports you can get involved in. I know here in SA the City of Marion (which happens to be my council area) has been running a blind soccer league (unfortunately aimed at a younger demographic as it runs after-school/before-tea hours) encouraging mixed (i.e. sighted and vision impaired) participation. 

Oh, and an addendum: you make me want to get my stuff together and work on learning the banjo that's sitting in the corner of my living room.

The issue would be with contexualizing text and understanding it.

To simplify, there's two real kinds of memes, and then reaction images are a separate category.

- Images with text. They're simple, usually images from a popular show, or some comic/fan art. Pepe the frog is from a comic showing a frog peeing with his pants around his ankles, if I remember right, and the original frame said ""Feels good, man."" but now his weird facial expression is used for... everything.

- Images that have significant changes. These are harder to explain. There's one going around that's a picture of the Chum Bucket and Krusty Krab from spongebob, with gross/bad things on the chum bucket, and good things on the Krusty Krab. There's also a lot with no text, like stock images with the faces changed. I know there's one that was a guy and his girlfriend, with the girlfriend looking unhappy because he was looking back at another girl.

That one was used for things like gamers, over the guy's face, Destiny, a video game, over the girlfriend's face, and Warframe, a similar game viewed as better, over the other girl's face.

With things like that, it'd be hard to contextualize them. Maybe if there was a bespecular type of app that could recognize what memes are which kind, then send the memes off to people to confirm or edit the description, to make them make more sense.

Possibly with some sort of watch ads to get a single meme described per ad, and just buy a ton of meme tokens to be able to get multiple memes described and all that kind of stuff.",,,2,0,0,

See if you can get a technology assessment through the DOR (if you live in the states)  so you can find the best set up for your needs. 

I use a unit called a ""revo to go"" (basically a fancy android tablet). It can connect wirelessly to a small portable camera so i can ""look"" around the classroom and view things from a distance. It also comes with an optioonal stand so i can prop the tablet up and use the tablet as a CCTV. 

It's fairly lightweight and it performs wayyy better than my visionbook did. The only downside is that the actual cctv function (just for looking directly at papers) is pretty limited. But, that won't be an issue for you in college. A lot of information will be available online and you can request to have your materials sent to you in an accessible digital format, so you don't have to use paper all that often anyway.

There's been a couple cases, like in character creation, where I felt a little barb of frustration, like picking a genotype because I literally didn't know anything about what they were talking about, and how important each stat would be, and if I was meant to type about appearance or not in the box.

There's also the clock, which just... makes no sense to me. I have no idea how long anything will take, and it just feels irritating. Is it based on real time? Based on something other than earth clocks? I can't tell.

Also, when stats are used too much, it'd be nice to be told, like, wait until the stat refreshes or go to this place and do this thing, or whatever.

Also, please, please, make chat hideable. It's collapseable, but I basically never use chat so having to scroll past it is a mild annoyance.

My father in law mowed for us last year, but he’s got other stuff going on.

I’m seriously considering hiring out the mowing, but a yard my size would probably be expensive.  I’m a little more confident using the weed eater, but I’m not keen on mowing again.

Generally coffee or drinks, usually in the afternoon. It's got to be some place with people and something ya can leave fairly easily if it's just going awfully!

Last date was in a coffee shop I picked. It was a lot busier than expected, which was annoying. We chatted about work and college (where we'd gone what we got up to) and what we each get up to in our spare time. I thought it was going well for I guess nearly the first hour - she laughed at all my jokes. I thought the conversation flowed and she had plenty to say for herself.

Then at a certain point things changed and she just wanted to get out of there - she didn't say that obvs but that's the vibe I got. This was coming toward the hour and a half mark. Naturally I obliged and ended it as quickly as possible when I got that vibe.

I still have no idea why, which is annoying because she was the pick of my dates so far, she was clever, cute and funny.

I asked her afterwards (online) where it all went wrong and she said she'd had a lovely time, I was a lovely fellow etc. but I just wasn't her type ... or words to that effect.  Clearly though, we can't put too much weight on what she said there, since she was obviously trying to be nice and would probably say something similar even if she actually had a really awful time - I would in her place.

There's a really active, great DnD community on Twitter, and even here on Reddit, there's a pretty good one.

Are you more into fantasy, space, star wars, lovecraft, monsters, etc?

There are so many tabletop role playing games, AKA TTRPG's, that there's a little something for everyone.

I currently have a DnD 5E, dungeons and dragons' fifth edition, game going, as well as starfinder, a space version of Pathfinder, which is like, a sister game to DnD, as well as a Monster of the Week, like Supernatural meets the X Files, crossed with Scooby Doo meets Buffy depending on how your Keeper, that game's version of a Dungeon Master, DM, or Game Master, GM, wants to do it.

There are a bunch of subreddits for it, and quite a few blind and VI players. 2 out of my 3 games have multiple people who are blind or visually impaired, not just me.

The main question I have is how comfortable are you with a screen reader, and would you be willing to try different things if it doesn't work perfectly?

My starfinder sheet, made before the official starfinder sheet went onto Roll20, is a pain to navigate, honestly. But, if I can't do something, my GM is always willing to help.

Also, any GM worth their weight in feces will be willing to help you plot, plan, and map using words instead of images, which is fairly common.

However, should you trust the stranger? Is the stranger a safe guide? Is there any special risk where you are travelling? These are all questions a blind person will be asking themselves whenever offered assistance by a stranger in public.

In most cases getting a stranger's ""help"" isn't quantifiably better than the blind person making their own way. The blind person may be familiar with the route, have good mobility skills, feel safe without assistance, don't want to talk to random weirdos, prefer to use their dog or cane, etc. so generally blind people aren't interested or wanting of guides. 

Before GPS my wife would sometimes ask to the people around her ""Is this 5th and Main?"" for confirmation. Now she may still ask ""Is that the number 12 bus approaching?"" but beyond the cases where she is requesting confirmation she doesn't want or need assistance. In either of the examples the confirmation assists her but certainly can be done without if unavailable.

She has accepted assistance from random people very occasionally for situations like the city has dug up the sidewalk and not coned off the holes and her dog is having a problem finding a path. Happens surprisingly often. Getting through the jam of people at concert at intermission to find the bathroom she has sometimes asked for someone to show here the way.

Have you guys contacted an Orientation and Mobility Instructor to learn how people with vision loss crosses the street? It may be useful to see how that is done, and some of the techniques used to counter veering (or in some cases, reasons to intentionally veer).

To be honest, One of the problems that I'm facing here is that many blind individuals argue that:
1. its embarrassing to walk with a cane.
2. since we don't have sidewalks or any accessible buildings that supports walking with a cane, we don't need it.
3. if we can get a helper, why would we need a cane?

For some eye conditions, an OTT lamp helps people see better (but not for everyone). The OTT bulbs are designed to replicate the frequencies of natural sunlight, so some people can see better. For example, fluorescent lights are not the best lights for many eye conditions, so while the brightness may be the same, the usefulness is reduced.

OTT bulbs can be purchased commercially, but they are noticeably more expensive than regular bulbs. I usually advice trying it out first to see before purchasing.

1. I'd pick somewhere quieter - like the coffee shop was positively bussling!  In fairness that's because it rained, I've been there other times and it's been fairly quiet.

2. I'd make sure we weren't sitting opposite one another, like people at a business meeting! I hadn't thought this through until we were sitting down, at which point there was nothing to be done.

3. I'd make a couple fewer jokes. Not no jokes but fewer and better. That's what nerves will do for you!

4. I'd make sure I wasn't under pressure with work at the time. Again that isn't how I planned it, it just happened that way - if I was doing it over I'd have postponed.

5. Key mistake I'd have and end time. I may be kidding myself but I think if I'd cut out gracefully at an hour I'd have gotten a second date.  Your point that a coffee date lacks a natural end point is well made actually.

Sometimes finding an activity that others can relate to and mastering it.  Or at least heading in that direction.  I'll give an example.  Indoor climbing is a possible physical activity.  Sighted and blind teens may find it cool to do.  I will also include a link to Justin Salas' page.  He is a blind rock climber, photographer who likes to skateboard in his spare time.  Notice I mention some things that are not necessarily associated with blind people.  Teen years are often about asserting independence.  The goal is to balance activities that allows this with risks. 

I will also bring up the prickly topic for teens - sexuality.  Dating and relationships can be difficult for any teen.  Depending on how a blind or partially sighted teen gets along with peers it can be tougher.  Teenagers can be mean.  How to deal with this?  Socializing with other blind teens is part of it.

Sort of hard to know without experiencing someone else's vision. I have trouble knowing how far away traffic lights are and how long it will take to get to them. Most of the lights I deal with have pedestrian timer signals next to them, which I can usually make out the time on, especially now that I've had so much practice reading them at a distance. The ones I'm used to sync with the light, so that the pedestrian countdown is counting down to the instant that the traffic light will turn yellow. I use those to gauge whether I need to worry. If I seem to be at risk of dealing with a yellow, then I make a conscious effort to compare my speed to how far away it seems, and I try harder to figure out how far that is. The relative size of cars closer to the light helps, as does the relative size of the traffic light. Not applicable to you, but it helps me to look at things a little to the left and a little to the right to try to get some input from each eye.

On another note, I find it easier to gauge distances when I'm in traffic with plenty of cars around me. The relative size of cars and distance between them really helps me figure out how far away things are. It's open road that I have more trouble with. Most of the time that's not an issue, I just maintain speed and and stay between the lines. I think it used to cause me to drive faster because I thought faraway objects were much closer than they were, but I monitor the speedometer more now.",,,2,0,0,

[*Young blind man in a sweater, sitting alone in a room with brick walls. Background cello music.*]

**Young man**: It was very new to me when I tried it for the first time. It was like a different world.

[*black screen with white text*] Over 253 million people in the world are visually impaired.

(00:10)  

[*The young man is wearing black virtual reality gloves, waving his hands in front of his face*]

**Young man**: I was thinking - how can I feel in these gloves? How the hell am I supposed to feel something now? Then the vibrations came and it was something I totally didn’t expect.

[*black screen with white text*] Neurodigital presents TOUCHING MASTERPIECES

**Young man**: Art is not always explainable just by words. The element to touch it, and to know, to feel it is missing.

(00:33)  

[*black screen with white text*] A unique VR experience for the blind and visually impaired.

**Young man**: When first touching the virtual statue I was kinda puzzled, like

[*The young man is now wearing a tuxedo and VR gloves. Behind him is a digital rendering of the Venus de Milo. As the young man moves his hands, we see what part of the statue he is “feeling.” He smiles broadly.*]

**Young man’s voice**: It actually works! Yeah, there’s something in front of me that is existing. 

(00:52) 

[*Camera is moving down a museum’s long hallway. A sign says the exhibit is called “Touching Masterpieces.”*]

**Young man’s voice**: Usually when you come to a museum you can’t touch these things, so I can just hear about it from a guide or someone who is with me reading that. That’s not the full experience. 

[*We see the young man in the brick room, then some Braille signage on a museum display about da Vinci’s David*]

**Young man**: It shouldn’t be.

[*black screen with white text*] March 2018, The National Gallery in Prague

(01:08)

[*Close up of many adults putting on virtual reality gloves*]

**Young man’s voice**: The best moment, of course, was when I started to have an idea of, like, what part of the body I’m touching.

[*We see several participants using VR gloves to experience David, Venus de Milo, a bust of Cleopatra. Close ups on various faces - they all look genuinely excited.*]

**Young man’s voice**: Having the art in front of you, and you can explore it and see how much your imagination was right and what you wouldn’t expect. For example about David, like, yeah, I knew this guy would have a big head, but that it’s this big?

[*A VR display shows Venus de Milo. There are red, green, and black marks indicating where a person is “touching” it. A young woman is now speaking to the camera. She is in a museum hall.*]

**Young woman**: I recognized the dress of Venus de Milo, I said, like “This is the dress!” and they said “Yes, alright!” [*laughs, screen fades to black*] 

**Young woman’s voice**: So it was the greatest.

(01:48)  

[*Back to the young man in the brick room*]

**Young man**: The entire experience, this is something that adds this element which was missing before. That you can...see it, really, and know the beauty of the art and touch it.

I don't know a lot about meem culture, although I would like to know more; one issue I see for the kind of project your talking about is that I believe one of the key things about meems is that people create and use thousands of altered versions of meems.

In terms of size, that is dependent on how many people you plan on take. The facility would need a few (fairly standard) things learn.... things like doors, walls, stairs, elevators and escalators. Once indoor travel has been mastered, outdoor travel would usually take place on the streets (sidewalks, areas with clear traffic, street crossings, etc).

The program for training O&amp;M instructors weren't pumping out enough, and a fair number are expecting to retire in the next 5-10 years. Which unfortunately creates a situation, as current projections indicate we will get more people with vision loss in the next few years (the baby boomers are starting to get to the age when many eye conditions start to come up).

You as a person dont have the natural arch/movement to be able to take a  picture that straight on. If you could get something sort of like a sheet music reading stand that would be much better. The way you hold the camera will be synced with the paper I feel much better this way. I wouldn't turn the camera like a portrait I would just keep it the regular way like when you text or receive phone calls. A table top version of the paper holder would be great to be honest. Also have the phone about 10-12 inches away from whatever youre trying to pick up. This is all I could come up with. Good luck though let us know what works best for you. Cheers. ,,,1,0,0,

I was already planning on playing spider and web, so I am excited to hear your praise for it; think I will start that one today if I can. I have not played through many games myself yet, but my wife and I played through three over the weekend, here are my thoughts.

We really liked lost pig. The difficulty was good for beginners, and the length of the game was just right, with a small, manageable number of rooms; also, the main character was kind of endearing.

The Underoos that Ate New York was fun, if very short. I think it would be a good option for people’s very first If game, or, perhaps, a game for children.

Bronze had a pretty rich world, with lots of rooms to explore, although I got pretty board with it, so my wife finished it. It’s a little difficult to play as a blind person because the description of each room did not explain which options you have for moving to another room, IE you can go north, east, or west. This is because the game has a special system that gives you that info at the top of the window and the directions you have not tried yet are in red. NVDA was, for the most part, reading these directions, but since they would just read like, n ne se etc. it was a little harder to keep up with your options, and you can’t know which option is red. This game involves exploring dozens of rooms, so this small disadvantage can be pretty annoying; I guess it’s worth it if you like the world and are willing to be patient.

Although my wife and I have not played it together yet, I think my favorite game, so far, is still Violet, which I played on my own a few years ago.

She needs an IEP immediately, which is a legally binding, and with her visual accuity, she will 100 percent qualify for special ed. services. 

Your school district should contract or have TVIs on staff like me who will then come to the school, do a Functional Vision Assessment and a Learning Media Assessment, and then go from there. 

Step one is bring in eye report. The school will make a referral based on that. You need to be communicating with special education department. If they give you shit, contact the special ed director of the district and complain about the administration at your daughters school.

If you bring up some Right-wing hamckneyed site as your version of the truth, then there is no point in continuing talking to you nor continuing this AMA. 

1. Fine, but many of us like participating in the social sphere and connecting to our peers with the consumption of the same media. This was not only AD for entertainment, but AD for educational and kids channels, slated to expand to more channels for more access to informaation and to lengthen the amount of AD required per month. This was only shut down because it was from Obama's administration, and shelved to assess ""business impacts"" and now it is just going to be forever ignored. It took a long time to get that legislation ready to pass, and they just chucked it because it was from Obama.  

2. I just don't even know where to go with this. So you don't like civil rights? You'd rather be discriminated against for being disabled? You'd rather walk through unsafe buildings and streets and crosswalks? You'd rather live as a second-class citizen without the ability to vote or be heard? You don't want to use technology, the internet, go shopping, eat at restaurants, use ATMs and banks, and ultimately just give up our right to equality and inclusivity?  Really?  You worry about jobs, and 30 percent of blind people are employed due to social programs like the DOR and accessible training through schools provided through ADA, Title 2 and 3 legislation, and you'd be totally fine with doing away with it all making it even harder for blind people to get jobs? You like being discriminated against? 

3. The ACA has issues, but is ultimately the right thing to do for the country. Removing the pre-existing conditions discrimination was a massive step forward in and of itself. Healthcare insurance should not be a business, and the majority of Americans want a single-payer system. Unregulated insurance companies make getting sick dangerous, and being human, we all get sick or get in accidents. Medicare and single-payer drastically alleviates medical bills and controls spending since providers no longer have to mark things up just to get a fraction of the payout from private insurance firms. They want to make a profit and appease shareholders, and don't care about the people who actually need their services to survive.  You'd entrust your health to a private unregulated insurance firm rather than a government run entity with plenty of oversight and mutability via voting? 

4. You don't sound very informed about this issue. The WCAG standards are required by Title 3 and Section 508 law to be followed if a website is run by the government or is a private site doing business with the government. This applies to universities, State entities, etc. Do you not want blind people to be able to use the internet to learn, interact, buy things, and get jobs? The upcoming laws that were trashed by trump were slated to make any brick and mortar store with an online presence have that presence be accessible. This has come from litigation and case law involving Target and other stores and companies. Making things accessible is just the right thing to do. No amount of bootstrapping will conquer inaccessible and unusable websites when trying to get basic info, pay taxes, get postage with the USPS or other logistics carriers, pay bills, access bank accounts, etc. 

If you care about jobs, taking away the ability for a blind person to learn, get transport to and from work, allowing them to get direct deposit and have bank accounts, pay bills, have affordable healthcare, living wages that do not discriminate on disability, and overall just function equally in society,   ,  none of that will help your case. Trump wants and is actively stripping that away from us, so why are you so adamant about making life harder for us all?

UV scrambles DNA in your cellos, which can lead to mutations, this could cause cell death, cancer, all sorts. Our body has an intrinsic ability to correct these mutations but it is not 100% accurate, which is why if you get too much sun exposure you're more likely to develop skin cancer. 

Some people are just genetically more predisposed to sensitivity in photoreceptors. This means that staring at the sun, which emits a lot of concentrated radiation, focused on your retina, can cause a metabolic overload in the cells that are basically working too hard to try and convey to your brain ""whoa there is a lot of light here"". If you keep staring at the sun, the cells tire out and if you have particular genetics this can cause buildup of reactive oxygen species and other molecules which are harmful to cells, causing them to die, if they cannot be removed quickly enough. Unfortunately the retina doesn't have a great deal of regenerative capacity so once enough photoreceptors die you start to lose vision. 

The short answer is, you're probably fine, polarised UV-blocking sunglasses will give you the best protection, and most fldamage is done by looking at the sun for an extended period :) ",,,1,0,0,

Caused by some strange series of events best summed up as birth complications, retinal detachment, sympathy syndrome, scar tissue, uveitis. In that order.
  
The best part, IME, only really applies if the vision loss comes very early, as in near birth. Which is to say, it's kinda horrifying how dependent sighted people are on sight, to the point of being seemingly incapable of imagining how to do something as simple as buckling a seatbelt in the dark. Sight is extremely useful, sure, but there are other senses and I'm glad they were never shoved out of my problem-solving space by the overpowered one.
  
The worst part? Probably the general public. Finding small things that you dropped, the difficulty obtaining books, and not having the option of taking a car all over the county on a whim are runners up. I can get around just fine, most of the time, but the reactions of other people when I do are terribly unpleasant and strongly demotivate me from going anywhere.

The app has issues, but the matching algorithm is quite robust and with some navigation workarounds in the app and the site, it is quite functional. As with all dating, you will only get out of it what you put into it, and it really is like a full-time job. It comes down to how you present yourself, how well you communicate what you are looking for, and if you actually meet people with whom you can share interests. 

Full disclosure, I lost my vision entirely 4 years ago, met someone on OkCupid a few months later using my new VoiceOver and accessibility tech skills, and we are still together today. We are in an open relationship and I seek additional play partners using both OkCupid and Tinder. With Tinder, I just keep swiping right and let the onus on matching go to the women. I am fully open and honest about my relationship and blindness in my profiles, plus my partner and I are linked in OkCupid so anyone can view both our profiles. Tinder has been pretty successful, plus I wrote a fun blog about dating a blind guy and tend to link matches to it if we are clicking and are trying to set up a date. Getting offline ASAP is most helpful so you can assess chemistry and how you click in person. Some women will look past the blindness, others will be curious, it will always be a crapshoot. It's awkward, there will be rejection, but just stay persistent and understand that dating always goes through peaks and lulls and if you give it solid attention, you'll be much more successful. 

Confidence, not making a big show of the blindness and normalizing it and just being yourself will go a long way! So depending on what you are looking for, OkCupid is your best bet for general dating, Tinder is for hookups and play no matter what anyone else tells you. You can try other apps like Plenty of Fish or Coffee Meets Bagel, but OkCupid is the most successful and robust in my dating experience.

I would say one thing that almost every blind student I know struggles with is the bureaucracy/incompetence of DSS offices. I once spent six months arguing to get a textbook I can read, and have spent whole semesters without accessible readings. Yes, there are technically laws in place to stop this, but it happens anyway. I don’t think I’ve ever met another blind student who hasn’t struggled with this in some way. 

I prefer to read things I need to understand well in Braille. I have a Braille display; you can just Google to learn more about those. Socially, I would say I’m introverted. I have leadership positions in two organizations on campus, and I’m president of a pretty well-known group on campus. So I interact with people a lot, and I’ve had to learn to force them to become comfortable with me and my disability. I would definitely say I have a few close friends I prefer to keep to, though. Academically, things are pretty much the same as with sighted students, I just access material definitely. Romantically...I’m a heterosexual woman and have never really been in a serious relationship, but I don’t think that’s blindness so much as me being awkward, haha. 

I love hiking! I generally prefer to have a sighted guide for it, both for the help and also because they can describe things. :) Honestly, I would say the most poignant moments for blind people are the same as for sighted people.

 It's totally OK to _offer_ your arm, or to touch (when relevant) purely to help indicate where you are — _if_ you've made verbal contact first to establish that they want to be interacting with you in the first place.

 To do so, use the _back_ of your hand (_not_ palm) to touch the blind person's forearm. That way we know where you are, how to get hold of your arm, _and_ that you're not going to be the (extremely common) grabby-assaulty type.

 Do _not_ grab a blind person, and especially do not fucking grab their cane. (You wouldn't like it if someone grabbed _you_ by the eyeballs.)

2.  Some people (eg me) prefer to not hold on to sighted guides at all, and just follow by sound. 

 For that, it's helpful if you keep talking, or drag/scuff your feet a bit. It can be quite hard to track a specific person, especially in a noisy environment like a subway station with lots of people.

 In particular, please remember to make sure you're audible if you take a turn, go off to talk to someone, etc. If you leave without indication, the blind person will probably not notice, and get annoyed / confused / disoriented.

 It's also helpful, for sound-based guide, to walk about a step behind and to the side, so you're not in the way of the cane or changes in direction (e.g. to follow a wall). Don't worry about crowds; the white cane is a more effective Moses than you are. :-P

Holding on vs following by sound is definitely a matter of preference though. You can ask, if it's established that someone wants your guidance in the first place. More likely though, the blind person will probably just indicate which they prefer.",,,5,0,0,

Yes, that's really damn stressful.  No idea exactly where I am, or how I'm going to get out of the fix I'm in.  However, any solution that depends on others going far out of there way is never OK.  You did all you should have: you told him how far it was, and pointed him in the right direction. The correct response on his part is to start walking.  Perhaps the person he asks for help at the next crossing will already be headed that way. Or, if not, they may be able to make sure he's still going the right way. And in that way, asking for 30 seconds of help from people we meet, a blind person can pinball our way from sighted person to sighted person back into familiar territory.  ",,,6,0,0,

If you want to assist someone, the easiest way is to offer your arm. They would hold your arm near your elbow, and follow you from that. That way, they can feel where you are going, but they aren't being dragged or pulled off balance. The name of that technique is called Sighted Guide. 

In some cases, people will do sighted guide but still use their cane. That isn't anything insulting, some people just find it more comfortable to scan still.
