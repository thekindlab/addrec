I think some people have an issue with their advertising slogan, which is ""Making Blindness History"". I've had a number of clients complain that their advertising campaign makes it sound like it cures blindness and vision loss of all types, which it doesn't.

One thing I am curious about it, who told you that you don't need to use a cane when using the eSight device? When I was trained as a eSight pre-screener (this was ages ago, when the device was first coming out), we were told specifically to remind clients they still needed to use their canes. Because of the design of the device, it allowed someone to read upcoming signs and identify landmarks. But due to the reduced fields when using it, someone can't see drop offs. That is why the device can be lifted up, so the user can use their existing vision when traveling. I haven't had a chance to try the newer version of the device, but I can't imagine the fields have increased to such a significant degree. Their own FAQ says...

""With eSight’s patented Bioptic Tilt capability, users can be mobile while using the device. They can tilt the eyewear to the precise position that, for them, presents the best view of the video feed, while maximizing their natural peripheral vision (which is often still functional for people with low vision). This, along with imperceptible short latency, ensures that a user’s balance is not disturbed and, hence, no nausea occurs – common problems with immersive technologies such as virtual reality headsets.""

It would normally be the peripheral vision that would detect the drop off. But if they need to use a white cane because the peripheral vision isn't sufficient, then the device wouldn't be able to assist. ",,,2,0,0,

Independent Living Skills Specialists (I believe American usually use the term Rehab workers, rather than ILSs) teach a few different methods for identifying clothes. One common method is to sort out what matches well with each other, and then use a safety pin with beads on the inside to identify. For example, maybe one bead means dark colours, while two beads mean light colours, etc. There are also little braille tags that can be sewn in, or little shaped buttons that can also be used to identify colour in a tactile manner. 

Colour detectors can be useful, but there are some issues with them. They are not always correct (I've had them detect my skin as ranging from green, to blue, to chartreuse). And depending on the lighting, it can change the perceived colour. They also doesn't work so well with a shirt that has multiple colours (such as a Hawaiian shirt).

They are almost militant about it. NFB canes are longer than other canes, and they typically don’t fold. Why should you hide your blindness? Something inherent in this view is discrimination against people who are blind and who have additional disabilities. The NFB typically does not train individuals with cognitive disabilities. I can’t say if that’s intentional or not. 

One main difference in these organizations is that they are either “for the blind” or “of the blind.” An organization for the blind is one that works to do whatever for blind people. The NFB is OF the blind, meaning that most of their directors are blind, and all of their members are blind. No exceptions.

I was born with glaucoma and lost vision in my left eye very early, and since the pressure in my right eye was hard to control I knew that eventually I would go fully blind, however when it started to finally happen nobody was prepared for it, and that includes 3 glaucoma specialists who thought I was lying when I complained about loss of contrast perception, because [apparently it is a common misconception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1298679/) among ophthalmologists that glaucoma affects the peripheral vision first, and since my pressure was fine, my field of view remained unchanged, and both my cornea and lens were clear the only possible explanation was that I was lying.  This lasted until a year later a cataract was diagnosed and immediately blamed for the loss of contrast, and I was advised to do nothing about it until I was completely blind.  Another year later my pressure started to increase, so I had surgery to implant a glaucoma valve which was supposed to free me from medication, though 3 months after the surgery my pressure was already back to its previous levels.  Eventually my contrast perception got so bad that I was having trouble walking on the street , so I decided to have the cataract surgery, which left me seeing everything extremely blurry and didn't restore my contrast perception, leading one of the doctors to finally conclude that it was probably due to optic nerve damage.  Following this I had another surgery to control the pressure because my mother believed that it was still possible to do something about my vision and it actually brought the pressure down but it was already too late.

In my case I wish doctors had been quicker to figure out that my optic nerve was getting damaged and attempted the surgeries as early as possible to avoid blindness, but unfortunately due to the aforementioned misconception coupled with their inability to actually observe the back of my eyes since my pupils don't dilate I ended up going blind.",,,5,0,0,

He learned how to travel with a cane; how to cook, clean, fix things, and keep house using non-visual skills; how to use a computer with a screen reader; Braille; some job and organization skills; and he even learned wood shop skills using non-visual techniques and made a beautiful table that we keep in our home now. He’s now working again and has fully adjusted to blindness. It’s been 15 years since he lost his sight.

51832528-3376-4822-afc5-898738979f7a,1519854742,"Right, so a few random thoughts:

Closed captioning typically refers to the text at the bottom of the screen when characters talk in tv/movies, which is typically not helpful for people unable to read said text.  The term you are looking for is audio description or descriptive audio, which is a narrator who describes the visual details on screen.  For descriptive audio for porn, go check out porn hub, they have a category of examples.  Whether or not descriptive porn is good is up to the individual listener.

I know of blind people who like all the formats of porn, including video, literature, and audio.  Video-based and audio-based porn are pretty similar if the person watching has no vision at all.  If they have some vision, the gratification from video porn is pretty much the same as a sighted person.  For audio-based porn, there’s pretty much no difference between blind and sighted people, since they perceive it in the same ways.  The only type of porn that is completely inaccessible for completely blind people is picture-based porn, since it is inherently visual with no audio.

As for the type of porn that blind people appreciate, that’s like asking the question what type of porn do sighted people like.  The preferences are going to vary based on the individual, and will be just as diverse as any group of people.",,,5,0,0,

I kind of disagree. Reddit can be both accessible and inaccessible. The official app is somewhat useful, but it could be better. The site I heard is combersome to screen readers, and not that great. Both of my friends are efficient windows users great at screen reading. One is a coder, programer, or at least use to be. The other teaches computers and Jaws, or did.

So far we don’t have children, but he does help me take care of my mother who is unable to do a lot of things. He can’t drive, but we live in an area where public transportation and uber allows him to get around pretty well, and he’ll take trips to go take care of my mother and has even gone over to her house to help her get ready and then taken her by taxi to an appointment. He can’t “pick up/drop off” things that are far away at the drop of a dime, but it isn’t much of an obstacle since I drive. I was also raised by a single mother, so anything he “can’t” do doesn’t seem so outlandish for me to figure out, because my mother relied on herself alone throughout my entire upbringing. Children will add an interesting twist, but he has a friend who is completely blind who married a blind woman and they had a child, and while we’re not close enough with them to understand their daily experiences, they are managing with the help of an aide/assistant/nanny. 

Otherwise things are normal, we’re each other’s support systems, friends, lovers, all that great stuff. The ups and downs are typical, but sometimes include personal frustrations with the physical limitation. I’m constantly amazed at what he’s able to do and how his thinking and processing reflects the world without the endless visual stimulation/distraction. He’s able to focus well and learns really well aurally. Those kind of things just amaze me because it shows a different angle on experiencing the world.

I don't use sites that I can't use. lol But I know Twitter has an alternate version of their interface for the blind in their IOS app that works really well. The only issue is when they add new features or changes there can be a slight delay before we get them. Normally I would just want them to modify the existing site but there are certain stylistic choices where you really can't have both so I would say the alternate version should be a last resort. I know Gmail used to have one that I used but they stopped and made their regular interface more accessible. And I agree that the headings and other navigational markers are important too, more for usability than accessibility. There's a difference between really being able to use something and being accessible enough to sort of use it, if that makes any sense. Also, I'm surprised this hasn't been brought up, if you use an image captcha without providing an alternative your completely blocking the blind. This is probably the most frustrating thing. I mostly surf the net on my phone these days and mobile optimized sites are sort of simplified as a byproduct. ",,,2,0,0,

 I've always been an independent person so besides these little things it doesn't really affect our relationship it's just forced us to learn how to communicate and I really appreciate how normal  my blindness is to him.

I still have enough to read massive print, but only in some circumstances (usually with high contrast) for certain periods of time. 

The lights are kind of hard to explain. They're constantly there, darting around and changing colors. They're kind of like semi-opaque semi-translucent moving sprinkles. They're even there when i close my eyes, so i technically havent seen complete darkeness in 4 years. And since they're not real objects that exist in the real world, i can't focus in on them to get a more clear understanding of what they look like myself. 

A lot of what i see is kind of a surprise to me too. Sometimes my brain can fill things in because i can make assumptions about the people and objects surrounding me. For instance- if i see a dark shape in a certain setting at a certain distance, i usually assume its a human. The closer i get to things/people, the clearer they become.

 I normally can't see faces unless i'm uncomfortably close (inches away), but i can often imagine the faces of people that i'm familiar with. Sometimes, my understanding of what a persons face looks like comes from a patchwork of memories of one- off glances where i had the chance to catch a decent look at some of their features. I can't see any of the fine details on people's faces (pores, thin hairs, most blemishes) even when i get close, so i usually just remember the most striking and obvious features. And even at that, i usually forget a lot of what those features look like because that information just isn't important enough for me to remember (unless the person is particularly attractive). 

Strangely enough, i kind of forgot what it feels like to see things in 20/20. I can't imagine seeing an entire clear full image at all. Now, i just picture that episode of spongebob where everyone freaked out after seeing the close-up of the butterfly. I just imagine sighties see everything in a freakishly detailed way like that all the time.

It is best not to wear make up, especially if they have to put drops into your eyes. Some of it can run out, and some of those drops make you tear up as well.

Depending on the cause of vision loss, there may be some treatments for them. But before jumping right to the treatments, take the time to research some of the side effects. You can also always ask for a second opinion, if you aren't confident in that eye doctor. 

If you do have the start of some vision loss, definitely connect to your local rehabilitation agency. Getting training earlier is helpful, even if it turns out you don't need it.

I'm blind, and I'm going to need my lesson materials in an accessible format.  Similarly, ""blind"" to mean ""unable to see"" is not Derogatory, either. Someone can be blinded by the light, or the blinding reflection of the sun off the snow.  Again, that's just a statement of fact.  

However, ""blind"" to mean stupid or ignorant is absolutely derogatory.  But at the same time, we can't police every single word everyone uses. If a sentence like ""blind to the truth"" was in a textbook, I might complain about it.  A textbook should have gone through multiple rounds of editing; someone, at some point, should have noticed the unfortunate association.  In a lecture, though?  ""Blind to the truth"" could also mean that they were literally unable to see the truth, in some fashion.  We could certainly argue that the colonists were culturally unable to visually perceive the truth of what they were looking at.  A cultural or moral disability, as it were, rather than a physical one.  Or it could just be a turn of phrase that your professor used without thinking.

I think this was more of a problem when MUDs were relatively more popular. With 200-300 people on a server at any given time, and with how combat text would spam for everyone in the room, you'd need tons of rooms to keep things clean.

I can absolutely understand where you are coming from. Even though writing code in a text editor is doable, the mainstream IDE tends to quickly prove to be inaccessible. It's a shame as they are meant to provide good UX, convenient functionality; not only to write apps, but to learn programming while doing. What is your top 3 difficulty you run into in most major developer environments? Any killer feature you'd like us to address in the future? At the moment, most of our resources are spent on kicking off IRIS which is for learning and teaching, including descriptions of figures used to teach programming concepts; this would be helpful for programming in the sense that if someone’s programming and is “stuck” with a specific problem that is happening on their screen rather than an overall frustration, they could take a screenshot and upload it to IRIS to get a sighted volunteer to explain what’s going on. However, in the future we might start projects around specific tools to make programming a more inclusive experience. Either developing our own tools, or working with larger providers and communities. At the moment, the only code related consultancy &amp; training job we are working on is creating training material on how to use LaTeX and its workflow to write accessible maths, but that's more of a markup language rather than programming. I'm sorry can't be more specific at the moment, but suggestions are welcome for future reference. Meanwhile, have you heard TDSR, a command line screen reader for Mac? I found it recently and it’s been very helpful to me (fully blind), so thought to share. https://www.grapheel.com/2018/02/19/nanotip-command-line-screen-reader-for-the-vi-geeks/

- monitor arms that I can move forward 
- setting up a TV as a second monitor 
- playing SOME games in black &amp; white

Simulation games I can get on with although at first I had to use the magnification tool on windows before I memorised the layout of the UI.

Strolling into Donkey Bakery and into the café section, I didn’t realise anything extraordinary about the waiting staff. As the waiter followed me with a confident strike, we exchanged niceties. He politely handed me a menu and I quickly chose my order. It wasn’t until I looked up that I noticed the milkiness of his eyes.

Tran Quoc Hoan was born blind. A customer service officer at Donkey Bakery, Hoan is one of the bakery’s first staff members, having started a year after it opened in 2009. His colleague, Nguyen Tuan Huy, who is deaf, brings my food to the table. Below is Hoan’s story.

“I love learning English and working in customer service and that’s why I chose this job, because many foreigners come here. I take their orders by phone, from the website and email. We use a software program with a screen reader.

I was born in Ha Tinh province, in the middle of Vietnam, near Hue. I’ve been blind since birth. I’m the youngest of five children, and my parents are farmers from the countryside. 

I completed a Bachelor of Music at the National Conservatory of Vietnam and play the Đàn bầu, a one-stringed instrument.

For deaf and blind people, the biggest challenge is to find work. Society doesn’t know how to use these people. Many work in organisations for the blind or deaf. The choices are limited. I graduated in 2003 and it took five years to find a job doing administration for a company.

But I wanted to work in customer service. I’d been going to an English club run by foreign volunteers to learn English, and I was a friend with an Australian who worked at a NGO. She knew Luyen (Donkey Bakery co-founder), and she connected me. I successfully applied for a job at Donkey Bakery and started as a phone operator on a part-time basis.

Working at Donkey Bakery has given me more confidence in life. We were given two or three months for training. I never knew about customer service before I worked here.""",,,2,0,0,

Some countries have fairly generous disability assistance, some don't. In some places blind people can access specific employment programmes.

The problem isn't the eye itself, but actually the brain. The patch is forces the brain to use the weaker eye, and improve the connection. The earlier the patching, the better the results. Unfortunately, it isn't always the easiest to pick up, since the kid can compensate with their other eye.

The only eye condition I can think of off the top of my head where there has been minimal research into correcting is myopic degeneration. With our current knowledge, there isn't much to prevent it (it is inherited), and most of the treatment is to fix the retina if it becomes detached. Monitoring the eye condition is the next best thing, and avoid impacts that can cause retinal detachment.

As I've transitioned to focusing on web accessibility, I've starting using NVDA to test the various sites I personally frequent as well as larger well known sites to see how they handle things. I haven't much used the accessibility features on my iPhone yet, but I've been thinking about taking time in my schedule some day soon and only using accessible features on my devices for an entire day. 

I agree with you about just putting in ARIA tags and calling it done. My personal philosophy is to really consider the accessible user experience versus just doing the minimum to pass an ADA scan. It's honestly simple enough to make those considerations as you're in the design phase and building phase of a website.",,,2,0,0,

b73591d8-60c2-48e7-82f1-3403ae8fb8f3,1519264848,"&gt; &gt; I've been thinking of getting in to sales.

It's a lot of fun, and you meet a lot of interesting people, at least with the industry I'm in. I recommend it if you can find a good place to work.

&gt; If you don't mind, I would appreciate more details about your job.

My job has two parts, advertising, and sales. We run a skeleton crew, so everyone pulls double or tripple duty where I work. I get there early, 6:00 AM, 6:30 on my gym days. First, I check and respond to whatever emails may have com in for my directly. Then any leads that were generated that provide phone numbers get split between our sales team, and I take anything that's email only. I do posting on local websites, such as Craigslist, Kijiji, etc. Normally by now the phone is ringing so I'm trying to sell while posting, which I'll typically pause to talk.  If I can't help them, I take their information and email the lead to another salesman or another department.

Typically when people call they have an idea of what they want. Worst case, they know why they need it, and I'll ask questions to find the right style of item for them. From there, I find out how often they'll use it, how long they'll be using it, and what their budget is. Then I walk them through the options I have, including year, make, model, price, and general condition. Once they pick one, we'll walk through options to figure out exactly how it needs to be equipped to work for them.

If they pay cash, take their billing and shipping informaiton, make out an invoice, and email it over with wire instructions.

If they're financing, then find out what style they'll need, and send them the right applications. If they send the applications back, see that they get to the bank. And make sure the bank follows up on their application. Then send the invoice to them both, bank and person.

Once I'm funding, arrange shipping through our typical broker if they're in the mainland US, or through one of a few freight companies if going to Alaska, Hawaii, or out of North America. Canada is my typical broker too.

Sometimes these conversations are quick, and within 10 minutes you can have a guy asking for instruction on wiring you $150,000.

Sometimes they drag on and on, and after exchanging dozens of emails, phone calls, pictures, and finance documents, you'll get a wire from a rip off finance joint for $20,000.

Typical commission equates, roughly, to 1% gross sale before tax.

Honestly, the big fast sales are exciting, but working with a nice older woman from a few states over to find something that will help her and her family keep afloat, even if it takes a month, is a great feeling.

&gt; How you got it, and the qualifications you needed.

It's a family owned operation, and I'm family.

As for qualifications, you don't even need an AA. One of our guys has a GED, one has a high school degree, and I actually have a few college courses under my belt. We don't have a single salesman with more than a year in college, and all get at least $80K yearly, before bonuses and alike.

You obviously need good people skills. Great phone skills, great in person skills, and quick on a computer.

&gt; Also are you low vision or totally blind.

Low vision.

&gt; What accommodations needed to be made. 

I have a large monitor, not as large as at home, but decent sized. It's 22"" or so. Also, whenever another department sends me a lead, it can not be hand written, it needs to be emailed. Most salesman drive their customers, or guide their customers, to our second location to show inventory, but I just pass them off to another salesman, and split the sale with them.

Also, I can't inspect the inventory myself, not easily or reasonably, so I have to have lot boys inspect and be my eyes, which works just fine, as typically other salesman don't have time to inspect.

Anything else? I'm an open book.",,,1,0,0,

Some people feel like they have some handle on the situation if they're using the right words. Some people use humor. I don't think there's a right way. I do get a little bored if people are always pointing out words related to vision, even if it's in a humorous way. Like, ""see you later"" isn't really funny because there's a blind person in the room. But that's just a matter of things being funny or not, and obviously that's pretty subjective. Remember also that you're making jokes in good fun, but that a lot of blind people have been bullied or pushed around and made to feel ashamed. If that's the case, they might not find the same jokes as funny as you do.

For me, I like to see the humor in situations, not in the person. Like, I walked into a glass door the other day, and made a few jokes about birds and that they really need to keep their doors more dirty around here. Or I was telling people the other day that Voiceover always reads the word Friends before every Facebook post (I think it's to tell you who the post's audience is, because once in a while it's ""Everyone."")
