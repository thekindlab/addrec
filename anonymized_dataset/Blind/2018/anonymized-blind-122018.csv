1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1543686803,"Braille Screen Input has nothing to do with a braille display. It is literally what it sounds like, entering braille using your screen. You enable it in the rotor options, then any time you are on an active text field,  you can quickly switch to Braille Screen Input. A special keyboard appears on the screen with 6 keys, and you can either type on them with your phone flat on a surface using a standard brailler layout, or you hold your phone in Landscape mode with the screen facing away from you. Bracing the phone in your hands with your palms, pinkies, and thumbs, you are then free to curl your remaining 6 fingers inwards onto the screen to start typing braille characters. iOS interprets multiple forms of braille, a right swipe with a single finger types a space, a left swipe deletes a character. A 2-finger swipe left deletes a whole word, a swipe right is like pressing Return, so it either makes a new line or presses the Send/return key depending on your situation. In kik, for example, I can type a message and immediately swipe right with two fingers to send it to the chat rather than hunting for the Send button on the screen. 

A 3-finger swipe right or left toggles the braille entry mode from 6-dot to contracted, and a 3-finger swipe up and down toggles screen orientation lock so you don't accidentally jump into table mode when moving around in screen-away mode. 

Plus, it looks pretty interesting to people who have no idea what you are doing when using Braille Screen Input, and they are all blown away when I explain and demonstrate it. This, Actions like mentioned in the comment above, and well-designed features like Magic Tap that can be enabled by developers are very important to know and understand for a fully comprehensive comparison, not to mention that all standard Apple library controls when building apps in Xcode are inherently accessible. A developer doesn't have to do much work to make their apps accessible if they are just using standard controls, whereas getting accessibility up and running in Android is a nightmare and the bane of Android development for all the devs I work with daily. Not important to overall usage comparisons, but the ease of fixing accessibility issues is much better in iOS so when the developer is notified and puts some effort into remediation, iOS apps will be fixed much much sooner than Android apps when they are inaccessible.

Tactile markers such as these can be felt, but low enough a wheelchair can go over it (although you'd have to have it more continuous). The picture also showed a version that has LED lights built into it, but that may be a bit difficult to construct.

One thing I should mention about those tactile marks on the floor is that while wheelchairs can go over them, they can also be a tripping hazard for people using a support cane who can't lift their legs up high enough. I actually know a facility who is ripping that kind of tiles out because they were having serious issues with people tripping on them.

If you are given a lot of latitude and area, a design that is more squareish/has right angles may also be easier to navigate than one that is all curved. Curves are harder to tell how much someone has turned, as opposed to right angles. 

I think you can also make a labyrinth that has a separate entrance and exit, rather than locating the middle and turning around. One of my clients did that kind before, but she has more vision than most of my clients.

My son has RP. In his case, it is autosomal recessive. It doesn't ""run in our family"" but my husband and I both have the recessive gene. In our case, we have a 25% chance of any of our children, boy or girl, having RP.

I was told I couldn't have any more children because of a medical condition I have before we received his RP diagnosis at age 4, even though I wanted another baby. So DH got the big snip. But even if I could have another biological child, I wouldn't let the risk of 25% risk of RP stop me from having another baby with my husband. My RP son, 7, is legally blind and is a rock star at Braille. He won 3rd place in his state's Braille Challenge this year in his division. He's also getting really good with his cane. He doesn't let RP stop him!

Blindness may be a lift altering condition, but it is not a life limiting disease. It's also a condition that can be adapted to. If DH and I had a 25% risk for some other condition that shortened our future children's lifespans or put them in physical pain, we'd likely have a different outlook and adopt instead.

The thing is, as the blind person, it’s not my responsibility to keep idiots from tripping over my cane. *I’m* the one who can’t see. 

I do my best to stay on the proper side of the sidewalk, etc, but when it comes down to it, I’m not responsible for their ankles getting tapped by accident if they’re not paying attention to the *long white cane* that practically glows in the dark and stands out for the sighted to see from yards/meters away. I’m also not responsible if they don’t move out of the way and crash right into them. Sure, I have some usable vision, but I can’t always see people, or even people-shapes until they’re a foot or two in front of me, and if I’m walking, already moving, that’s too late if they haven’t noticed me, my cane, its movement as I swing it, or the tapping sound it makes as I approach. 

I always apologize when I bump into someone, because I try to be polite, but it’s still on the other person. 

I’ve also been sweared at more times than I can count when I bump into someone, and I think that’s just unfair. They usually slink away without an apology once they realize I’m blind. Like disappearing will make up for yelling at the blind person they were too self-absorbed to notice... 

I’m sorry if this turned into a bit of a rant. I hate when sighted people do dangerous things like vault over my cane while they’re running for the train. It could end badly in so many ways, and it’s scary.

De Leon isn’t the only one who loved it. Last month, pop singer Bea Miller called it the “purest thing ever” to her more than 800,000 Twitter followers.

Note: I Can’t cut and paste twitter posts from my phone. 

And her followers, some of them also volunteers, responded:

Plenty of other people have taken to social media to say that answering a quick call to help a blind person is “so awesome.”



It’s the most popular time of year for giving, but some people shy away from pledging their time to help others because they feel overwhelmed in a flurry of holiday gift-buying and travel. Yet interacting with people while volunteering is the most emotionally rewarding way to give, according to Ashley Whillans, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies how people navigate trade-offs between time and money.


“If you give time away, you actually feel like you have more of it,” Whillans said, explaining that we often are not as busy as we think we are.

The Be My Eyes app has attracted more than 100,000 visually impaired users since a Denmark-based team launched the app in early 2015. When one of those users makes a call for help on his iPhone or Android device, 10 randomly selected volunteers get alerts on their own phones.

The first person to answer sees a video image of the blind user’s environment and tries to help resolve their issue. A volunteer may read the label on a soup can, look around a caller’s house for a missing object or do one of hundreds of other tasks that can be difficult for people with impaired vision.


“Sometimes it’s a quick fix, other times it’s a longer conversation of what’s life like where you are,” said Christian Erfurt, the chief executive of Be My Eyes. “That reminds us that we’re not that different, and the gap between ‘us and them’ is minimized.”

People who are visually impaired can use accessibility features to make calls from smartphones. The software uses speech and touch to communicate with users. Some phones also offer increased text sizes or color contrast to help people with low vision.

In the two years that she has used Be My Eyes, Alaina Walker has made more than 10 calls for help. Although she said she most often uses the app for guidance matching her outfits, she has also called volunteers for help determining if her oven was on and navigating from a bus stop to a nearby dollar store.


Walker, who is visually impaired, said she gets excited when she connects with a volunteer from her state of Alabama or from a different country.

“What I think is cool about it is it’s anonymous,” said Walker, a 43-year-old makeup saleswoman. “Some people are so self-conscious about asking for help.”

Be My Eyes doesn’t do background checks on its users or volunteers, although rules of conduct and respect are published on the app’s website. The company gives everyone “the benefit of the doubt,” Erfurt said, and bans people if someone reports their behavior as abusive more than once. Erfurt said the company relies on the assumption that the app’s users will see any inappropriate behavior as simply bad apples.

ADVERTISEMENT

That proved true for Pittsburgh-based volunteer Jacqui Giordano. When a caller once asked for her phone number, she said, she declined and assumed the uncomfortable experience was an anomaly.

Giordano’s second call through Be My Eyes was far more successful. Several family-related issues had left her crying before work one morning in August when a visually impaired user called to ask for help matching a pair of colored jeans to a shirt and scarf. The call was no more than 15 minutes, but Giordano said she probably would never forget it.

“It came at the right moment, because there were struggles going on in my life, and I thought, ‘There is still good in this world,’” said Because I know they’re only a phone call away.

**Contact Lenses that Respond to Light
UV-responsive dyes embedded in contact lenses can quickly adapt.**

**Sunglasses that darken automatically in response to bright sunlight have been available for eyeglasses for 40 years. But adapting this flexibility to contact lenses has proven challenging. Now researchers in Singapore have developed UV-responsive, or photochromic, lenses that darken when exposed to ultraviolet light, protecting the eyes against the sun’s damaging rays, and return to normal in UV’s absence.**

**Seeing the light: A new contact lens technology responds to UV light. The key is a novel polymer laced with an intricate network of nano-sized tunnels that can be filled with dyes. Initial studies have shown that the technology performs faster than the light-sensitive sunglasses on the market today, says Jackie Ying, director of the Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN) in Singapore, and developer of the lenses. The research is part of a broader effort at IBN to develop new materials for contact lenses that can dispense drugs and diagnose diseases.**

**Conventional light-responsive sunglasses are coated with millions of molecules of photochromic dyes, which are transparent when out of the sun. These molecules change shape when UV light hits, enabling them to absorb UV light and triggering the darkening of the lens. When UV light disappears, the molecules change back to their original shape and transparent appearance.**

**Few previous attempts have been made to design light-responsive contact lenses, largely because it’s difficult to apply dye coatings uniformly to the delicate, soft surface of a contact lens. Ying and her colleagues got around this by developing a contact lens that embeds dyes uniformly throughout the material.**

**This approach allowed them to pack more dye molecules into the material, Ying says, giving the contact lens greater sensitivity to light and thus a faster response.
Researchers created the spongy nanostructure material by mixing specific combinations of water, an oil solution with monomers commonly used in contact lenses, and a novel surfactant–a compound that encourages mixing between water and oil solutions.**

**The resulting material is studded with tiny pores and tunnels, which can be loaded with agents such as UV-sensitive dyes. The lens material’s porous structure provides a flexible environment for dyes to transform from dark to light and back again, says Edwin Chow, team leader and senior research scientist at IBN. “If the polymer is too rigid, the dye is stuck and can’t transform,” says Chow. “This pore structure and polymer happens to give the best environment for dyes to react quickly.”-**

**Speed performance is crucial for photochromic eyewear, particularly for adjusting from high to low levels of light. “When your car suddenly goes into a tunnel, the amount of light is very dim, so you need your lenses to transform back immediately,” says Chow. While this can take minutes with sunglasses, he says, “Our response time is 10 to 20 seconds.” The team is getting ready to test the photochromic contact lenses in animals. The researchers have already tested the lens material, without dyes, on rabbits, and have determined that it is biocompatible. Ying says the main concern in animal tests is to see whether the dyes are successfully contained within the lenses, or if they leak out.**

**In addition, researchers will work to focus the dyes so that they cover only the corneal region of the eye, to block out the most UV light. The lenses now have dyes distributed throughout, and would darken a wearer’s entire iris–a potentially unsettling effect.**

**The institute has created a spin-off, iNano Pte Ltd., to commercialize the technology. It will initially target markets in Japan and Korea. Ying estimates that photochromic contact lenses will be commercially available within a year.**

**Jan Bergmanson, director of the Texas Eye Research and Technology Center in Houston, says athletes may benefit the most from such contact lenses. “If you are a tennis player, and you perspire a lot, perspiration on sunglasses may be a distraction,” he says. “If you had [photochromic] contact lenses, you wouldn’t have to deal with this dilemma. So this may have a market as a sporty lens.”-**

**In the meantime, Ying is exploring other applications for the photochromic material, for instance as UV-sensitive tinting for windows and windshields, or as a cheaper coating alternative for sunglasses.**

He would try to explain himself and what he needed the dog for,  but there were no laws about it then. So he would finally leave and tie the dog up outside,  then come back inside purposely knock over all the tables and chairs on the way back to his seat. It won't feel good to get your friend access at first because it feels like you are breaking rules,  but really you'll be breaking down barriers.  ",,,6,0,0,

If you were thinking about how to get there, would you imagine the shapes of the streets and how different buildings are related to each other, or is it more ""Turn left here, turn right there.""

It's somewhere in the middle. It's not like a map at scale with the detail and the distances, but there are definitely directions and angles involved in the way I think about it. Like say I get out of the door, turn 90 left, walk for  a while, cross a road, further, then turn 90 right, walk for a while and then turn 90 left. I will have this sort of notion of a line to the left, cut by the road, further line to the left, and a 90 degree angle of it, but the distances in my mind won't be anywhere accurate.

For me this depends. If the routes have enough in common or if I know the areas in between etc I can integrate them at some point, but sometimes yes sometimes no. Depends on the amount of stuff there is that isn't shared between the routes.

Some PWD need accommodations from birth and don't get them.  Those who get to college level are well aware of these barriers and have some skills at getting around at least enough of them to succeed as much as they have.   

It is my experience that as much as tech might create or fix an obstacle, my biggest and most insurmountable barrier has forever been people.   Those on positions of power to provide supports, facilitate participation or require changes that facilitate that participation are the always the ones whose attitudes make or break a situation.

Ex: I was one of the first mainstreamed VI kids in my pss.  The same woman who made that program, got some of us to camp for b/vi kids for years.   The bad side?   She controlled access to the library. (I was banned for a couple years because she felt I'd read everything accessible.) She decided what classes we could take (No art  for any of us but advanced sciences and career oriented courses were off the table, too.)   She also redistricted us to schools of her choosing.    (She was single handedly responsible for the best thing in my childhood - camp AND facilitated daily sexual assaults, bullying and relentless abuse at the hands of teachers, peers and other kids in the program.). 

This same woman pioneered all things braille for our pss.  She retired nearly two decades ago and as far as I know, still is the spearhead of new tech for braille transliteration of all HS math course materials from her home office.    She doesn't have the power she once had, but she can still decide whether a student has free access to a class via materials.  

 She's taught her secrets to others, for sure but they're less willing to do the work so a student actually used to have a better chance if she says 'yes' than if another teacher had to do the work.   She may have died by now.   Her good qualities were a blessing but she was human and a mess and we paid very well for her gifts.

So it is at every stage of our lives.  College fir me was just as mixed.  I had yo find my own enlargement service for my Russian materials but the math dept did their own magic.  The ODS chief forbade biology classes so most of us didn't even try as her interference meant out of pocket readers, notetakers, labs assistants and proctors.   She controlled find disbursements.    

Pick your battles. Persevere. Leave an easier toad for the next guy.  This is our plan for success.

Glaucoma on the other hand is trickier than that, i think that if i ever have it, i might have either normal-tension glaucoma (normal pressures but nerve still gets damaged) or open-angle glaucoma (classic glaucoma - comes in 2 types - age-related and juvenile for people before 35).

I just endlessly calculate it's progression rates, hoping that it would take at least 40-45 years with full and diligent treatment to go fully blind from it (i think it's highly likely in the time we live in), because idk anymore, some people say that it progresses very slowly, especially in juvenile cases, some people, on the other hand, say that it can progress rapidly (but then again there is trabeculectomy for such cases).

I just worry that there will be no actual possibilities just like today for disabled people in 20-30 years (but something must get better, right?There are already freelance jobs that can be done from any part of the world, imagine what will be in 20-30 years from now on!)

As much as blind people can (and do) have wonderful lives, who the hell would willingly put their children through this?

If my parents had made the choice to have children, knowing that they carried RP and did not consider the implications, I would be furious.

If this couple can prevent another person from getting this disease, then they should.

E.g. nobody's going to say on a form that grabbing someone on the arm is a good thing, though of course we experience that all the time.

I can only catch that kind of over-correction by having the questions go both ways, or if it gets at things that a sighted person actively trying to empathize in a nice way, without actually understanding, simply would never realize (and would answer the opposite way).

I’m not a doctor, but I’ve seen a few clients with trauma induced vision loss. It sounds like you were hot hard enough to detach your retina. If the doctors didn’t detect that early enough, it’s likely that the retina malnourished and died, leaving you a blind spot. Unfortunately, that was in your macula which is responsible for fine detail vision. Once the retina dies, it does not come back. 

It is strange that you are now experiencing issues in your other eye. It could have something to do with the optic nerve, the retina in that eye, or the visual cortex of the brain itself. It could be that there was a micro tear in that retina and it is now progressing. The brain is a really powerful thing. I’ve read stories of people growing up and losing their vision slowly, and not even realizing it until they cause some sort of accident that warrants a doctor’s attention. The good news is that you’ve identified the issue now. The sooner you can get medical attention the better. I know the holidays complicate that...

Also good news: if you find that print is difficult to read, there are free services out there for audio books, like the National Library Service. There is free software that will help you use your phone and computer by enlarging the screen or by using audio. Also, every state has a department dedicated to rehabilitation services for the blind and visually impaired. If you need help connecting to them, I would like to help.

I have albinism and therefore am photophobic and my acuity varies wildly depending on lighting. 

Take the following with a grain of salt because everyone is different 

The pros :
- you can add sunglasses on top of them 
- you can choose the tint you want (there aren’t a ton of options, but there are a few gradients) 
- they are pretty effective in situations with fluorescent lighting
- better acuity - I can read a  line Lower than with regular contacts (not the whole thing but a good chunk of it) (like from line 2 to 3) 
- good in snowy, reflective environments 

The cons: 
- they are thicker than regular contact lenses (or at least that’s how they feel to me). It takes a little while for me to get used to then when I pop them in, but afterwards it’s fine.
- I have yearly contacts. The closer I get to the end of the year, the less comfy they get and the less I will wear them
- my main issue with them is that I’ve had multiple pairs and after a while I have trouble focusing with them . Probably an issue with how they fit me personally.
- the ones I have make me look creepy. 
- not great at night, unless I am going to a concert. Makes the bright lights less annoying. 

That said, if you are photophobic or light sensitive, they are definitely worth a try.

My sight loss began in August 2016 and I was declared legally blind a few months later.  My experience sounds very similar to yours.  I have pretty much no usable vision in my left eye (I see light and color, but basically no detail) and I have blind spots and intense visual snow in my right eye.  I see static of multiple colors, along with random flashes of various colors (yay, fireworks I guess?!?). I even see the static with my eyes closed.  I also have pretty much zero vision in low light.  I no longer drive and can’t read much other than digitally magnified text.

If you haven’t seen a low vision specialist, you should.  They can recommend assistive technology and set you up with orientation and mobility training.  Luckily, I have enough usable vision that I can navigate by sight (mostly), but I’ve ran into people and things much like you describe and it is embarrassing.  I use a signal cane in crowded environments, not so much to navigate, but to communicate my partial sightedness to others.  

My opthalmologist is a researcher and is plugged into the research community internationally.  He is fairly confident that there will eventually be a treatment for optic nerve damage.

Some of her best friends are autistic, which works out really well because they understand what its like to need a little space or a little more time to process stuff.   


I remember Jae started walking kind of late, and I wanted to find out exactly when so I took a trip through my digital memory lane and the first videos I have of her walking on her own are when she was about 18 months. She also totally skipped crawling. I think some VI kids have a hard time giving up the sort of... stability of being able to feel what's in front of them, like they can with a walker, with a walker, or clinging onto furniture they have a lot more feedback about what's there.

Currently, my workflow is to use the SSH client in the Windows version of Git to manage everything remotely, even VMs on the same host I'm working on. As someone else mentioned, there is a Linux graphical screen reader, Orca, but the quality is not great. It takes very little to cause it to go nuts and either freeze or behave unpredictably, it can be pretty laggy/unresponsive, and just feels really buggy in general. There are also really annoying issues with how it interacts with every GUI terminal emulator I've tried. There is a kernel-space console screen reader called speakup that I can use in a pinch and which works reasonably well, but it's old and I think rarely gets updated (there was an issue two years or so ago where reading by word would cause a kernel panic, so yeah, you get the idea) and I frankly hate to listen to ESpeak (the only practical voice synthesizer option) for long periods of time, like it physically gives me a headache. I apologize for all the negativity, but those are the reasons I use Windows as my desktop OS; NVDA is where it's at for screen readers. As concerns large amounts of text, I either do what you mentioned and output to a file and use grep, or sometimes pipe it to less so I can scroll by page that way, since regular console scrolling is just awkward for me; could be that I'm doing something wrong there. For cases where I need to watch output in realtime it gets trickier; I generally turn off the ""caret moves review cursor"" and sometimes ""report dynamic content changes"" settings off so I can keep focus on what I'm examining and not get interrupted by new lines, and speed up speech to the limit of what I can understand (or sometimes beyond, if I don't need to know precisely what I'm looking at) in order to try and keep up with it as best I can. Probably still don't have the flexibility I would with vision, but it works okay. I'm unsure what I might need to change when I work with Linux in a professional setting; ncurses-based applications where the screen reader needs to follow the highlight are a particularly annoying problem. Sorry for the wall of text and that I'm late seeing this, but I hope you found something in here interesting.",,,2,0,0,

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried the built-in Windows 10 mail app, but it has a very odd conversation view, and I don't understand why some messages don't get marked as read when I've looked at them. Chrome is good, except that I don't like the lack of a good reader mode, and Firefox is a little more configurable. Having said that, web apps like Reddit, are a little bit more accessible in chrome. I usually just use firefox though, and work around that, because it renders most things a little better and eats less resources, even on a very fast system. I also find that Google's AI poorly predicts what I want, so I use DuckDuckGo for search, which is more convenient in Firefox because I don't need an extension. But the speed boost from Chrome is nice sometimes. I'd consider getting JAWS, as I heard that having multiple screen readers can sometimes help, but I'm not sure it's worth the $1500 price tag, plus yearly upgrade.s. I'd get it for braille features, possibly, if NVDA is lacking something that JAWS has for braille, but I Haven't seen that so far. The Braille Extender add-on seems to have most features I'd need, but I think JAWS might possibly have better translation tables, I'm not sure. You might get her to install the Windows 10 app essentials NVDA add-on as well, as that adds some better UIA automation code, and causes certain Windows controls to read better.",,,2,0,0,

You  would need 2 dice that are carved/engraved so that you can feel the numbers by touch, should be easy to find, or if you can't then you can just use some dice roller app on your phone that will speak out the rolls. Because color is the only thing separating the playing pieces, you can just replace one player's pieces with coins or something similar so that they can be distinguished by touch.

Is there any chance you can get a third, sighted person to join you? If yes, then perhaps you can check out **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective**, it is a story driven game where the players are trying to figure out who has committed a crime. The sighted person will be required to do the reading of the text and clues, but you as the blind players will help him with theories, bounce ideas and discuss facts. The game can be a bit long though, 2-3 hours per case. There are 10 cases in thte base game.

At 3 player, you could play a simple auction game called **No Thanks!**. The deck of cards has nubmered cards from 3 to 35, and each player starts with a set amount of chips. Technically this can be played by a fully blind group with some adjustments, as there is no hidden information in the game. You would just need to mark the numbered cards so that one person can announce which card is currently revealed on the table.

&gt; YTA

&gt; I am totally blind, and naturally have a bunch of friends and acquaintances who are blind all over the world. Most of them are incredibly smart and talented,
and they are not ""deprived of all the joys that life has to offer""

&gt; I am just a few months away from getting my engineering degree abroad, and I am neither first nor the last blind to do that. Just in my close circle, my
peers have either graduated or about to graduate from majors like law, psychology, statistics, mathematics, international relations, music and so on. They
are all living successful lives. Some of them have been to dozens of countries and had many incredible experiences that life has to offer.

&gt; Just like an average Joe, a blind person can make the best of life if they want to. And just like an average Joe, they could suck at life too. It has nothing
to do with the blindness.  
&gt; Please don't feel insulted, but Considering that your wife, the person whom you intend to spend the rest of your life with, has such a condition in her
family, I don't think it is too wrong for anyone to expect you to have at least some degree of decency to research and be informed about blindness in general
before having such ignorant opinions.

His RP is on the X gene. Any male child I have with him will NOT carry the gene since they will get their X from me. Any female child we have will be carriers but not present symptoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this was a long way to say, if you're worried, get genetically tested and understand the odds and what they mean for future generations. He had this information always available to me and was honest about it VERY early in our relationship.",,,1,0,0,

The alert flashed across the screen of Christina De Leon’s iPhone on a recent morning: “Someone needs your help.”

De Leon, 36, answered the video call and saw a middle-aged blind man on the other end who said he needed help finding one of his dining room chairs.

It was the fourth call from a visually impaired person that De Leon got through the smartphone app Be My Eyes, but it was the first one she had been able to answer. She was nervous.

“I didn’t want to mess up or anything,” said De Leon, a photographer who lives in Fresno, Calif. “But I loved it.”

She was able to guide him to his chair. He thanked her, and they both hung up.

The free app connects visually impaired people with sighted volunteers for help with daily tasks, such as matching an outfit or picking out the right spice.

Dad was an ophthalmologist and his colleagues recommended not making me feel like I had a disability. Let me do what I wanted even if I was going to fail or lightly hurt myself. Kids tend to hurt themselves... I had multiple bruises on a weekly basis. 

Learned a martial art. Judo is good for someone who is VI or blind because it’s a close body sport. I can’t stress sports enough. They give you confidence and a feeling of independence and achievement. If there is VI/Blind tennis in your area, give it a go. Or order sound balls and play with your kid. 

There are some things I wish my parents had taught me, but I didn’t live in a country where it with OTs etc . 

Watch your kid’s posture. Face in food isn’t attractive on anyone. At 2, it’s probably just about coordination, but later, once they have the coordination down, gently remind them sit up straight etc. (Obviously it depends on how much vision your kid has). 

Teach them to make eye contact. I do it, but sometimes I do tend to forget mostly because it’s easier to focus if I’m not looking at someone. Eye contact goes a long way in making others feel comfortable around you.  

Let your kid take “safe” risks. Teach him or her all the regular skills you need to be independent. Let them ask for help, but their disability doesn’t need to be a crutch. 

My suggestions probably don’t work for everyone, but they did for me. 

I didn’t know I couldn’t drive until I was 18.... kind of shitty but it also meant that I didn’t put any barriers on what I could do until I was an adult. 

But I also didn’t know what accommodations I needed until a few years into university. I regretted not using a note taker for example. 

Your kid will be fine. Some things might take longer to learn, but don’t stress to much about it either. Use the assistance you have available and teach your kid to respectfully but sternly advocate for himself. 

I apologize, this isn’t a particularly well structured response. DM if you have any questions. 

Edit: teach your kid to ask for help when needed. It can take a while to recognize what accommodations you need because you don’t have anything to compare it to. For example, I only recently started to ask people to switch seats with me so that I wouldn’t have the glare in my face.

You would need to get evaluated for your visual field loss by a specialist. 

One thing to think about is this: you can be the safest driver out there. Even if you remove all the “idiots” from the road, accidents happen. A friend of mine lost all but a small amount of peripheral vision. She had the same attitude toward riding her bike. She figured that people would see her and get out of her way.

700090be-0b1d-41a2-927a-70652ac5a575,1543849701,"There's sort of an all-or-nothing perception I've noticed where technology is concerned. Sighted people seem to think either that we can't use computers at all, or we can use and read everything, including blurry screenshots or scans, CAPCHAs, etc. I've twice told website supports that I can't get past a CAPCHA because I'm blind (I used the words ""I'M blind""), and was told to just load a different image.

(I still do not understand the screenshots of text thing. What software feature made that so prevalent compared to copy-and-paste in the first place?)

It's kinda hard to think of false negatives, really, other than what you listed such as signs and branches. I suppose there are things like knowing when someone's talking to you, instead of just in your general direction (this is especially troublesome if they're on a phone, since then there might not be anyone else around they could plausibly be talking to), dealing with noisy environments where all the useful sounds are being drowned, or the thing where proper cane use makes it almost mandatory to walk in single file (and holycrap is finding the back of lines not troublesome when they aren't effectively organized). I've been kinda bothered when guided before, even when I felt like it was welcome in general, just because of how many times the person would, presumably unintentionally, basically grab my hand with their elbow, such that I couldn't non-rudely pull it back far enough to not be caught in a tight space between an arm and a breast. Also dropping tiny things is horrible. Nuts, cereal, chocolate chips, bits of those Granola bars that fall off the instant you open the package (usually chocolate chips or nuts); 2 seconds by sight, possibly minutes by touch if they tumbled and bounced sufficiently, or you were moving at the time.

The other direction is more common and more stressful, generally. It's OK for the cane to hit non-fragile furniture; that is its whole purpose. You vastly overestimate how likely walking in the gutter is to result in getting hit by a car (what with most cars not driving in the gutter). If I made it to within half a block of the destination, and am asking for directions, perhaps consider that I didn't just magically appear in front of you so as to be rescued by the hand, and did, in fact, make it the entire rest of the journey single-handed. No, I don't need a wheelchair, or a ride in a stranger's car. My legs are not the part that's broken. Stairs are not comparable to interstates in terms of fear-factor. Moving furniture around is less big a deal than reorganizing my kitchen (do not reorganize my kitchen, and the bedroom is right out).

Some things like this—but mostly inside jokes—come up on the Twitter / Facebook feeds of ""The Blind Onion"" (@blonion). They've been inactive for a while, but there's a vast archive to pick from. A lot of it is cultural tropes or references to companies and organizations, but there are some gems in there, also.

(Which reminds me: cost. I was shocked when I discovered that printers go for about the price of a new cane, two or three orders of magnitude cheaper than embossers. Same difference for books, slates styli and Perkins Braillers compared to pen and paper, tactile graphics, etc. And books. I'd rather read more in Braille than audio, but it's just plain impractical most of the time - either price, availability, or the Braille version taking up multiple shelves, and no refreshable Braille device comes anywhere close to a Kindle in terms of experience (might as well try reading a novel on a 1990s calculator). Add to that the inability of these products to take advantage of mass production, the reliance on government assistance distorting the market, the way that innovations vary in terms of both quality and speed depending on how involved blind people are and how much funding there is, etc. There's no good reason Braille couldn't have been invented 5,000 years ago, but it's actually younger than the USA, and UEB-only education is rendering the overwhelming majority of Braille books needlessly confusing for new readers, for all that it's better for Twitter and programming. If not for TTS and GPS, I'd question whether blindtech is out of the 19th century.)",,,3,0,0,

On one hand, my parents did what they could to give me chances to experience things: they got me to take music lessons, for example, or some martial arts (the music stuck, the martial arts didn't, but it was worth a shot and I'm glad I at least tried it). Just as important, though not at the age of two of course, they allowed me to take risks and got out of the way. Not that they wouldn't care or help me if I asked, most of the time at least, but they were willing to let me make my own choices, sometimes hurting myself in the process (unfortunately this is probably an inevitable part of learning). So I would go on my own to the park after a certain age, make friends as I could, etc. At 16 I got a scholarship to go to study abroad, and this was very very hard for them, but they let me do it.

The balance between being overprotective and neglectful is important, though it's not like there's only one way to do this right. Children vary as well about their own need for autonomy as they grow up. My personal feeling is that most parents (of blind or sighted children alike) are erring on the side of too much protection/control, but then I don't have a child so what do I know? It just seems to me that children were a lot more independent 25 years ago or so when I was one, than now.

I do something similar, but I have some vision, so I still use images, just *my* images rather than the true picture, if that makes sense. I have certain distinct features on people and places that act as identifying markers. A lot of it too is memorizing paths rather than places, so I can tell you how to get to another building based on my path, but not tell you what it looks like. 

With people’s faces, my brain fills in gaps, so it’s strange how often I forget their “true” face until they get close to me, esp with professors. 

Supermarkets and stuff are similar to campus- the Target near me recently completely remodeled and it fucked me up so much!!

I have never been able to keep track of overarching directions (like driving). I do notice landmarks that let me know I’m about to be where I’m headed, but that’s it. 

Mental maps are absolutely exhausting to keep up with, so I only bother remembering “important” faces- the people on either side of me in class, my profs (if I like them), my friends, family, and the children I babysit (moreso than their parents). Places are easier because they so rarely change, but they’re still a huge pain in the ass.

Sighted people so rarely understand that these maps take so much thought and memory, and often when you would be focused on an activity or task, we would be torn between cross-referencing mental maps and the actual task/activity at hand. That’s why accommodations matter- they free up brain space that we shouldn’t have to lose to things like this, we should be using that space to do the same things our peers are. ",,,8,0,0,

Newer, tall office buildings have elevators that don't have the floor buttons inside anymore, but they have a touchscreen security panel that displays the floors you can access when you scan your card in. While they do have an ""accessible"" feature built in, it is virtually useless when it is busy (which is most of the time). For example, my client scans in her card, and it starts reading the available floors (10 possible floors, out of 50). But it takes roughly 10 seconds to read them out... by which time, someone else has hit a button and that floor gets selection, which is most likely not her floor. An actual, accessible means of selecting the floor in a realistic use scenario would be amazing.

And on a related note, a method of locating an arriving elevator when you have a bank of 8, or 10, or 12 elevators. They make a sound when they arrive, but with a large number of elevators, it takes time (which you won't realistically have) to locate, especially when you have to factor in two different sides. And, related to the first problem, if it is the wrong elevator, then it would take you to the wrong floor (because of the security pass issue).

* As mentioned by other transparency is a big one. No one really thinks about it too much so of course no one explained the concept to her.

* Clapping was a surprising one. No one really thinks about how you clap. You see others and you copy them. Her parents explaination of clapping was basically ""slap your hands together"". It makes for slightly painful and awkward looking applause.

* Farts. Slightly embarrassing but she'll lift a butt cheek to let out a fart and was completely certain that the slight movement would be unnoticeable. To everyone else its an exaggerated motion that you do when your joking or something.

* Lights. My wife was pretty surprised to discover that when the lights are off I can't see her facial expression. When I explained further how difficult it can be to move around and do stuff in the dark she made the comment that eyes are useless and was quite chuffed that she could do a lot more than me in the dark.

* Direction and Sight line. Specifically... I can't see something if I don't turn my head and look at it. Also a funny situation that resulted in the comment from me ""Can you please move I can't see the TV"".

* Opposite to what another person said, my wife was shocked when I told her that everyone can see ***in to*** the car.

And that's about all I can think of right now but I'm sure there are many more. There are just so many thing that sighted people just do, for lack of a better term, without thinking about it. And we learn it through observation. Even things as simple as how to walk and move in various ways. We don't think about it, we just see it and copy it.

Thanks for your answer. I use a lot of sensory references too, as well as ""verbal scripts"" or instructions. What I don't do that you discussed is the sense of the angles. I just don't have that intuitive sense.

Can you clarify something for me? Say you're imagining the route from your house to any place in walking distance (insert whatever applies). If you were thinking about how to get there, would you imagine the shapes of the streets and how different buildings are related to each other, or is it more ""Turn left here, turn right there.""

Another thing I can't do for instance is integrate routes. At my school I was taught to walk from the student center to the library. I was also taught to walk from the student center to my classroom buildings (academic complex). This does not automatically teach me how to get from the library to the academic buildings; I would have to go back to the student center first and then go from there to the classes, unless it's literally along the same linear route or an O&amp;M instructor explicitly teaches me a new route. What's your comment on that?

If I need special accommodations  for an event I'm attending, I make sure to let the people at the event know. I don't just expect the presenters to read my mind and have what I need prepared in advance, without my asking.  If she requires a digital copy of your slides, or a magnified printout would be better, etc, your prof should have these details. He should be able to tell you how to best meet her needs.  Anything else is unrealistic, unfair to you, and unfair to her.  

Now, on the other hand, if you were told a week in advance exactly how to accommodate one of the judges, and you didn't do it...then it's fair to seriously mark you down for it.  But just like any engineering project, you've gotta know the requirements.  

Doing this, I think, also makes blind people ourselves look kind of bad.  I wouldn't walk into someone's presentation that they've been planning for weeks or a month, and say ""Surprise! I need accessible digital copies of your slides right now!""  If I knew I was going, I would make sure to contact the organizer in advance, so I would get exactly what I need.  ",,,10,0,0,

Cataracts are generally a fairly safe surgery, but as with any surgery, there are risks of complications, which can also be exacerbated by the glaucoma itself.

Advertising she's there, saying she WANTS to be there but not providing specs so you can make appropriate accommodations?    Her presence is not actually valued regardless of what he's saying. 

She may be willingly adding the dynamic of accessibility to your thinking for your training.  Some of us do intentionally walk into situations like that but we definitely learn how to be a benefit and not a further hindrance.   This transition clearly hasn't happened with either of these two, yet.

For explanation...
Benefits :  You learn a little about formatting options or services that can help you.   You learn how to try to make your presentation accessible to ONE person with a vi.   Maybe this opens your eyes to accessibility not only in your work but your final product, too.  

Hindrances:    This heretofore unknown element affects your grade?   You are not prepared for any aspect of inclusion for her.  Added time and stress of trying to plan for unknowns which may be completely useless.   Reinforcement that she IS a zoo specimen and it's way easier to not have to think about her or any other permutation disability can throw at you.

Yeah, slap him senseless.  He's subverting decades of progress on an individual/class level.  

Meanwhile, if this experience does inspire you to think of such things in a positive way, reach out to The Specimen*or your campus Office for disabled students and offer help with note taking or other mundane student tasks.   That way, you can learn from a range of individuals what works for them and remove the showmanship aspect from the equation.  

*She doesn't deserve this moniker even if she feels it's applicable.   It stems from us being 'the first' at something, or the one to speak up, or the only one like us in a situation.   Tokens.   Pioneers.  Inspirations.   I've been here both as some noncrip's display piece and of my own choice.   

The balance happens when she decides to advertise that she's willing to help students make their presentations accessible to her BEFORE she's disclosed as part of the panel.   He could add a lecture about accessibility and have a range of people speak and at the end of term, you learn they're judging.  Or!

However, you should check to see if it is the kind of lighting you are using. Fluorescent bulbs and some LEDs are not good for some types of vision, so even though they may be very bright, a person still can't see well. If you have access to a low vision specialist, try to book an appointment with them to see if OTT bulbs help you. They are also sometimes called full spectrum bulbs, because they are designed to replicate natural sunlight. You can buy them commercially, but they aren't cheap, so you want to make sure they work well first.

Also, you wearing sunglasses indoors... Talk to your low vision specialist about indoor glasses that cut down glare. There are some that are clear (https://shop.cnib.ca/ProductDetail/sun3115149050_noir-u10-uv-90-clear-sunglasses) but because they cut down glare, it helps.

If you're speaking to someone in a context where there is a lot of background conversation, being able to see the speaker's mouth helps to add visual information cues. For example, lip and tongue placement can disambiguate what is being said, or mouth movements may help identify who is doing the saying (sound localization). So, a low vision or blind person may not have these additional cues if the auditory information is somewhat ambiguous. I don't think I've personally experienced better hearing, but maybe someone else can speak to this.

That being said, one context where being low vision or blind can actually be helpful is when listening to a speaker explain something complex. Usually sighted people, when thinking about or hearing about complex things, will direct their gaze to simpler stimuli (e.g., a white wall). But a blind person should have less interference from those other senses.",,,8,0,1,

&amp;#x200B;

The vertical swipes that normally move to whatever the rotor is set to have another option which is automatically selected if whatever you focused has them, simply called Actions. VoiceOver will notify you if they're available. Actions allow you to, well, act on a control simply by swiping down and up through the available options and double-tapping to perform them. So, if you're focused on a message in your Email inbox swiping down through the available actions will give you options like reply, flag, mark as read and delete.  In an app that lets you work with files, you get things like copy, cut, rename, delete or show info, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Many developers, including Apple but also Microsoft, Facebook in both the Facebook app as well as Messenger and WhatsApp, and Twitter, both in the official app and 3rd party clients like Twitterrific, make extensive use of this feature, and it makes it extremely fast to do an action which would normally take someone using a Screen Reader a lot longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I quickly want to sort through Email, on Android you have to double tap to open a message, then explore the screen to find the button to delete a message, and then double-tap on it. On iOS, all I have to do is listen to the message preview, and if it's something I don't want to read it's simpy a matter of swiping up to select the delete action and double-tapping, which is almost as fast as pressing delete on a computer. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a Twitter client, any links and hashtags of a tweet are turned into actions. So if I see a tweet with an article I want to read it's simply a matter of swiping down once to select the link action and double-tapping to open the browser. Compare this with Android, where tapping on a link is either double-tap to open the tweet in detail, then explore to find the link and double-tap again to open it, or bringing up the local menu, selecting the links menu and double-tapping, and then selecting the link propper and double-tapping again.

&amp;#x200B;

Android has had accessibility actions like this as well, except there it's again something that has to be accessed by doing that 2-part gesture to open a menu, finding the actions  option and opening that which kind of negates the whole point in my opinion.",,,3,0,0,

This reminds me of one time, at band camp, when percussion was practicing in an exceptionally echoey chapel room. I was on orchestra bells, and could not hear anything I was doing. Like, more so than any other environment we played in. It might as well have been the heart of a thunderstorm.

I don't know how much my blindness is part of this, though. I went to an NFB National Convention, once, and it was *awful*. The big, tile-floored rotunda areas were sufficiently stressful that I made a point of trying to get past them long before anything opened, just to avoid the crowds. I wanted to spend more time in the Exhibit Hall, because it's not like there's a Wal-mart for blind people products, but the crowds were just *too much*. That scene in the 2003 *Daredevil* film, where he talks about how the rain gives him better feedback than usual? My experience is the opposite, other than extremely perfect situations (ex, the rain is very light. Also if I'm under an umbrella, that makes the sound worse.).

While blindness might contribute to this sort of thing, I get the impression that one has to already have some other traits that lend themselves toward being overwhelmed this way. I mean, there were over 3,000 blind people at that convention, so clearly it wasn't torture for all of them.

I just realized that none of the examples I gave are specifically what you asked about.
