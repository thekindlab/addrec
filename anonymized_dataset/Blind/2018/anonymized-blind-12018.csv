3c0a5c2d-4532-404e-81c7-9fbd7a356ef0,1516418453,"I think if you want to enter biology you need to spend serious time coming up with mitigations for the specific task you'll be doing day to day. If you need to be looking at a microscope, you better invest in some kind of microscope with a great camera and a giant screen, or take pictures that will be inexpensively interpreted by others, or something. No one is going to solve these problems for you, and in some cases you may be the first person to be solving these problems in your field. That's the price of admission for you.

Try to look for situations where you can gravitate toward your strengths. This assumes, of course, that you have clear strengths. For example, I try to take on tasks at work that involve self-directed writing or programming or public speaking, which are strengths. I avoid, when possible, tasks that involve repetitive use of difficult interfaces or detail work involving paper, small items, or computers that I haven't prepared for my own use. This requires both a flexible working situation, some diplomacy and people skills, and a realistic knowledge of your own strengths and weaknesses.

Anyway, the long and the short of it is, things will be harder for you, but because you'll know that going in you'll be prepared. Setbacks are going to happen, and because it's a matter of when and not if, don't be too discouraged. Resilience, flexibility, and a commitment to learning will be your greatest assets, with the possible exception of strong persuasive and communications skills which are singularly crucial.

You're going to need to be exceptional in order to succeed in your field. But when people NEED to be exceptional, they tend to be. Throw the worlds ""should be"" out of your vocabulary, expect only mild assistance from others in your journey, and buckle in. I'm looking forward to your post in 6 years about how good of a damn biologist you are. Absolute best of luck.",,,2,0,0,

In some cases, if one eye is good but the other is exceptionally poor (Amblyopia, also called lazy eye), the brain may actually stop paying attention to the poor eye. In some cases, that presents as blackness to that one eye, in other cases, it just results in severely reduced vision. That is why for children, they do the patching...

I assume by voice assist you mean VoiceOver, the screen reader built into every IPhone?


The Seeing AI app is completely free and has a couple of amazing modes that I use.


Short text mode for getting short pieces of text off of anything. If a human being can see it, chances are the Seeing AI short text mode will be able to see it too. It's not perfect but it's very close.

Light detection mode. I'm not sure if she can see lights and shadows like myself but if she can't, this will be great if she doesn't know if the light is on or offf.

the phone will make a tone that raises in pitch the more the light is shown to it. So the more the camra sees the light,, the higher the pitch.

The currency mode is great if you are living in the US and don't have different sized bills. Put the phone above the note or coin and Seeing AI will read it out to you.

I'd like to see a simpler interface to all the various apps, or one app that does a bunch of things.

Especially when flying, it can be difficult to take advantage of the technology when one hand is usually taken up with a cane or guide dog harness and the other is hauling luggage. Or if it's -40 and touchscreen gloves aren't cutting it. 

For hardware, I'd go for a $1000 or less set of glasses with a camera that gives as good of results as possible in any light situation, has good stabilization, supports some sort of open protocol for apps to use if such exists, and includes a pair of bone conduction headphones so I don't have to wear two devices on my face.

Part of acceptance is finding ways to do things well without sight. If you haven't started to use a screen reader, for example, you might start doing some of your reading using that technology. Part of acceptance is also hitting life milestones that show that you're adjusted to the difficulties associated with your low vision or blindness, including holding down a job and being in a relationship, assuming that's what you want. That is, blind and low vision individuals who lack things in their life will blame those things (rightly or unrightly) on their condition, which leads to more dissatisfaction and sometimes depression with the condition. So here's some actionable items for you at your age:

- First and foremost, read up on retinitis. I'll let you do your research and talk to your physician, but investigate taking Vitimin A and possibly also Omega 3. Some studies have suggested the progression of the disease can be slowed significantly so take this seriously. I AM A RANDOM INTERNET PERSON AND NOT A DOCTOR so do your homework.
- Decide what's bothering you most about your reduced vision and take proactive steps to implement fixes and mitigations. If you're at university and can't see the board, get your hands on a good camera and hook it up to your computer. If you're struggling with reading, investigate screen readers, audiobooks, and podcasts. If you're a poor navigator, look into apps for that. Especially at a low vision level, most problems have strong or fully effective mitigations.
- Start coming around to the idea that your life will continue and still be enjoyable when you're low vision and, eventually, blind. This is the truth. Fear of blindness is often largely fear of the unknown, and the reality can be frustrating for a time but many or most adapt to blindness. It's not the end of the road for you and there are, quite literally, far worse things that could happen to you. Blindness is a problem, but being depressed about blindness is three problems.
- Work on yourself. This is good advice for anyone, but as a blind or low vision person you don't really have the option to coast a bit in life like most people do. Blind and low vision people often do well in higher-level or expert careers but have a harder time at ""regular jobs"" or unskilled labor. So unlike most people you'll tend to either be doing pretty damn well or not well at all, there's not really a ""mediocre"" option like there is for most people. So aggressively develop your skills, especially force multiplier skills like writing, speaking, and technology.
- Finally, don't go in for the philosophy of sentimentality around sight. Fuck sunsets and your grandchildren's faces were probably going to be pretty boring anyway. Blindness is a problem to deal with, but not because you can't look at pretty pictures anymore...it's because you have to learn to do things differently. So be prepared to do that learning and you'll find you'll probably be ok in the long run. Remember that everyone has their challenges, and this is yours, you're not uniquely cursed. Keep things in perspective.

With that last bit said, I'll leave you with a bit of sentimentality since I've just come across it:

&gt; To go in the dark with a light is to know the light.  
&gt; To know the dark, go dark. Go without sight,  
&gt; and find that the dark, too, blooms and sings,  
&gt; and is traveled by dark feet and dark wings.   ",,,16,0,0,

I still struggle a lot with coming to terms with my disability but there are 4 thoughts that I have found to be really helpful to me. YMMV.

Focusing more on what I can do rather than what I can't. I just had to spend a few months focusing on the negatives (to get PIP a UK disability benefit) and it was horrible. It had a noticeable affect on what I was able to do and how blind I felt.

That everything has been easier than I imagined before I got there. I didn't think I'd be able to cope or function at all with this level of sight but it's nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be (still bloody hard sometimes mind you). I assume that this trend will continue

Realise that this is the best your sight will ever be. (Barring some miracle cure). Sounds depressing but this has been more about doing things I want to do now and avoiding regret. A big example is that I spent years whitewater kayaking, really pushing the edge of what was safe for me, I loved it and some of my best memories are from that time. A smaller example was buying a Vive and getting into VR (I'm a stingy guy) which was expensive but has allowed me to have a lot of fun. The only thing that I've failed to do this with is travel which I am starting to regret, but that just means I know I should make it a focus soon because it'll only get harder.

Realise that sometimes you just can't do something and have to move on. This has been a tricky one for me but very important. As an example of how tricky I'm not going to give any examples because they still feel a bit too raw and private.

I hope that was helpful. I hope it works out for you. Remember to have fun.",,,6,0,0,

I understand we all must have a dose of reality in order to carry onwards with ourselves.  That's the tricky part.  More so, wondering about the future. 

The trickier part is limiting the thoughts about the future and primarily focusing on the NOW, the present. It's kind of hard considering I have a lot of good going for myself, but then I think of ""what-ifs"" incessantly. Like for example, being in a relationship with the most loving and compassionate woman. How do you men cope with your disabilities when in relationships with girlfriend/fiance/wife?  How do they treat you and what are their expectations? To add, I go as far as to my future career paths. It's a challenge and I understand there are resources to turn to manage your jobs.

93ea8a37-b443-4127-90c5-515aa469789a,1516915038,"Fellow parent of a visually impaired child here.  My daughter is now 2.5 and I try and encourage her to take her cane everywhere so that she gets used to using it.  Usually it is just from the car to the destination and once she is in a familiar environment she will hand me the cane.  She wears glasses and has some functional vision she is around 20/200 currently.  Did your doctor use Teller Acuity Cards to test her vision?

I'm not going to lie, you will get some looks from people, but I wouldn't call it pitiful. It is more like a double take.  It is likely to be the first blind person they have ever encountered and rarer still to see such a young child.  With adults, they just look briefly and that's it.  I can count on one hand the number of times people have spoken to me or asked any follow up questions, it just doesn't happen.  I personally wouldn't mind talking about her and her condition, but no one asks.  So let them look, not a big deal.

As for other children, they might simply ask ""what's that?""  You can simply respond that it is a cane and it helps your daughter because she can't see as well.  It is important to remember the cane is NOT a toy, it is a tool used for a specific purpose.  No one, including your daughter should treat it as a toy.  Kids understand when things are ""not a toy"" and that's about the extent of reactions I've had to deal with.

As for her exploring, it is important for your to encourage her.  She might just be an overly-cautious personality (I sometimes wish mine was a bit more cautious) that said, she also might be responding to your own anxiety.  It will help to get a TVI involved, but you should also get a orientation and mobility teacher to work with your daughter (and you) as well.

I've been playing piano since I was smaller, never had any learning issues but I was definitely a troubled child with a lot of mental/emotional chaos going on. Piano was my way to cope, calm down, focus on one thing and feel like I was at peace for as long as it lasted.

The thing is, due to my enjoyment in playing piano I never cared much for sheet music. As a result I can't read sheet music at all, I can read the C note that's in the middle of the piano on a normal piece of sheet music where it's in the line below the block of lines, but that's it. If music starts in a different key I get stuck and any other time I have to count out which note is which one by one.

I also had a teacher who basically told me that I had to start learning how to read sheet music or that I'd probably have to stop, because it's 'impossible' to memorize entire pieces and it'd be hard to learn how to play a certain piece without reading the intent on paper.

I said screw that and kept going. As a result there are a number of classical pieces that I have memorized and can play perfectly without reading sheet music. Some of these I play by ear so well that I can tell when my parents' piano needs to be tuned, but that may partially be perfect pitch hearing.

As hard as it may be to power through and play piano without reading sheet music, it absolutely is doable. Don't give up one something amazing. I currently can't play because the electrical piano I have feels and sounds completely wrong, and it hurts me to think about every single day. As long as you have the ability to keep practicing, don't give up.

Listen to music, feel the music, learn how to separate the way someone plays from what they're actually playing and you'll eventually be able to listen to a song a couple times and just play it.

Anyone can learn this, especially someone who doesn't have the downside of also seeing what they're doing. The only time I mess up is when I look at my fingers.

My son can't see out of one eye at all, but with his other eye he can wear a -17 contact lens and see OK - he has glasses to help out with reading, but you'd never know he was blind if you saw him. He doesn't use a cane at all but has been legally blind his entire life. My daughter has slightly better vision, wears glasses for her good eye, but can only see light/movement out of the other eye. She was visually impaired until about 6 months ago, when she crossed the threshold for legally blind due to her lack of peripheral vision.  She feels more comfortable when using a cane, and does so most of the time.  She started using a cane in high school and had a few encounters with people not paying attention and running into it.  The funniest was when some girls asked her brother (when they found out he was blind) if he knew 'that girl who pretends to be blind and uses a cane.'  He got to set them straight that day but thought it was pretty funny.

Anyway, your daughter's experience will certainly depend upon what (if any) vision she has, what sort of training she gets, and how much support you can give her.  Encourage her to explore new places, and keep in mind that the whole separation anxiety/nervousness in new situations isn't a blind thing at all - it's a 17-month old child thing!  

I wouldn't worry too much about pitying looks from adults.  It's not like she'll see them anyway! As she gets older and more comfortable she'll cope better and most people will just let her be - I know my daughter has had a few people try to 'help' her, but once they realize that she's pretty capable on her own, they treat her like anyone else.",,,6,0,0,

As for people messing with your cane. I don't have a cane yet either. I got a bit of training with one but didn't make use of it so I can't use a cane yet. There are laws protecting white canes. If somebody messes with your cane report it. Schools won't tolerate that shit. 

That's about as far as I read but I'll tell you a little story now.

Part of my eye condition is photosensitivity. Meaning I can't see in bright light. So naturally I stayed inside most of the time as a kid. But because of that I had/have very pale white skin. Around when I was 14 on a field trip some kids from my class and other classes approached me while I was waiting in line and started making fun of me for being so white. Basically kids are awful. I really wish that parents would teach their kids some freaking respect. Bullying a disabled person especially for their disability is just disgusting and unnacceptable.

However, if the idea included eye tracking of other individuals that could accurately gauge another persons eye gaze and inform blind people if they were being looked at directly by someone else, this might be more useful to a blind person.

What country are you in? If you're in the united states, you need to work with a counselor to get either a 504 plan or an IEP as soon as possible (oreferrably an IEP). These plans (theoretically) ensure that you're education will remain accessible. If you have any documented disability (meaning that you have medical records), you pretty much should be eligible. So, you can bring in any medical papers with your acuity. 

You need one of these plans because even if you have helpful teachers right now, they (and any of your future teachers) are under no obligation to provide additional accomodations until you receive one of these plans. When you begin you annual IEP meetings, make sure to sit in on them and have an active voice in your educational desicions. 

See if your school can provide any assistive tech or assistive tech training. We had to use chromebooka at my highschool too and i just used a regular ole laptop from the district and did my work with that. You should also inquire about audio or digital files of books and testing accomodations. I had about double the amount of time allotted for tests because it physically takes me longer to read things. You can even ask to have someone to bubble in your answers on your scantron (you still have to know the answers though lol). 

Try to get connected with a Teacher of the Visually Impaired (TVI) from your district. My guess is that that's where the blind girl you knew went. A TVI can help you learn different ""blind people"" tricks and help serve as an advocate for you. I was fortunate to have a wonderful TVI my last two years of highschool and she was so helpful!

National Federation of the Blind (nfb) has a lot of chapters across the country but i don't have any firsthand experience with them. I've worked a lot with the youth programs at the Braille Institute in CA and they're amazing. 

These types of orgs are great for multiple reasons. One, if you're having difficulty getting assistive tech, training, or o&amp;m from your district these places can provide it. In my area, it was common for high school students to rent out BrailleNotes (a pretty cool electronic notetaking device) from the Braille Institute and use that for their schoolwork. 

Nonprofit orgs are also a great way to meet other teens who get what you're going through. Prior to my vision loss, i didnt know any other blind people and that was really frustrating. I had the chance to make friends with other visually impaired teens through programs like improv and cooking classes at Braille. 

As far as dealing with sighted people, it is frustrating to deal with people who think that you're faking. I have to deal with those folks all the time and it can be tough.

bd938754-7e97-4f4f-a7c2-5285808657fc,1515305733,"It sounds like you have a lot going on. One thing I should mention is that while I have worked with many people with vision loss, that doesn't necessarily mean all of my suggestions or advice are appropriate for you. I only know what you've mentioned in here, and I have to fill in some of the blanks through guesswork. 

It sounds like you are going through the depression stage of the stages of grief. Something happened that has thrown your life in a loop, and you are still trying to to come to terms with that. That is common, and it does take time to process everything.

One thing you said was, you don't see the point of living without vision. May I ask why you think that? You are in a situation where you can't do things the way you have expected to, but you are still capable of doing most of it. If the screen reader is uncomfortable, have you considered supplementing it with a Braille display?

Just because someone is living with vision loss doesn't mean that everything is different and unintuitive. I""ll use an O&amp;M example. For someone to cross a lighted intersection, regardless of vision or not, they need to determine if the light ahead of them is green or red, and if it is safe to cross. Someone with vision can use their eyes, but someone who is blind can use their hearing to identify contextual clues. That doesn't always work for vision loss (loud noises creating confusion, or complete lack of traffic), but the same could be argued for vision as well (severe fog). It isn't always the easiest way to do something, but it is something you can do. 

You mentioned you want an easy life... that is still achievable, but it takes time. For your job, did you have to work hard in school to get good grades? Did you have to put in effort to get to that position? It is something similar, the skills are different. Rehabilitation is relearning the skills for daily living, which takes time and practice. That may not be something that you want to hear, but that is unfortunately how life goes. 

Good luck with everything! Hopefully some of that helped. If you have any questions, you can ask me on here or PM me.

I've been to a rehabilitation center for the blind and I mentioned that in the original post.  I also mentioned that it was there that my suicide ideation started, as I became extremely insecure.  Let me give you an example: you hop on a train to a familiar place but fall asleep and miss the train station where you were supposed to exit.  If you are sighted it's easy to find the overpass and cross the track to catch the train in the opposite direction, even if it was the last train you can easily navigate the train station to an exit and catch a cab to take you to your destination.  If you are blind, however, you are now in an unfamiliar place and either have to ask for assistance or spend a lot of time searching for the overpass or the exit.  It's this kind of inability to improvise when faced with the unexpected that leaves me extremely insecure, so I end up staying home and conditioning my freedom.

&gt; You can still design GUIs while blind--and, in fact, you're more likely to design an accessible one out of the box because, you know, you kind of still need to be able to use the thing you're designing.

Designing a GUI that the sighted would want to use without being able to see is nigh on impossible, and I don't want to be targeting only the 0.1% of the population that is totally blind.

My doctor has finally told me that the optic nerve of the left eye is too damaged for any possible restoration and that the eye is most certainly, for lack of a better word, dying. My three options are now: keep trying medications (however, we're running out of viable ones), surgery (the risk factor is insanely high), or removal of the eye.

My doctor told me he is ""at a complete loss"". I am as well.

As far as focusing solely on my vision goes, most of the time, I manage to ignore it. However, when pain strikes, it is unavoidable.

I have been working to get services for my vision like braille, but my school isn't allowing me to. Instead of starting a lengthy battle, I'll wait the next 10 months until I'm 18 and pursue getting help elsewhere. For now, I use a white cane when necessary to get around.

Thankfully, I still have a working eye. I do my best to care for it, and the vision has been pretty stable in it. I've been getting more focused on medicinal studies, and am getting a certified nursing assistant license. It's all very exciting and keeps my focus off of my health concerns.

Ironically the worse it's gotten, the better I've felt. Maybe I'm getting better at handling it.

I think that subconsciously people respond more positively when a blind person (or anyone for that matter) makes eye contact for two reasons.   First, eye contact is such a deeply ingrained social norm that it just seems off when someone does not make eye contact (even subconsciously generating feelings like mistrust and the thought that the other person is doing something shady).  Secondly, eye contact helps reinforce the idea that someone is paying attention, which generates more positive feelings towards the other person.  Sure, once people know that the person is blind, they can remind themselves that lack of eye contact isn’t important, but that’s causing the person to consciously fight their subconsciously-generated feelings, which is extremely difficult for most people to do.

As long as you're comfortable wear whatever you want. That being said, style is important. It's called a fashion statement because it is a statement. In the case of visually impaired people, being well dressed and put together can be a very powerful statement. I don't know how things are where you live, but where I come from, most people are under the impression that blind people can't take care of themselves at all, and always need to rely on other people. Being able to dress yourself (well at that) proves that you don't need someone else to pick out your clothes for you. 

The most important thing I can recommend doing is organizing your closet meticulously. So in addition to separating hoodies zip ups and pullovers, you should also try to organize them by patterning/design if you can as well as colour so you don't wear anything that clashes. 

I like to use hangars for everything so I can feel the materials of each piece of clothing and remind myself what it is. You can also use dry cleaner bags as a sort of divider to keep sections of your closet separate. ",,,4,0,0,

The Argus 2 has 60 electrodes (I believe in a 6X10 grid), which roughly translates to 16 pixels of resolution (as comparison, it would look somewhere between the 4X4 and 10X10 pictures  http://images.gizmag.com/inline/bio-retina-provides-new-vision-to-the-blind-2.jpg ).

The Alpha IMS (currrently the more advanced device) has 1,500 electrodes, but they connect to the brain, so it isn't so straightforward to figure out the resolution. In the most recent article I read, a small sample (29 people) with the Alpha IMS installed were able to get a visual accuity of 20/546, which is quite astounding, but still much poorer than legal blindness (at 20/200). But there is one number that is a bit telling... only 13 of the participants (45%) reported ""*useful* visual functions in their daily life"". While the that is almost half, it also shows that even with a marked improvement of their visual acuity, the current technology isn't enough to make it useful to people on a daily basis.

I'm sure the devices will eventually improve and the costs would go down (current cost is roughly $150,000 USD for either device and surgery). But for the vast majority of people, the device just isn't worth the cost. I've worked with three people who have gotten the Argus 2, and it is not useful for two of them (and barely functional for the third... they can use it to identify the drop off along the sidewalk, if conditions were perfectly optimal.... but if the day was slightly too cloudy, or slightly too bright, she can't see it anymore). 

Oh, the technical term for such an implant is called a visual prosthesis, or a bionic eye.

You may also want your survey to find out at the start if someone is totally blind versus low vision. Many people who are low vision use screen magnifiers, while someone who is totally usually uses screen readers. Web inaccessibility affects them in different ways, and it would be useful to know what their situation is. Also, someone who is low vision can use both a screen magnifier AND a screen reader, but someone who is totally blind usually can't use the magnifier.

My wife has been blind since birth: she has told me about the bad experiences with many other kids. Kids tend to be harmful to one another, regardless of blindness: it is more a lack of awareness of the consequences of their actions, than actual cruelty. This went on throughout her childhood and potentially peaked at around her 10-12 years of age. However, she found other kids that she could play with and that were respectful/mindful of her disability. 

Other adults become a problem not as a child, but rather as an adult. Having grown up with the habit of self-advocating and putting herself out there, she has learned how to navigate the adult world to the point that she has held high-ranking jobs, completed advanced graduate degrees and moved from a developing to a developed country.

My advice to you would be to experiment with the white cane, expose her to guide dogs, assistive technology and help her become resilient. Take it one step at a time: your daughter may be better off learning to walk in a familiar place (say, with her hand in front of her), before she is able to walk in unfamiliar places with a white cane. 

Finally, be mindful of your fears: the pitiful looks, as you call them, will always be there. It is important that you don't transmit your fears to your daughter.

For me, it kept me from going out, a lot, for a long time.

I'd sit at home, read, write, play with LEGO, or play some of the games I could. So, pretty boring life.

Then I went to the OTC, a training center for the blind ran by the DSB. I had to commute, I had to explore, and I loved it.

After graduating, I got a great job, travel around the world, skydive, white water raft, go on long hikes, tandem bike, and I'm taking up snowboarding in the next few weeks.

By all measures, and I don't say this to be boastful, I am a successful person, I am an awesome person, doing awesome things, with awesome people. I don't do these things because I'm blind, but or to spite being blind, I do them because they're fun, and they entertain me.

Still, walking down the Seattle streets to go see a play, my fiancé gets those looks. ""Oh, it's so nice of you to date a blind man."" ""Oh, bless you for dealing with him."" and ""I couldn't deal with that kind of burden."" ...

No matter what she does, or who she becomes, she will get looks, and the people she is with will get those looks.

All you can do is support her, and teach her, and yourself, that their thoughts, their opinions, and their judgement means absolutely nothing, and has absolutely no value.

Other toddlers taking her cane is a perfectly valid concern, and to counteract that I'd suggest trying to find some local blindness support groups, that might have meet ups. If while she's playing she can make do without it, great, just use it while navigating around like I do. Otherwise, the other kids will just need to learn that it's like a crutch, wheel chair, or cane used for support, she needs it, and it's not a toy.

As it is now, I have to hunt through Roll 20, several Wikis, and deal with all that comes with that.
I'm thinking, front page of the app is a list of characters by name, and the game they're currently in. There's an add button in the top right, with a menu botton on the top left, which lets you change the theme, from black on white to white on black, adjust text size, export/import the files to iCloud, or email them.
But, in a new sheet, you have the basic info, Name, race, which is in a drop down with a custom race option. If you pick, say, Tiefling which has variants, it puts up another picker choice, and it automatically adds the requisite skill points for you.

You get a button to roll for each of your stats, and they come up above the stats, and each stat says the bonus, ie Strength +2 if it's 14, etc. It only lets you assign those values, then adjusts for race, features, etc.
On another tab, you can add spells by looking at a spell book and what's meant to be available to you. Like, my tiefling is an Eldrich Knight, so it would automatically show me only first levels, sorted into offense, defense, and buff, letting me select only the 4 I'm meant to have, then 2 of the other kind, I'm blanking on what that means.

If you are sighted it's easy to find the overpass and cross the track to catch the train in the opposite direction, even if it was the last train you can easily navigate the train station to an exit and catch a cab to take you to your destination.  If you are blind, however, you are now in an unfamiliar place and either have to ask for assistance or spend a lot of time searching for the overpass or the exit.  It's this kind of inability to improvise when faced with the unexpected that leaves me extremely insecure, so I end up staying home and conditioning my freedom.

That honestly depends on the person. I've met blind people who seem to have an always-on internal GPS and can get themselves situated where they need to be even if you leave them in the middle of the street and turn them around 5 times. On the other hand, I know too many sighted people who couldn't find the exit if you pointed them to a sign that said ""exit this way and on your right"". Unfortunately which end of the spectrum you're on is going to depend largely on something you're just not going to have after only 4 years being blind--that being the ability to map out an area while you're travelling without relying on visual queues. Having never had to do that, I won't even try offering suggestions for ways you might be able to cope with that, but if you only lost your sight in 2014 I'm not surprised you're not there yet. Again, I'd probably be in the exact same boat if I gained the ability to see on the day you lost it--I'm used to navigating without it, you're used to navigating with it, we're both going to have to relearn pretty much everything.

&gt; Designing a GUI that the sighted would want to use without being able to see is nigh on impossible, and I don't want to be targeting only the 0.1% of the population that is totally blind.  Applications designed by the blind often tend to miscalculate the size of things.  Font sizes, for example, are very hard to calculate without visual feedback because most fonts are not fixed-width, and don't even get me started about games, especially 3D games with perspectives.

I'll take your word for it on this--I just use the programs and leave the design and development to people who want the headache. I just know based on what I've seen that it's possible to make a something the sighted can interact with. Is it perfect? I don't know. Probably not. But the devs I'm aware of who do this also aren't shy about asking a sighted friend if they could take 5 seconds and tell them if the thing looks like absolute ass. Sometimes asking is unavoidable, and that's one of those things I'm not sure how to help you get used to--as again, you're coming from a place I've never been.",,,1,0,0,

Here's some stuff to look into:

- On Windows, there's a program called TextAloud that's good for people with decent sight. You can set it up to read everything that gets copied to the clipboard, so it's just a matter of copying the stuff you want to read.
- On iOS and Android, there's an app called Voice Dream Reader that can read out an ebook in very natural sounding voices. Just email the book to yourself and open it in Voice Dream Reader. If the book has DRM, you may need to remove the DRM first (PM me for some tips) or use a proprietary app such as Kindle.
- If you have an iPhone, look into using Voiceover, a screen reader that will read what's on the screen when you touch it. It's really great for reading books, I've read probably about 300 or 400 books this way. Just open the book in Kindle or iBooks, activate Voiceover, touch some text, and then swipe down with two fingers to start it reading. Android has a version of this called TalkBack, but it's unfortunately quite inferior.
- On OSX, there's a screen reader that will read highlighted text when you hit a key. Find the setting in Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, click Accessibility, then click Speech, and check the Speak Selected Text button after selecting a key.

Hope that helps! Remember, if you want to read fast, there's no reason you can't. I'm 97% blind and am finishing a PhD in English and I read 50-100 books a year, plus (apparently) millions of words in articles. (Just got an email about that habit from the app I use to read, ha.)

Two reasons: The first is because I simply miss sight, the sense itself, it's not just the loss of functionality.  The second is because there are limitations all over the place, and while there are workarounds for many of them, those workarounds are not obvious thus making me feel insecure because I lost the ability to improvise.

&gt; If the screen reader is uncomfortable, have you considered supplementing it with a Braille display?

Yes, but my Braille skills suck, and I think it's a sensory problem because I write Braille much faster than I read it, plus Braille still requires me to create a mental image of the code since I can't quickly glance at other lines and read code without moving the caret, which is difficult when the sources grow large or when I attempt to read code written by other people.

You might want to read about Daniel Kish who is a totally blind person raised to explore and who can ride bikes and go hiking, among other  things.

The real danger is being too overprotective. It's hard, but encourage her to explore and bang her head on things. Best of luck!",,,15,0,0,

The doctor said we won't really know until she can tell us. She is behind in her gross/fine motor skills and speech as she was born prematurely. It's hard to separate all of these factors out and determine what is due to her not seeing well / what is due to being a preemie / what's normal. 

For example, for the longest time she would just sit and not move to explore, even at home. Now she knows where everything is at home and daycare and she'll go right to it. But when we're in a new/unfamiliar place and I set her on the ground to play, she would stay put, not move, or explore, just listen. I think also she's scared. Eventually she will start to move around a little bit, but it takes a long time.",,,3,0,0,

67a0da36-2e92-4de2-8320-338b47d4465d,1516915465,"Thank you! I am not sure how they tested her visual acuity as she was around 12 months when she was first diagnosed. (She got glasses at 7 months.) They wrote 20/200  but it was really just a guess. They said without her glasses it's more like 20/1000. But again, just a guess. Did you take the cane out before she could walk? At home she uses it to hit against things while sitting, I think to gauge depth (maybe?).

I am not anxious when we take her out. I am excited for her to play and interact. I am more nervous about the first time we take the cane out with us, but i think i've built it up in my mind that it won't actually end up being a big deal",,,1,0,0,
