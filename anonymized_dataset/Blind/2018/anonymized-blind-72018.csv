Posts in this thread make me feel pretty good about my own difficulty playing games these days too. I can't play Company of Heroes against human players any more because I have to pause the game so much to find my mouse and issue orders. I started a game of Arcanum the other month, but got frustrated trying to distinguish things and spot the NPC I was looking for. Then there's Minecraft. Rarely can I see the crosshair, and the contrast between blocks so I can see where edges are and different blocks etc is a real challenge. I often lose my patience and stop playing after a little bit.

There's really only one game I absolutely, 100% want to play and get through though: Cyberpunk 2077 (when it's released). I've been following it from day one and I'll be devestated if it's too difficult for me to play it.",,,4,0,0,

If you have a hard time with colours, like me, then you'll flag with your opponents what you're going for - there's yellow and white, orange and pink, and green and grey to get confused with. There is iconography to tell them apart to, but they're small can be hard to decipher. Everyone should own at least one version of Ticket to Ride imo), Takenoko (really nice components, only three colours to worry about in this one, I have a hard time with the pink and yellow, the green is no issue. 2-4)

Medium weight, city building (cards): 7 Wonders (3-7, card drafting mechanic, best with 5, easy to pick up, a lot of simple iconography and small amounts of regular to small text, there's also 7 Wonders: Duel which is for two players), and Citadels (3-7 as well I believe, role selection element, player interactions. Most cards have little to read and could be brailled easily, the unique districts are text heavy and its small print. You could braille out a reference book with those and the role abilities though if needed)

Medium weight, area control: Small World (2-5, whacky races, easy to learn except for a single mechanic which some can find tough to understand. It's tough for me to see the borders between regions and identifying what's in them can be tough, but the other players can help. Very little reading and iconography in this one and other players can assist easily)

Medium weight, coop: Dead of Winter (2-5, zombie survival with a possible hidden traitor. There is a lot of text, 10-12pt, including text in itallics. Some elements the others can help, but everyone has secret objectives and hands and brailling it all out for those who can't read is probably tough. I really like this game though and it can be quite challenging).

""I Want To Spend An Entire Evening Playing a Single Epic Game"" (i.e. a long, heavy game): Civilization boardgame (2-4 or 2-5 with one of the expansions. I have the second version but the third has just come out. Each version is very different. There's a lot of visual elements, but for the most part the other players can assist with reading things and identifying terrain elements if required. Text is small though.)

I'm not sure if you live in an area with no public transit or walkable neighborhoods, but it does seem overwhelmingly more likely that your vision problems, not the driving specifically, are the bigger hurdle. Btw, your vision must be pretty functional if you even went to DOT to attempt to get your DL.

In any case you might be doing yourself a favor to include that info in your bio. Is it OKCupid or Tinder? Depending on available space and how much detail you wanna reveal, you can throw that detail in there:

- ""I basically just see out of one eye, so I'm not much of a driver or 3D movie connoisseur.""
- ""Annoyingly, I don't drive, thanks to eye trouble. But I'm really good at Ubering around.""
- ""I do a great impression of [Leela/Polyphemus/Snake Plissken].""

Nothing apologetic, nothing overly defensive, just matter of fact. Your disclosure will (unavoidably) turn away some number of people, but the others will take a cue from your comfort with it. 

Lots of people, unfortunately, have a regressive conception of disability in which they envision themselves having to ""take care"" of you, and you don't get a chance to dispel that until you actually meet them. So consider including profile photos of yourself doing stuff to counteract the instinctive stereotype of equating disability with ""no ability."" And the first few dates you might aim for meeting in a familiar environment -- it might be extra useful to signal your independence and comfort, so it's not foregrounded during the date.

Personally, I'd start by looking at screen readers for devices you already have. I like apple products because I find them more intuitive as a formerly sighted person, but YMMV.

Apple products all ship with voiceover, which can be enabled via Siri or different key/button combinations depending on the device. Android devices have talkback, which I believe you have to activate in settings as far as I know, but I haven't used one in years. Windows computers have narrator natively from 8.0 on, although there are much better screen readers, such as NVDA for free and JAWS for the price of a mac.

In your state, when or if you are legally deemed blind, you can contact your state commission for the blind, or your country's equivalent if you're outside the US. If you have apple products, applevis.com is a good place to look for apps and reviews, although not an exhaustive list by any means.

Screen readers are tools, and different tools have their strengths and weaknesses. Personally, I choose to use NVDA as my primary screen reader, and I think it is a great tool. I also have JAWS on my computer, for accessibility testing, and I am glad to have it as a backup option. I really think the most important thing is to have options and choices; honestly, I wish we had more viable options for the tools we depend on. As blind people we become incredibly attached to our preferred screen readers, and I suppose that is understandable; I myself am very philosophically aligned with the open source, blind created, aspects of NVDA. With that said, NVDA is just a tool for me, and I will stop using it as soon as it stops getting the job done.

Screen readers should not be sport teams that we root for, they should be like pens, pencils, paper clips, etc. Their only value is in getting the job done, and if they get the job done for you, that’s all that matters.",,,7,0,0,

956626d1-649a-41bc-990e-06ac1faf0297,1533072058,"I feel you. 

I was in nursing school when this started, and I had to drop out because I was having trouble reading instruments that I needed to read and could no longer see well enough to evaluate a patient. I had gone to do the pre reqs for this and had my goal snatched out of my hands.

For the first two years after I started losing my vision, I was angry and I was suicidal. I had a bottle of oxy and was just waiting until the day that I couldn't handle it any more. The day that I almost did it, was the day that I could no longer pick up and read a book and read it. I was a shut in for the most part. I had been grabbed on the breast by some random turd in a parking lot on my birthday and was afraid to go out alone.

I started at my local blindness support center and everything changed. I saw people who were profoundly blind that were doing just fine. I went to their group discussions and activities. I met a lot of blind people. I had only known one previous to this. 


Now I have a kindle, I can make the print large enough. Or I can get an audio book. 

 They talked me into doing training with the white cane, which I was surprised to learn that I could easily master. Now, I can even blindfold myself and get anywhere I need to go. It is freeing and gave me a new sense of self confidence. 

I did technology training, to learn to use the tools that I would need. I am now working full time and I can get anywhere I want to go on the bus.  I have a bar code reader for the market, an app that tells me what it sees. I have Blind Square, that helps me navigate.

One of the trainers at the center has an awesome guide dog. I might get one of those eventually.

You are young, I was not when this started. You can start learning braille now, *before* it's a necessity. I suck at it. You have years to learn what you need and to readjust your thinking to fold in a different set of experiences.

You have a choice, you can stay mad and get nowhere, or surrender to the process and head somewhere completely different than you ever imagined.

A couple of them have got senior level careers, one got a Masters degree after sight loss. A couple I know are both blind but have brought up a family.

Tools means screen readers, guide dogs,  software like Seeing AI, tinted glasses, magnifiers, long canes and so on.

Adjustments can be as simple as other people not leaving stuff out or cupboard doors open where you will walk into them, or using taxis more to get around.

Assistance would be getting training to use the tools, employing people to help with correspondence or housework, going on holiday with a sighted companion who will be your assistant and guide.

Most of the above go on around me all the time and the extras eventually recedes into the hum of life.

You might be interested in the [social model of disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability).

Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.""

e93dd991-f219-4fac-abb7-1a4632d53848,1530568894,"I think you may be onto something. Maybe the schools that provide service animals could be accredited and any animal graduating from an accredited school could receive proper credentials. There should be an authority responsible for making sure the schools are using the best practices in training. 

That same authority should provide a field agent for anyone who has trained their own animal and who would like to receive the proper credentials. Like I said I don’t want to take away the right to train your own animal. There are people out there who are capable of doing so and do it beautifully. Also, why force someone to get a new animal if the one they have is capable and willing to do the work. Forcing a person to get a new dog from a school would be an unnecessary burden for that person, in time and expense. A person has to invest 3 and a half weeks at a school to learn to work with a new service animal, and the cost of food and vet visits for an additional animal might be too much for that person to manage. Not to mention travel issues if that person ever wanted to travel with their pet and service animal. I know someone who used to have to fly his retired service dog home then go back to get his working service dog and fly again. 

I disagree with a standard curriculum. I think that results are more important than the content of the training. As long as the training is done humanely. 

Maybe there ought to be some kind of program the handler has to complete. That way we can be confident that the handler will have some idea how to act in different situations. They will know how to advocate fro themselves and thus be less stressed when facing a difficult situation. Animals pick up on the stress and fear of their handler and the more we can do to put the handler at ease the more likely the animal will be at ease. 

There are definitely schools that provide animals for the deaf and hard of hearing, and for seizures. I’m not sure about psychiatric service animals.

To the person who was talking about entering text on phones, you can, actually dictate into any text field, apart from password fields. Using the default iOS keyboard you should have a dictate button you can simply press to start speaking.  I'm waiting for my Android phone to arrive, so I can't talk about that platform with much experience, but the G board has very good dictation and I would think it could be used in almost every text field.

I agree that on-screen QWERTY keyboards are not very efficient, but I really love using the built in on-screen braille keyboard on iOS. For me, using the braille keyboard is very very comfortable and fast. I can easily get speeds of over forty words a minute, when I'm just typing at a average, comfortable speed, and I believe I could type faster then many sighted people using on-screen QWERTY keyboards; plus I find the spell correct function much nicer to use on the braille keyboard when compared to the default QWERTY keyboard. There is a similar keyboard on Android. I only have a tiny     bit of experience with that keyboard, but it seems to work well; however, to use it you do have to suspend TalkBack, which does make it a little less ideal when compared to the iOS option. I have been using different versions of on-screen braille keyboards since around 2012, so it might take you a little time to become comfortable with the concept if you are  just starting out. By the way, I understand that if you don't know how to type in braille this style of keyboard does you no good, but I do think it's the best method for typing blind people have on virtual keyboards.",,,2,0,0,

Porr horse if he has to keep his head at the other one’s tail the whole time. Lol Or is that more figuratiiive, like they follow the other horse’s tail but at a distance?? Is it like the horse rides where the horses stay in a line and walk the whole way? I’d love to try horseback riding, but I’d definitely want to gallop. Can you gallop if the horse is following head to tail? Do you think a person could get by riding if another person were verbally giving them direction, like left, straight, turn around? Could you teach a horse to follow voice commands? Lol sorry like i said I know nothing. 

Now I will answer your questions. I meant to but I forgot. Sorry. I still have some useable vision, not totally blind, but probably less than you because you can see there is a horse in front of you on the trail. I probably could as well, but it depends on how far ahead they are and the lighting conditions and so on. I have never travelled alone, unless you count the airport stuff. I’ve been through airports alone, but not destinations. I’m hoping to do that this year sometime. Working on building up the courage. 

I like to do things on vacation rather than look at things. Museums aren’t my thing unless there is an awesome tour guide that is an excellent story teller. In Colorado I went hiking, zip lining, and had a craft beer tour, such fun! The hiking in the rockies was a little tough, partly because I’m blind and partly because I’m a flat lander from Florida. Lol The zip lining was great! Best travel experience was at the zip line place. They give you gloves to quote protect you unquote in case you decide to reach up and grab the steel cable while you are going fifty miles an hour for some stupid reason. Lol I think the gloves are more like mittens than protection though. Anyways, I was having a really hard time fumbling with the gloves cause I couldn’t feel anything. One of the guys noticed and offered me his fingerless gloves, which I happily accepted. Made the whole experience so much better! I was really impressed because it was so thoughtful of him to offer just by observing.

Worst experience... there aren’t very many. Only thing that stands out in my mind is when people think I’m faking. I’ve had a TSA agent tell me that he knew I wasn’t blind because he saw me playing with my phone while I was in line. I then explained to him that I still had some useable vision and that I had a bluetooth ear bud in telling me what was on the screen. He quickly apologized. I had another TSA agent ask me if i was blind where was my cane. I then told him that blind people don’t need to use their canes when they are being wheeled about the airport in a wheelchair so I had left it folded up in my backpack. Again, a quick apology. Other times I’ve heard flight attendants talking and saying stuff like I don’t think she’s really blind, look at how she looks around at stuff. Lol I just try to ignore it. 

I think mostly in first world countries travelling is fine. I would worry about showing peoploe that I am blind in a third world country though. Primarily if I was alone. I wouldn’t want to make myself a target. Most people are very kind and helpful when they find out. Some people are awkward and weird, but that’s okay because sometimes I’m awkward and weird about it. Either way as long as you are clear about what you need and what you don’t need they’re fine. Like please don’t drag me around by my arm as if I’m a child.

I'd recommend looking into the voices, you may not like the default voice. 
You can download voices for free and use any voice once it is downloaded to the phone.


There are quite a few settings so perhaps you should have  a little play around with it yourself so that you know what to do if he doesn't.


There's apps for free that run you through a little tutorial but I can't remember what they're called. I think a tutorial when the Iphone starts would be great so that those who aren't as into tech as we are can get used to Voiceover.

d42770b1-9f84-462c-9536-090461a2ff56,1530701351,"This is pasted from a reply I made on another thread here:

 Probably the two worst examples I can think of were when I was at rehab. I was under blindfold walking down the street. There was no tactile distinction between the parking lot on my left and the sidewalk. I bumped into a parked car, realized I had veered into the parking lot, and started making my way back to the sidewalk when a woman slides her arm through my elbow--square dance style--to ""help"" me back to the sidewalk. Keep in mind I had already realized where I was and was making a course correction. The other time, I was at a post office, innocently asked where the end of the line was, and a girl grabbed my hips and steered me there like we were in a conga line. Neither of these people asked to touch me in any way, and I had no idea the first lady was even there before she decided to play personal space invaders with me.

An honorable mention has to go to the morning I was on the bus to work when an absolutely plastered lady got on and started talking to my dog. She attempted to pet her, but in her drunken state, missed the mark and started petting my leg in stead. I quickly relocated to the other side of the aisle, but for the rest of the trip she kept groping the air a foot or two in front of where my dog was lying in a futile attempt to pet her.

Speaking of busses... these crazy memories are just flooding back to me right now... another bus related incident at rehab this time, I had forgotten to slip my ID lanyard under my shirt when I left the building, and while on the bus a woman grabs my ID and starts looking at it... while it was still around my neck.

Probably the worst reactions I've had are right here on Reddit, though. Just search /r/showerthoughts for ""blind"" sometime. The lack of knowledge is palpable.  For some reason people have a hard time grasping that blind people can type. Haven't people heard of touch typing? Same with using computers.

It stands to reason that we accept threats to safety for benefits. Think about cars, which are incredibly, incredibly dangerous. We have, however, decided that the danger is worth it...or at least other people have, I'm not sure that I'm convinced. The threat posed by service dogs is low, in part because they are trained. So if your suggestion is to have emotional support dogs be intensively trained, I wouldn't be against that if we go on the assumption that we're stuck allowing people to have emotional support animals in the first place. Given that there is no demonstrated clinical benefit for them, however, I think it might be better to just not give the concept legal validation. Currently, in the US and to my knowledge, there is no legal status for emotional support animals, though there are many shady companies that will send you an official looking certificate which might intimidate someone into letting you bring your animal into a restaurant or other venue.

We do not need studies to know certain things. We do not need studies to know, for example, that eating is required for maintenance of health. If blind people can't get places, and then you give them a dog and they can get places, then the dog is doing its job. It's not a clinical outcome, it's a practical outcome. In medicine and psychology, however, there are many reasons that you need to look at outcomes, mainly because things like depression are multivariable phenomena that change over time regardless of treatment. Without a study, you cannot actually know if a particular treatment or intervention is actually helpful. There many be evidence that support animals are useful that comes out in the future, but for now we have no such evidence So I don't think we should enshrine emotional support animals in the law.

As my mobility trainer explained it to me, if you naturally walk a bit faster (as I do), your cane should be a bit longer so as to signal obstacles to you on time. If you're a slower and more methodical walker, a short cane might be better and more practical. 

The biggest difference, really, is that longer canes tend to be heavier and hence require more muscle to move. A very slight change in cane weight or taking a too long or too heavy cane from the very start could cause muscle pain and tendonitis (as I discovered once when I had to use a slightly longer cane than usual for a few months). You don't feel it at first, but waving that thing around all day sure does take its toll.

If you're just starting out and do not have strong shoulder and wrist muscles, I would definitely recommend starting with something shorter and lighter, and then moving your way up as you get used to it. You will be the best judge of what kind of cane is most comfortable for you.",,,2,0,0,

The Department of Transportation? What kind of documentation will be required? Vet records and the sort won’t do much good. Should the ID cards only be provided to animals that came from a program like The Seeing Eye or Guiding Eyes, guide dog schools? That would raise other issues, like the fact that people are allowed legally to train their own pets to be service animals. I don’t think that right should be taken away. Ultimately, it seems to me that there should be some sort of good citizen test for the animals. Like a driving test to get your driver’s license. The animal should have to go through rooms set up with distractions and display that they are well behaved. This seems like it would be difficult to implement. Would every state need a location for testing? Every county? Will the Department of Transportation have to hire animal trainers who are more familiar with animal interactions? A lay person might be able to tell the animal got through the test alright, but a trained specialist might notice the animal passed but was very stressed. Lastly, should this be a periodic thing? Should recertification be required? And, how often? As I mentioned in another response a guide dog bit another dog when guiding his handler. If this dog came from a school and ID cards are just given to all guide dogs that come through proper training this would undermine the integrity of guide dog schools. When I don’t thinkt he school is the issue, but the handler’s interaction with the animal.

While writing this and asking these questions, it occurs to me that maybe a field agent would be best for certifying service and emotional support animals. The field agent could set up a visit with the individual with a service animal or emotional support animal and they could go to a busy location and walk through the distractions already there to demonstrate their animals ability to handle distractions. How often is still a question. Maybe every three or five years? Do you think that if the person knows theyu will be tested on a certain date they might prepare the animal to pass that date and then be less diligent about training between recertification periods? Like all the horrible drivers in south florida (this is where i am from) lol

Shiny/sparkly things were great, but size kinda mattered. I couldn't really appreciate the difference between real and fake jewelry, visually speaking, but tiny gemstones were barely noticeable and generally just detracted from the clarity of whatever they were inlaid in, so in practice, this meant that fake won out because plastic and glass and quartz can be big enough, much more cheaply.

One thing I'd do sometimes was blink rapidly, to simulate random special effects, especially when there was more visual snow / lights being set off. I think the only time I can recall encountering any depiction of rapid blinking is from *Frog and Toad are Friends*, which is a children's book which I don't think I've encountered in any format other than Braille. (Wait, do frogs have transparent eyelids? Would that even do anything for them?)

Sometimes, when I was in water that was getting direct sunlight, and the reflection caught my eye, I would do things like splash or stir it up to watch how it affected the reflection. I kinda liked trying various ways of making splashes in general, because of how they looked and felt. (Like, striking downward with an open palm, and continuing to push after your hand breaks the surface creates a small cloud of tiny bubbles that almost feel like solid particles if they hit you. Keeping your hand half submerged and vibrating it back and forth, or maybe in a very tight, fast spiral motion, seemed kinda like an Energy Effect.)

A certain type of contrast in colors was helpful, so the decorations around Halloween and Christmas were generally much easier for me to deal with than, say, Easter (where things tend to get more ... pastelly?). Particularly indoors/at night, since Frosty the Snowman on a snowy day is a lot of pale-on-pale, but a Christmas tree in a room, covered in colorful lights and ornaments, has much more contrast). Put this together with the bits about animation, and you can probably imagine how the likes of Scooby Doo could have an impact out of proportion with how much I cared about the specifics (white, amorphous ghosts on dark backgrounds worked so well that I developed a consistent fantasia where certain words or ideas would give me a visualization of a ghost with a jacolantern floating at head-height beside it). I made a lot of audio recordings in elementary school based on dreams, and occasionally random ideas, and these involved a lot of ghosts (and Power Rangers, which has nothing to do with their very my-vision-friendly outfits, I'm sure).

Weirdly enough, glow-in-the-dark things rarely got much interest. Probably because of how remarkably dim most glow-in-the-dark things were. Things that would actually light up, though, were plenty nice. For some reason, they kept giving me those little pen-lights at the eye-doctors', which is how I discovered the limits to the opacity of human skin. Also, that place had interesting glass around one of the waiting rooms, where instead of a strip of metal dividing the panes, there was another, thick piece of glass extending inward, which either had a greenish tint, or resulted in one when looking through it at a certain angle. So I tended to look at those a lot.

I can't provide an image for reference, but I had an action figure of Marvel's Garrison Kane with his metal fan-weapon. I didn't know anything about the character, but I did know that spinning the fan while it caught the light just right was fascinating enough to prompt the imagination.

It actually took me a while to discover the eye-pushing-illusion-thing, so it's hard to say how much I did that.

I stared at the ground a lot, because that was where the most distinctive chunks of color often were, between parking lot lines, those red stripes in Wal-marts, and the little blue arrows in the hallway at my elementary school that were supposed to encourage people to walk on the right side of the hall (I had to stare at those for, like, months before I could see which way they were pointing, rather than just a blob of blue on white linoleum).",,,1,0,0,

A Chinese lady stopped I was close to China town, but not within it. I don’t think she spoke much english. I happen to be Chinese and speak her dialect. She begins to shriek at me. This woman hhas a shrill high pitched voice anyway! She was shrieking at the top of her voice.

She asks:

Where are your parents? Why are you out in the dark? Why are you out so late? It’s not safe, and you’re blind. 

I kept telling her that I was fine, just needed a little of direction, this area was new to me. I had heard of this restaurant and decided to come check it out. I am usually a little adventurous. I tried to be nice to her. That it wasn’t a problem, and I was independent. I told her I was in no danger.  I told her even my mother didn’t do this.

Earlier my father texted me, to ask if I was coming home for dinner. I told him I wasn’t and the response was two words litterally: Have fun. I laughed.

Anyway, I eventually got a bit far from that lady she followed and shrieked at me. I found someone else and the lady eventually went away. The guy asked who that was. He said he thought he was my mother and thought she was trying to help me. I got what I needed.",,,3,0,0,

With some medical and service animals, the need is overwhelming and worth some risk of inconvenience or even threat. For emotional support animals, I'm not convinced that it's a worthy tradeoff. Unfortunately there are also many more people who insist on emotional support animals compared to the relatively rare guide or epilepsy dog, which strains the public's tolerance and willingness to accept risk in more worthy cases. If the science was there to support the idea of having an emotional support animal, I would be a lot more accepting of the idea.

I do have extremely vivid nightmares (good ol PTSD) but there aren’t usually many monsters around. There’s a lot of blood, viscera, and enclosed spaces though. Mostly it’s a feeling of dread, a presence that’s chasing me deeper into a terrible place I don’t want to be. Sometimes it’s just one nightmare element in an otherwise mundane dream (the blood pit full of teeth just hanging out in a school floor; everyone called it Steve and it was apparently friendly as long as you didn’t fall into it). And once in a great while I’ll have a sleep paralysis dream that ends with something screaming and leaping out at me from the side right before I wake up unable to move.

The exact moment that scene occurs is usually quite noisy, and would be difficult to hear the description. 

Almost everyone I know uses audio books for any extended period of reading. Keep in mind that Braille cells have to be a certain size, so books end up becoming quite large. For example, this is roughly what the Bible looks like in Braille.

I began by only using it at night, but I started using my cane all the time at the start of last year (I made the commitment at the end of 2016 that I'd start using it all the time). You don't look back, trust me.

I know a couple other guys who've had the same experience. You are so proud of being independent that you don't want to use a cane. I know guys still like that. When you finally get over it though and start using one, it's much better. People get out your way. People offer you help (even if you don't need it, you just decline and it's nice to know they care). People understand if you're looking around blankly. And it's always their fault if you bump into someone or something. 

Work and study? I dunno, it rarely comes up. And believe me, if ever it did come up in a negative way, I would hammer that person. Full weight of work's policies, or the law. It gives you real power. If you don't disclose your disability, if you don't make it clear, they can always get you because of it - because they can always say they didn't know. You make it clear, you make that statement, and they have to accommodate, they cannot discriminate (I'm assuming you're in a western country). And if they don't, they know you'll hammer them for it.

In this video, he describes his idea of the three most profound discoveries he had as a 7 day blind person.

I didn't get past 6:31 where he's describing how he comes across a surprise tree in the sidewalk that has birds in it that his listeners only notice after suspecting it's a tree.

How many of us first notice birds when we're just under their nests, for example?   He doesn't strike me as very bright.   Maybe it's that he thinks we aren't?   I stopped there.

He dropped acid one time. Just once. 
He took at and discovered himself in a great hall. I’m talking infinitely large. With an infinitely large table running down the middle. (How he knew how big the room and table were?- great question and I never thought of it until now. I’ll ask him soon.). 

He heard the great booming voice of what he knew to be an angel. The angel said something like “don’t you ever do this again” and *snap* just like that he wasn’t tripping anymore. 

More of a cool tripping story than a cool blind story I reckon.

While I had many complaints, it was overall a very positive and helpful experience. There were clients from a variety of backgrounds with a variety of skill-levels, ranging from ""terrified of stairs"" to ""send them to the next town because that's the only challenging assignment left"", and it seemed to me that both ends of the spectrum and those in between gained from the experience.

The exact combination of student and instructor probably matters a great deal, though I noticed something about which students wound up with which instructors that makes me think they might deliberately try to predict who would gain most from which instructor, assuming more than one has an opening. Maybe it was just a coincidence, though.

Basically, it was very helpful, and do keep in mind that they aren't going to fix everything in a client's life, just give them the tools to work on it themselves.

I registered a GMail account in her name and added a Google Voice number to it. I also associated her landline number with the Google Voice account. I got her a prepaid phone so I wouldn't have to maintain a monthly bill.

I hooked the phone up to the house WiFi, and I installed an app called GVoice Callback.

I configured GVoice Callback to log in to her Google Voice account, I specified the callback number as her landline number, and I enabled ""Outgoing call integration"".

Then I entered all her contacts into her GMail account, names and phone numbers and synchronized the phone with her Gmail account to bring in all the contacts.

So now, she can use the tactile button on the Samsung phone to activate Google Assistant and say, ""OK, Google, call John Smith"".

The GVoice Callback app intercepts the call, and sends a request through the WiFi for Google Voice to ring her back on her landline, and when she answers, it proceeds to call John Smith from her landline.

This way, she doesn't have to learn the intricacies of a touch screen, and she can answer and hang up her landline phone with the tactile buttons she's used to.

We used the bus or taxis or bummed rides or walked.     I was already in college when my brother got his license so that issue didn't hit me, either.   I did see it as an 'opening up' of options for my mom who could then MAYBE get a ride to the grocery or whatnot.   I wasn't there to know if that happened.   

My mentality was shaped around autonomy and use of resources at hand.   In brutal reality,   I couldn't have afforded a car and insurance but  I could walk nearly anywhere I needed to go and knew the skeletal bus system like it was a part of me.

I'm the latter category. My dreams are very much still fully visual for the most part. I lost my sight only about ten years ago. They have always been completely vivid and too real. In fact after I lost my sight I was having confusing dreams of waking up with my sight again and my dreaming mind wourd rationalize that I was blind only part of the time, not realizing dreams weren't real.

I had sight in only one eye all my life, my sight in one was lost when I was still a baby so mydreams reflect that even today.

I have had some incredibly vivid nightmares including one where I was killed by being hit by a car and the dream continued aftert he fact where I saw my own body. Otherwise my nightmares are pretty run of the mill, being chased by things, ones where someone is trying to do unsolicitied things to me, the like.

Schools are notorious for not working with you. My father got really good at demanding for things. In the right situations he can deal with situations very trumplike. Hahaha! They often wouldn’t would not want to work with him, make excusses. I was criticized and was lacking here and there so I didn’t need these things or wasn’t benefiting from things they were giving me. They wanted any excuse to take it away. I was the smart leader type kid bored in school. So, part of it was laziness, but there was a lot of excuse finding. My father shouted them down until they turned blue. He asked for too much but because he kept at it, they gave. I had a set of braille books at school and one at home. Yes, they ordered me two, my father made them. They also in high school came to our house and installed Jaws. Hahaha! Some district people came over for tutoring. One of the higher level came too I think. I forgot why, but I think she was some type of administrator. I hated to go to my IEPS because they were loud, everyone turned in to my father souting and to an extent making them, bullying them in to submission. They felt so threatened that they hired two policeman. He wouldn’t ever get violent, but... they felt it.

Otherwise it’s hard work, you just have to go at it and deemand it and make them. The state of California and the education department in Sacramento knew who my father was, and was probably afraid of him. He had all the He said she said notes.

My wife called at 1:30 on this date, and Jules South said this to my wife.

Very specific details. We talked for this long, very exact words was written down.


Only 1 request wasn’t given to him. He moved districts for 3 months and moved back. That time he wanted an L shaped desk for me, pretty unnecessary. He hired a few lawyers throughout the years.

I got books in to sets, throughout all grades my father would have it absolutely no other ways. “She’s not bringing braille volumes around, end of story, you better do it, I will complain to your superintendent”

I had jaws as I told you, My father fought for training in a braille notetaker. I had one throughout high school.I had many equipment, I had everything. That’s the only way dad wanted it!

Before answering though, I would absolutely recommend contacting the VA in your area and ask if a soldier with sight loss would like to talk to you for the sake of research. I am sure someone would be, and not many people have the courage to talk about someone’s blindness and ask questions. I haven’t met anyone so far who minds answering questions about their vision, but losing eyesight in battle is something I cannot imagine and it is heartbreaking. 

My vision loss was tied to symptoms of a brain tumor so I was very scared for other reasons.  I got new glasses that didn’t work after 2 weeks, but I went to renew my drivers license (even though I didn’t drive then) and I started crying in the MVD bc I couldn’t read the top line.  Anyway, the most upsetting thing was being suddenly unable to work.  I used a computer and my employers did everything possible to accommodate my sight.  They even tinkered with the graphics on their proprietary software but it didn’t work. 

When I realized I couldn’t support myself I went through pretty intense depression.  I had a lot of surgeries, lumbar punctures and awful drugs and they actually upset me much, much, more than sight loss.  My adult kids supported me through it all and I love and appreciate them but feeling dependent on them financially was also depressing. 

Another factor that has been emotionally difficult is the process of rehabilitation. I have an independent living teacher, a vocational counselor and a technology teacher.  I went to visit a residential program that wasn’t my cup of tea so the process is slower.  It took almost 2 years to get the ball rolling on my training and their resources are so stretched I only see the teachers about once every 2 months.  This has been emotional because even though Im laid back I stay pissed off and frustrated with it.

I guess my sight loss in general hasn’t been a huge emotional factor, there are some good things emotionally.  I am actually less self conscious because I can’t see when people are gawping at me.  I am braver about speaking up and asserting myself instead of being timid and passive.   I have grown in confidence by learning to navigate streets and my profanity at drivers cutting me off or blocking pedestrian lanes has become eloquent and Im not averse to smacking bumpers or car doors of people who nearly run me over.

Sorry if this is a too much info, I tend to ramble on with voiceover. ��

you are terrified in much the same way that a bird would be terrified at the prospect of never being able to fly again or a dolphin never being able to use echo location. these animals would probably look at how we live and pitty us. and yet we do not share their terror because not being able to fly or use echo-location is the only existence we have ever known.

-

your daughter will not miss being able to see because she wont know what it means to have good vision. the biggest barriers she will face are from the social stigmas of having a visible disability. 


&gt; Will she be able to work?

yes, with the proper training and the proper direction she should be able to do all sorts of things you wouldn't expect. this includes working.

&gt; Will the work be the same as a sighted person, or will she have to choose a job better suited to her abilities?

sadly, she will be limited in the kinds of work she can do but you already knew that. she will never be a professional basketball player. the good news is that technology is getting better and better. **accessibility** is becoming a major concern for people who develop software and other technologies. by the time your daughter is in highschool i suspect most computers will have very robust accessibility software that will allow her to use all sorts of devices without the use of her vision. this will open up a lot of possibilities for her. 

-

look up some youtube videos on NDVA and JAWS. these are software packages that allow blind people to use a computer. they aren't perfect but they do get better every year. you should learn how to use them so that when your daughter is ready to start using a computer you will know how to teach her. start her young.

&gt; Is it hard to find work in your chosen field, as a blind person?

yes. there is no sugar coating that. the only thing you can do is build a strong strategy that will give her some advantages early. 

Is higher education a possibility?

yes. like i said earlier, accessibility is a big issue right now and a lot of major players like microsoft and apple are making a big push for it. i was close friends with a blind woman in university. it was definitely more challenging for her but she managed to finish her diploma.",,,7,0,0,

e93dd991-f219-4fac-abb7-1a4632d53848,1530571964,"I understand where you are coming from and it makes logical sense to look at the science, however, in this case we are looking at the law. The Air Carriers Access Act ACAA is the law that the Department of Transportation DOT is interpretting with its regulations. The ACAA does not directly address the service animal issue. It simply states that air carriers cannot discriminate against passengers with disabilities, must provide said passengers with reasonable accommodations unless the accommodation poses a safety or health risk to others or poses an undue hardship on the air carrier. This has been interpreted to mean that people with disabilities who have a service animal should be allowed to fly with that animal. 

If I apply your thoughts to this law it would mean that not all people with disabilities would be treated equally. Not necessarily a bad thing. The definition of disability in the ADA is extremely broad. There are something like 292 disabilities out there. It would be a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability that requires a service animal, an animal that performs an assistive task for that person, to travel with said animal. However, it would not be reasonable to accommodate people with disabilities who have ESAs that do not perform a task but only provide emotional support. The risk to reward balancing might support this argument, but I’m not sure the science would. While the science can’t prove the benefit of having an ESA, I’m not sure if there have been any studies done showing the benefit of a service animal except through observation and surveys. If we are basing our arguments on science it seems to me that we are comparing apples to oranges. This is why I lean more towards allowing service animals and ESAs, as long as they are well behaved. 

I think that addressing behavior is the way to get around the threat to safety of others that the air carriers are concerned with. I think it would get really tricky to legally argue that some threats to safety are more acceptable than others. Furthermore, there would be people with ESAs claiming discrimination based on the type of disability they have. Why should they be discriminated against if their ESA can be shown to be as safe as other service animals?

I do agree that it seems like a lot of people are using this as a backdoor way to be able to travel with their pets. This is unfortunate and selfish. In my opinion. 

Great points though about the science and thank you for making me think through the legal type arguments. I’m sorry if I’m boring you with the legalities lol",,,1,0,0,

What your daughter can do depends on her and on you. She will face unique challenges, but with support, work, and some luck, she'll be able to do anything she wants to do, within reason. She might not be a professional baseball player or a pilot, but she can be a teacher, writer, journalist, musician, salesperson, programmer, personal trainer, athlete, lawyer, researcher, mogul, librarian, social worker, government worker, or politician, and that's only mentioning professions that I actually know of blind people currently doing.

For blind people, certain skills are very important. Even if she turns out to have some remaining sight, she should learn braille and you should err on the side of giving her a cane. Don't try to protect her too much, let her explore her environment. Many blind people are socialized into helplessness by fearful or embarrassed parents. Don't be the parent that encourages her to ""pass"" as sighted when she would be able to do more using the appropriate blind method, whether it's reading with braille or a screen reader or using a cane to navigate.

I'm sorry this happened, as blindness does complicate things in life and she, and you by extension, will face discrimination. But there are worse thigns to have than blindness, like chronic pain and certain cognitive disabilities. Keep your perspective and develop a sense of humor. Read about blind people and what they do and maintain high expectations of her. Give her the resources to develop her own solutions to common issues. If she's losing shoes, ask if she'd like a special shoe rack or if she can come up with other solutions, like using an app. It's critical that, as she grows, she keeps a feeling of control and agency. She'll need to be a technologist and a diplomat just to do what sighted people take for granted, but becoming those things has their own advantages.

There’s already schools that teach this, they really just need to standardize the curriculum and agree upon a standard identity card. It’s unfortunate that something like this is even necessary because not only blind people benefit from service animals.  Guide dogs for the blind are readily identifiable, emotional support and service dogs for people with other special needs should be as easily identifiable Because there’s always going to be some special snowflake who has to have her pocket dog with her no matter how badly trained it is and at least this way it would be possible to filter out the snowflakes - which hopefully will make things easier for people who have a genuine need.

Having one certification standard would make it easier to keep an eye on certified service animals, I don’t think you can put a specific timeline on “recertification”. Much of that depends on the owner and how well they maintain the training and the dog itself. That’s why guy dog puppies go through such rigourous training, to make sure that they’re suitable before they even start training as adults.

As others on here have said definitely find out your state’s rehabilitation institution. In Florida, where I am, it is The Florida Division of Blind Services. They have been extremely helpful and provide a lot of support for getting you on track to a career. They can even help pay for your education. They also bought me a Macbook Pro with voiceover, a scanner, and a printer. These are all things that will help me in acheiving our shared goal of self sustainability. They also got me mobility training and the mobility teacher showed me around the campus and helped me map out and strategize where my classes are. They also can pay for your books.

At the school you will want to work with disability services. With a receipt of your books and some paperwork you should be able to get your books in alternative formats. I chose PDF versions of the books and use the Voice Dream App on my ipad to have the books read to me. It is a really useful app. Takes some getting used to, but once you’re used to it it is excellent. You can even ask for the school’s office of disability services or the rehab institution of the state to break the books up into the assigned readings. Pages 11-34 for example, can be put into one file. This way you don’t have to try and figure out what page to stop on, or on what page to begin.

You also need to learn to be a good advocate for yourself. A lot of people will ask you what you need rather than make suggestions, so be prepared. Extra time for exams and assignments, notetakers, scribes, readers, even a private room for testing are all reasonable accommodations. If your school has the capability of recording classes and giving you access to the recorded lectures you may want to ask for that as well. This is what I receive in lieu of a note taker. Be prepared for some push back because some schools want to do the minimum required. If this is the case get what you can and then use your improvements as reasons why more accommodations would help to maximize your potential. 

When it comes to giving presentations or speaking. I’ve been working on listening to a pre-recorded script while talking. Kind of like tele prompting but audio rather than visual. I’ll put a bluetooth earbud in my ear and hold a remote in my hand that connects with my phone or ipad and play the recording. I like to use prompts rather than a full script . So it will read me the key points in my ear that I read aloud then I get into detail about it. Then i hit play for the next point and talk about it, and so on. Super helpful. I can hide the earbud with my hair and most people don’t notice the remote if I am at the podium so it looks really natural and a lot of people are impressed that I don’t use notecards. However, listening to something while speaking takes some skill. You have to start with the audio slowed down and talk along with it. Then you can slowly build up speed. No one has ever denied me this accommodation.

Licensing boards are more or less exempt from ADA requirements and can deny someone a license on the basis of disability if, in the board’s opinion, the individual is unable to perform the tasks associated with the profession in question, at least that’s the explanation I was given. 

I will also say that Virginia is known for its draconian laws. For example, I could not become a LCSW because schools were unable to place me for fieldwork because all state agencies require either a driver’s license for employment and/or presentation of the title of one’s car proving full ownership. I could go on and on about the laws here, but that’d be getting off topic. 

In your husband’s case, I’d suggest contacting the board and asking just to be safe. Clinical psychology is known for its sometimes insane licensing requirements; however, VA is the only state I’m aware of that’s so restrictive.

bf5caaf8-41bd-41a5-9f5e-dd738c577b1c,1530582408,"Well to your point about feeling mohr comfortable with a dog as opposed to a cane, I found myself wishing for the cane once I'd used a dog for a while. While nobody will ask for your cane's name, it won't poop on the floor either.
This is purely my subjective opinion, so take it with a whole shaker of salt, but if you're not comfortable in your own skin, a dog won't help much. The dog will be of little to no help without a foundation of good mobility skills, and there's a lot you can do with a cane. While a dog can find a door, it can't tell you what side the handle's on, nor can it tell you how high up the knob is.
Don't get me wrong, the dog can be great if you have the disposition for it, but it isn't a magic cure for the insecurity that blindness can bring. I'm not saying this to be a jerk, just relaying my own experience.
Also, prepare to be left behind by uber drivers a lot. Uber wasn't a thing when I was a handler, but my friends who have dogs have a lot of trouble because Uber drivers will see the dog and bail on them.
I really hope you make the right decision for yourself in regards to getting a dog. If you are an animal person, and if you have patience, you may have a good experience. Many people seem to love their dogs and do very well. My opinion is just the rantings of one random internet stranger, so like I said, take it with a grain of salt.

By the time I was 19, I was being pushed into a school to learn how to be blind, learning cane use, learning screen readers, adaptive cooking, all sorts of stuff.

Except the mobility instructors, two of them are awful at their jobs and one is a really shitty person who deserves to be fired, I cannot recommend the Carroll Center in Newton, Massachusetts enough.

I learned fencing, orientation, computer use, smart phone use, woodworking, cooking, all sorts of things and it was amazing. Excluding mobility, I never felt like they pushed too far or too hard, plus they have mandatory group and individual counseling which, honestly, I really needed. With it, though, I became much more confident in myself as a blind person.

There, we talked about the stages of grief, and about how you can yo-yo between them. You can accept it and love yourself and your life one day, but be raging at the world for the injustice of having to deal with blindness the next, and the day after just be depressed and bargaining. There is no requirements on how you deal with the trauma, because that's what it is.

I'll be the first to tell you that being blind can fucking suck. It can be awful, people will sometimes treat you like scum or try to take advantage of you, they'll doubt you, infantalize you, but there's also the good.

Your friend may do well with at least initially some job that allows them to duck out of the way of needed and can help them learn the lay of the land.

e93dd991-f219-4fac-abb7-1a4632d53848,1530578414,"Thank you for sharing. Your point speaks to mine about the guide dog that bit another service animal in the face. The other service animal was a pit bull who did nothing but back away from the guide dog. The point was made that the guide dog will still be allowed on flights because it is a labrador while the pit bull is banned on Delta because of its breed. The guide dog likely came from a school while the pit bull was handler trained, mind you the handler had years of dog training experience. Goes to show it is the handler and not the dog or other animal that is the problem. 

I do not have a guide dog, but I am considering getting one. Can you tell me which schools the poorly behaved guide dogs you know came from? I know I’m contradicting myself asking about the school that trained the dog, but just because the handler is more important doesn’t mean that the school and training is a null factor. Lol Also, where did the guy with the well behaved guide dog go to school?

I agree that there has been a lot of abuse, but I also see the value in guide dogs. I still have some usable vision and am considering a guide dog because I think I would be more comfortable in new experiences if I had a guide. I also think I’d feel more comfortable going out with my sighted friends if I had a guide dog. This way my friends don’t have the responsibility of checking in on me. I think I would feel more independent. The guide dog could also guide me around chairs and signs that I sometimes miss with the cane. And if I get separated from my friends I can tell the dog to find them, can’t ask the cane to find things. Lol Dogs can also guide towards door handles to help avoid feeling around awkwardly for the handle. And, lots of people like dogs and they are a good conversation starter, most people don’t ask you what your cane’s name is. Lol 

That being said, I am a bit apprehensive primarily because of the travel issues. I do not look forward to being discriminated against because I am traveling with a service animal. Nor do I wish to encounter another service animal or ESA that is poorly behaved. I do not know how I would react if another dog bit my dog in the face, but it’s safe to say that no one, least of all me, wants to find out. 

I also think it would be nice to have a license to show the legitimacy of my service animal if I choose to get one. ",,,1,0,0,

Well, why don't we just kill ourselves? The short answer is that life continues to be worth living after blindness. Of course, some people do respond as you're suggesting, not seeing past the immediate difficulties of dealing with blindness. Think about the stories you've heard of people who end their lives after breaking up with their romantic partner in their teens. They don't have the experience or the breadth of perspective to put life after that dramatic incident into context. Because life is now unimaginable, they find it not worth living. There is also an element of revenge or anger at the world or at the reality they face. Because reality has dealt them an existential blow, they attack reality by ending it, at least as far as they are concerned.

Don't end your reality. Give yourself time to develop the perspective you need to find enjoyment in life after blindness. Blind people, as we will be happy to tell you whereever you go, lead full lives. It's not always easy, I'm not promising you that. You'll experience grief at the loss of your sight and probably also discrimination from others. You are, after all, discriminating against people with the condition of blindness through the subtext of your question. But if you give it a chance to, that will pass, and you will realize that the unimaginable is imaginable, and in fact is your life.

I'm here for you if you want to send me a message. There are also many people who would likely be willing to provide support in your community. Your stance is not an unreasonable one given the shock and loss you must be feeling. For now, you might just have to take it on faith that life will be worth living after the this happens. But, if you open to it, you will find it worth living on the other side.

For this reason, some blindness advocates are against this practice as it risks misrepresenting the community, and /u/3eb826fc-ba3d-4af5-b032-34a45320bd62 is right to advise a lot of caution in equating blindfolds or special glasses with the lived experience of visual impairment. 

From a neuroscientific perspective, people who have been blind for a long time don't just have more practice in getting around without vision. Their brains are often adapted to process sounds and touch in ways that brief deprivation can't duplicate. (Abstract example: What we call dark is the absence of vision; it might not even make sense to say that blindfolding yourself gives you the same basic sensory experience as someone who has never seen.)

Having said all that, I think the general experience of relying on your nonvisual senses is actually pretty valuable! Just bear in mind the many caveats about considering it a mile walked in a blind person's shoes.

Low-effort start: It's a little janky, but if you can get past the nagging popup messages, an organization called See Now takes you to any Google Street View, but filtered through one of three reasonably rendered possible visual disorders (adjustable in severity): https://simulator.seenow.org/

Edit: another low- to medium effort option is not necessarily blinding yourself, but getting used to using your phone's accessibility features. Got an iPhone? Turn on VoiceOver and see how quickly you can use it without ever turning on the screen, and how high you can crank your text-to-speech speed. That will familiarize you with an aspect of many blind folks' everyday interaction with the world.",,,4,0,0,

But you have to decide that, probably, life will be worth it, even if you don't know how right at the moment. Making that choice is almost self-determining, if you can take that leap, then you'll have given yourself the space and time you need to make it come true.

I think it's not unreasonable for everyone to be giving you hotline numbers. But, at least in my own case, what you probably need now is people telling you, ""I went through this and I'm ok."" Well, I still have some vision left, and my transition happened gradually rather than all at once, which is much more traumatic. But I will say that, to the extent that our situations are the same, I went through this and I'm OK. You will be OK too, if you give it time.

This might not be what you need right now, but I'll put it in your head and maybe you'll think of it later. It really helps develop a purpose and to serve something larger than yourself, like a cause, an organization, or some precious people. Like Nietzsche said, ""He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."" Right now, you might be thinking, ""Well, I'll be blind, so how can I do anything with myself?"" You can't see from here how you'll be able to serve a purpose because you don't know yet how blind people live and do stuff. Hell, I'm writing this to you now, as are all the people here, and I can program a computer and give a speech, and what else do you need to be able to do in the world to affect change but to do even one of those things?

Anyway, give yourself some time. You can always kill yourself later, after all. (Though I recommend against doing that.) And keep a lookout for a purpose. If you can develop a sense of humor and a lot of perspective, that's even better.

My original thought was to just flat out give some kind of dom representation of the room.

    &lt;div tabindex=""0"" data-type=""room"" id=""room-a""&gt;
        &lt;!--actual coordinates might not matter--&gt;

But while that might work well for a static layout, or just allowing you to see the map in general, that's probably not going to be a great experience during play if a guard is running into and out of a room and keeps interrupting your focus.

Probably in that case I want something closer to a regular activity stream, or maybe even just a set of really quick audio queues for something entering/leaving the room and a shortcut to say ""focus me on whatever element just changed.""

What I'm thinking is that if you're blind, the experience I'm shooting for should be a bit like playing those old-school text adventures. You'll have a description of whatever room you're in, and shortcuts to take common actions or target actors in the room. The big difference of course being that Reset Hard is a real time game, so I won't know until I start testing how chaotic things are going to get.

People may think less of you if you're blind, or disabled in general, that's just how our world is.

The thing that's worked for me is to prove them wrong, consistently.

I've lost out on a few chances due to being blind, but I also snuck it in to the first conversation I had with my fiance, and 18 months later we've pushed eachother past any limits we thought we may have.

I didn't do this by being typical though. Between an average guy, and an average guy that is blind, you're a few points behind. Between an average guy, and a guy that's blind and loves to hike, skydive, go white water rafting, rock climbing, and traveling, you're going to be miles ahead, and not being able to drive won't be nearly as big of a factor.

For the first year of our relationship, neither one of us drove, we just Ubered everywhere. She's not from my area and doesn't have a car in the area.

Well, my family had a spair truck, so we gave her the keys to that, and now she's our DD. Also recently got her a Mini Cooper, a convertible like I love, and a small car like she loves. Best of both worlds, for both of us.

We have far more resources to get around these stereotypes than we used to.   How we use, or not, those resources is up to us, but vanity for personal reasons versus social ones is definitely a topic people with disabilities get stuck with sorting out.     This is a good opener for a semester's worth of discussions.   


My own take on fashion just for the fun of it.
My closet has very little solid colors in it.   When the cataract was 'inoperable' I made sure I had the full range of tie dye, vivid colors and my trademark retina-damaging patterns so I'd have at least some sense that my clothes matched me for a few years after I could no longer see them.    I've never been particularly dull but I had a young son.  No way was I going to get fixed into some conservative navy pantsuit for his important milestones.     

I did, finally get the surgery.  I have a reprieve of unknown duration.   I'm gently phasing out the rest of the monocolor items or pairing them with appropriate torment for my own gleeful pleasure.   I've been designing and installing tattoos, too.  No way somebody's gonna be able to quietly drop those in the good will bin when they ship me off to the nursing home.

Regarding the visual aids, it's possible she can see them with the aid of a magnifier or other device, or might be totally blind and require someone, you or a fellow classmate or her TVI, to describe them.

Lots of my nightmares revolve around me being a passenger in a car without much sight, just glare from the headlights. The fear stems from the feeling, the sensation of movement is very strong for me, falling, speeding, starts and quick turns are very clear. The driver sometimes disappears, and I've never driven, so that's terrifying. Sometimes they just become distracted and I can sense them veering. 
I don't know how many sighted people dream about monsters, so I'm not sure how many blind people will have insight about that either. I don't smell things, but I do hear voices and feel the wind and stuff of that nature. Dreams that have a daytime setting have a varying amount of visual feedback. I don't see very much, faces I've seen in magnified photos are the most common.

If you're our and shout with your cane you're already defying the stereotype that blind folks stay in because they have no jobs or family or social lives.    The sooner you're comfortable with your cane, the better.   Further vision loss will have less impact. 

On the job part, I grew up with tech minded blind folks who did exactly what you're doing as a career path.   We're in our late 40's to early 60's, now.    Tech was primitive and assistive tech was infantile.   In the early 80's, one friend told a story about needing a hardware upgrade assist and having a colleague come over to his house to help out.    Helper was shocked to discover that my friend's system had no monitor.   Why should it?    

Take a deep breath and consider that what you're doing is a lot easier to adapt than many other careers.   You still have time to experiment and find the right tech fits for your needs.   Even if you wait, the solutions are out there and more are coming out.     The advantage to starting now is that any issues you discover can be worked on before you absolutely need them to work.

Consider that your expertise base might put you in a place that would be beneficial to many other users without your skills or even colleagues who unexpectedly find themselves in your shoes.   We never know how much we help others just by solving our own problems. 

On the social thing.   I was a lot less secure when I was younger. I used to get really scared in large groups or loud places.  I waa clingy with friends and it made us all uncomfortable.     

I've worked on those issues and found solutions but found its more stereotype than just my personal situation that caused problems.   So, I've given up trying to reassure others that I can keep up.   I make sure I have supports in place so a concert or street fair is possible whether my friends want to go or not or if I get separated from them, for example.   

Friendship shouldn't have to include resumes.   Few of my friends know how to use a cane or arrange my art supplies or how to assess a medical crisis all of which are essential skills I have which I've adapted to suit my vision limits.  Focus on commonalities and when accessibility issues come up, handle them with dignity and honesty.  Some people handle this better than others.   You will find true friends you never  imagined and maybe lose someone you thought would be a bff.    Welcome people into your life who don't try to kill you (out of carelessness or intentionally) and offer them the same thoughtfulness in return.   The rest will work out.   

This is definitely not the end of your life.   Just a change in how you live it.

With a pencil or disk tip, unless you hit the puddle, it's unlikely you'll notice. I don't like pencil tips, the sound isn't as obvious as a disk tip, but that's more personal preference. I exclusively use a marshmallow tip, though, because it's the most convenient to me.

Some experience is very bad, some of them very good. Some of them somewhere in the middle. Some counselors will do absolutely anything to help, some of them will want to provide you with not much, set up with whatever work they find convenient and send you off on your way, suggesting you don’t even go to school. You don’t want to do this! Hahahaha!

I didn’t even begin on being a successful student, I just gave you an accommodations list. 



Goal setting is important and accomplishable goals is necessary. What you don’t want to do is set a goal like study to be a police officer. I saw a post on here a while back. You’ll be disappointed, you won’t ever do that. It just, isn’t feasible! I am training to be a pilot! That’s absurd but okay. Be ready to be disappointed and don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. Hahahaha! Setting goals that you can work on checking off is important. And in education having a bigger goal this can go towards is super important. Not expecting others to direct your step for you is useful. Go in ready to do what you need to do. Too many students expect people to guide and spoon feed them, and have no idea. Some expect others to make up their mind for them. Yeah, don’t be one of those people. People don’t actually like it or find you easy to work with. You need to understand what you want or don’t expect people to, I think people expect others to understand what they need when they don’t know themselves.

Be assertive, even if you’re naturally just not assertive. Communication is so important. Learning to speak up for your needs, and how necessary it is is essential. You can not be ashamed of asking for help. I think advocating and learning how to express polite of how abled and capable and communicate how this is possible for us is important. Most people except for some people are actually open to learn about you, but there is actually so little understanding about blindness. Be ready to education and watch them be absorb the information. Push for what you need, sometimes pressure is important here.

Make friends and have fun. You’d be surprised just how far a few connections and friendships can get you. Take the time to say hi, stand at the counter and take time to get to know someone. It will help. May get you somewhere.

Is it possible that your view on emotional support animals might stem from the bad examples set forth by people who pass off their pets as emotional support animals? I think that the fake emotional support animals are the ones that weaken support for true service animals.                                                                                      I think the biggest issue is the poor behavior exhibited by these animals. 

It is my opinion that emotional support animals should be welcomed on planes, if they can exhibit excellent behavior. That being said, the animal’s behavior has more to do with the handler than the animal. I recently heard about a guide dog that lunged at, and bit another dog. Guide dogs and other service animals have excellent training, but if the handler doesn’t keep up on enforcing the rules even guide dog’s can be poorly behaved.

If there are not as many safety risks in Canada I’m very curious to know the protocols. ",,,1,0,0,

My ophthalmologist offered to “write a letter” that would give me an exemption.  I think this was very irresponsible and even immoral considering I was about 20/600 and 20/900 at that time.  Which may explain some drivers.

20/200 or less in best correctable eye is what will definitely be considered legally blind, but that is only a measure of visual acuity.  Other factors might be loss of % of field of vision, etc.  Some kinds of visual impairment can be compensated for with magnification, mirrors and the like.

I am on another subreddit and I told them and I’ll tell anyone I hate it when blind people or others make blindness out to be something difficult, or a big deal. Or focuses on it. I am on here to help but blindness isn’t really a major thing in life.

I am more independent then most. I lost all my sight at 8 was born with what some people think is scalio-hypoplasia, I think or peter’s anomali. I dont have the mental part of peter’s anomali if I have it. I’ve done a lot in life.

Is higher Education possible. Well I’ve been doing it for 7 years.. Political Science and communications major. So not easy majors. I brought some books to school and these were thick books. Someone said they looked smart. I was once a philosophy major. If I have the time I like some philosophy. I also studied some psychology. I take an interest in that. I was an English major and have an AA degree in English creative writing. Yes! I get usually no lower grades then bs for the exception of a few classes. I am known as the model student, and have been asked to represent disabled students and to give advice. I’ve even ran for ASB and won that in Elementary school I was ASB president. Probably could win in University, I was asked to fulfill senate seat a couple years ago. I was too busy and turned it down. I was mainstreamed all my life. I went to a blind school for 3 weeks in the summer for summer camp and was bored.. I think I went to a half day blind school thing but that was when I was 5. Blind school told my parents we won’t take her. She’s too smart.

No need for blind schools really if you don’t want it, don’t baby her, treat her like any normal child. Adapt some things but she’s nothing special, just a kid with no sight. Not mentally challenged. She can do anything if she puts her mind to it.

Back to school I wasn’t quite top of my class but I was fairly close I think I had a GPA of 3.4 weighted 3.6 or 3.7. No I wasn’t valedictorian for sure, but I wasn’t stupid. I wasn’t actually popular, was sort of a jerk of a kid and like telling others how to do things, where to go, even figuratively. Hahaha! I wrote on the school newspaper. Went to different rooms delivered them, yes, on my own. I actually was this teacher ta/delivery gal in high school. He would send me off with his papers and I delivered them. But back to the newspaper, I was a respected writer on it, and well read. Someone told me I was well read, well-respected, People pointed my articles out to friends, passed my articles around, ETC... No one bothered to tell me, but that was what happened. I found years later. Someone told me semi-recently. I was ignored but found out people remembered me as the smart one, who people envied and wanted to be, teachers liked me. I was known as really intelligent. 

Can we get a job. Many blind people have gotten jobs. I haven’t applied but I did a job at one point testing software. I did this as a volunteer a few times. No special job is necessary. May it be harder, but is it possible yes. The more normal, the easier it is.

I’ve lead groups in person and online.

I’ve gone surfing and that I had help with but if I had better balance not much help is required. Iceskated. What impressed most people, is I got on the iceskating rink and never really fell, not often, and the first go I never fell.

I am well traveled I travel around the entirety of LA county and also orange county. I know La much better, but I could figure out orange county if you gave me a few minutes with an app. But You can drop me off at a random place in LA and say okay now go home, Absolutely no problem. I’ve eaten at a lot of places in La County by my self too. I travel independently. People ask me if I can get home or where is my parents or helper, and I don’t need one. Hahaha! I have built a nice four square pages too!

I’ve lived in San Francisco for a bit in a dorm, no roommate, did everything myself. I know the San Francisco city pretty well, but regretably not the bay area. I got out and started exploring a bit late. I absolutely don’t need to be tought a route before I go, I just use my phone and go at it. I love trying new places. I love food. Hahahaha!

I can use most technology, and I am a techy and I love and set up audio equipment. I love social media. It surprises people, but yeah. I am extremely extroverted so I am on all of them. I use about 3 or 4 regularly.

Figure out traits for him, and hobbies. Personality isn’t everything, but can be useful here. 

Maybe he’s a more feminine boy, can he sit and read, get him more access to books or other less physical activities. Maybe he’s more creative and enjoys art. There’s clay, ceramics, music, ETC....  Maybe more masculine, and like some of the outdoors sports I mentioned.

My current thinking is that credentials should be given to animals that graduate from an accredited school. And anyone with a self trained service animal or ESA should have to pass a field test, in which a field agent (trained in animal behavior) comes out to the individual to observe the animals interactions in public settings. Based on that observation the agent grants or denies the credentials. This way we can help mitigate the safety risk these animals pose. 

One issue with my solution is where will the money come from for such a program. The ESA and self trained service animal handlers? This could help fund the program and deter pet owners who don’t think their pets will pass.

I lost a great deal of my vision last year (at age 38) after an acute medical emergency.  At first it was completely dehabilitating, but I wasn’t focusing on it as much due to my physical health problems.  Once I began feeling better physically, it hit me like a ton of bricks.  It will take time and effort for your father to settle into the new normal of his life.  

First of all, make sure your father has access to mental health care if he needs it, because I grieved the loss of my vision almost like losing a loved one—I was angry, afraid, unrealistic, but I grew to accept it over time.  
Next, get him in to see a neuro-ophthalmologist for a second opinion and a low vision specialist to help learn how to accommodate his disability with technology and other aids.  Connect him with resources.  He will likely be referred to orientation and mobility training, which will help him regain a lot of his mobility and capability to navigate in unfamiliar environments.  The Library of Congress offers free audio books and magazines to the visually impaired.  There are tax breaks for the blind and I'm not sure of his age, but blindness qualifies you for Social Security Disability automatically.

I was declared legally blind in my mid-20’s, used a cane for a little while because I thought it was what I was supposed to do, but then I put it away because I “didn’t need it.” That was fine, until my vision started getting worse again, so I pulled it out &amp; started using it. It’s been necessary for a while now, and even though I know I need it and feel safer when I do, I still question. 

There are people out there who will be jerks because of your vision loss, as indicated by your cane. There will be a lot of people who don’t care. There will be people who want to help you. Sure, there might be times that you don’t get invited or don’t get the promotion because people think being blind means you’re not fun or can’t do things, but there’s going to be times when you prove them all wrong. 

Technology has come a long way, and adaptive software is much more common, so you shouldn’t have trouble doing your job/classes. It takes a bit of adjustment, but so does any new task. 

And, really, do you want friends who won’t include you because of your cane? They sound ignorant and like not good friends. 

I’m 40 now, have been legally blind for over 15 years, have gone through several experiences of vision loss. I have a full-time job, a house, a family, and a bunch of friends, sighted and not. You’ll do fine!

That’s good don’t be shy about it. The fundamental differences is I don’t think we should gone as far with some issue. My father was willing to buy nothing, and depended on the school.essentially the state to give me anything. The school didn’t give anyone else the Jaws license and had no real need. My father could have bought it. That really wasn’t his responsibility. By my high school years he had a fairly good job. It costs about a 1000 dollars but seriously unethical to ask like that. I am very in between about the two set of books. Probably I could have carried something. Everyone else was carrying something sighted or blind, I carried nothing. While very nice, was it completely necessary, probably not. Realistically I couldn’t carry 4 braille books, they’re large volumes and heavy, but I don’t know....

Many things was reasonable, but also many things was a luxury. Especially my dad wouldn’t buy anything, Even if a braille ruler was 10 dollars 20 at most.

Yes, your daughter will have many different career options and higher education most certainly will be a possibility. 

She’ll likely have to use adaptive techniques and assistive technololgy, but she should be able to go into various areas, especially more white collar jobs where everyone uses computers anyway. It might be best to let her explore her interests and passions and then use trial-and-error to find ways that she can work inthose fields. 

Encourage her to learn different adaptive independant living techniques as early as possible. When she’s at the age where sighted kids start to do chores, encourage her to help around the house as well. Maybe check to see if there is a local organization by/of the blind in your area. 

Also, see if you can get her orientation and mobility (independant travel/cane usage) training as early as possible. Knowing how to move about safely and independantly is a huge confidence booster. 

Are you in the united states? If so, then know that when she starts school (and yes she can go to public school), she’ll need an IEP (individualized education plan) so she can recieve accomodations.

But it is incredibly expensive and for the price they sell it at, I rather invest in IrisVision or NuEyes. 

The advantage of using Lime Lighter is that it would be easy to add mark ups on the music and you use a foot peddle to move stanzas. However, it still has the disadvantages of the repeats I mentioned earlier.

Ideally a light weight durable magnifying sheet that could be flipped/slide towards the top of the music stand would be a better option, especially one that would cover two pages at a time. Flipping up towards the top of the music stand means it’s not likely to hit your instrument (which would be a problem if flip it down and say you’re playing a guitar), and it won’t get in the way of someone else’s music stand if you’re playing in a group, which would happen if you slide the magnification sheet to the right or left.

The reason it needs to be light weight is so if you have to move to another page you can do it quickly without disruption in your performance.

It is common to need to order your books early in advance for your math classes. The frustrating reality is that electronic books just do not work well with most math related textbooks. I would look into enrolling in your state’s vocational rehabilitation program (if you live in the States) and your school’s Disabled Student Program Services. They would be the first place to start in terms of getting your textbooks. Hopefully, the cost of your textbooks will be covered by these groups. If not, I would suggest starting applying for grants and scholarships both big and small to help with the costs. Additionally, be prepared to need to wait an extended period of time to recieve your materials.

Unfortunately, far too many people view blind as a binary, something you are or aren't, without taking in the nuance of people with some vision, lots of vision, little vision, night blindness, etc.

I know at least 4 people who have broken a bone or otherwise somewhat seriously injured themselves because they felt that they didn't need a cane, they could see enough,or they knew the area good enough, or they were out with friends who would help, or some other excuse.

One person fell because they didn't check the side of the ramp and broke their ankle, another broke their collarbone tripping off the edge of the curb, and plenty of bruises, rolled ankles, hurt elbows, and road rash all around.

I won't tell you with any absolutes how people will react, because nobody can. Will some people become raging dicks and presume you're incompetent? Almost definitely. Will people look at you different? Sure. Will employers look at you different? Possibly.

But they also have to realize the limitations. I had a client who was interested in going to the US to get the training, and I was explaining a bit about it to him. He kept saying ""But the guys says it is like seeing again!"". And I explained that it doesn't reproduce sight, but can give him the ability to sense things from a distance. He did some more research and ultimately decided against the training.

My primary concern is safety, especially in regards to drop offs (stairs and streets). I've had many clients who, getting something that marginally improves their eyesight (new sunglasses, iPhone app, etc), decide they don't need a cane anymore and prompt start tripping on things. Because they believe the item has improved their eyesight significantly, although they don't understand the limitations (often when someone is still partially in denial).

That being said, I've met one person who was born without vision and uses echolocation, and his abilities were astounding.

Reposted from /r/windows10 in case someone comes across this sub later or uses Reddit without cross-posting support.

I've taken to carrying an external keyboard around, connected to a laptop via USB. The laptop goes onto a table, or leans against the side of the chair I'm in. This typically provides adequate airflow. To let this work, you have to turn off the sleep-on-lid-close feature in the power section of the windows control panel. You could also use a wireless keyboard if that's your thing.
Edit: While the lid is closed, the screen is disabled, from what I understand. I failed to explain that crucial point earlier.

I have yet to find any feature in Windows to continuously disable the monitor.
There is an internal programming function to disable the screen when there's no activity, but obviously that won't work for your use-case (or mine).
This includes programming and Windows's internal API's.
That being said, I would love if anyone could offer another suggestion.

929293dd-79a7-4adf-9db1-b5c35bba8a59,1532375475,"&gt; When you say follow head to tail is that literal?

Trail riding horses will follow each other at a distance that they feel comfortable, and I'd guess it's very rare that they'd literally be touching head to tail. The rides I've been on the horses are usually about 10-20 feet apart -- less if they're going slow, more if they're going fast. Some horses are slow or lazy and will hold back 100 feet if you let them. I'm no equestrian, but I don't think you could convince a horse to gallop if they don't have enough space in front of them to stop safely. They don't want to crash into another horse any more than you do.

&gt;  I’d love to try horseback riding, but I’d definitely want to gallop.

Horseback riding is really great, and even though I'm fully sighted it's definitely an experience for touch, sound, and smell. I'd advise against tasting, but to each his own!

You may have trouble finding a riding stable that will let you gallop the horse, since it's more dangerous, especially for inexperienced riders. Their insurance may not allow them to, and if you're blind they'll likely be even more hesitant to allow it. You may have better luck if you find a farmer with horses who will let you ride in an enclosed area until both you are comfortable enough to gallop. If there's an equestrian club in your area they might be able to help you find something.

If you go to a riding stable, you should definitely let the stable know when you make your appointment that you're blind and have not ridden before, so they can pick a horse suited to you. They'll have a guide riding a horse in front of you, holding a long rope attached to your horse, so that your horse can be controlled by the guide. That's how they do it for young riders.

As far as I know, horses aren't trained to turn left or right by voice command. You get them to turn by gently pulling their reins to the left or right. You can also get the horse to stop or even walk backward by sitting back in the saddle a bit.

&gt; Lol I just try to ignore it.

Yeah, people can be inconsiderate, but I think that's mostly just their inexperience. If they're not used to working with blind people, or really anything different from what they're used to, there's a good chance they'll speak before they think through what they're saying. I've heard of deaf people being handed braille menus at restaurants, for example. I don't even know what those people think you would have to gain by faking blindness anyway.

&gt; I would worry about showing people that I am blind in a third world country though. Primarily if I was alone.

That's a good point. As a foreigner you're already a target, and if they know you're blind they'll know they won't have to worry about you retaliating with a gun or something, or you being able to identify them as easily if they're arrested later.",,,1,0,0,

That being said, I don't think the market for human testers is very big. A lot of companies are selling automated testing products. I can't speak for the process those companies are using to develop the systems or their testing process.

Many organizations are starting to hire people specifically to keep them compliant with regulations. If an organization accepts federal funding, they need to be compliant, so you see a lot of higher education jobs for web accessibility coordinators or something similar. So if you want, instead of testing for accessibility, you can develop for it. This would definitely involve a lot of testing, but you also need to know how to find the solution.",,,1,0,0,

One strategy is to set standards and regulations for the design of websites and apps so that the are navigable by a blind person skilled in the accessibility tools available. The idea being that a well made website / app should be accessible to blind person with access to VoiceOver / Jaws / NVDA etc., and the skills to use the software. The benefit is that blind people have immediate access to any updates or improvements to the website / app at the same time as the mainstream get them.

Now I'm just a bystander and parts of Voiceover (e.g. effective use of the rotor) are still unknown to me, but I can see that the functionality it gives  to navigate by headings or links or words, for example, would be a lot of work to duplicate in every VI specific app, whereas making mainstream apps / websites accessible to blind people shouldn't be that great an overhead.",,,6,0,0,

I had an ex-girlfriend who would rock, but she would rock a LOT when she was excited or otherwise stressed (She rocked a lot during exams).

For some people with residual visual, they may like looking at sparkly things and lights (I've had a few clients who stare at the sun, something we strongly suggest again). In some cases, those with very low vision may also poke themselves in in the eyes. The pressure causes the nerves in the eyes to fire, and the brain receives some stimulation from it. Long term, it often causes eye damage and a sunken in look for the eyes.

Some younger children also like swings (the ones that swing back and forth, as well as the ones that spin around), because it stimulates the vestibular system. I've literally seen children spend their entire lunchtime on a swing.

Second, you mention not always noticing cues to burp. Honestly, with babies you just have to go through a routine til they’re happy. After you feed your baby, she should be ready for a burp right away. If she doesn’t burp but she seems content, I wouldn’t rock the boat. If she is upset, go through the routine of burping, trying different positions, etc until she becomes content. 

You also mentioned having trouble measuring out bottles. Are you formula feeding? If it’s in your budget, maybe you’d benefit from getting a baby brezza formula maker. I personally used one and it was a godsend. I bought it used and paid half price. You don’t have to do any measuring and there are only a few buttons to use.

We are a college prep school and share a campus with another school (even though we have more student then they do. Its super messed up and the politics are insane. You will have to take my word for it. ) So you would think we would have all the resources we need. But our school district hates us. I’m definitely going to ask about the resources available but I’m not hopeful. Since we are a public exam high school, student have to pass a test to get in. This mean the students whose needs we accommodate are usually along the anxiety and depression track. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of resources already created for other needs. 

No 3D printer or other useful tech. I emailed my principal asking about that and haven’t heard back yet. 

I have a little extra time. The tricky thing is that this is my first time teaching AP world, so I have to prep for the entire course. That means, assignments, lecture notes, tests, quizzes, etc. This is going to take up most of it, especially since I need to have everything done with enough headway to get stuff converted into Braille. I want to help this student but I still have another course to prep for and lots of grading.  Class sizes went up this year too. Yay. I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed. 

I’m in AZ. 

I’ll definitely try your suggestions, thanks!",,,1,0,0,

What you use in the classroom to be successful will change based on how you use your remaining vision.  If you can see,  but need things enlarged or brought closer,  things like a screen sharing program and a monocular may be all you really need in class to keep up.  You might need electronic books as well,  but can always reference the physical book with a magnifier if the graphics don't make sense.  
If you are functionally blind,  that makes things more complex.  Do you know or read braille? Your professor will need to learn to talk in a different way while teaching so that the material isn't gobbled gook. Materials will need to be presented in braille,  of course,  but it really slows down the turn around time for feedback since there isn't a vision teacher to transcribe like in high school.  Learning Ally supposedly does a good job of describing things in books and has professional readers knowledgeable in the subject area read the materials,  so that might be helpful.  
There is certainly a way to reach your goals.  You may just have to push for them a little bit. Be confident in yourself in case other people aren't, you'll have some spare to share.  ",,,2,0,0,

The only thing I disagree about is the message that blind people can do anything a sighted person can do.  I am not a defeatist, and blind people can do amazing things, especially if they have access to technology training and adaptive equipment.  However the reality is different at the lower income level.  Fast food, cashiering, cleaning motel rooms...  it ain’t easy finding an employer that will hire you.   I wish someone would let me work free for a week to demonstrate my ability to work but they just don’t hire.  

My advice is please don’t make a blind character inept, dependent, or give them superpowers. ",,,2,0,0,
