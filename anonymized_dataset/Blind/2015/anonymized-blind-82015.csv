If your overall goal is to promote gardening, and you don't ever plan on moving the garden around then plan the layout carefully. The layout needs to stay the same, all the time, every day, every month. Expanding and changing is nice...for sighted people. 
This includes tools. The rakes, spades, hoes, etc they all need to in the same place all the time. In fact, if this were my project, I'd spend the first day hanging up all the tools and taking them back down and hanging them back up again so I could learn where they all go. It seems too easy to move the fertiliser and bedding pots somewhere else and forget that the people coming to weed can't see where it's been moved to.I'd also leave out roses, and any other plant with thorns, spurs, rickets, etc. Cactus are great to look at but hell to take out of the skin.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1439306890,"1.  NVDA: a free and open source screen-reader to free us from the grasping greedy paymasters who now own Freedom Scientific.  Now anybody can use a computer.  You could expand it to free screen-readers in general, if you want to include Apple's VoiceOver and Google's TalkBack.  The days of paying $12000 for screen-reading software are finally over.  Today, if you're unemployed, you can't get a job without good computer skills.  But if you're unemployed, you can't afford to purchase JAWS to learn those skills.  Finally, free screen-readers have broken that cycle.  

2.  Accessible e-books.  After Amazon was forced to make Kindle accessible, blind people now have access to almost every mainstream title, from textbooks to research references, the day they're published.  Other mainstream e-book shops like iBooks are also accessible, now.  Libraries for the blind do the best they can, but they just don't have the resources to offer every book published, no matter how obscure.  

3.  Online Education courses (also known as MOOCs).  We still have a lot of work to do to make these fully accessible, but that work is slowly, slowly getting done.  Once these are fully accessible, it will cut the price of post-secondary education in half, at least.  It will also mean you can get an education without having to travel.  If you live somewhere where the nearest university is two hours drive away, and can't afford residence, you can get an education anyway over the Internet.  And once you have a degree, you have a slightly larger chance of getting a job.  

I think the three things listed above have, by far, the best chance to help pull the majority of the world's fully blind people out of the grinding poverty many of us are forced to live in now.  Access to low cost computing, low cost e-books, and a low-cost education, can mean access to the world.  And best of all, that access is coming into our reach without having to depend on government hand-outs (government funded JAWS purchases to read books from a charity funded library so we can take government funded education courses).

I think I'm really beginning to understand. I guess practically every object can be simplified: house = box + triangle; book = shallow box; chair = shallow irregular box + sticks... and if you can recognise those simple ingredients then you can develop a vague comprehension of a lot of things. Understanding an object is simply relating it to other simplified shapes maybe. 

Perhaps a misunderstanding a sighted person might have is that 'to see is to witness truth' and that any other interpretation we get when sight is absent must be lacking. And even then, what I see can be totally different to what other people see. Seeing is a simplified interpretation I suppose.

This also being the reason she likes getting help from her mother because she doesn't have too many close friends, maybe. Combing her hair could just be some exchange of mother-daughter affection.

Where do you live? There might be some local resources for blind training (for children, adults, veterans - doesn't matter really which). I mean there *are* local resources thst'll help you get started.
Or maybe you can find a blind person somewhwere random - in your church or sports club or whatnot.
But it'd help immensely if you can hang out with a few different blind/white cane users - maybe help them with something while you silently notice how they do stuff.

Blindness scares so many people.
Let's get quick a few myths busted:
Not everyone that wears a white can is totally blind.
Not all blind people can read braille.
Some have a tunnel vision -with prescription glasses they might see well enough on the eyechart to get most letters, but maybe only one letter at a time, or they might only have peripheral vision on one side, some see some color, most can percieve light so it's easy to know if it's day or night (just close your eyes during daytime vs in a lightless room - I think you can see the difference).

Then there are those with other sensory loss.
For instance in Usher syndrome the person may be born deaf so they rely a lot on vision to lipread etc. Then they start to go blind. That sounds so lonely - so they have to rely a lot more on others' help and technology, cochlear implants etc.
A few of my friends have Usher. Yet we manage to chat in facebook and twitter. I only know they are deafblind because they told me (both twitter and facebook have a lot of blind people by the way).

For clothes - everyone has their likes. Some care a lot, some just pick practical stuff.

And for everything so much depends on whether the person ever saw anything. If they did, it can be tough to adjust. Or easy - it always depends on the person.
And family - there can often be a lot of drama.

I learned Braille in school, so if they're going to change it, they have a responsibility to engage in a massive public awareness campaign.

Some of my blind friends met on a blind date, some thru other means.
A lot of blind communication is by all other means than sight - and the plausibiity of your story depends partially on details. Has the blind person ever seen? (Body language skills) does the deaf person communicate orally? Not all deaf communicate only with sign language. Many can lipread and speak pretty well.
So a love story with a functional blind that can do normal bosy language of the country and culture they live in and a deaf person that can lipread and communicate orally might be pretty reasonable.
But big potential for communication issues: when you can't see how do you know if someone is fooling around, lying, making fun of you? Microgestures or discomfort or cluelessness does not translate well to spoken language. 
They would have to find ways to communicate and learn together. Email, twitter or facebook might be some of those means.",3,0,3,0,0,

The only doc who ever thought maybe something was a little off was back when I was 17 or 18 but he and all optometrists after shrugged it off.

I'm OK with it now, the first few months after diagnosis I cried myself to sleep 2-4 nights a week or more. It's terrifying thinking things are fine one day and then a week and two doctors appointments later you're told you're going to be blind well before you retire. I was mostly afraid because I don't have kids yet. I don't want to pass it on, yeah, but what if I never know what they look like?

I still have all of the large containers of Lego blocks and knockoff compatible blocks that I got as a child taking up space in my closet.  I also still have my marbleworks, though I'm missing a few of the pipes.  I just recently gave away the Brain Bash hand-held game I used to own.  Those are the only toys that I loved enough to keep with me from my early childhood into my late 20's.  I went through a brief period (age 8 or 9) of being totally obsessed with those metal ring puzzles, but I got over it.  I still do have a nice wooden tower of Hanoi puzzle on a shelf, but I don't really consider that a toy.  I remember playing with a speak and spell in my early years, but I don't think it was ever mine.  I also had a Language Master, but while that had a few games on it, I wouldn't really say it was a toy, either.  But you could make the Language Master say ""shit"", and that's the best part when you're 9.  I had a Meccano set, but I hated it!  It was all sharp and fiddly and complicated and bad and just made me want to throw things.  Hmmm, I remember obsessing over a yack back at the beginning of grade 1, but as I recall, that only lasted a few weeks.  Oh, and silly putty, of course.  The day I found out that being an adult means I can buy several pounds of magnetic silly putty was the best day.  But gak and floam are abominations, and should never be spoken of.

Edit: writing this made me go find my Lego. I'd forgotten that I have, like, a table with four legs and everything, with the Lego bits covering the entire surface. Building forts and mazes yay!

Both on Reddit itself, and many many other social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc) people post images, infographics, charts and graphs, pictures of news articles, images of signs, pictures of cats, photos of the new baby, etc, etc, etc, without useful captions.  The result is many many discussions in my facebook newsfeed and Twitter timeline where I don't have any idea at all what's being discussed.  I guess I could take a picture of a computer screen, but it would be useful to upload these images somewhere, and get insight into what the image contains.

Lastly, if this is done in the cloud, what about privacy?  KNFB does all the OCR on my device, so it's no problem.  I'm not sure how I feel about taking pictures of potentially private information and uploading it to the cloud.

I'm alone in my home getting over the flu right now, so I'm enjoying bringing back my childhood.  :-)  I feel like I should put in a bit of a disclaimer, though.  I'm a straight white Canadian male (currently age 27, even though it probably doesn't sound like it), and a bit of a nerd.  My best friends in childhood, both blind and sighted, were almost all straight white male nerds as well.  I think a lot of what I'm saying is pretty widely applicable, but I really have no way to know what parts of it aren't that applicable.  I have no idea what the blind girls were playing with while me and the boys were involved in extremely important discussions about what kind of dinosaurs they would ride in Star Wars if they ever rode dinosaurs (because both dinosaurs and Star Wars were a long time ago, so obviously it could happen!).  

&gt; ""accomplishment and the elation we feel from success - even alone - is one of the most important aspects of playing"".

Yes, I agree with that, with one important proviso.  At least for me, the successes were only meaningful when they were successes involving challenges I had set for myself.  That's why I tired quickly of a lot of puzzles, and why I never cared even a little bit for kits with assembly instructions.  I felt like successfully following instructions given to me by someone else wasn't really interesting or fun.  But I suspect that's just me; I know some people who do get tons of satisfaction from following instructions, and checking off items on check lists, and I don't think a lack of sight would make someone any more or less likely to enjoy that.  On the other hand, I could never read any of the instructions I got with toys myself, because they were all in print pictures.  So following them would have meant getting someone to read or describe the photographic instructions to me, and thus giving up some of my Independence. Maybe if all of my toys had come with instructions I could follow by myself I might have felt differently about them, I don't know.  As an adult, I do find completing quests in online games deeply satisfying. But I find it even more satisfying when I find an unintended behavior, bug, or exploit that allows me to complete the quest in a way the game author didn't intend and/or doesn't want.  So it's possible that I'm just a terrible person.  

&gt; satisfying noises into my design

Speaking of satisfying noises, I had forgotten just how satisfying the sound of searching for a particular Lego block in a container of Lego is.  When you stick your hand in there and go for a rummage, it makes this lovely loud noise, and you really feel like you're up to something important.  And then you find the bit you wanted, and put it where you wanted it to go, and it's a little mini success. And the entire process of building something out of Lego is just experiencing that same small success over and over and over again, until you finish your structure, and it's built-up into one large success.  I may not have gotten out of my pajamas today, but I built a truck with 12 wheels and a ramp so I can drive another smaller truck in to the bigger one.  Then I had an almost overpowering urge to go ""vroom vroom"", so I had to get up and check the computer before I regressed in age any further.  What have you done with your day? LOL.  

&gt; justifies incorporating braille into a design.

Yes, I guess so. But mum didn't teach me to read; I learned to read at school.  I'm not sure that a toy that set-out to teach Braille as a primary purpose would be much fun.  But a toy could expose young kids to Braille, and that would help when it comes time to learn it later on.  Although if you're doing a toy for older kids who can read, at least a little, having Braille on the packaging and any instructions in Braille would be a good thing, of course.  

&gt; how are you able to build something like a building/castle in Lego? 

Well, if you take it right down to basics, buildings are really just boxes, and cars and trucks are boxes with wheels on.  And every blind person has felt a box probably even before they were a year old.  As I grew, my concept of different buildings expanded from ""big wooden boxes that people live in"" as people described things to me (roofs often come to a peak, etc) and as I felt different things myself (scale models of buildings at museums, a model barn my grandfather gave me, a Princess Barbie Castle my cousin had, a plastic model of the Lunar Module purchased for me when we went to Cape Canaveral, and so on).  Once I understand the shapes of things, it's easy for me to combine them in my head, even without vision, and come up with a moon castle that has walls with towers along them, gates defended by mini-figures, and the towers all have broadcast antennas and rotating laser guns on them, because that's what makes it a moon castle, of course. 

&gt; Would you enjoy an object or a toy that involves something scented?

Personally, no.  But I have allergies to a lot of the chemicals they use in perfumes and chemical scents.  So maybe other blind people would enjoy that, I don't know.  The only other thing I enjoy in objects that I haven't already discussed is magnetism.  Two magnetic objects will either pull together, or push apart, all by themselves!  For no reason!  They just...do!  I mean, Lego has bumps and holes; it's obvious why they stick together.  But why do magnets stick together? Why do they push apart?  It's like magic.  If you have strong enough magnets, you can even stick your fingers between them, and the magnetic rays can somehow penetrate right through your hand and they'll try and stick together anyway!  Well, now that I'm a grown man I know it's because of science.  Atoms...and...electrons and...things...make magnetism...because...science! I bet Merlin had something to do with it.  

&gt; Did/do you prefer toys/objects that are small? Or quite large?

Again, I think that might be down to personal taste.  I always liked toys that I could hold in my hands or on my lap.  I find it's a bit more difficult (though nowhere near impossible) to get an overall sense of anything much larger than that.  Plus, our family traveled a lot when I was young, so I liked things I could bring with me.  The only large thing I had that I loved was the Lego table I mentioned above. What good is even the most fun toy in the world, if it's sitting in my room at home, and can't come on car-trips or to school with me or whatever?  I had an electric train set, and I remember being annoyed that I couldn't take it with me to show people without going to a lot of trouble. But that has nothing to do with my blindness, just my personal circumstances.  So other blind children probably differ there.  

&gt; Is temperature a factor in helping you decide whether you like an object or not?

Not usually, no.  Though I remember enjoying how the texture of Plasticine would soften as it warmed up in my hands, and then firm up again when I finished with it.  

&gt; doesn't that require a visual understanding of the moon?

No, not really. The moon is in space, and space is where all the cool stuff is, like aliens with eight arms and laser guns and lightsabers and rockets and transporters and robots and doors that go ""woosh"".  And everyone in space has adventures all the time. The only cool things on earth are kings, wizards, dinosaurs, and castles.  Thus my 11-year-old inspiration.  Even then, though, I knew that the moon was round and much smaller than earth, and full of craters where asteroids and rocks smashed into it.  I'd heard lots of documentaries about the moon landings, so I had a pretty good idea what the moon might really be like.  But I didn't see that as any reason to limit my imagination.  I had also felt a model of the solar system, though I can't remember exactly where. Maybe it was at a library?  So I had a pretty good idea about stars and planets.  

&gt; with a lot of art and design being about the visual and the emotional responses to the visual,

I think a surprising amount of design doesn't have as much to do with the visual as people think it does.  What would Star Wars be without the humming sound of lightsabers?  Where would Doctor Who be today without the iconic sound of The Tardis, and the vocal style of the Daleks?  I think that because sighted people notice the visual first, you tend to think it's the most important, when it's really just your first impression.  I bet if you stopped random people on the street, they could all tell you the sound the Tardis makes, and do a Dalek imitation, but I don't think many of them could give you a detailed description of any of the doctors, or draw the inside of the Tardis.  Think about how many people deeply hate fake Lego, because it feels wrong when it goes together, even though it looks almost identical to the real stuff.  Everyone knows the sound that the doors make on the USS Enterprise. But how many of them could describe what it looked like inside off the top of their head?  Thousands of people are totally devoted to the old IBM keyboards, because of the way they feel to type on, even though they're pretty ugly to look at.  I could go on.  The only art and design that's exclusively about the visual is comics and paintings.  ",1,0,1,0,0,

I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at a really young age which is a degenerative retinal disease that causes tunnel vision, night blindness, cataracts, and in many cases, eventual blindness. 

In the last few years, my vision loss has gotten to the point where I am having difficulties getting around even well lit areas. I find I am very nervous going out in public and plan any outings very carefully and am still anxious even then. 

Yesterday I was out at a bachelor party with a large group of childhood friends and I felt really down and out of place, particularly at the end of the night when we were bar hopping. I was never good in bars with my night blindness; it's hard to enjoy yourself when you're trying not to run into people and are also trying not to drink too much in order to avoid having to grope.  your way to the bathroom. But the whole experience left me feeling really lost and alone. If I feel like an outcast with a group of my good friends celebrating an engagement, I'm not sure where I do fit in. I think, like you, it's an identity thing. I don't feel like I fit in because I don't feel normal any more. 

I don't have any help for your problem, I just replied because what you described sounded an awful lot like what I'm feeling and I wanted you to know that at least to some degree, I know what you're going through.

&gt; Did you dislike the Meccano simply because it was sharp and fiddly? Does that mean you preferred simple textures that were more versatile and malleable?

Versatile, yes.  I never built any of the kits with my Lego, if I ever even had any to begin with. I just sorted all the blocks out by size and shape, and built whatever I wanted.  I didn't feel that the Meccano offered me that same freedom. Also, I hated that I needed to use tools to help put it together, rather than just clicking it together with my hands.  Also also, some of those little Meccano bits were round and would go rolling off on mysterious journeys over my hardwood bedroom floor, never to be found again. Lego blocks were usually square or rectangular, and so they didn't have that problem.  If you drop a Lego, you can find it by sweeping your hands over the floor; if you drop a Meccano bit, you'll knock it with your hand, and it'll start rolling again, and it's just so frustrating when you're a kid.  Even as an adult, I hate screws.  and bolts.  I'm just better at planning ahead and having a container to keep them in, that's all.  Lastly, the metal they used just felt cheap and bendy and sharp and unpleasant to me.  But that might be just because I already disliked the toy, so my memory may have just tacked on another reason to hate it; I haven't touched one in like 15 years, so my texture memories of Meccano aren't exactly fresh.  

&gt; What other toys did you dislike?

Transformers.  I could just never figure out how to transform them. And then when I finally did get it, the results were never satisfactory.  Also, all of those little moving bits just broke so easily!  Plus, I didn't care about the TV show, so none of the characters made any sense to me.  I mean, a robot thing that...turns into another robot thing...why? Why not just build two different robots? Wouldn't that be cheaper and easier and more reliable?  These were questions that bothered my young self.  I'm sure the TV show explained it, but I don't remember ever experiencing even a single episode of it.  

&gt; Did you ever play with dolls/figurines?

No.  But I did have a lovely collection of die cast Star Wars ships and vehicles.  I enjoyed Star Wars growing up, so I always enjoyed getting to touch the ships and things that I was hearing about in the movies.  I never really ""played"" with them, though. I'd examine them, and set them up on a display shelf in my room and feel them every once in a while.  I also had a Star Trek enterprise, that I enjoyed for the same reason.  Even today, I enjoy going over to friends places and touching there Doctor Who figurines/tardis/dalek models.  So if a blind child is into a particular TV show, they may still enjoy owning the merchandise, as a way to bring the things on-screen they're not seeing to life, even if they might not play with them in the same way a sighted child might.  Oh, and dinosaurs! I went through a dinosaur phase (what kid doesn't?) and liked plastic dinosaur figurines for a while.  

As a slight aside (because this comment just isn't long and rambling enough), in my experience blind kids tend to like franchises that have extensive book and audio components.  If I had a blind pre-teen today, I'd probably point them at Doctor Who: the Big Finish audio dramas are some of the best audio-only content ever produced, and their are many many many excellent books (both in audio, ebook, and a few even in Braille) to enjoy.  It makes it easier to get attached to the characters that way, and thus the TV programs become much more rewarding and interesting to experience, even without the visuals.  When I was growing up, it was the Star Wars expanded universe novels and the Star Trek novels that made me interested in the movies/TV shows to begin with.  For blind kids too young for The Doctor, My Little Pony is probably the thing to enjoy: it's the only cartoon with voice acting that's worth listening to, the music is good, and the dialogue is worthwhile.  Unfortunately the books are so terrible they're unreadable.  But to bring this ramble back on-topic to things you actually care about, at least unicorn/Pegasus figurines would probably be interesting, or at least more interesting than another generic only slightly articulated human doll.  It occurs to me that for a totally blind adult, I spend a surprising amount of my life thinking about children's cartoons.  

&gt; What makes you like an object now?

Hmmm.  Well, I do like things that make noise.  I have a [clicky mechanical keyboard](http://www.daskeyboard.com) and I wouldn't give it up for anything.  The keys feel so nice to press, they make a nice sound, they have no lettering on them so they stay smooth and nice (whereas lots of cheap plastic keyboards start to feel dirty and yucky as the painted lettering starts to get warn off), and the keyboard just has a nice sturdy heft to it.  I know that's not a toy, but it definitely qualifies as my favorite object in my daily environment.  I still like die cast models and parts as an adult, because they just feel nice and firm and well maid, whereas plastic models just feel kind of cheap and yucky, for the most part.  The only plastic things I like are Lego blocks; while they're sometimes chipped or scratched, they're at least firm and solid.  Also, they snap together with a nice click feel.  I think the only way I could improve on Lego is if they sounded like they feel when they go together.  A nice click/snap sound would just make building things out of Lego feel like such an accomplishment.  Thinking about it, I seem to believe in my heart of hearts that light and bendy things are cheap things, even though intellectually I know that's not always true.  

&gt; Can you read braille? 

Yes, I can.  Mostly, I learned in school; I didn't have any Braille toys that I can remember.  However, my mum did label lots and lots of things around our house for me using a Braille dimo tape label maker she got at the CNIB, even if they didn't need labels.  For example, she put ""on"" and ""off"" labels in braille on all of our light switches. I already knew what was on and what was off, but feeling braille letters every day from about age 1 probably did get me used to the idea of ""letters"", the idea that sometimes things have letters written on them, and that Braille and reading with my fingers was a thing.  She also put room names in braille on various doors (each of our names on our bedroom doors, words like ""bathroom"" and ""closet"" on other doors, etc), and random labels on other things (""fridge"", ""freezer"", ""stove"", and so on).  Plus, all of the VCR tapes and audio tapes that I owned she labeled in Braille, long before I could even read Braille at all.  I remember that she put labels both on the case, and on the tape itself.  Before I could read, she used to take all of the tapes out of there cases, and we'd play a game where I'd try and find out what tape went in each case, based on finding the tape and case that had the same Braille on them.  When I eventually did start learning Braille in school, I think I was slightly ahead of the game, because I already had a good concept of words and letters, and was already experienced at following Braille with my fingers and recognizing the different symbols, even if I didn't quite know exactly what they meant yet.  

&gt; You mentioned building forts and mazes. How are you able to do that? 

With Lego.  Everything is 3d, so you can move your hands and fingers through it, and really get a sense of what you're building.  I also have a Lego table, with a large surface that Lego blocks can be attached to on the top, to build quite large structures.  I'm searching for it on the web, and I absolutely can't find anything quite like it.  I'm going to have to ask where on earth it came from.  I'm in front of it now, and...it's large enough I could sit my full-sized keyboard on top of it, if I wanted too.  So the Lego surface on the top must be...oh, maybe 4 feet square? It's got detachable plastic legs holding it about 3 feet off of the floor.  It's too low for my adult self, but when I was a kid, sitting on the floor in front of it put it at the perfect height for me to build on.  Counting, I have...eight solid Lego opening and closing doors, plus six sort of grill-style doors that open and close in two parts that I tend to use as windows.  I also have enough antennas and spinney bits to build a space-castle as epic as anyone could possibly want.  I do, in fact, remember building a moon castle one weekend when I was 11 or so.  Then I went off and wrote a ridiculous story about King Arthur and the knights of space that I really deeply hope nobody still has a copy of.  I think the only thing I did differently from other kids was that I sometimes didn't put roofs on any of my larger structures, because I wanted to be able to stick my hand inside them easily.

I actually had one of those Lego tables when I was younger as well, the bumpy top could flip over and become a flat top for a normal table instead. 

I'm really interested in your fascination with building and the sounds involved in particular. I wrote something in another piece of research for my project after visiting a Toy History museum that said ""accomplishment and the elation we feel from success - even alone - is one of the most important aspects of playing"". I guess I could incorporate that idea of construction/interlocking pieces and satisfying noises into my design. 

I like that you said that your mum putting braille labels on everything meant you were a little ahead of the game when you started learning braille at school because that totally justifies incorporating braille into a design. 

I'm trying really hard to understand as best as I possibly can (being sighted) what it is like to be blind. You've been so helpful. But I'm still stuck on a few things.

Like how are you able to build something like a building/castle in lego? Doesn't that require a mental/visual representation of a building/castle? What do you use as reference? Because I'm not sure whether to design something that is fairly abstract like Lego or some kind of shape that is texturally and aurally appealing or to design a toy that resembles an aspect of real life. 

Would you enjoy an object or a toy that involves something scented? Or can that make an object too complex to bother with?

Did/do you prefer toys/objects that are small? Or quite large?

Is temperature a factor in helping you decide whether you like an object or not? E.g. Is it the coolness you would like of metal or the warmth of something like wool that would make you enjoy an object?

I hope this doesn't sound patronising but I am surprised by how you have such an understanding of objects. For example, you mentioned you built a 'moon castle' (which sounds awesome by the way) but to build something that gives reference to the moon, in any kind of way, doesn't that require a visual understanding of the moon? How has that been described to you? It's not something you can touch or really experience without sight... is it?

I'm really interested in these concepts. I'm an art student and study design as well so, with a lot of art and design being about the visual and the emotional responses to the visual, I see a life where visual doesn't exist or has never even existed for some and I'm fascinated. My great aunt turned blind at the age of 7. I never met her but according to my gran, she was very independent, I think she even left home at 15. 

I really appreciate your help with this, it's been difficult trying to find a 1st hand source of information, a lot of charities have told me that they can't give me access to any of the families they work with which is a shame. 

Thank you so much again.

I have two local organizations in my area.  My local Lighthouse for the Blind offers indoor warehouse work, full time starting at $8.00/ hr and going up with experience.  I worked in the warehouse as a summer job a couple years back.  The money they made from the warehouse and assembly business was put back into their services.  Even if they cannot provide you with employment themselves they can help you seek employment, they will almost certainly have contacts and can help you get a job.  If your local organizations can't help I would look at contacting national organizations.  There are two major organizations in the US; The American Council of the Blind, and the National Federation of the Blind.  There is some debate on which is better, I would do your own research and find out which you prefer.  Either way, both can potentially help you find a job.  There also state divisions of both of the national groups.  The last piece is if you are in the states contact the division of the Department of Social Services in your state.  Mine is called Rehabilitative Services for the Blind.  They will set you up with a Vocational Rehab counselor that can provide you with training, equipment, and contacts to help you find a job.  They could even help you get funding to go back to college.  While that is happening some states (mine included) can provide you with something called ""Blind Pension.""

Here's a few tips from RNIb for design http://www.rnib.org.uk/sites/default/files/Designing%20gardens%20and%20nature%20trails%20June%202013.doc

Try to find some local VI gardeners.
Figure the paths first.
I'm a big fan of raised beds. Raiseed beds in a way that all ares can be reached easily. Similar items together, and use scented plants in many locations. Rosemary, lavender, basil, flowers...
And you can change what's in one raised bed or pot if somethibg dies or when it's the next season,
All plants should be safe to touch, nonpoisonous too.
Find a way to label  them - tactile, raised letters, braille, a combination.
All tools need to always be in the same place so they don't get lost.

Soft plants, plants with different textures and feel, sound of leaves etc.
Easy plants (like sunflower), more difficult ones too.

A lot will depend on the climate as in what will grow and what wom't. Where will your garden be? (City/state)",1,0,1,0,0,

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1440460221,"I still benefit from having a pretty substantial prescription lens.  I'm also super sensitive to light so if I forget my shades I'm usually in a lot of discomfort outside.  I went to my optical shop and had them make me some custom lenses in my prescription.  They were fit for my RayBan Aviator frames which I really like.  Because I also can't see at all in low light they gave me a lens color that does a really good job of filtering out light that hurts my eyes while leaving enough that I can use some of my vision while I'm wearing them.  I wear them in light and dark, I can't really use streetlights either way and having that glare gone is nice.  I rely on my cane to get me safely from place to place either way.  I think the aviators work well with more formal stuff as well as when I'm just dressing casually to hang out with friends.  The lenses (and frames for that matter) weren't cheap so I wanted to get something that would work in multiple settings.  Overall I'm pretty happy with that route.  Really if you go to your optical shop and explain the situation they will probably be able to work with you to find something that works well.",1,0,1,0,0,
c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1440810456,"Having low vision and Windows is tough... I have had experience with both operating systems (I used my MacBook Pro with OSX for two years and switched back to Windows).  Apple is definitely more squared away with accessibility in all of their products.  However I'm a Windows fanboy to the death, so I'm going to continue to make it harder on myself :)  Both definitely have merits, I like the overall flexibility that Windows gives me, OSX has always felt very locked down.  That being said I'm strongly considering getting a new MacBook Pro for college and I'll probably partition the drive so I can get the best of both worlds because I know OSX is more accessible but I don't want to give up Windows.  Either way it looks like Zoomtext, NVDA, and maybe JAWS are going to continue to be in my life for the foreseeable future because there is no way I'm entirely giving up Windows.",2,0,2,0,0,

Did you dislike the Meccano simply because it was sharp and fiddly? Does that mean you preferred simple textures that were more versatile and malleable?

What other toys did you dislike?

Did you ever play with dolls/figurines? I feel that toys like Barbie or Action Man or any sort of mini person wouldn't work for somebody who is blind because of a lot of the appeal is visual.

What makes you like an object now? Do you like things that have an appealing texture? (What for you is an appealing texture?) Do you like things that make sounds?

Can you read braille? If so, how did you learn? Would a braille toy have been helpful while growing up?

You mentioned building forts and mazes. How are you able to do that? The concept of a fort or any kind of building is quite a visual idea. Sorry if that sounds stupid...

Thanks for replying.
