You answer two questions as with most standard captcha.  Each one gives you a sentence about a person and asks you to give an emotion the person is probably feeling.  The idea is that humans can easily tell when another human would be sad/happy/frustrated about something, but computers have a hard time.

Here's an example:
Bob is on his first date with Mary. He is feeling: [nervous] 
Bob last ate 8 hours ago. He is feeling: [hungry]

The system would have a method to account for similar emotions, so users wouldn't need to fret too much about which word to use.  Does this seem like a reasonable solution?  I'm really sorry if I've overlooked something.  If something about this wouldn't work, does anybody have an idea for adjusting it to something that would?

The two things that would make life a lot easier in this regard would be:

* Improving LaTeX's output to make the PDFs it generates usable with screen readers.
* Improving MathML handling in browsers and screen readers.

&gt;He was speaking directly with disability services. If disability services declined your BFs request, they probably talked to the college's legal department and have a good reason for saying no. These decisions are not arbitrary. There is probably legal case law on this matter that justifies the decision.

They didn't take it to legal. He made the request during a meeting with disability services employee and they verbally said no, it wasn't submitted ahead of time, or reviewed or anything. So this at least gives me hope that maybe we should resubmit a formal request and have it reviewed by legal. Do you think that's a good idea?

&gt;Your BF can probably request an appeal of the disability services decision.

This is also helpful information, the kind of information I was originally looking for in my last thread. Not just people telling me that the university is right, the end. If there's an appeal process then we would absolutely seek that avenue.

&gt;If your BF can not request an appeal, or is not satisfied with the results of the appeal, he can hire a lawyer and sue the college.

 I work in a call center environment and the grey walls and carpet and filing cabinets started blending together, my depth perception was starting to go as well as my field of vision.

I know so many people that should be using their canes but choose not to due to the stigma of it makes them weak and vulnerable. They would rather hide the fact they can’t see and physically hurt themselves.

No, visual porn does absolutely nothing for me.  The skills of a good porn-star are extremely different from the skills of a good voice-actress, and I've never heard of someone who had both sets of skills.  If you close your eyes and listen to porn, it'll probably become pretty obvious, pretty fast, that all the sex is completely and totally fake.  There is audio porn, but it isn't a mainstream thing, and most of it is pretty awful.  Someone experimented with describing porn movies, but...describing it just lends it a detached, almost medical air.  

Even if you hired a voice-actress to make some high-quality audio porn, I'm still not sure that it'd work, for me, at least.  While I am initially attracted to a voice, I've never become at all lustful towards someone without feeling like I know at least a little about their personality.  I suspect it's because listening to a voice just doesn't give as much information or impact as looking at someone.  When I was a teenager, this lead me to believe that I was asexual for quite a while.  As I got older, and got to know more girls as something other than either close childhood friends or near-strangers, this eventually changed.  But even today, I can't be attracted to a woman I just met. So that pretty much rules out porn, for me.  Based on how many of the actresses in that industry are abused, raped, underpaid, and so-on, I can't really bring myself to think that's a bad thing.",2,0,2,0,0,

The information that you pull from previous posts will undoubtedly be useful, however, I would encourage you to look beyond just r/Blind.

If disability services declined your BFs request, they probably talked to the college's legal department and have a good reason for saying no. These decisions are not arbitrary. There is probably legal case law on this matter that justifies the decision. 

Your BF can probably request an appeal of the disability services decision.  

If your BF can not request an appeal, or is not satisfied with the results of the appeal, he can hire a lawyer and sue the college.

I like where I live. Feels safe, I can walk and run (gasp.. In bright daylight) around. But I can't get a bus alone, I can't cross any of the big roads - and it's very difficult in the small things in life right now.
Like: trying to talk to your neighbors (I find it easiest to say hi to all dogs with their owners in my area. As all that I need is to feel safe around the dog, and then can ask what kind of puppy he is etc).
And other ""little things"" - using a phone indoors/outdoors (I have an iPhone), watching TV (let's just say I've given up with the remote. TV = apps on iPhone or iPad). Cleaning home. Figuring out what to wear that is pretty, clean, appropriate for style and occasion, will work for weather (cold makes me ache), does not make me look like an easy target etc.
I hate some buses here - no announcements, no clue where it goes... Or when it comes because I don't want to use an app to find out, and it is very loud in this city so it's difficult to find out when/which bus it is. Just feels uncomfortable. So I have to change to express line if I take the other bus...

Tuesday I went downtown. Had a meeting in a place I've been before. I knew the address and was looking for something I could recognize. 2 minute walk (husband dropped me off, so I had to figure from a new location) took 30 minutes. It was very dark, no sun to help orientate, and it was cold so I was freezing. Very uncomfortable to walk around busy areas when the survival instincts kick in (where am I? Are those blur people safe? Which way am I going? Let's walk until I can find a landmark that works for me... Fine, 5 minutes and I'll ask someone, or think about actually whipping out the cane).
I am comfortable to very uncomfortable and unsafe degrees of vision problems. I really need to get some proper cane comfidence and o&amp;m training. I'm relying as much as I can on all other senses, but it'll make a world of difference to get some training and confidence.",1,0,1,0,0,

Denial is something I am *very* familiar with and I was born with bad eyesight! I pushed away many who tried to ""help"" especially at that age. I wanted nothing to do with assistance devices and really just didn't want people to treat me like a person with a disability.      
      
My younger brother knew exactly how to ""handle"" me but he had many, many years to learn. He never treated me like someone who was disabled, but he always knew just when I needed help. Like for example, when we'd go to fast food places, instead of simply reading the menu to me, he'd ""make suggestions"" based on the food he knew I liked. He might say ""that bacon-cheeseburger sounds good"" or something to that effect. He learned how to read my body language and sometimes he'd just ask ""whatcha lookin' at?""     
     
He never forced help on me; that was key. He was just always there. I always felt comfortable around him largely because he never treated me like I wasn't capable. I use the past-tense because he was taken from me in an accident back in 2005 (I'm crying as I type this, I still miss him).

1. Speakup. It's a console screen reader that can read the system right from startup, but requires kernel module.
2. Console screen readers like yasr. They're executed by the user, possibly on the logging script, and are bound to one particular terminal. They allow cursor review and the like.
3. emacspeak. This is an add-on which adds voice support to emacs. emacs is an editor, but it's extensible so all kinds of things can be done from it (web navigation, email, some music edition...).
4. Orca. This is the x-based screen reader and it operates with the gnome accessibility standards. I hear it can work in some other window managers, but can't speak to it personally.

For most users orca is probably the best option. Speakup and yasr are handy if one can't or doesn't want to run X for whatever reason, such as performing maintenance on a system. Emacspeak is really powerful its own way but it has a very difficult learning process, since you must learn to operate emacs itself.

This is so true and has been one of the most frustrating parts. There's not much education in the public about low vision people who can not have their vision corrected with glasses. Before I met my boyfriend I'd heard people say they are legally blind, but they had glasses and could do all normal things like drive, etc....so when he told me he was legally blind, at first I thought that's what he meant. But his problems are not helped at all by glasses, so I think a lot of people assume since he can see a little bit, he can see everything. But he can't. And it's super, super frustrating to try to help people grasp that.

&gt;You can get different handheld CCTV's that do inverted colours.

His pebble does inverted colors, which works wonderfully for paper documents viewed up close like in that image. But when you move more than an inch or two away, the camera quality is really poor and details are all lost. I've looked at it and it's bad for ME, so I can't imagine how bad it is for HIM using it.

&gt;Does your boyfriend have access to the dummy for study purposes as well?

It's acutally a human cadaver (dead body) so he does not have acccess to it other than during the exam. He emailed his professor today, bipassing disability services, to see if there's anything he'd be willing to do. At this point we're kind of grasping at straws, but are hoping that he will be kind and understanding and maybe offer a written exam of some kind.

&gt;Good luck and stay strong and be willing to fight for what you want, but be as adaptable as possible and you should see results.

Thank you! Today we sent out 3 different emails. One to his professor, one to disability services asking what accomodations they give to 100% blind people and if my boyfriend can have that accommodation, and one asking if we can submit a formal request for accommodation since our previous one was a verbal request during a meeting that was immediately shot down.

Does your boyfriend have access to the dummy for study purposes as well? Sometimes I've found you just have to work 40% harder than everyone else to be at their level - spending a significant amount of time memorizing the various parts using the CCTV, by touch and repetition may get him through.

That way it prevent screen readers from saying head level 3 every line haha. Also, when it lists the string and frets, maybe to it in a list type fashion? Sorts like this:

Low E: 1. 3

D: open. 2.

etc

That way it would be easily readable, sort of simulate a fret board, and so on. Really appreciate this effort and I'm definitely  going to take advantage of this. I only know the minor pentatonic scale because I've never bothered learning the others, but now I have a reason to.",1,0,1,0,0,

He asked for my help and I don't think he is helpless because he is blind. Hs is incredibly self sufficient. But he does need help in this situation and was not able to make and progress with disability services on his own.

Waited tables, worked in an arcade, stocked shelves at grocery stores, cleaned floors, etc. I decided I wanted to be a 911 dispatcher, but to do so requires experience. Started with a cab company as a radio dispatcher for a couple of years and one day the position of GM fell into my lap. It was a relatively small company and the GM and dispatch supervisor (husband and wife) were quitting to move out of state.

I mean, don't ask her straight out, but you know, get her talking about herself and the things she likes doing just like you would any other girl and figure out a way to make those things into dates.",3,0,3,0,0,

I really hate to say this, but he may need to take a semester or year off to learn the skills he needs to be independent. Sure he could probably get through if someone guided him around, read everything to him, and wrote everything down for him, but that's just degrading. First off, he needs to get oriented with computers and screen reading software. I recommend NVDA, although some people use JAWS, witch costs about 1000 dollars and does the same as NVDA, witch is free. He'll also need to learn braille. Logically speaking, if he wants to continue his education, he won't reading braille for his assignments; it takes years to get fast at it, and it's very inconvenient. He'll also need to get a cane, and learn how to use it. I believe there are several programs to help recently blinded people, perhaps he should sign up for one of those. I hope this helped and let me know if you have anymore questions.",7,0,7,0,0,
