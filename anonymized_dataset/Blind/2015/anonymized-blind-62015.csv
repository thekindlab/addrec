Lots of people drop out of engineering programs because they cannot commit the time and energy to learn the material and keep up with the workload. If you are responsible and committed in your undergrad studies then you can achieve these career goals just fine.

In particular [this electrical engineer](http://www.blindscience.org/images/ncbys/media/jmiller/johnmiller-8.mp3) created a board that you can draw on and feel, and he would bring this board to office hours and ask professors to draw important graphs on them and he would annotate those graphs.

I'm 19 and haven't been officially diagnosed yet but my optometrist has said I have myopic macular degeneration, and i'm currently going through tests to test for retinitis pigmentosa as my ophthalmologist said he thinks I might have it too. I was aiming to be a General Practitioner but have taken a year off school to get my eyes sorted out and decide what I'm going to pursue. I've though a lot about it and still am not totally sure what way I'm going to go but it will be very, very tough to pursue a medical career if my vision goes quickly, and i'd imagine the same for any STEM degree. There's really no putting it light that you may really need to consider something else. At the same time though if you plan on working around computers a lot i'm sure there are a lot of programs to help you with that so you might be able to do it. I've read about a guy that went to Business  school and now works for a huge American Bank (I can't remember the name but i've seen it thrown around a lot), and i've read about a woman going to university and getting a Degree (Again it's slipped my mind) both while being blind, so there is hope. I'd imagine in astronomy and engineering you need to be able to see graphs and lines and things, i'd imagine that's going to be difficult blind.

So yeah just think about you future and what is reasonable. If a lot of your data that you work with is presented on graphs and other visual things, it might not be reasonable.

Stay positive though even if it gets hard, who knows what the future has in store for us, there are already bionic eye's in the making and maybe one day in our lifetime they will be good at manipulating stem cells to just grow a new retina or some shit.

785715d2-5557-43ec-a873-47078f038f24,1435588183,"I have two. 
One is a 44"" foldable ambutech - the red parts covered in green. Usually in the purse as 8'm not comfortable wearing one, and mostly need it when it's dark or when Iʻm somewhere completely unfamiliar. It's a comfortable height for how I use it.
It's easiest to practise using it in dark, with sunglasses on, because that way I have no usable vision. It's scary to use it, but only I can tackle my fears. I feel vulnerable at night, probably also because I've been mugged before and I'm afraid wearing ""the stick"" makes me more prone to run to unsavory characters. So I practise slowly, with pieces of road I know so it's easier to look like you know where you are going (and then safely find where you want to go, like a bus stop or a store or home).
My second one is my creative take on the item. Itʻs an EarthTrek brand foldable hiking pole, black in color, about the same height. I like it when walking in nature, and have used it especially when traveling. Because when it gets dark, I can use as I wish - I have no clue how people are ""supposed to"" use a hiking pole but I use it to see where I walk. If actually hiking, it can support weight, and you can get spare tips on it. (And since I destroyed the tip by just practising with the other one, I was happy to notice the standard spare tips can fit my other ""stick"". 
An o&amp;m friend of mine said he uses hiking poles too. So it can be an alternative if you are very selfconscious about wearing a white one when you start to need it. At least for your own practising - it won't do any good when you are crossing a road on your own because other people and drivers most likely don't realize you are visually imapired. But try different kinds of canes and methods - and don't be afraid to customize yours with anything you like - charm, stickers, pretty colros, or getting a fancy patterned one. Because that way ot will be your cane, and it'll feel a lot more comfortable than just one of those standard looking ones. Your eye-extension, your style. ",1,0,1,0,0,

I have two now, both are folding. One is small (48"") and super light carbon fiber that I use daily and carry at work. The other is big, 56"" (I think) aluminum, very tall, very sturdy. I use this if I am going to a public venue or unfamiliar location.     
     
The reason for the difference is in my day to day, I'd rather have something smaller and lightweight but if I am going out, especially someplace unfamiliar, I want something longer and less flimsy.     
     
For me, I decided I would carry one at all times when out of the house and to be honest it really wasn't that big an adjustment to me.",3,0,3,0,0,

Work with the professor first and try to come up with a solution that will work for everyone. If that doesn't work, certainly talk to disability services and make sure that all of his accommodations are in writing A letter from his eye doctor stating what the optimum lighting conditions for his eye condition are would greatly benefit him. I would think that reasonable accommodations should include double time, appropriate lighting conditions, appropriate assistive technology, and even enlarged photos if necessary. However, if the professor has a three-dimensional models of anything that he can feel, it would be also beneficial for him to recognize some body parts  by touch. Do not be discouraged. I know plenty of blind massage therapists, and all of them have been able to complete their education. If he is told that this is not possible, certainly use the appeal process and possibly an attorney. One of the most important things that he can do is advocate for himself.

If I'm being honest, holding things/ managing one handed is the hardest part for me.  You learn how to balance the cane in your arm when you need two hands but to compensate for the missing hand I always carry my messenger bag.  It has all my low vision gear (spare cane, magnifiers, etc.) as well as any regular day to day items I need.

I think it's about balancing your whole mobility system to accommodate the cane.  It just requires some thought and creativity.

Loosing your sight will mean that you have to find different ways of accessing the information you need to do what you need and want to do. For example: STEM requires a lot of charts and graphs, so you will need to learn how to read tactile graphics. While you can use Text to Speech programs to access information it will be more beneficial to learn to read braille. You can hear a program tell you a complex equation but you might miss details that you otherwise would catch if you were reading the material.

Look into [Kent Cullers](https://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/braille/voices5.html) a blind astronomer who who was the Director of Research and Development at the SETI Institute and holds a PhD in Physics. There are many resources available to you, like the National Federation of the Blind, American Council of the Blind, Perkins, and so many others. Look for your local blindness organization and they can help you find information.

Like getting into any career you need to do your research, talk to people in the field, build connections, build your skills, work as hard as you can, and definitely use all the resources available.",1,0,1,0,0,

It also feels a bit weird to get compliments from cane users when you aren't wearing one. Like about shades or tattoos or clothes.
