If you need help finding the bathroom on a flight, the flight attendant can help you. For me, this only needs to happen once, because I can memorize things pretty well. If I need to go more than once, I can make my own way. For some, this may be more of a challenge. If this is you, and if you need it more than once, long flight, not feeling well, etc, their job is to help, so they'll help you as many times as you need it.

I don't fly often, so I can't give reviews of specific airlines, but I have flown with two different ones. Each time, someone helped me from the moment I arrived at the airport to the time I was in my seat and from my seat to either a cab or my ride.

I flew with United from Nashville to Washington D.C., and flew U.S. Airways from D.C. to Nashville. I landed at Dullace, and they put me in a wheelchair. I think this made it easier for the attendants to more quickly move me around as opposed to using sighted guide. I don't believe it was because of a misunderstanding of my disability.

74d4a5cf-0b48-4c7a-a22a-de2a8b1c7c01,1422301450,"I would suggest you learn a bit more about braille. There are two reading levels of braille. Level 1 braille is basic braille taught to beginners and children. Unfortunately there aren't many books in Level 1 braille that are not considered children's books. Level 2 braille uses a lot of contractions since braille takes up a lot of space and there are no font sizes saving space is important. Another thing to note for English speakers is that the English braille code is changing. All English speaking countries are changing to Unified English Braille (UEB) so it will be beneficial to you to start learning that code. Math uses another code but I will not get into that one. 

That being said there are several books you can start with. The first is *Braille for the Sighted* by Stanley Collins. The second is *Just Enough to know Better* by Eileen Curran. There are many other books out there but those are the ones that I can think of at the top of my head. Print/braille books might also be helpful. Remember that most young adult and adult books are written in Level 2 braille and are pressed to be double sided making it difficult to try to sight read them. 

You might also want to get an alphabet card. We have them (National Braille Press) and I can mail you one for free but these are not UEB. Once you are familiar with the basic alphabet code you can begin learning contracted braille. UEBonline.org is a good place to start learning Level 2 braille. A side note on UEB BANA has set the official date for January 4, 2016 so it is still in the roll out phase, meaning there is UEB Material available. But most of what you will find is American English Braille, or Canadian English Braille, etc. 

Successful tactile reading depends on a variety of factors some of them including finger sensitivity, ability to train yourself to recognize the code and personal ability. In the same way that sighted people learn to read at different speeds and with different methods so BVI people. ",2,0,2,0,0,

* The cost to produce braille literature is a lot higher than the cost to produce print books. There is no average in the same way there is no average price for print books. Now I can't speak for all braille presses but we believe in parity not charity so we charge the same amount for a braille book as we would for a print book.  If you were to find a book at a bookstore for $8.98 we would sell for $8.98.

* There are definitely libraries that carry braille books. The one that sticks out in my mind the most is the Library of Congress, but you can also find local libraries that do.

Wonderful idea, really poor execution. It's something I as a sighted person wish I had in some of my online courses at another school where the discussion boards were your standard format, but really the video portion of the site was completely inaccessible with JAWS, Apple Voiceover, NVDA... flash based, so nothing was machine readable. They had a universal site that was text based and you could play videos, but not record. You could post text, but not videos. You couldn't even subscribe to the thread. So I had to log in for her, subscribe to her thread, log out, and let her login with the universal access site and view videos and post text comments, and that was after having a nice long conversation with Mr. I-Have-A-PHD that I have a long slew of tech certifications and a lawyer.

Two key parts of the system will be the custom editor, which will be very VIM-like, and the custom code-to-speech transformer.

In editing source code in a normal editor we as sighted people use visual feedback loops for just about anything. In VIM, a lot of these feedback loops are already abbreviated. If I want to delete a line in a normal texteditor, I have to select the line and then delete it with a key. In vim, I just press dd, and the line is gone. More complicated things like ""delete everything inside this html tag"" is also easy.

While a braille display could still be useful there, I don't want to require it (for now). The braille keyboards I have seen look as if they need several keystrokes for many characters. I don't believe that this is a good idea for an editor which relies on key combinations to do most of the work.

Another important factor in this framework is the way the user interface is programmed. For example, this is a rough design of how a user interaction with keyboard and tts would look like.


    def addition_drill():
        yield from speak(""Mental Addition Drill."")
        ndigits = yield from number_input(""Enter number of digits"")
        yield from speak(""Let's start."")
        for i in range(10):
            a = randint(0,10**ndigits)
            b = randint(0,10**ndigits)
            question = str(a) + "" plus "" + str(b)
            c = yield from number_input (question)
            if a+b == c:

            else:
                 yield from speak(""Wrong answer. "" + q + "" is "" + str(c))

I haven't implemented all the details yet, but general keyboard events etc work already. The ""yield from"" syntax enables us to use coroutines/generators for asynchronous processing.

My thinking is that it would be easier for blind programmers, especially beginners, to write user interactions this way rather than create windows, widgets, html code etc which then have to be decoded again with the screen reader. And this model still allows for concurrency just as normal user interface frameworks do.

A nice benefit is that this user interface does not require a windowing system or even a screen.",1,0,1,0,0,

I'm sighted but I'm a software engineer specializing in assistive technology and I work with many blind people, including several blind programmers. Most blind programmers I know use a refreshable braille display, like this:

http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/Focus40BrailleDisplay

While expensive, the braille display solves all of the problems of trying to figure out punctuation and indentation from speech. Most states will pay for a braille display and other AT for any blind student who wants one.

I'm curious why you found that most solutions seem to be unsatisfying. I'd say the blind programmers I know find programming to be one of the *most* accessible things they do. In comparison, browsing the web is very challenging because there are so many sites, each one is laid out differently, and people aren't good at providing alt text for images or labels for form controls.
