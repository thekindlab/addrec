How long is her White Cane by the way? There are two types of Canes, one is a short one sometimes called and 'ID Cane' and it is something you hold in front of you and it simple shows Cars/other people you are Blind. You sometimes use it to check depth at curbs or tap things to figure out what they are, but it is not tapped from side to side like a Long Cane.

A Lone Cane is the one most people think of, you tap it left to right in a cone in front of you to not walk into things, check depths, find curbs, cafe stands and bash people in the shins because you can.

And at the end of the day, it is easy to 'milk' your disability. If your feeling a bit sorry for yourself, you can get into a bit of a rut and just let people help you all the time. It kind of compounds the issue and again, it is an issue younger people struggle with. The more they get helped the angrier at the life they become, the more reliant and helpless they can feel.

The other reason your room mate might be letting you help so much is she just likes your company/wants a friend/feels lonely. Is this her first time living away from home? 

It sounds like she could really use some O&amp;M Training from whatever services are available to her. ",1,,1,0,0,

I feel like having a service dog draws enough attention already, a horse would probably draw even more, whatever works for  those people though, I'm happy they have a solution that works for them :)  But yeah, from talking to trainers it sounds like most breeds will work, I guess each school has its preference though.  There are some schools here that only train Labs and I think Fidelco only trains Shepherds, the rest kind of mix around the breeds they use from client to client but most seem to stick within the Lab/ Golden Retriever/ German Shepherd range, at least at the schools I've looked into within the States.",1,,1,0,0,

I probably look confused when I'm trying to get my bearings but it doesn't always mean I don't know what I'm doing.  Most people I know, myself included will ask if assistance is needed.  If they weren't asking for assistance you are probably fine, but the age thing is a unique situation I guess.  Kind of difficult to answer that one.

&amp;nbsp;

In the future with other blind/ visually impaired individuals traveling with a mobility aid I would just let them figure it out.  Every time I've needed help I've asked for it and I frequently find that people offering help slows me down because I don't want to be rude but I don't need the assistance and I also have places to go.  By far my least favorite way that people interact with me is by grabbing me.  This happens frequently on public transit where it is assumed I can't figure it out how to board a bus/ train so I'll get dragged in by someone.  This is a major safety issue for me for a lot of reasons and sets off some major alarms, and it is very disorienting.  You don't seem like the kind of person who would do that though.  Mostly I would just say let the people you see do their thing, if they are traveling independently they probably know what they are doing.  Like a lot of people I've received professional training on orientation and mobility and I've learned the skills necessary to get around with impaired vision by myself.  You learn to adapt :)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I think you'd be hard pressed to present becoming blind as something positive

Pretty sure I could manage it.  I mean, not seriously, but as a self-deprecating bit of humor, sure.  And perhaps that's the way to go; discussing depressing topics through humor is one way we find strength.  Either that, or showcase blind people who are currently successful and happy, and talk about the journey they took to get there.  That way the ad might start off negative, but it could end on a more upbeat tone. That would at least put a positive spin on it.  But it won't happen, because the only purpose of that ad is scaring people into donating money, and if it means screwing those of us who actually are blind to get a few extra bucks, they couldn't care less.  The CNIB in Canada also does this, and it's the primary reason I will no longer have anything to do with the organization.  In Canada, we're finally transitioning our talking book library away from the CNIB and towards CELA and our public libraries.  Once that change finishes, I will cancel my CNIB membership entirely.  

I'm not against realism and practicality, not at all; feel free to reference many of the more depressing posts about education and employment that I've made in this very sub!  There are enormous problems in the blind community, and we need to talk about them.  But we need to talk about them from the perspective of finding solutions, using practical work-arounds in the meantime, and staying upbeat.  Otherwise, not only will we fail to accomplish anything, we'll harm ourselves in the eyes of public perception.  It might be a little hard-line, but I don't believe there is any place what so ever for negativity in an ad that is to be shown to the general public.  Yes, let's be open and honest about our problems and challenges.  But let's not talk about them in the same breath as we beg for money!  Half of the problems blindness causes in the first-world can't even be fixed by a charity. We need companies to understand just how capable we really are, and make the changes needed to create an accessible work environment.  We need educators to realize that blind people are just as capable of achieving academic success as anyone else, and take the time to teach us.  We need people everywhere to know that we live, and play, and laugh, and love, just as often as everyone else in the world does.  None of these problems can be solved by someone donating $20 to help the poor blind people, and then giving themselves a pat on the back.  Yes, charities for medical research towards cures for various types of blindness are fine.  But that's the extent of it.  And those charities need to be run and administered by the blind (something that doesn't apply to the RNIB or CNIB), and they need to be extremely careful that they aren't harming the people who can never be cured when they ask for money.  I think The Vision Walk that this sub recently supported did a pretty good job of that: it didn't portray anyone as helpless or hopeless, and it involved blind people themselves actually showing up and participating.  So let's have more of that, please, and less extreme negativity, that only helps the sighted administrators of charities for the blind keep getting paid.  

In closing, despite my complaints about this one ad, the positive advertising that I want does happen frequently.  AMI in Canada has been doing a series of excellent ads focusing on the importance of audio description that clearly show the problem, what the solution is, and aren't at all sad or negative.  I spent 20 minutes searching youtube to try and find you a link, but sadly I couldn't.  Then I got distracted [watching stuff about beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AkwdxJ0pIc).  However, be assured that the ads aren't ""Think of the poor blind people who can never ever watch TV again! Doesn't it just make you want to cry? Give us money right now!""  And that's exactly the tone I get from the ad featured in the original link.  ",1,,1,0,0,

An adult teacher may have been watching them from a ways back.  In my experience, many orientation and mobility teachers will stay quite far back, so they stay out of ear shot. That way, the blind student can't get clues from the way the teacher is moving, etc.  The lesson may have been something along the lines of ""starting from hear, find the coffee shop we learned the location of last week.""  Once the student or students have done that, then they and the teacher will talk about what went right, and if they got lost, how they did in recovering from that problem.  It's always good to get lost during a lesson, because if you're a blind person, you're going to get lost quite a bit during real life. So one of the most important things we learn is how to find our way again.  Also, many O&amp;M teachers like to stay back because learning to politely ask for help, or politely refuse help that is offered, is another important lesson that might not happen if the teacher is visibly there.

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1444771295,"So for technology I guess it kind of comes down to the application of it or the OS.  I prefer Windows so I use Zoomtext 10 by AiSquared for magnification and NVDA as a screen reader.  NVDA is free and open source, Zoomtext is not and is quite expensive.  You can also get JAWS as a screen reader but JAWS is very expensive and many people don't think it is better than NVDA.  On Mac magnification and color correction are built into the OS along with a stock screen reader.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently an Android user on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but that is likely to change within the next year to ios.  I've come to the conclusion that ios is better in terms of visual accessibility.  This is sad because I'm kind of an Android fanboy.  Anyway, on the Note 4 I just use the stock Samsung accessibility features and they work pretty well.  Google TalkBack is getting better, they recently pushed out an update that seems to be an improvement but Apple still has Google beat on the the mobile screen reading.

&amp;nbsp;

On ios I have been exposed to a couple of apps, most for mobility.  You have BlindSquare and The Seeing Eye App which are both great but are both kind of pricey.  On both Android and ios you have apps that are not necessarily blind specific but that are very helpful.  I like Google Maps Walking Directions and an app called Transit.  Transit provides real time public transit updates.  There is another app on ios called Hopstop that does this too.

&amp;nbsp;

In terms of hardware, I really like the Humanware Trekker Breeze platform as a mobility GPS, I have one of those on the way and I've had a chance to trial one for a few weeks and loved it.  I also use an Eschenbach Smartlux Digital video magnifier which is great.  People also like the Freedom Scientific Pebble.  I also have a full size CCTV by Enhanced Vision called the Davinci.  In addition I use a Bradley Timepiece for time keeping which is super awesome.

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1444969661,"Night blindness is one of my biggest issues.  Admittedly I haven't partaken in Trick or Treating in quite some time but when I was younger my parents did some things to make it easier.  I would get him a flashlight, this is great for night blindness.  If he's really young he doesn't need to have it always in his room or whatever, but making it available for these kinds of night activities would be good.  This can be a major comfort and can help with safety.  In the meantime I would learn sighted guide technique.  There are some videos on YouTube about sighted guide that you can find which should explain it better than I can here.  Depending on what works for him a flashlight may be good, or you may look to other options.  I personally switched to a cane as my primary mobility aid day and night a little over a year ago to address the other aspects of my vision loss and it had the bonus of replacing the need to use a flashlight.  He may or may not want to do this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd also just like to note that allowing him to figure things out is really good.  My parents from very early on insisted that I learn to do things by myself.  They were always there to help me when I needed it but they wouldn't do things for me and I have benefited enormously from this.  Though I'm passed the days of trick or treating, I have no problem going out at night knowing that I have the skills to be independent with friends or alone using the skills and tools available to me.  Let him make a few mistakes while figuring out night blindness, it will make him much more independent in the future.

If you can get the tutor, have them get in touch with your professor.

At the end of the day, other than 'that is not fair!, everyone should be treated equal!' why SHOULD an employer hire you/a vision impaired person over the other candidates? You have to show that you can adapt to anything, that you put in extra effort to make sure your disability is not a burden to your employer.

I do not disclose my disability at all when applying for jobs. I obviously do not apply for things I know I cannot do. I bring my own software and have bought a laptop/tablet in before to demonstrate how I use a device to overcome my vision loss.

Getting a job starting out and breaking into an indutry and building up some experience is always going to be hard wether you can see or not. I have many younger friends who cannot find work because nobody wants to 'give them a go'. 

You can see it a few ways, are you a stronger more capable person because you have fought to be where you are, because you are willing to work much harder to compete with able bodied people in your industry? Does your strength to overcome obstacles, to adapt creatively to the challenges in your every day life make you an asset, someone who thinks outside the box and who is going to be a loyal employee for treating them like a human being?

Or is being vision impaired about what entitlements you are owed by the world because it is not fair that everyone else can see and drive and read and you cannot, and people should accommodate you because Section X of an Act says they have too?

I think we all react much better to a positive, confident person who has answers for the questions an employer will have rather than someone comes in, and just wants a job and also wants accommodations to do it. At the end of the day they are both the same, but one is driven by you, and the other is where you expect others to do the work for you.

Hopefully my words are not too harsh, and I totally relate to peoples frustration and pain in finding work, especially as a young adult out of high school or uni/college. Breaking into the workforce is hard for everyone that age, and having a disability in the mix can just make things feel hopeless.

I have a bachelor of science in professional/technical writing, which covers grant writing, technical writing, document design, usability testing, and editing. 

I've worked on two internships, and have used my abilities to assist more than one company to improve their content.

I worked for just under two years at my university's IT department, troubleshooting problems for both students and faculty as well as maintain/repair more complex IT problems in and around campus.

I've been looking for full-time work that utilizes the degree I earned in school, and have worked with DVR and other employment consultants to refine my resume and other qualifications so that employers get the right information and nothing irrelevant. I'm aware that a lot of HR departments use computers to search through documents for key phrases, and that's one of the things I've worked with DVR and my Employment Counselor to get through and make myself more hire-able.

The reason I've been disclosing up-front about my disability is because it winds up saving time. I've gotten as far as interviewing and walked in with my service dog or a white cane and done well, but never received a callback. I double, tripple, and quadrouple-check my information and call the company back but they either ""lose"" my application or decide to ""choose other candidates."" In the end, disclosing my disability up front seems both more honest about my personality and a protection against getting my hopes up and getting them crushed.

However, something's not right about this.  In the first place, she should have her cane out at all times.  It sounds to me like she's just not paying any attention to where she's going at all, and not even having her cane out is the first sign of that.  In the second place, it's mid October now.  When I had similar issues, I got someone to guide me for the first two weeks or so, and describe where we were going.  Then I had them walk with me, but not guide me (I wasn't holding there arm or anything) for a week or so after that, until I was confident I knew how to get from point A to B reliably on my own.  I probably didn't even need help for that long, but it was a complicated campus, and I'm an infamously terrible traveler.  

There actually was a case where I didn't learn the way to one particular class, because one of my classmates was in my dorm, and we were friends anyway, and it was a morning class, so we just naturally met outside the dorm and traveled there together.  Then he dropped the class half way through.  I was left scrambling in November to learn something I should have made an effort to learn in the first week of September.  It sucked!  Needless to say, that wasn't a mistake I made again.  Also, it made the person who had been guiding me feel needlessly bad, over something that was definitely my poor planning and lack of forethought.  

As to how to keep your relationship with her healthy, I don't know.  Perhaps make a point of describing where you're going, pointing out the turns you're making and everything your passing and so on, while you're guiding her.  Because she really does need to know that stuff, if she's ever going to go anywhere on her own.  Ask her how she's doing at learning her way around the rest of the campus.  Offer to walk along with her if she wants to try and get somewhere on her own, so you can help out if/when she gets lost.  Generally just try and shift the focus of your relationship from doing things for her to helping her do things for herself.  If she's interested in independence at all, that should go quite smoothly, and she should start needing less of your time.  If she's not interested in Independence, then you'll probably get excuses and guilt-trips.  In that case, I'm not sure that she's in a place where you can have a healthy relationship with her, because she may want people to do things for her more than she wants friends.  Also, sadly, I don't think she'll last long in university.  

Most importantly though, start bringing up this stuff in conversation with her now.  Don't let it keep bothering you for weeks and weeks, until one day you just explode out of the blue in frustration with having to do things for her all the time. That isn't fair to her, and it isn't fair to you.  When I ask someone for help, if I'm inconveniencing them even a little, I'd rather they bring it up right away.  I might be able to make other arrangements, or ask them less often, or ask someone else, or find a way to take less time, etc.  If people pretend everything is totally OK, and they're just fine with what I'm asking, even though they're really not, I'm probably going to ask again.  And then when they're suddenly irritated the second or third time I ask, it can be quite a surprise.  ",3,,3,0,0,
41c805e6-708c-481c-a37e-f22048d13575,1445829837,"I'm a developer that does some accessible front-end coding and this was my experience doing accessibility testing with NVDA. The lone test case was just to exit the beta site.

TLDR Analysis: I do not believe screen reader users will be able to exit the beta site at all. I tried with NVDA and even with sight, the focus management was non-existent and I gave up.

On the page linked in the OP, the focus dumps you on the body element. The first tab is the skip to main content link. After that there are two list of links (one on the left and one on the right) that are glyphicons without any hidden text to announce what they really are to screen readers (end results is just the word ""link"" being announced back). Nothing wrong with glyphicons but they absolutely need hidden text to back them up.

There is one that will announce back which is ""Sign in"" since it's printed there in text. A user relying on a screen reader would have to find this and know to do a shift+tab once to land on the Exit button (announces as ""link""). This requires prior knowledge of this or having a sighted user help (which defeats the purpose of web accessibility).

This is where it really hits the fan. Upon activating that Exit link, a modal pops up but focus does not go to it at all. A screen reader user will be waiting here forever and never know a modal popped up. After fumbling with tabbing through, I found the modal to be all the way at the start of the DOM which again requires either prior knowledge or a sighted user helping out.

For whatever reason the textareas have no labels and instead have heading level 4 text to mark what they are. NVDA had no idea what it was and just said it was an editable field. None of the buttons on the modal were properly labeled either and instead announce as ""button"" for all of them. I couldn't find any nearby items to go off of so at this point I gave up. For a final kick in the balls, the focus element was not visible to the user so sighted users that can only rely on a keyboard will probably not succeed in exiting the beta either.

Another weird design choice (going off on a mini tangent) was all the heading level 6 elements. For screen readers examining it, I'm sure you encountered a million random numbers being called out as heading levels. For each sound byte file, they coded the view, favorite, and comment counters as a heading level 6. This is probably the least of their concerns with accessibility though.

I've sent feedback with a developer commentary on that exit button and strongly urged them to remove opt-out style beta testing as they are not even close to ready for that. The site design visually does not look bad but they completely threw out HTML semantics to get it there instead of using CSS like they should. This HTML should have never passed internal code reviews nor internal testing.",1,,1,0,0,

What's ""wrong"" with that question (or most questions like it) is the fact that people aren't educated about assistive technology, or are otherwise incapable of looking it up, so it's a question that gets asked over and over and over, as if blind people are assumed to be living in the stone age or something. Yes, blind people can use computers. We put a remote-controlled car on mars, and nobody blinks. We managed to accurately throw a camera past pluto, and nobody balks. We have successfully taken the physical media necessary to store a gigabyte down from a city block to a chip no bigger than your pinky nail, and there are other chips of the same size with 128x the storage capacity for under 50 bucks, and yet still, somehow, people get so confused and astonished to find that technology is capable of making computers, the internet, phones, and all sorts of other electronics accessible to people who are blind. 

That's upsetting because it represents just one of the many ways sighted people tend to ""overlook"" people with disabilities, not just the blind. People are more than willing to learn about cultures in other countries, but somehow disability culture is still more alien to people than [the festival where they dress up guinea pigs in Peru and then eat them afterward.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l98aBSXYz7U)

I'm not saying anyone who asks this question is to blame for the vast amounts of ignorance that is required for this question to be a constant mystery to people who are assumed to be sighted and have access to computers. I'm saying it's a symptom of a larger problem, and it's more and more infuriating every time I hear someone ask me ""How do you use a computer?""

&amp;nbsp;

******

So to your post...  It's kind of interesting thinking about what I would do if I had to relearn how to use technology from the ground up.

&amp;nbsp;

At this stage, being low vision I would say having decent systems off the bat would be good, make sure they are fast, up to date, and secure to limit issues that already come with computers while students are trying to learn.  I also think having a mix of OSX and Windows systems (or loading Windows on a separate partition of a Mac computer) would be good to give exposure to both operating systems.  On the Windows side of things, I'd definitely have NVDA, JAWS, and Zoomtext on board to train with accessibility software.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not a braille reader, but perhaps having braille displays available would be good?  I'm not sure how many people use them, so if anyone here uses one and wants to educate me on whether people like them or not that would be great.

&amp;nbsp;

The last piece is to make sure that touch typing is emphasized.  I would not be anywhere close to the level of computer proficiency that I have if I did not have typing skills.  I never really liked the large print keyboards, the large print wasn't really helpful and the keyboards were usually poorly built.  I actually much prefer having a nice mechanical keyboard, I use Cherry MX Blue key switches which offer a tactile bump and would be great to learn how to touch type on.  The goal is to be able to type without sight and I think getting a good learning program as opposed to using large print stickers is the better route in the long run.  I learned to type when I could read screens with more ease and when I was very young, we had drill programs that taught us how to type in school.  I'm not sure if a blind friendly version of those exists now, or if one could be adapted.  That would be something to look into.  What my school did when I was as young as 7 was put rubber keyboard covers over the keyboards so that we couldn't even use the markings on the keyboard, this forced us to learn how to touch type which was very beneficial.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, those are my thoughts, hope this helps :)

If you feel okay talking about your visual impairment with your potential employer, it's probably beneficial for both you and them in the long run. Maybe towards the end of the interview kind of make a joke about it (employers often get feel really awkward about talking about disabilities because they feel like it might be a touchy subject) like ""Well, as you guys may be able to tell, (or not tell), I have a visual impairment."" Then the most important thing to do from there is inform them how you would be able to perform the responsibilities of the job you are interviewing for with your visual impairment. The general population, as I'm sure you've come to realize, has no idea how people with visual impairments are independent, functioning members of society. If you confidently present to the interviewers how you used public transport to get to the interview on time, you use a screen reader on the computer to be able to do all the things sighted people can, you use a magnifier to read printed items, etc. (I'm just using examples, I'm not assuming these are the types of accommodations you use). You can also tell them that they can ask you questions about your visual impairment if they have any, it all just depends on your comfort level. 

Of course, you don't have to disclose anything to them if you don't want to. However, if you don't discuss your visual impairment with them and you are hired under the assumption that you are sighted, it could just cause some awkwardness and miscommunication in the long run.

Sure, showing the person coping with it and being fine would be preferable but it would also take more time and cost more, possibly get less attention.

While I agree with many of the points you make regarding the way society sees us, and that the problem is not about money, this particular campaign is about a particular issue which requires funding. Note this is a very specific campaign with goals: only 1 in 3 hospitals in the UK has a sight advisor. What does the campaign ask you to do? Not give money to the evil RNIB and its evil sighted administrators, but sign a petition to the British government to improve this support, which to me seems like a pretty good idea.

So in closing, this campaign doesn't:

* Ask for money for RNIB.
* Ask for money for the poor blind people who will never have a life.
* Complain about problems of blindness while begging for money.
* Fill the pockets of the evil RNIB administrators.

This is a campaign about one of those problems which requires actual social support: sight advisors in hospitals. It's not even particularly about curing blindness.

I think it's notable, and I'm not attacking you personally either, how people reach this conclusion that the negative campaign is exploiting the blind and asking for money for some unaccountable RNIB bureaucracy, when looking at the actual claims of the campaign they're really specific, and about an issue which requires action by the NHS and which doesn't involve the RNIB getting any money. That's why I think the reaction is oversensitive and a little misplaced. I don't think this should be the only type of campaigns that blind advocacy organisations carry out, but I don't think they're out of order, either.

I'm amazed (in a bad way) at the questions she gets in public, and the assumption that she is obligated to answer them.  And it never ends -- on almost every bus ride, she gets questions or comments that are either directly or indirectly about her blindness.  I know it's frustrating and sometimes exhausting, and that has been an education for me.

I can understand asking a blind person a few questions about her blindness, once you've gotten to know her and sort of ""earned"" the right to ask those questions.  But I also feel like I have an obligation to simply learn things on my own, by paying attention and being a good listener / observer, instead of asking invasive questions, so that learning about a person's blindness is just part of learning about the person in general.

Corded phones are generally better as they have a large base unit that is better for large buttons but you can also get cordless phones.

Whichever is better would probably depend on your grandmothers ability to memorise what button does which function by touch.

You'd think they would be more cognizant of independence and O&amp;M issues.  I went to go see my doctor for a regular physical and I arrived into the office and checked in, a volunteer grabbed my arm to guide me to my seat and I wanted to say ""You know, I figured out how to get here on the bus, got in the building, and found your department, do you really think I can't problem solve my way to a seat?""

One of my O&amp;Ms a while ago taught me this thing, I think it's called the  Hind's Break or the Hind's Maneuver.  Basically if they grab your arm and you take your other arm and grab their arm a little above the elbow, this usually kind of catches people off guard and they will loosen up that you can gently tug your arm out of their grip and then you are in control of their arm and can kind of push off.  The whole point of this is that you can separate but it doesn't feel to the person like you are aggressively pushing them away, you can kind of slip out.  That's how he explained it at least.

I have a particular problem on public transit with people trying to help me on to buses or trains, and it's a major safety issue because I don't know who they are or if they really are just trying to help.  This is aside from the fact that it's super invasive and that I am fully capable of managing on my own.  The other maneuver that was taught to me by this one O&amp;M is twisting my arm towards their thumb until it breaks or loosens their grip and then I do a little tug and that takes their hand right off.  This is good for people with death grips that are so determined to help me that they are unable to listen to my verbal request that they quit touching me.

The only things I could add is to consider the following:     
     
1) Rarely is a blind person ever in an unfamiliar environment by themselves. Typically, if we are going to an unfamiliar building, it is usually to see (no pun intended) someone like a doctor or other professional.     
     
2) Most commercial structures have extraordinarily loud fire alarms and there is no universal sound for them. If you were going to make an audible guide to emergency exit routes, you will have to ensure that it is clear that's what the noise means (like something verbally saying ""stairwell; fire exit this way"" or something). This wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea.     
     
3) Another thing to consider is the overlap of multiple noises and geneal chaos including the fire alarm itself, people yelling and moving in different directions (some running out, some running back in), and the possible confusion of more than one device saying ""fire exit this way"" (as one might lead to the actual exit while the other leads them away from it).

To say that someone losing their sight fears for their job is not to say blind people can't work. To say that they are afraid and uncertain is not to say that blind people can't be happy.

Does she have any vision? From your first description where she doesn't use her Cane very much it sounded like she had some she was using, but if she is using a lot of Braille then I am now second guessing how much she might have?

Does magnification help her? If she is using an Apple device there is an amazing zoom feature on it. It is in the options and essentially once it is turned on you tape the screen with three fingers and then drag up and down and it will set a 'zoom level'. Then three finger tap and it will zoom out. Simple three finger tap over the area you want to 'zoom' to and then swipe up/down/left/right to 'move around'. Three finger tap again and it zooms back out.

As a low sighted person who relies on magnification mostly it means any Application can be navigated as this is not application spefifc but built into iOS.

Before I had a Guide Dog, I had a Long Cane instructor. I was 'on the books' with my organization that helps me. If I would have a new route to learn because something in my everyday was changing I would call them up and ask for an appointment to come out and help me figure out the best way to my campus/employer etc. Together we would figure out the best combination of trains/buses/walking routes and they would show me hazards that I might not see etc.

We would then figure out things inside as well, like if I had to use a lift everyday they would show me the buttons I would need etc and we would do a few 'dry runs' so I could feel confident I could get to the place by myself.

It sounds like she is having friends/guardians/parents do this for her instead and she is too shy, not independent enough to reach out for help? A lot of places will let you refer her to them as a friend. Often they understand people are too shy or embarrassed to ask for help, and can be great about reaching to the client and making them see that they could benefit from the services they provide. 

Would she go get food at the place by herself or had she only been there with you? Did you read her the menu? Go get the food for her? How did it work?

""You donʻt look blind."" Wtf is that supposed to mean? Oh sorry I missed the dresscode memo. With what Iʻm wearing I would not pass as a sighted person in Italy any more.
Iʻve started habitually showing my friends how to do stuff with a screenreader easily. If I show it first, as in itʻs cool and makes my life easier, then perhaps i avoid some of those ""why do you use..? Oh"" reactions.",2,,2,0,0,

Essentially you hold your finger on the screen and it makes 'walking noises' and plays ambient noise. It sounds like your in a tunnel. Then you walk up or down, left or right to avoid things and reach the end of a maze.

The screen is totally black and when you touch the screen light pulses from your finger and illuminates in a small field of view around where you are touching.

I can just ask one of them for help as they pass me.  In that situation, asking strangers for help is no problem.  I really can't think of a situation where I would be entirely alone in a large building, without even any passing strangers who I could ask for help.  ",1,,1,0,0,

It's great that anyone gets into computer programming, and I hope the person gains enough from learning to make any difficulty worth it, but this will only increase the number of people asking ""How do you use a computer if you're blind?""
