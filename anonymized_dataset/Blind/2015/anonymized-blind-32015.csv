WHile this solution may not be an ideal one, I can certainly appreciate anyone who wants to put in the effort to better the lives of any group. As someone else articulated, it's hard to really figure out what your project is trying to do from the page you linked to. From the page, I can tell this is some sort of wearable but can't gather much more from that. Perhaps a description of the product idea would benefit those on here. While I feel that some of your assumptions about the capabilities of the blind, especially when it comes to smartphones, might be off, it's unfortunate that some people decided to railroad into you for trying.
You will find however, that what many may perceive as the capabilities of blind people are often quite different than what they really are. Plus, capabilities vary widely from those living at home and doing very little to employed blind people that travel the world. Just like developing a product for any market segment, it's important to understand your audience and know what might be possible. As for your Google Maps example, I could achieve that task just about as efficiently as you could, either using the Talkback screen reader on Android or with Google's voice search. There's thousands of blind smartphone users currently, especially on the iPhone.

My opinion in brief: Braille is important, but far too costly. If giving up Braille meant more money spent on mobility training, technology training, and employment training, I'd give it up.  But it won't; giving up Braille will just mean spending less money on educating blind people overall.  But we need to be spending every research dollar we can scrape together on bringing down the cost of Braille, the cost of devices, and the cost of education to a tenth of what it costs today.

&gt;Where did you hear that blind people can't use smart phones? That is simply not true.

Let me clarify what I meant. I'm referring to being able to quickly and easily open google maps, pop in an address, and look at walking directions. For a sighted user, that's about a 15 second process. It's obviously longer without that. My proposal relies on GMaps as well. The change is that instead of having to use the phone, and listen for directions, it's a matter of holding up your hand, pressing one button, and speaking your destination. Within a few seconds, you'd be on your way. 

&gt;This is just more do-gooder shit to make some college kid wannabe philanthropist feel like a rockstar. 

It wasn't even an assignment, I did it out of a personal interest to try to make something a little bit better. It literally wasn't even the intent of the product to be revolutionary. Even in the way I just phrased what I wrote above, the point is to make navigation just a little bit easier. That's it. It's not going to change the world, it's to use existing, cheap technology in a new way, to simplify and improve. 

As for usage testing, I did actually talk to people. I worked with my college's disability support office, and interviewed some blind students. The consensus among them and the workers was the same. Obviously it's not trying to be a revolution, it's trying to say, ""Hey, it's a simple, cheap, easy to use hands free device that conveys accurately and succinctly basic directions to the wearer.""

&gt; 1) Why is this more useful than just using a smartphone app? 

Quite a few ways. For one, the fully blind (for most intents and purposes) can't operate a modern smartphone. The entirely glass interface and lack of anything tactile kills that chance. I originally explored making an app, actually. That would allow them to touch one of four quadrants of the screen to do an action that was announced audibly. However, I ended up deciding against that because....

&gt; 2) Is this extra product needed? 

I'd strongly say yes, for a few reasons. First off, as you know, sound and the ability to hear environmental cues are extremely important. It's an easy thought to say ""Well, give them audio directions,"" but that introduces a safety risk. Anything that blocks potential sound reduces environmental awareness. It also opens up the chance that a direction could be missed or misheard. Next, for those who are using canes to move around, holding a smartphone would tie up their only free hand, a major inconvenience. 

&gt; 3) Is navigation the biggest problem blind people face?

From the feedback I've gotten, it's a major one. Those I interviewed all shared the general feedback that physically getting through spaces wasn't that hard. If they knew their route, they could get to where they wanted. The real problem arises if the destination is somewhere new. If you can't read street signs, etc, it's very difficult to get around. Ultimately, that's the specific goal I'm attempting to achieve. 

I should address the goals of this project. As you may know, Microsoft is developing a product with similar aims, but an entirely different method. Their blind navigation device uses a combination of sonar, embedded transmitters throughout the city, etc. It's a very tech heavy, futuristic, and in many ways, 'better' device than mine. I looked at the problem from the other side. I think MS has a bunch of sighted designers who closed their eyes and though, ""Ok, I'm blind, what can we make to fix this?"" and then used all the awesome tech MS has at their disposal. 

My goal was more, ""What can we do today, using existing technology, cheaply, that would make a major impact."" It's an assistive device, not a complete replacement for vision, but I think that's what's needed to make a large impact, and quickly. 

Thanks for the feedback and questions. ",1,0,1,0,0,

Honestly though, a blind person on a crowded sidewalk should/will probably be using a different cane technique than they might on an empty sidewalk, involving holding the cane farther down the shaft so it doesn't stick out as far, making slightly narrower sweeps, and moving a little bit slower.  If you're walking normally, a blind person will probably hear you well enough to either avoid you completely, or just tap your ankle on the way buy.  Personally, where I have a problem is when someone sees me coming, panics, and freezes.  Now they're not making any sound at all, and they've come to a dead stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Ironically, it's these people who I sometimes end up crashing into, because I don't hear them, and because they're not moving in the same way (speed/direction) as everyone else I'm sharing the sidewalk with.  

If you're elderly, or using a crutch/walker yourself, it can be helpful to call out to a blind person coming up to you: ""Careful; I'm using a walker!"" or something similar.  This should draw our attention to the fact that you might be moving slower than we expect, and that we need to be careful about not knocking into you.  ",6,0,6,0,0,

One of the major obstacles that they came across like mentioned by the other two people is the cost. While labeling is important there are other more cost effective ways to produce a label than buying your own 3D printer or going to a local shop that prints them for you. Hopefully this problem will not be an issue much longer since cheaper 3D printers are being produced. The problem with these cheaper printers is the quality of what they print. I've seen 3D printed braille and it looks okay but if you want the crispness and quality you're going to need a better printer.

There are [hand held label makers](http://www.lssproducts.com/product/braille-label-maker/braille-writing) that run up to around $30 that sighted people can use. You can also use a Perkins brailler on sticky paper or use a slate and stylus and cut it up based on your needs.

If I was suddenly sighted, but deaf, I'd have even more challenges than a person who was born deaf: I couldn't read print because I learned Braille as a child instead, I couldn't identify colours because I'd never seen them before, I probably couldn't read maps, I couldn't use a computer because I only know how to use a computer with a screen reader not a mouse, I wouldn't know sign language, I'd have trouble estimating distance/depth/quantity/size by vision because I'd never done it before (I'd have to learn to compensate for things like perspective and light level), and probably lots and lots of things sighted people do naturally with vision that I haven't even thought of (recognizing faces, maybe).
