The Department of Social Services for my state has a subdivision called Rehabilitative Services for the Blind.  This is state funded, they provided me with a caseworker for general things and an Orientation and Mobility specialist.  This is all free of charge.  I meet with my O&amp;M specialist once every few weeks and I am coming close to completing my training fully.  They do more than just cane work, they can help you with night time orientation, public transit techniques, and tons more.  If you don't have something like Rehabilitative Services for the Blind you can look for private organizations (I have two in my area).  All of these agencies can help you with training and equipment.

My caseworker at RSB made sure I got the training I need, she also pointed me to another organization which provided me with over 5,000 dollars in low vision technology including a desktop CCTV, iPad, and handheld video magnifier.  These are all things that I wouldn't have been able to afford by myself.  Luckily there are resources, you just have to seek them out.

Back to the cane, I really enjoy the confidence it gives me.  People make room for you and you don't get the frustration from people in public.  Part of the problem is that just because you are visually impaired and prone to running into things does not necessarily mean you look like you have that problem to the public.  The cane makes your disability visible which is good for a lot of reasons.  The one I like the most is the not getting in hassled part, however it is also very important for safety.  It is a very visible warning to drivers that you are visually impaired and may not see them and it has gotten me out of a few situations where I didn't hear a car coming due to the noise level of my surrounding.  If for no other reason than that I will not leave the house without a cane in my hand.  

Beyond the warning it gives, you just won't run into stuff as much and that is a fantastic perk :)  If you can find an organization that will train you for free they will probably also provide you with a cane for free.  If you can't find one, I don't think it would be impossible to train yourself on the basics.  It isn't exactly rocket science and if you needed guidance I could PM you some basic techniques.

As far as I know (and I could be wrong), standards documents don't really address this.  The problem is especially bad on sites that allow users to style things, like MySpace and Zanga used to, back in the day.  You can wind up with some parts of a website that are perfectly accessible, and some that aren't, depending on who's in charge.  Wordpress.com for example, is pretty bad for this.  They host all the wordpress installs everyone who blogs at domain.wordpress.com uses, so there is no reason they can't let me sign in with my Wordpress.com account, and then force every wordpress.com blog I view to use a theme of my choice.  That way, they'd all look the same, and be more-or-less accessible!  Tumblr is another website that's bad for this; I haven't tried tumblr in over a year, but last I checked, even when I signed in, I couldn't disable the customized styles for each different tumblr.  If that's changed and I'm wrong, I'd love to know!  In the positive category, Reddit does this perfectly; when I'm signed in, I can disable subreddit styles, if I don't want them.  DreamWidth and other LiveJournal based sites also do this well; I can force every other journal I visit to use the style I have for my journal.

I have had interviewers start talking to me as if I were six years old again or start talking to others in the interview as if I wasn’t there.  I had one company tell me the job had been filled that very morning, pull the job off their website and re-post it a week later with a “REQUIREMENT” of a valid drivers license even though the description stated zero percent travel.  

I truly believe that the average person doesn’t understand the difference between “legally blind” and “totally blind”.  My empirical evidence indicates that most people sub-consciously make a connection that if your eyes don’t work and since your eyes are in your head then there must be something wrong with the rest of your head.  

I no longer use the phrase “legally blind” when my vision comes up in an interview, instead I use the phrase “very near sighted” which seems to be more acceptable to people, it is something they can relate to I guess.  Using “very near sighted” is a way to open the topic for conversation and allow me the opportunity to quantify my vision, offer examples of how my vision is an asset to me in my job as well as, hopefully, an opportunity for me to dispel some false assumptions the average person may have about people with visual impairments.  

A potential employer needs to know and not making them aware of my vision during the interview would, I think, come across as being deceptive.  One of the best opening I get is when I am asked what my strengths are to which I reply that being very near sighted from birth has given me a lifetime of experience in problem solving and that I have honed that skill to a razors edge.  More often than not I am asked to elaborate on the “skill” of problem solving before I am asked about the “tool” of being very near sighted

Personally, no.  I have my TTS set to well over 300 words per minute, and the average human speaks at 150 words per minute.  Sure, for fiction books and stories, I love audio readings by a real human, because they can dramatize the fiction in a way a computer never will.  But for the vast majority of the blog posts I read, a human reading would add no value.  I can honestly think of only 2 of the 20 or 30 blogs I read regularly that I'd enjoy having read to me. For the rest of them, I'd use my TTS even if I had the option of a human reader.  TTS is faster, and if the article has been well-organized (headings, etc), I can skip the uninteresting bits.  

Also, every single blog I read includes multiple images in the articles with no alt-text, or where the only thing in the alt-text is photo credits (stockphoto/Wavecraft Media is not valid alt-text, no matter that it passes all the tests, and fulfills your obligations to give photo credits).  I'm absolutely serious about this, without any exaggeration at all:, every single blog I read has photos with no alt-text or invalid alt-text.  So trying to get bloggers to read their articles out loud is just a tragic waste of resources, that could be better spent advocating about alt-text.  If you use an image, for anything, it needs a description.  Who cares if you take the 25 minutes required to record a reading of your article, if you flatly refuse to take the 45 seconds needed to describe an image you included.  ",2,0,2,0,0,

On Windows, of course, there are multiple screen reading packages, and they all do things slightly differently.  While there are APIs on Windows like IAccessible2, support and implementations differ.  

As for your games, if you want to access them right now, and have access to Windows, a guide on how to do that is at:

It requires that you use the NVDA screen reader, and have installed the OCR Extension for NVDA.  Basically, using steam involves trying to run OCR on the text in the steam Window, and clicking on likely looking bits of text.  In my experience, this breaks frequently, and I would, in the strongest possible terms, not recommend anyone who is blind purchase any Steam games; any update could, at any time, break this solution, and you will lose all of the money you've invested in games.  Also, it won't work on Mac, or with anything but NVDA, Firefox, and Windows.  But if you already have some steam games, maybe because you got them for free in a promotion, or because you purchased them before you lost your vision, you can still sort of access them for now, sometimes.

Some people have tried models where it displays a single character at a time, but I don't find these to offer the same level of flexibility. At minimum, a full line (40 cells or more) seems ideal, especially for programmers as one can feel the characters in relationship to each other and spot errors such as missing braces, etc. A good braille reader will use multiple fingers on both hands and can read at 200-300 words a minute or more.

And the person.

I have so bad memories from hospitals of a litime and especially last year that I rather die than go in any hospital, at least in USA.

Let's put it this way:
Hospitals and EMS fail in recognizing people who are blind or visually impaired.

ER doctors have talked to my husband to ask about my symptoms while I am lying on a hospital bed, and fully conscious. WTF?! Jusf because my eyes don't have the same type of funtional vision as yours, why do I need an interprete? Oh yea beacuse I don't see, right... 
So I don't know what hospitals I've been in because they don't always actually inform the patient. 

I also wish every medical staff would quit ever trying to do stroke diagnostics on me.
I have a non-24h circadian rhythm, what a surprise. I try to regulate my sleep/awake schedule. English being my third language I may form a bit odd sentences to a native speakersʻ shall we say, eyes?

I don't even know how I can find out in this country if I have been diagnozed with a seizure. Guess how fun that is...

Medical records belong to the corporation, not the patient. That depends on the state you live in. US is definitely the most stressful place for any medical needs of all the countries I've lived in on three different continents. 

It would probably be less stressful if I had been always completely blind.",4,0,4,0,0,
7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1429640877,"Facebook on the computer has improved a lot, over the last year or so.  But it uses all the fancy new accessibility APIs, so if your version of JAWS is even 1 version out-of-date, Facebook is going to be a lot easier on Mobile.  Think of it like this: on a computer, you have a large screen, with lots of memory and CPU, so apps are designed to have multiple things happening, all at once: a scrolling activity feed on the side, chat messages and notifications popping up, an endlessly scrolling newsfeed, and all that just on the one page, not counting all of the other apps the computer is running.  On a phone, the screen, CPU, battery, data, and memory are limited enough, that most apps are designed to only do 1 or 2 things at once.  As a 27-year-old blind person who has been an extremely active computer user since age 9, even I find doing a lot of things on my phone much easier and less frustrating.  

If you do want to keep your grandfather on the desktop, I strongly recommend getting him using Firefox with NVDA (http://www.nvda-project.org).  NVDA is a free and open source screen reader, so he can have the latest and best, without having to pay several thousand dollars every 2 years.  Also, currently NVDA's support for web apps, when using Firefox, is the best by miles.  The key commands are similar enough to JAWS that he won't be totally lost, either.  Also, once you've gotten him on Firefox, you can give him AAdBlock.  For a blind person, this is the best thing.  First off, it blocks all of those animated ads and pop-up windows and spammy links with no relation to what we're trying to do.  This will make the screen reader faster, and his experience much better; as a blind person, it's sometimes not obvious where the ads end and the real website begins.  And if you know a little about web development yourself, if your grandfather finds something on a website difficult or confusing, you can use AdBlock to get rid of it for him, or GreaseMonkey and Stylish to modify it.  This is something only Firefox seems to allow, and in my opinion, is another reason why Firefox and NVDA leads the pack in accessibility.  ",1,0,1,0,0,

See, whenever I use my iPhone, I'm always, always using my stereo bluetooth headset.  But, here's the surprising part: If I turn off the headset, and just use my iPhone speaker, the crashes are vastly reduced.  I can use the video controls without crashing at all, and the Netflix app never crashes when I start video playback.  I did have it crash at launch once, but I just don't have the time to give it another 10 or 20 tries and see if it keeps happening.  I also still have huge lag when swiping through things like search results and recommendations, and if I swipe too quickly, the app will still crash.  But the lag and that one crash are the only bugs left after turning off my bluetooth headset.  So it seems like the bugs I'm experiencing have something to do with using Voiceover in Netflix while using a Bluetooth headset.  That...is oddly specific.  I haven't yet figured out if It's my model of headset, or all Bluetooth headsets, yet.  And I'm not sure I care enough to test.
