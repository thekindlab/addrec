* Why me?

 Mostly that I am willing and able. I am an experienced mod on a number of medium and large sub reddits. I check my mod queue 5-10 times a day to handle reports quickly. My connection to blindness is that I have been married to a blind person for 25 years, /u/91e81c72-269b-44a2-821f-a358941a5c0f. In that time I've met and worked with many other blind people. I have also previously worked in assistive technology and web accessibility though this has never been the focus of my career.

* What will you do?

 I am eager to fight spammers (I have a particular hatred of ""custom vertical blinds"" spam) and help maintain a civil community. I originally volunteered for just this cleanup role and to run the automoderator. I have a familiarity with accessibility technology, public access laws in Canada and the US, living skills, service dogs and other blindness topics and when I don't know the answers myself I know others I can call on to provide information.",1,0,1,0,0,

I'm not very active on the mobility front to be perfectly honest. I do use OCR on my Samsung phone, so I'm not limited as far as written wording goes. I can snap a photo with my phone's camera and the words in the picture are converted into a document. Then the words are read aloud.
I also don't go out too nuch from the apartment. 
The biggest complaint I find is a lack of accessability in applications. I understand that I can't run around in an online rpg like I used to, but that's no reason why a developer can't at least try to label some of it.
There's no reason on this planet why the app Kik can't label itself properly. 
I've frankly have given up on the pc getting something like voice-over or talk-back with a mouse. I haven't even put a screen reader on any of my computers because the technology for mobile outdoes the pc, and that's a flat shame.
I'm fortunate enough to be married so my wife drives us to where we need to go but I imagine that both Ios and Google need more accessability features in things.
Off the top of my head, google maps has a street view, why not add a waypoint feature that way gps navigating can be increased to add a 'my route' feature. 
You set a waypoint at the door, walk ten feet forward and set another one, turn left and start to walk. Sure, this would require help, but I'd be able to manage to take out the trash in my apartment complex on my own using a waypoint system.",1,0,1,0,0,

I totally get wanting to stick with your favorite platform, I'm an Android fanboy to the end and I refuse to switch until I absolutely have to.

My current phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which is about as good as it gets with the Android devices I've used in terms of accessibility.  You can use the S Pen to control a magnifier and it works so well, honestly one of my favorite features.  You can also setup a quick accessibility menu that can be activated by tapping the home button 3 times which will give you access to the toggles for Negative colors, TalkBack, and a shortcut to the full accessibility menu.  This makes it super easy to adjust quickly to different needs.

The TalkBack is unfortunately incredibly weak compared to IOS.  I know Google is working on it but if he occasionally needs to use this feature (like me) it won't be as robust as on the Apple platform.

Android is undoubtedly behind on the accessibility thing, however Google is working hard to make the platform better.  My struggle is that my mobility is impaired.  I use Google Walking Directions to stay oriented in unfamiliar environments but there are a lot of great, blind specific apps like BlindSquare, Seeing Eye, etc. on iPhone that aren't there for Android.  I think the Android platform will get there, it will just take time.  I'm excited to see where it goes but I may have to switch myself for practicality reasons at least in the short term.

It was sudden and I had no idea it was going to happen to me, so accessibility and that mode of thinking never entered into my mind when coming here for school. Since I have lived here for so long, I know the lay of the land and can still navigate around the city even though I can't see it. I'm still not comfortable with walking around to new locations by myself; I require an orientation and mobility trainer to get to specific destinations or at least train me on a safe route to where I want to go. I have not considered moving anywhere else, and San Francisco has so much to do and so many amazing places to visit and eat and experience in such a small area.The transportation systems are generally good, and I have access to Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft to conveniently get around to places where I want to go when I don't want to deal with the bus or train.

I would say that learning to cope with simple tasks that I used to take for granted when I could see is the most frustrating thing in day to day life. I am getting better at cooking and independent life skills, but a lot of that is trial and very messy errors. When out and about, finding restrooms and having to navigate non-family/single restrooms is difficult. I have basically memorized every Starbucks and coffee shop location around places were my girlfriend and I tend to visit so as to always have a convenient option available when I don't want to deal with a multi person bathroom. I have noticed that people are generally happy to help if I ask for it, which is nice… Much better than being ignored, although you will encounter people that really don't quite know what to do or decide to be over zealous and being helpful before you have a chance to explain exactly what you want them to do.

I think one of the biggest things that I struggle with is not being able to just get out of my house and quickly go do an errand. Everything takes a lot more planning and a lot more time. Dictating messages, navigating and searching for specific information, getting directions, getting used to being so limited and slow at something I used to be extremely fast at when I had vision has been nothing short of difficult. If I am cooking something and realize that I am missing a key ingredient, I can't just run out to the store easily, at least not yet. If I meet someone in a new and unfamiliar place, I cannot immediately discern my surroundings and will always require assistance to get around, at least for the first couple of times until I understand the location and work out my spatial reasoning. Going out for a simple walk is just not relaxing, as you have to constantly be on your guard to stay safe when doing Cain travel. I guess what I'm getting at is generic mobility issues is one of the greatest hurtles of this disability.

I've done it before, in communities of several hundred, and I can step up to the challenge when I must.  But I'm perfectly happy to work as part of a team, and focus on my strengths.  I don't think any community can thrive with only 1 or 2 active mods, and I think that with the large variety of differing experiences we as blind people have (total, low vision, born that way, blinded later in life, etc), that applies especially to us.  I hope that we can build a moderation team that will work together to prepare for, and create, explosive growth in this sub.  There are millions of blind people online, and as I've said previously, this community is already a valuable one.  There is no reason we should only have just over 500 subscribers.",2,0,2,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1438013336,"I third bluetooth speakers, with one warning.  Make sure they're accessible to pair!  Some speakers need you to hold down a button until the light flashes red to pair, and then you know it's paired correctly when the light turns green.  Oh, and of course you know the battery is low when the yellow light comes on.  On some speakers, the on-off button is even a touch toggle, so the only way to know if the speaker is on or off is by looking at a light.  

For my portable listening needs, I have a creative d80, and I couldn't be happier with it.  The on-off button is a large switch at the back, that clicks firmly from one setting to the other.  It does sound a tone when you get it into pairing mode.  It only has three buttons on the front (volume up, down, and another multi-function button), so no menus or complicated anything.  It doesn't even take batteries, so I don't need to worry about that.

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1437253104,"In general, I get really fed up with applications where the developers are too lazy to label their buttons. It's one of the easiest things to do when coding, so why they do not label them especially after constant feedback is beyond me. I also hate it when they sacrifice accessibility for form; adding animations and cutesy things around the interface which make it impossible to use via voice over. Being a former animator/designer, I know that form and accessibility can work hand-in-hand for both The sighted and visually impaired.

As for getting around, I live in San Francisco and encounter quite a few issues daily when attempting to use Muni or navigate the streets. The most common issues I encounter are improperly installed tactile mats at intersections/street crossings. Normally at each corner of an intersection, there are supposed to be yellow bumpy tactile mats for each cardinal direction to help cross the street in a straight line. For some stupid reason, the engineers to install these mats get lazy and install only one curb cut that points 45° out into the middle of the intersection rather than having to curbs for each cardinal direction. Sometimes when they're actually are two curb cuts for the proper directions, they are not pointed straight at the other one across the street and are not lined up appropriately which can become dangerous when crossing the street. The locator tone beacons for street crossing signals are also a problem when the volume isn't nearly loud enough to compensate for traffic flow and you can't hear them to adjust your position when crossing the street or navigating to them to get set up for street crossings. I've contacted the traffic in engineering group here several times to get the volume raised on a common route I take, only to have nothing happen even after they say they've changed things.

Getting on subway trains can be problematic when you don't know what train has arrived at the station. There is usually an audible announcement as to what trains are coming and how long it will take to get there, but at most stations The announcement is not loud enough or is located at a part of the station where it is far away from where you have to be to board the train safely. Train operators calling out stop locations when the trains are out of the subway and on the street is also very intermittent and frustrating when you are going to a new location by your self. Sometimes you will get great bus and train operators who announce every stop clearly and efficiently, and then other drivers who don't give a crap and just expect you to know where you are at all times and say nothing the entire trip, even when prompted to do so as soon as I enter the vehicle.

Going back to street crossings, it's really annoying when there is street construction going on and The workers do not properly place safety baffles or appropriately Mark a safe route around the construction. In San Francisco, there is always construction going on, and sadly a lot of it is happening on one of my most common routes through the city. Every day, the area outside the construction zone is different, with different replaced cones and barriers that are always a surprise when attempting to do appropriate cane travel through the site. I actually almost completely walked into the construction area because someone left a fence gate open wide enough that shoreline Eng brought me straight through the entrance rather than around to continue along the fence line outside the zone.

I have a disability parking placard that I bring along when people drive me around. People who temporarily park in blue disabled zones to speak on the phone are profoundly annoying especially when we are attempting to find parking around a busy area of the city. Construction workers have also been known to dump excavated dirt or pile up construction equipment and material in blue disabled zones leaving the other parking spaces free.

These are just some of the gripes, your question will have to be more specific to get further specifics on user experience or general issues for travel.",1,0,1,0,0,

I can't possibly verify every story I post, and in this case, the system worked as it should have: someone posted a comment taking issue with the story, and it got downvoted.  That's how journalism 2.0 works, IMHO.  Not by having the gate-keepers restrict and remove information, but by having the community as a hole judge the worth/accuracy/importance of any given story.  I do pass over about 90% of the blindness related news I find, because I lack the knowledge to judge the accuracy or importance of medical information, so it is of no interest to me.  But someone else is welcome to post that stuff, and I'm sure the community will do a decent job of evaluating it.

* You need a better sidebar. with some helpful links (preferably nonprofits) for low vision or blind users and also for people who like to learn more about the conditions.
* Having a Twitter is really easy: Just register a name (maybe @RedditBlind?) and use [dlvr.it](http://dlvr.it) to post [/r/Blind's RSS feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind.rss) on the Twitter. once it's ready, you can connect with related accounts (nonprofits or people) and ask them to promote your account and help you to find followers.
* Did you ever had a Reddit ad? /r/subredditads is a great start, you just need a good banner. you can also create [sponsored headlines](https://www.reddit.com/advertising/) for as little as $5. Reddit ads are the best way to find interested subscribers. to my experience it is so hard to get people join Reddit by promoting it on Facebook or Twitter.
* Partner with nonprofits such as [blindness.org](http://www.blindness.org), [afb.org](http://www.afb.org) and [discoveryeye.org](http://www.discoveryeye.org) for running or promoting AMAs or other events.
* Interesting and descriptive user flairs. let users display their conditions and its severity.
* Your /r/Naut theme is modern and fun, but it needs to be modified for more accessibility (larger fonts, and more visible buttons).
* You can use /r/AutoModerator for almost anything, like removing spam or automated posts, and as for the wiki pages I guess you can give permission to interested users to edit them.",1,0,1,0,0,

I know that it is habit for servers, but anytime I sit down and they try to hand me a menu it gets rather awkward. Servers need to be very vocal about taking orders, most of the time I am unsure if I am being addressed until my girlfriend says so or tells me to order. Braille menus are fine, but learning the menu is a lot faster when you are with someone with vision, plus I know that restaurants with ever-changing menus would have some trouble acquiring fresh braille menus. If financially feasible, iPads or tablets with assistive technology and screen readers could be quite useful depending on how large your restaurant is. I went to a restaurant in Canada where the servers all carried around iPad minis and were able to check you out right at the table and thought it was quite pleasant.

For the food, please tell your servers not to grab. Have the servers BeVocal about the food being there and describing what they are doing and how they are placing it in front of the blind patron. As was previously mentioned, a standard clock face orientation description would be all that is necessary when describing the locations of plates, drinks, and the food itself on the plate. I say don't grab because I have had a server physically grabbed my wrist and splat my hand into the food on the plate after she placed it in front of me to show me where everything was.  Servers being vocal about refilling water glasses and drinks while at the table is also extremely helpful and will aid in avoiding accidents…while in conversation, I have casually grab for my water glass while it was in the process of being refilled and it makes for a very messy situation, especially in loud environments where it is hard to pick up The servers manipulating things on the table.

But fingers don't work the same way that eyes do, so perspective isn't going to work so well.  Also, not only is there no way to represent colour in a Braille illustration, you can't do anything with brightness/shadow/shading either.  However, if the person wasn't born blind and has looked at illustrations before, they may have the experience/knowledge to understand what you're trying to do with more complicated braille illustrations.  

While it's an anecdote, not data, I've noticed personally that those who had vision are much better at reading tactile maps.  I struggle with going from what my fingers are feeling on a flat page, to turning that into a mental picture of a real place that I can use to get around.

If I may ask, were you born blind?  I was, so I've never known a life where a lot of these small tasks were easy.  So it just doesn't impact me, because it's how I grew up.  I've often thought people who weren't born blind have it a lot harder, because they have a loss to grieve for, and a better understanding of exactly what they're missing.  

Maybe try thinking of the things that are easier/better for us without sight? There are a few.  Off the top of my head, one big one is that I think I live in a less polluted environment.  To explain, every day the fully sighted are bombarded with images they may not want to see, especially advertising. It's everywhere: painted on buses and trucks, on billboards on the side of the road, on gas station pumps, on textbooks, on flashing neon signs in front of stores, on magazine racks at every check-out counter, printed on soda cups, on the t-shirts of people walking buy, on the TV over the bar, on every web page you ever visit an animated ad is flickering and bouncing, sprayed on graffiti on every wall, and so on, and so on, and so on. Without sight, we just don't have to deal with all of that constant, unending visual spam.  I've never experienced it myself obviously, but I feel like the peace and freedom from that nonsense is quite a mental advantage for me.  

Another one, of course, is that we can do everything in the dark without difficulty.  If you live alone, it does ad up to a small savings on the power bill, because you don't have to turn on the lights just for yourself.  

I don't know if that helps at all; all I can share are my own experiences, and it's quite possible I don't feel the frustrations as deeply as you do.  ",3,0,3,0,0,

I have been an active member of this sub for several months and contribute as much as possible in comments and in submissions.  It is my belief that I can help to further the success and expansion of /r/blind as a mod to help this resource which has helped both myself and others to become even better.

* What will I do?

My focus when working with other mods would be to promote expansion.  I believe a larger community can only be beneficial.  This can be done by networking with other subs, promoting via social media, and reaching out to prominent members of the blind community to be a part of the sub.  This is something I briefly discussed with /u/6b71e46e-9c9c-43d9-bb9e-90dfc13ffcd9 in [this suggestion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/3cfy5y/have_suggestions_to_make_rblind_better/).

I also believe taking input from the community on how to make this sub in particular more accessible to more people through adjustments to the CSS for those who use color correction and magnification (like myself) as well as those who use screen readers.  Little things to improve accessibility can make this sub more attractive to the visually impaired community as a whole.

I have to agree with /u/6b71e46e-9c9c-43d9-bb9e-90dfc13ffcd9 on a lot of points.  Keeping the sidebar and wiki updated is critical to making this sub the best resource it can be to those seeking help.  I believe /u/6b71e46e-9c9c-43d9-bb9e-90dfc13ffcd9 would also be an excellent candidate for a mod position.

The last piece is making sure that there is an open line of communication between the mod team and the community as a whole.  Making regular suggestion threads, like the one recently posted to allow the community to voice questions, concerns, and recommendations is crucial.  While individuals can put forth good ideas it is the expansion of said ideas by the community that makes real meaningful change and improvement.  I believe working with other moderators and with the whole community I can be of service to this sub in a meaningful way.

* I am legally blind with Leber's Congenital Amaurosis and I am low vision.  If selected, this would be my first time as a moderator on a sub.  I recognize the lack of experience may be a concern, however as stated above, I am a pretty active member here and I believe I can step up and be a valuable member of the moderation team.

If you can do technical work (install/configure Wordpress, Drupal, etc, manage domains/dns/email/web hosting, and so on) or write decent copy (advertising, SEO, promotional/PR stuff) getting work is...not easy, but doable.  There's a shortage of Canadians who are native English speakers and are willing to do this kind of work at competitive rates.  And because you're just a contractor, people are more willing to take a chance at giving you work than they would be to take a chance at hiring you.  I've done countless interviews over a number of years, and never found anyone (at least in the Toronto or Ottawa areas) willing to hire a fully blind person.

I raised two guide dogs (neither made it, they loved too many other things) for two different schools. I have a brother who has a dog as well and he enjoys it but there are times he says a cane is easier and other times where the dog is easier.

As far as things I'd suggest to ask and by no means an exhaustive list:

* What do you train your dogs to do?
* What should I not expect from dogs from your school?
* What expenses will I need to cover?
* Who pays for room and board during training?
* Who pays for transportation to and from training?
* Who pays for the dog? Is it paid for by donations?
* Who covers veterinary care?
* What will be expected of me?
* What is the typical time frame?

As far as getting and making the most out of your dog, it's like anything in life. If you put effort into adjusting your life to accept a guide dog and learning to work together I think you'll find it useful. A dog will need attention and on going training. You should expect any school to expect this from you. If they don't mention it ask them about it.

If you're proactive you can really build a bond of trust with the dog and you'll be able to learn together how to help each other. All for the low cost of some attention and love those dogs will work tirelessly for you.

Feel free to ask questions! I can answer them from a different perspective though so hopefully this is helpful. I've only had second hand experiences since I'm sighted, but I've seen the amazing work these dogs do.",2,0,2,0,0,

Switching from vision to blindness is all about learning new skills, and the faster you learn those skills the easier your transition.  The downside is that learning new skills is hard - just like it takes a long time to learn to write with your off hand, you shouldn't expect to become an expert at navigating the world overnight.

For starters, it's excellent that you're learning how to use your phone.  They're getting good enough to really be helpful, so look for apps and personal assistants that may be able to help you get or manage the information you need.

One other major skill I would recommend is to learn how to use a PC computer, and learn how to type if you don't already know how.  Computers are an amazing gateway for information now - you can use them to not only get information, but to actually build and do things as well.  Nobody knows you're blind on the web, and a lot of blind people are able to get work on the web.

The top most left is known as dot 1, The one underneath is known as dot 2, bottom left is 3, upper right is 4, middle right is 5, and bottom right is 6. Now that you are oriented to the numbers associated with the appropriate dots, there are a few ways of doing this, formally and casually. I will separate each cell with a comma, and the numbers I right out for each braille cell are the dots that will be activated/raised.

The letter B is: 1 2
The letter R is: 1 2 3 5
The number 117 is: 3 4 5 6, 1, 1, 1 2 4 5

The 3456 symbol tells you that the next symbols will be represented as a number rather than letters. Effectively, BR117 will look like:

12, 1235, 3456, 1, 1, 1245

there would be no spaces between the braille cells. Formally, to make the B and R capitalized, you would have to add two dot 6 Braille cells directly in front of what I wrote out above. So that would look like:

Most restaurants that I frequent are pretty low light so I've had to work around that.  I don't really see a way of getting around that without ruining the ambiance for everyone else, as a result I've figured out ways around having no sight in these situations.

Beyond that my three biggest issues are the menu, navigating the restaurant, and the check.

I always carry my video magnifier on me in my messenger bag to help me with text based things, however that has a battery and it has been known to die when I most need it.  I think having a decent amount of large print and Braille menus for those who need them is a good start.

With regards to navigation, I am personally a white cane user with formal orientation and mobility training.  I think if you are looking into training employees getting in touch with a local O&amp;M specialist would be a good start.  I've found that most people who have had formal O&amp;M training usually speak roughly the same language when referring to matters of navigation.  Using things like clock directions is an example.  Usually there isn't too much walking around that needs to be done, but finding the register if the check is paid at there rather than the table, or finding restrooms is particularly challenging at times.  On this note, finding staff members when I need something is pretty difficult at times.  I don't have a specific idea on how to make that easier but an O&amp;M specialist could help come up with a solution for that.

The last piece is the check.  I usually pay with debit so there is a signature required.  I think a lot of staff members forget about all the aspects of being visually impaired and they just leave the receipt at the table.  I have a hard time finding the signature line.  Making sure that the staff asks if the person can find the line is a good start.  Many people (including myself) will carry signature guides, which are small business card sized cards with a hole cut for a signature.  I usually have the person waiting on me place the signature guide on the line and signing is easy.  If for whatever reason I choose not to use a signature guide I usually just ask that the person guide the pen to the line for me and I sign there.  If I'm paying with cash, I think most people prefer to have cash stacked from lowest denomination to highest.  I also appreciate it when they tell me how many of each bill there is because I fold my bills for identification.

With regards to equipment, I typically carry all the equipment that makes my life easier anyway, so I don't know what else you could add.

My girlfriend and I had just come out of the symphony and we were waiting at the pick up location when the driver called and told me to walk a few blocks towards where he was as opposed to just driving up to the address I had dialed in. I told him that I was blind and that would be inconvenient. He went silent for a few moments and I thought he had hung up, so I asked if he was there and then he said that it was OK and he will be there. About 10 seconds after I ended the call, I got a notification from Lyft saying that I was a no show and got charged a cancellation fee. I was super pissed, and after getting another driver to take us home who was extremely friendly, I immediately emailed Lyft and explain the situation, to which they refunded me the cancellation fee and gave me a bunch of credit towards future rides and claimed that they would discipline the driver accordingly. Sadly, shit like this will happen every now and then, but unlike taxis, at least you have accountability from the companies and the drivers alike.",3,0,3,0,0,

I'm not blind, but my dad is so I like to lurk in this sub to try to get a sense of how my dad feels, ways to help him, etc. My dad lost his vision to NAION 4 years ago and he's technically visually impaired since he can still see some contrast, but ***legally***, he is blind. He requires a cane or dog to get around and wouldn't be able to tell me apart from a stranger just by looking. He's never thought the word ""blind"" was offensive, but in fact, feels as though it's easier to refer to his condition as ""blind."" The definition of visual impairment is vision worse than 20/40 or 20/60 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment)), so saying blind is much more direct. 

What I have heard is offensive from my journalism studies is when you refer to someone as a blind person. If you call someone a blind person, you're defining them by their disability. I've learned that it's much more PC to say ""a person who is blind."" I've asked my dad about this and he says he doesn't mind either way, but I'm interested in hearing what you all think.

In an old job I was told that our weekly brainstorming sessions for client design ideas was offensive, as the word 'brainstorming' was offensive to epileptics.

As an epileptic this was the first time I, or anyone I knew with the condition had heard that we found it offensive.  Turns out the dictat had come down from someone in HR who seemed to spend most of their day thinking up problematic terms.  I honestly think they would have felt right at home in the novel 1984 thinking up new terms for Newspeak. ""Brainstorming"" is doubleplusungood!!

As well as my vision issues, I also have major mobility problems (4 heart attacks and a stroke really puts a cramp on your walking!) and had a social worker repeatedly tell me I wasn't disabled, but 'Handycapable'

I hate that word with the intensity of a thousand suns.  It just drips of condescension!

Far too often political correctness is used to make those without a disability feel better about themselves without actually doing anything.  'If we change the name of the thing, then the thing doesn't really exist.  If it doesn't exist, then we can feel better""

George Carlin did a wonderful piece on how PTSD used to be 'shell shock', then 'battle fatigue' then on through other terms.  Each change taking it further away from what it actually was.

As long as you have corrected vision to a certain level in one eye you are not considered to be legally blind.

In Ontario you have to have one working eye corrected to no better than 20/200 to be considered legally blind.  Low vision is 20/70 corrected in your best eye.  Basically if you can see anything more than a couple of shadows the government is not going to do bugger all for you.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1436369483,"We really need to do a little more community promotion.  Of the blind people I follow on Twitter, Facebook, etc, most of them still think Reddit is inaccessible to screen readers.  So, of course, they won't have heard about and joined this community.  If we can make this community larger, not only will that be a good thing for us, but having more blind people participating in Reddit overall will raise awareness of access issues in other communities.  

As well, today, most blind people seem to participate in mailing lists, and websites like the Zone, that are entirely separated from the larger online community, even when they share the exact same interests.  I'm convinced that this increasing isolation from the sighted world is an extremely bad thing.  We at /r/blind, by promoting not only our sub, but the use of Reddit in general, could help to lift at least some of this isolation.  

The question, of course, is how?  Off the top of my head:

1.  Podcasts.  A lot of blind people listen to a lot of Podcasts, so it could be helpful to create podcasts that demonstrate how Reddit works, in audio form.  For example, how to use Reddit with NVDA, how to use accessible Reddit apps like Bacon Reader, information about the other subs that those of us active in /r/blind subscribe to and enjoy, etc.  

2.  A twitter account.  I have no idea how, but it must be possible to link a Twitter account to a sub, and have it post out a new link every time a post to /r/blind is made.  Thanks to the many, many accessible Twitter apps like TwBlue, Twitter is where most screen reader users tend to hang out.  Heck, as someone who does check Reddit daily, I'd still find a /r/blind Twitter account useful.  

3.  Host AMAs of interest to the blind community.  A good AMA drives a lot of traffic to a sub.  Perhaps we could host an AMA from someone at a company offering a new accessible service, or a person writing a new book about blindness, etc, etc.  The promotion works both ways, and everyone wins.  

In short, there are thousands of fully blind people online, and millions of partially sighted people as well.  This is a valuable community, and there is no reason at all it should only have just over 500 subscribers.  ",2,0,2,0,0,
c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1436112955,"So I have actually had my home visit for one school and have an application out for another school.  I am in a similar boat, I have some vision but my O&amp;M encouraged me to seek a dog because of the speed I'm looking to attain that a cane just does not provide.  I actually had a chance to trial run a dog and LOVED it.  It is so much better than a cane in every way, for me.  It definitely is not for everyone, if you like having tactile awareness then you will lose that with a dog.  For me tactile awareness isn't as important as speed.  I'm an urban traveler and have to hit public transit connections fast.

A few things that I learned from my research and speaking with trainers from multiple schools.  The first is make sure your O&amp;M with a cane is solid.  Know how to track traffic phases, use cardinal directions, etc.  You should also make sure your technique with a cane is very refined.  They will need a report from an O&amp;M professional certifying that you can do all of this.

The other thing is make sure you live in an area and have activity patterns that would warrant the use of a dog.  They won't give them out to people who won't be able to adequately work the dog.  Being an independent traveler as a pedestrian/ public transit commuter was appealing to the schools I applied for.  

The last big piece is financial.  Dog schools are essentially free for most schools.  The only school I've ever heard of charging is Seeing Eye, and it's $200 I believe.  That is nothing compared to what it costs to pair and train you with a dog.  Every other school is completely free, at least the schools I've applied for.  They will pay your airfare both ways, lodging, food, dog, equipment, and everything else.  However when you get out you have to support the dog yourself.  You need to be able to cover food, veterinary care, and all other expenses.  The estimates I saw were over $1000 a year to maintain a guide dog, and there is usually about a ten year working life before you are supposed to retire the dog. 

There are a lot of positives and a lot of negatives.  For me the positives vastly outweigh the negatives so I'm going forward with it.  I've been thinking about this decision for several months now and finally decided to go with the recommendations I was getting.  It's a lifestyle shift but it may be worth it for you.  Hope this helped.  Good luck!  ",2,0,2,0,0,
