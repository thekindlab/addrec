What happens when most GPS apps go fully augmented reality?  When the majority of meetups and events, instead of being planned on Facebook as they are now, are planned and organized in a virtual augmented reality overlay?  When stores list deals and coupons only via a marker in an augmented reality app?  When nobody introduces themselves anymore, because everyone can see everyone else's augmented reality nametag?

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1468378853,"Well, I think we're already heading slowly in that direction.  Things like ARIA landmarks already describe parts of websites as ""article content"", ""search"", ""header"", etc.  I remember the days when I used to need to understand what things like divs were for, because screen-readers offered commands to navigate the tag structure of the page, rather than the human layout.  Also, CSS is slowly moving us away from things like layout by table, using font tags, and so on.  These days, I can move through a page by landmark and heading, and not worry so much about how the site is formatted visually. And that's a big help.  Heck, even tags like italics and bold have been replaced with tags like strong and emphasis.  

When you say ""easy as having a conversation"", that makes me worry about privacy, again.  I don't want to talk to my computer!  I can touch type, and I'd much rather do that; I don't even use things like OK Google myself, because I don't want random people on the bus with me to know who I'm calling, what I'm looking up, and so on.  As things stand, I can pres h to skip to the next heading, e for the next edit field, b for the next button, and so-on.  I think this is a system that works; the improvements we need are to make sure that everything on a website that is visually intended as a heading is marked up as a heading, and that things that aren't headings never get marked up as headings.  For example, on Reddit, the title of every submission on my front page should really be a heading; that would seem to make logical sense.  As it is, I instead need to remember to press ""b"" to get to the next upvote button when I want to skip an article.  Once I've learned that, it's fine. But right now, every knew sight I ever visit has little flaws like that, and little tricks I need to learn to get around it quickly.  And that's what slows me down.  If everything was coded correctly, the system we've got would work fine.  Unfortunately, that just isn't the case.  And I can't think of any knew ""conversational"" system you could introduce that would work any better, because not every website author is going to write websites to work propperly with it.

The main reason is that their screen reader is something they use for everything, so they've invested a lot of time into customizing it and using it efficiently, whereas reading printed text is just one of many possible activities.

An experienced blind user will use their screen reader to read email, browse Facebook, send text messages, and much more. They've probably picked their favorite speech engine, set the speech rate to their favorite speed, and configured it to output braille just the way they like it (if they have a braille display). If they open a new program they'd prefer it to work with their existing screen reader.

If a program bypasses the screen reader and speaks by itself, or outputs braille by itself, that's just confusing and inefficient.

If you're interested in working in this area, I think the first step would be to pick a platform (iOS, Android, Web, Mac, Windows, etc.) and get to know the existing solutions and their pros and cons.

We got into a little bit of a discussion about making the game accessible via voice over. On one hand, I feel that battles need to be picked about making things like this accessible… Surely there are other applications that could have a lot more focus on accessibility first before games. At the same time, having been a former serious video game player before losing my vision, I definitely feel that I am missing out on something fun.

If Nintendo or the app developers care about accessibility at all, I can see them making a specific version of this game with accessible menus and dialogue. The primary component of walking around and attempting to catch a Pokémon is all accomplished visually, from hunting it down around your environment using your camera and augmented reality, to using a specific swiping skill/minigame to throw a ball at the creature to catch it. I figure that this could be made accessible by having the phone polls faster the closer you move the camera towards where the creature is in your environment. Vibrations and sound design would allow you to find it without vision, and the mere difficulty of that would offset the removal of the ball throwing portion of the process. Once you've locked onto the Pokémon, you would simply double tap to throw a ball at it and let the chance functionality of the game work to see if you catch it or not, which is the very same with cited players.

There is a detailed map of your surrounding environment that shows where various locations are to catch Pokémon, where people have lured them, Poké stops where you can get items, and Gyms where you can fight for control. Giving blind players access to GPS data or basic addresses would solve this issue, allowing them to navigate to within 100 feet necessary to activate them. Obviously certain time restraints would be adjusted to accommodate for the new accessible features.

The fighting dynamic to take over a gin is problematic… There is a dodging element when you can see an attack coming from the opponent which may be impossible to make accessible. There will be trade-offs, but ultimately if they just included features like these it would make the game open to everyone!",2,,2,0,0,

Not intentionally, maybe. But effectively, yes, they are.  Pokemon Go currently has more app installs than Twitter, and more user engagement than Facebook.  I would hate to be a blind student right now; this is going to go down as the summar that the blind were excluded from.  If you can't do something that 70% of people are spending most of their free time doing, you are effectively excluded from society.  That's why this matters.  Unfortunately, it's a battle we've already lost.  If we're extremely, extremely lucky, we'll get access features some time in the next 5 years.  And just to get that much is going to take lawsutes from someone like the NFB.  But even if they did win in court, the victory wouldn't matter.  Because in six months, the world will have all moved on to the next totally inaccessible craze.  Unless we take a stand now, augmented reality is going to be the next major step towards the isolation of the blind.  

&gt; no Pokemon game in the past has been accesible.

True. But no Pokemon game in the past has been played by 70% of the country.  So it really didn't matter.  Plus, in the past, they just didn't have the technology to make the game accessible. Today, everything the developers need is built in to the phone.  ",3,,3,0,0,

The goal is ultimately to create an entertaining, enjoyable, replayable experience without relying on visuals of any kind. Partially a design experiment, mostly motivated by our interest in creating ""better"" accessible games by building them from the ground up with the target audience(s) in mind. Because my friends have experience with mixing and recording, we look to incorporate high fidelity audio in a unique and engaging manner. These details are not yet ironed out, but we have a couple ideas so far.

While we can place audio sources in a 3D environment and build the world and mechanics that way, we realize surround sound isn't a luxury most people have access to. Do you use 5:1 or 7:1 audio when you game? Is it normal for visually impaired gamers to have more advanced audio setups?

One thing we don't want to do is create a game and atmosphere that screams ""This game is for the blind, we're 'helping' you by creating a game just for you, now you can have fun."" I think we can all agree that is demeaning and misguided. We want to create a great game, and we want to create it without visual elements whatsoever. As lead designer on the project, it's my job to understand any common pitfalls seen in accessible game design and avoid them, or better yet, innovate for others to use in the future.

As a blind individual who still has limited functional vision and a relatively good gamer I have always ignored games for the Low Vision and Blind. They are half-baked stereo types and limited in game mechanics. That being said let me attempt to answer your core questions as I interpret them.

High fidelity graphics and lighting fx are amazing to experience but fall flat if the soundscape is not engaging. What would make any game like World of Warcraft, WildStar, EVE Online, Diablo 3, StarCraft 2, Minecraft, or Tycoon games better is 3d positional soundscapes. High Definition audio is a most in this stage of the game both for sighted and total blind individuals. Sound sells a game more then the graphics. The next best thing is an engaging narrative that compels me as the player to care about the game world. For example take a look at the guys that produced Prison Architect. They have a new project that used the LADAR concept and is is buitiful in is simplicity graphically.

Lets move into what are expectations that normal blind players seem to have who are gamers. This is simple what sighted gamers want is what we want. It is that simple. You can achieve this by improving the soundscape and allow for HD 3D soundscapes be the guide to your game worlds.",3,,3,0,0,

If some independent flick only shown in 40 theatres isn't audio described, I just can't bring myself to care.  Same with this: I don't care about Pokemon in the slightest, and I don't care about this game at all.  But more people are currently playing Pokemon Go than people who use Twitter.  So we're excluded from something that over 70% of society is currently enjoying.  And that's why it matters.  

The other reason not to focus on how ""useful"" something might be is because that isn't at all objective.  If you're a blind parent, access to Pokemon Go might be ""useful"" to you, if only to know what your child is being exposed to.  Same goes for audio description of children's cartoons.

It is very difficult to do without in these areas, at least for me. Programming in particular benefits a lot from braille because it makes it possible to quickly move through the code, perceive indentation levels, size, structure and complexity of the lines, from quickly scanning them. Parenthesis matching for example (necessary both in maths and programming) is far easier with braille than voice, at least for me.

I also find braille easier when learning a foreign language. Simply relying on the voice makes it harder to learn, since listening is a different skill from reading and relies on distinguishing the sounds, syllable and word breaks, and so on, which takes  awhile to develop. Additionally learning a language only through listening makes it likely one will commit many spelling mistakes, if one learns the spelling rules at all. I've noticed a lot of blind people seem to have some difficulties with spelling, often resorting to approximations to the way the words sound. I think braille is helpful in this regard, certainly with foreign languages and possibly with one's mother tongue.

He is always wanting to be held or played with, his wide blue-green eyes looking up pleadingly. “Love me?” they ask “Take care of me?” 

My hand, vast and giant in comparison, sweeps down his back, appreciating in one smooth, gliding motion the intricate perfection of his bumpy little spine. “Of course,” the hand says, “always.”

In another thread in this sub I posted a technical analysis on how to adapt the game but lets be real the game is still in a Beta stage.

I use braille in some things but not everything. An old-fashioned slate and stylus works, and i do some notes, read some stuff (not fast but enjoy it as for at) and label whatever i need.

293c2f78-c88a-4580-a16a-5fef160420de,1469193736,"Greetings OP,
Your question is a slightly complex to answer but I will do my best. I will give you the TL;DR version first and then I will go into details and an extended explanation. Do you believe in yourself and are you having fun when you move forward? The other thing is that our condition regardless of what others tell us is a skill and a tactical advantage. Below I go into detail of what has helped me overcome the mental block that you speak about so read ahead but let me give you one other quick bit of information. Even if others give you all that you say take it with grace and act on it. If you need help and you think you will be interested I am part of a Leadership Group that focuses on empowering others. I have been a Peer mentor for many years and I have gone through what you are feeling.

What do I mean by believe in yourself? I understand the feeling of having been handed something by others due to the condition that one has. In my case I am almost totally blind at this point in my life. I struggled with the feeling you described as I was finishing my BS in Sociology a couple of years ago. The truth of the matter is that I was doing extraordinary things that from my point of view were common things and nothing special.

Yet, to those who are experiencing my story and who attempt to put themselves in the role of myself the actions I was taking were incredible to them. Let us distill it even further. The crux of the feeling is by what rule set we choose to judge our actions by. When we imply that something was given to us due to our condition we are using the rule set of someone that does not have any limitations.

When we reframe the point of view and use a differentangle lets say would someone else who suddenly acquired your condition be willing to go to the extreme and do what you have done regardless of outcome? This reframing sets you up for a new mindset. You are not the victim role in the question but the survivor role.

To many times we get hung up on the what if it was given to me because they feel sorry for my condition. The truth of the matter is they may feel sorry but that does not matter a single bit. Did you do all you could and be happy with who you are. If I was someone that used to be in a perfect physical condition and became how I am now a disabled and blind person can I be happy with who I am.

The answer for me was NO I was not happy with who I was but I learned to enjoy myself. I believe that when it comes to confidence in oneself we have five aspects that need to be in harmony in order for us to overcome the challange that your question asks.

The five aspects are Physical Outlook, Mental Outlook, Spiritual Outlook, Instinctive Understanding, and Logic/Analytics. This five core concepts when they are in balance we start to understand that no one gives us anything for free.

Balance in your Physical Outlook comes from our understanding of what limitations our body has and us accepting the limitations we have been given.

Balance in your Mental Outlook comes from and understanding of our mind and the factors that influence us the most. In my case although I am almost blind I enjoy reading print, painting scale miniatures, and playing computer games.

Balance of your Spiritual Outlook translates into having faith in something. This does not mean faith in God or a Divine being although it can help with this aspect. Faith is being able to belief that something you can not quantify or apply reason can happen even if no evidence exists to prove its outcome.

When I talk of Instinctive Understanding I mean do you listen to that feeling you get when you stop thinking and just take action. When you have balance with your intuitive self and your active self something interesting happens. You start to understand the world around you from a unique perspective that not many normal individuals get to experience.

Finally a balance of Logic/Analytics is as simple as do you trust the facts of what you have seen at face value and do they make sense to you. If you can reach a clear state of mind while looking at the reality you have in front of you you have most likely reached balance in this area.

When we combine all this factors and reach a balance between them we come out with one interesting point of view. No matter the external conditions or internal conditions we show that we are incredible individuals and nothing was given to us. We paid for each thing with hard work and dedication by believing in ourselves.  Others see this and support us because we all like a story of someone struggling and overcoming adversity.",1,,1,0,0,

It is precisely because the user experience with a screen-reader is so bad that I haven't returned to coding even two years after going blind.  Screen-readers turn what used to be a pleasant task into something extremely painful.

The awful user experience is not unique to screen-readers, however.  Pretty much everything is non-trivial when you're blind.

Braille is still invaluable in my opinion. Labeling things? Braille. Need to read or take notes and listen during a meeting or class? Braille. Trying to use your computer on a phone call? Braille. Want to enjoy some quiet time with a book? Braille. Working with math or programming? Braille. Going camping? Bring braille. Text to speech is great and I use it for hours every day, but it isn't always practical or possible to listen to what you're trying to read.

I think its a shame that braille equipment is so expensive, and especially that the manufacturers get away with unthinkable prices for often inferior equipment simply because they can. I'm disappointed that so many children aren't being taught to read braille (and often grow up with poor written language skills because they've never been taught how to actually read in a way that works for them!) 

To any blind adult who is considering learning braille, its worth it. If you can't or don't want to get a braille display through VR, there still are affordable ways to buy one. I bought mine on ebay for far less than retail. There are also blind and assistive technology classifieds to find used displays or note takers and AT individual development accounts to help you fund the purchase. There are [free courses you can take at home to learn braille.]
(http://hadley.edu/braillecourses.asp) There are many braille books available either in print through the NLB, or electronically through NLB BARD or bookshare, as well as many more accessible ebooks. 

To any parent of a blind child wondering if their child should learn braille, please consider it. Braille means being able to actually read text, not just listen to it. Even if your child has enough vision to read print, braille means reading without eye strain or headaches and being able to continue reading if their vision worsens. Advocate for your child in getting the professional instruction in braille that they need and having access to braille at school. Fill the home with braille and read braille books with them just like you do your sighted children. Literacy is so important, and so many blind kids are missing out on important skills because ""speech is good enough"" or because they are being encouraged to rely on unreliable remaining vision. Emotionally and developmentally, knowing braille is about more than being able to read. It is all tied up with self acceptance and confidence in your skills and abilities as a blind person. It tends to be part of a bigger picture of that child being raised with expectations that they will be as competent as their sighted peers, and is associated with [better outcomes in adulthood.]

While I am a blind individual with low vision and minimal mobility impairment on an android device. Let us examine the limitations of the application that is still in what could be considered a Open Beta situation. Not all core features have been activated.

Let us follow this up by examining the spirit of the game. The idea behind the game is to go outside and walk and explore your environment. This activity could be best done for us with a disability by asking our sighted and non-mobility disabled friends to help us and make a trip out of it. One of the cores of the Pokemon franchise as a whole is to go out and meet others and talk to them and make friends.

Calling out the game out for its technical limitations is slightly outdated. Yes we are moving into a more open gaming culture and it has been pointed out by many of my industry friends that the visual impaired community is being left out in gaming. However let us also be realistic.

Pokemon in the past for those with total blindness might have been accessible in theory if you learned the game world and learned all the sound FX. However Pokemon GO is in an order of magnitude larger then the Gameboy version of the game.

You are talking a concept of inplementing Siri or Galaxy integration with turn by turn navigation that could let you know were you are in the world. The next stage of making it accesible would be using the pulsing radius that a player can interact with the augmented reality world act like a sonar pulse for the blind.

If you set the game to silence it vibrates when you get near to a PokeStop or a Pokeman shows up in your zone. If you use a sonar pulsing system to guide you in direction that might help you get close to it. When it comes to throwing the pokeball it could use a vibration system to let you know how on target you are and then throw it or use the Pokemon GO Plus bluetooth device.

From what I have said here you can see that the game has its technical limitations when you start to evaluate the performance hit that your device would have in order to make it a bit more accessible at this stage of development. Battery optimization should be the games priority before adding compatibility.

One other point that has come into my head as I finish writing this post. Gym battles while I have not participated myself and just reached the level to start trying out for them. I feel that the sound FX make it good enough to fight even with limited vision. Just learn the gestures to attack and dodge as well as special attacks.

Hope this gives you some insight into how game developers are not shafting the blind community but have other priorities for a non-niche market.",7,,7,0,0,
7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1468071036,"There are a surprisingly large number of TTS services that offer high quality voices, these days.  In my opinion, the best, by far, is [Neospeech](http://neospeech.com/about).  However, based on what I've heard from other developers when I requested them to use these voices, they aren't cheap!  Apparently, they focus on the enterprize, and aren't that interested in startups.  But they really are the best voices available.  

As I mentioned in my last post, [Acapela](http://www.acapela-group.com) is another option.  Most of the apps on IOS who want custom voices seem to use these guys, as they were one of the first to market with an IOS SDK.  No idea what their cloud offerings are like, though.  

If what you want is an enormous variety of voices in the cloud, [Voiceforge](http://www.voiceforge.com/demo) is another option.  The output quality isn't quite as high as Neospeech or Acapela, but they have the largest variety of voices, and they make it pretty easy to get started.  

Of course, the biggest player by far is [nuance](http://www.nuance.com/landing-pages/playground/Vocalizer_Demo2/vocalizer_modal.html).  They make the voices built into IPhone, and pretty much every GPS currently on the market.  They're a close second in quality to Neospeech.  But everyone already has and uses these voices, and apps that read articles using them already exist.  

One lesser known option is [CereProc](https://www.cereproc.com).  I think they might focus on desktop, though, not sure.  

IBM also offers [cloud TTS services](https://text-to-speech-demo.mybluemix.net) via IBM Watson, to compete with Microsoft.  The output is OK, and compares to the Microsoft offering fine.  But based on the Watson hype, I expected a little more.  However, the voices are high quality, and perfectly listenable.  

Google, of course, also offers a Cloud TTS API.  However, I can't find a link just at the moment.  

So, in short, TTS is quite a hot field right now.  ",1,,1,0,0,
