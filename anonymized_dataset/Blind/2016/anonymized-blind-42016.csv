It's not necessarily correct, but uh... I suppose it's not incorrect either? Though naturally, it's for the reasons you yourself stated, and not because I'm prejudice and judgmental (I am somewhat judgmental, but for the most part, it's somewhat reasonable!)  

Peh, I don't mind you asking at all, but it's rather convoluted and just generally headache-inducing. I'm technically classified as an undeclared at the moment, but that's because I'm enrolled in a program in which I'm not meant to specify my major until I transfer from the branch university I'm currently attending, to the main one that I actually want to go to. The place that I actually want to attend however, offers the major that I'm interested in - that being Iberean Studies. It's a mix of Spanish and Portuguese, and one is meant to choose one as their focus, and designate the secondary as the supplemental. Due to the fact that I'm already bilingual in Spanish, I plan on making Portuguese my focus, and taking supplemental Spanish courses so that I can become more proficient and professional in the language.  

I plan on double majoring though - the second major being French, and I'm planning on using all of this unnecessary coursework to go into translation. Working for the UN is naturally the dream, but if not, any sort of government position would not be amiss! Even freelance work, really. I just like the idea of translating due to the fact that I'd (hopefully) have the opportunities to expose myself to different culture, and the market for translators in general is ever-increasing.  

I also am probably going to pursue a minor in music (specifically vocal performance), and am sort of... in the mind set of: I'll do it unless I don't. All of this seems super daunting, but hopefully all of my language experience will help me out. That, and due to my insane passion for singing and music theory in general, I just can't imagine letting it go - though I wouldn't want to pursue an entire degree in the field overall, because I need a safety net and making it anywhere in music seems somewhat impossible.  

Hahaha, I'm sorry for word-vomiting. I write novels. I've come to terms with this.

The chromevox screen-reader is not the best thing in the world, but once you learn to deal with it, it works OK.  The main problem with Chromevox is that it isn't user friendly, and the way it's designed everything takes two or three times longer than it would with any other screen-reader.  But it all does work, where work is defined as you can get everything done eventually without sighted help.  Unfortunately, the documentation isn't the best, either; the shortcut keys you need are spread out over two or three different places, so it's a bit tricky to learn them all.  The most important two that aren't listed in the chromevox documentation are search+f2 to toggle between the tray with wifi etc, and the app launcher, and search+f6 to toggle between parts of the browser window (the main content, the address bar, and so-on).  

How old is your brother?  If he's in middle school or junior high, a chromebook would be absolutely perfect to take to school and use as a note-taker, assuming the school has wifi.  The battery lasts forever, it boots up and down extremely quickly, and Google Docs would be just right for taking notes and completing assignments.  Also, it's small and light, so it can be easily carried on the walk to school, or on the bus.  Plus, it's cheap enough that if it gets stolen, it sucks, but it isn't absolutely the end of the world.  

However, come high school, he might take a programming course, a science course, or any other course that requires some desktop app.  And then he's going to need Windows anyway.  

If your brother is an adult, looking to get into, or stay in, the working world, then a chromebook makes a nice back-up computer.  But it's just not capable enough to be a main computer.  That's how I use it, in fact.  The chromebook goes anywhere I don't want to carry a full sized laptop, or anywhere I want long battery life.  It's perfect for writing emails outside!  ",3,,3,0,0,

835be7db-4c29-499d-bf31-820fa9804cf7,1459875687,"I'm a sighted guy, and have been dating a blind woman for about six months.  She's the best, and looking back, I would have really missed out on a lot if I had decided not to date her, just because she's blind.  (I never considered not dating her because of her blindness.)

There are practical things to consider, of course. There are some experiences that you won't be able to share, and others that you can share with a little extra time or creativeness. But there are so many possible things to do in this world, that no person (whether sighted or blind) could ever do any significant fraction of them. So her blindness just pushes us in certain directions -- we focus on the things that we can share together.

I was surprised by how quick and easy it was to adapt to her blindness.  It's a fact about her, like many other facts, and it isn't awkward or anything like that. It took a little time to get to know each other (and to build a little bit of trust), but once that happened she really came alive.  She's confident and funny (sassy, really), and flirty and adventurous and out-going -- and introspective and sad, and all the usual things a person is.  And she's also casual and easy-going about her blindness.  It's really important that she never treats it like she's ashamed of it -- she just owns it, it's just a fact of her daily life.  Sometimes it's relevant, such as when we're navigating a new place that is unfamiliar to us both (where she relies on me a bit for moving through crowds, etc.).  Usually it's either not relevant, or is just one background fact among many others.  Sometimes she gets sort of goofy and playful about it, which is adorable.  I mean, it's a fact about her, not something to be ashamed of.

You should definitely be thoughtful and considerate, when getting to know her and when learning how to interact with her. Try to think of things from her perspective. At first it takes some mental effort, but soon it will become very natural. For example, generally don't move her stuff, especially not tools like a cane. If you have to move something, let her know quickly and casually, like ""Hey, I put your backpack on the sofa."" Also, I've developed the habit of making just a bit of noise, when I'm moving through the house, so that she knows where I am. That way, she doesn't start a conversation with an empty room, etc. Over time, she'll let you know how much of that kind of thing is needed / wanted. But again, it all becomes natural very quickly.

One super-important thing: If she uses a guide dog, absolutely follow her lead on what to do with the dog. There are plenty of articles out there on how to interact with guide dogs, and the number one rule is generally -- don't.  Don't make eye contact, absolutely do not pet them, don't feed them, etc.  I can't exaggerate how important this is.  You wouldn't believe the stories I've heard from her, about inconsiderate and rude things that people have done with her guide dog.  And even if you're dating her, that doesn't make you an exception, with respect to the guide dog.  At some point she may tell you ""Ok, now you can play with the pup"" or some such (when the dog is out of harness / not working), but you should always take your cues from her about when and what is OK.

With just a little bit of effort, you can do some homework on the experiences of blind people, and maybe avoid a few things that are consistently annoying or awkward for blind folks.  There are some excellent blogs and such out there.  One of them is Fashioneyesta on YouTube.  She mainly blogs about fashion, but she has also done a lot of videos on frustrations, guide dog etiquette, etc.  Listen through the things she complains about, and you'll probably avoid a few common mistakes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeWRBmmDqGA

Also, if you do decide to date this woman, consider that this relationship will unfold like any other. You'll get to know each other, maybe things will go great and maybe not. Maybe you spend the rest of your lives together, but maybe (like many, many relationships) it runs its course and ends at some point. There's nothing in there that is different, just because she's blind. If you get on great, I can almost guarantee that her blindness will be the last thing you're worried about.  And if things don't go well, one or both of you will probably end the relationship, and -- shocker, here -- it will probably have very little to do with her blindness.

Best wishes.

But if you grew up there always failing the eye charts, it'd be massively different.
I lived there (and another country) as a kid. I knew an older blind lady as a kid, but never anyne around my age. Regular school there reminds of your experience, being one out of those handful of kids being picked at in a school of 600. 
Back then I saw enough so no one thought about futureproofing my skills with o&amp;m or braille. I thought everyone would have the same kind if sleep issues I did (especially in summer and winter when circadian rhythms just fail so bad). I learned only as an adult thru massive sleep deprivation that normal-eyed people can just sleep at night and stay awake during the day. And I learned braille - and now I just don't think I've ever noticed anything brailled around there. (Is there? Bathroom signs, room rumbers etc? I kind of assume elevator numbers and star is always there no matter what country)

I find it often easier to get around here in US.
""I don't drive"" is a lot more powerful statement here (especially in the South) than in Europe. There there can be a lot of reasons for not driving, here just 3.
And of course public transport and planning how to get somewhere and back is a lot more figuring out.
Print disability can be another great thing in US - when you get it official and can request those reasonable accommodations. Before that it's a pain.

Visiting doctors and hospitals is one thing I imagine being easier there. Hospitals in US have left me with PTSD.
Customer service and assistance is probably easier too. At least with public transport, shops etc. (But you ""Can I help you?"" all the time here. Maybe I need to work on some of my insecurities to admit a bit more often that some help would be great)
Sauna culture and more honesty in communication are also great there.

About the ID cane, have you used a standard length mobility cane in the past?  I am a mobility cane user and have never used an ID because since I've needed a cane I've needed it to be full length because I need obstacle detection.  If you need obstacle detection it may be worth looking into getting some orientation and mobility training and working with a longer cane, but that is entirely personal preference and depends on your situation.  I know one person that uses an ID cane and he mostly caries it in his hand in front of him, it seems to work for what he needs.

&amp;nbsp;

As for public perception/ taking advantage/ whatever else.  It is certainly not a silly thing to ask about but it's going to depend.  I have had people be super great to me while carrying a cane, and I've been taken advantage of a couple of times that are super memorable and resulted in me having to call the police.  When you start traveling with a cane you need to be aware of your surroundings and the people around you, even if you are just carrying one for ID, be sure to maintain situational awareness.  I have never had a problem with change, but I am careful about the places where I pay cash, and I mostly stick with my debit card because there is no change at all to worry about.  I also know there was a discussion about ID canes in 2015, if you search the sub you will probably find it, but I believe the person inquiring actually started using one and liked it.

Sometimes though that extreme can be hard as well though. I have a friend who is very high low vision, but still falls under legally blind.

She constantly suffered from migraines and fell behind, as a result her confidence suffered. It became more of a problem with post secondary. She pushed away from me to hang with sighted preppies, the agony! She was in my wedding party. It was and still is very hard to watch. There is nothing wrong with having life goals but I think someone should have been real with her.

When I suggested Linux, I thought he wanted a familiar environment to do the same things he's already doing.  If he's willing to re-learn everything anyway, Windows is a better solution in the end.  

As for a mouse, does he have enough vision to use it?  I don't have one at all, myself.  If he has no vision at all, the only place a mouse will do anything for him is in some relatively obscure audio games.

For a headset, I'm using the Turtle Beach Z300.  However, this is probably way overkill!  I use it because it can pair with my phone via bluetooth, and my computer via USB, and play the audio from both devices at the same time.  This is so useful when I'm on a phone call and need to check something quickly on the computer.  However, I do recommend Turtle Beach products.  They're usually pretty accessible, with voice prompts when they're paired, when the battery is low or charged, and audio feedback when the mic is muted and unmuted.  You might look into one of their cheaper wireless options.  When you're blind, wireless is even more useful than it is to sighted people!  I can start my screen-reader reading a long email or web page, and get up and go do something else; I don't need to be anywhere near the screen.  In fact, if you get him a good wireless keyboard too, he gets some of the advantages of a laptop, with all the advantages of a desktop!  Most wireless keyboards and headsets have a range of two or three hundred feet, making using the computer in another room perfectly possible when you don't need to see the monitor.  I'd recommend one of the various Logitech wireless keyboards, as they seem to have the least lag.

As for brand of computer, it really doesn't matter.  When you're setting it up for him, the best thing you can do is format the drive and install Windows from scratch.  Every computer maker fills the machine with inaccessible crapware and ads.  So just get whatever's in his price range and wipe it.",2,,2,0,0,

While he has some vision, it is not enough for a mouse to be useful from what you are saying.  Your point about a wireless headset and keyboard makes a lot of sense, so I will make sure that is what he gets.

Do you have any recommendation on antivirus software and firefox plugins?  My biggest concerns with having him on Windows are viruses and spyware.  I personally use firefox with noscript, privacy badger, and ublock origin.  I'm always leery to setup noscipt for anyone but myself as it is a constant challenge to get new sites to run properly, but I figure an adblocker is a minimum security requirement seeing as there are so many malicious ads out there.

Right now he mostly uses word perfect 5.1; where he keeps phone numbers, addresses, notes, and various other documents.  Do you have any recommendations on software to replace that functionality?  It would be nice if google's web software would work for him, such as google docs and sheets--but if something like Microsoft office is more accessible that would probably be the way to go.

The app will read your screen and also wjat you type. Wjochever screenreader you use it can take a while to get fluent with it.

Also not all blind people are totally blind. Some have a bit of usable vision left, whole you still are considered legally blind. So other options may include zoom in browser (you can make the letters as big  as a cat if it helps). Then you can also use reallly high contrast or inverted colors if you are able to see something.

Reddit has also many ways to browse it.
Right now I'm using an app on my iPad. It kind of works - I know how to use it and where my controls are. But I don't know for instance if I'm replying to a pm or a thread because I can't tell. 
On iPhone I often find links to intereeting topics via a twitter app where I follow a few subreddit bots. So I click on the link, follow thru to read it... Sometimes open it on safari too. Any text gets then read by voiceover. Pictures are pretty useless, and I don't bother reading long threads of comments because that takes forever.

No matter of browsing style the usual visual landmarks don't apply. ""click on the sidebar on the left""... I can try to find it in iOS with Safari by touching around left side of the screen to listen what's there. Otherwise the bars or lefts or rights aren't there.
(I use headphones and have my voices set to pretty fast).

If you want to try, on Mac or iOS go to settings &gt; preferences &gt; accessobility and turn on VoiceOver. You'll get a black or white box that will show where you are on the screen. The app will guide you telling you how to do what.

Forgot to add there are also refreshable braille displays. They can be the size of a larger phablet to a keyboard. You'll use your fingers to read the text. Those dispkays are really cool, but they are also really expensive (easily thousands of $).

For instance a night or two ago I met one of my previous cats in a dream. It was in a dark room that I couldn't recognize. He was a black cat (could see him when he was alive). I recognized him from voice, the touch of his fur and his scent.

Other blind dream types: getting lost inside buildings. Crossing a road. Variations of the dreams where you are naked or dressed weird. Dreams where everyhting is completely dark but very vivid and you think you're awake - for instance dreaming of sleeping in a different bed when it feels completely like sleeping on a specific other mattress, in a different room. Or are in a plane and know what kind of plane and what seat, just no visuals.
Earlier this week also: riding a bicycle, and the road was flooding. I couldn't escape, and got stuck with the bike in the flood.",2,,2,0,0,

Plus on many other medicine type products.

In USA it's too rare to find Braille in products.
But room names and numbers in public buildings always have it. You can also find the elevator/lift floor numbers everywhere brailled (ground floor is usually star symbol or number 1)
Many L'Occitane cosmetic product bottles or packaging have braille - a lovely little details being able to read in the shower what I'm using (as if I couldn't tell from the scent).
Also some plant food bottles had braille; toxic for humans stuff but i so wish all tylenols, aspirins, cough medicines etc had the product name and dosage brailled on the box.

A few affordable ideas in US &amp;amp; Canada: you can get cheap children's braille books from seedlings (.org?), and a basic braille slate &amp;amp; stylus for writing for under $10 from braille bookstore online (free shipping for $10 or more, so maybe add a few silicone bracelets with braille alphabet to show and raffle).

Paths for Literacy might have a few cool ideas. :) 

An alphabet map would be great to show too.

You can and probsbly should contact some local blind organization to see if someone could help show materials or how to read and write etc.
In many cities in US NFB (national federation for the blind) is great, but there is also AFB and ACB. 
What city, state, or country are you located in? Maybe I can find some local ideas :)

Although I have come across nice people wanting &amp;/or willing to help, the fact that Europe is just so much older than North America poses some challenges for anyone with a visual impairment or physical disability, due to all the cobblestones, numerous kinds &amp; colours of stones being used, many stairs, fewer ramps, lots of stairs on trains themselves, uneven train platforms, etc.  However, many of the concert venues I've gone to in Germany &amp; the UK have been wonderful with their disability accommodations, so it's a bit of a mixed bag for me.  Some of my fellow travelling concert goers who live in Europe don't appreciate the venues giving accommodations to visually impaired people either, which I was rather surprised at, as I unfortunately have to deal with these same people at nearly every show I attend for our favourite band. :(  But I have also met some very nice &amp; understanding Europeans, too, so it's nice to hear that Finland for the most part is very accepting.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1459900752,"Yes, you can get audio queues when moving the mouse around. It plays a beep, where left to right panning represents left to right position on the screen, pitch represents up and down, and loudness represents brightness of the mouse pointer.  The feature is turned off by default, though, and I have never ever used it.  I guess you could memorize the positions of icons and click them, but why on earth would you?  Maybe for an app without keyboard access, I guess. But I think I'd find a different app to use.  

Ad blocking is not only good for security, it's also a big accessibility win.  Getting rid of ads that open windows, move the focus, play loud noises without warning, show bouncing blinking animated images, etc, makes everything so much easier for screen-readers.  I also use UBlock origin for that. The only catch is you need to whitelist facebook if he's going to use it. UBlock blocks some JavaScript that facebook uses to make accessibility improvements.  

Another addon I run is [F123 Access](http://f123access.com).  It makes accessibility improvements to popular websites like Reddit, Youtube, and fixes common access problems found on many sites.  Full disclosure: I'm involved with testing and development for them.  

For getting past CAPTCHAs, I have the best luck with [Rumola](http://skipinput.com). But if he's knew to the web, he might not need that for a while.  

I also use 1password, Down Them All, Video Download Helper, Grease Monkey, and Chatzilla.  But I don't think those are things he needs until he wants something that does those things, if that makes sense.  And I don't recommend noscript for anyone.  I'd consider myself an expert user, and even I don't have time to consider the security implications of every single JavaScript file on every single page.  

As for antivirus, I don't run one on Windows 10. I find that they work really poorly with screen-readers.  Because the virus checker wants to make sure a virus can't click past its warnings, virus scanners often disable screen-reader access to all of there warnings and dialogues completely.  Because anything a screen-reader can do, any other automated program could do.  What I do is keep UAC on the highest security setting, and disable running unsigned executables.  If NVDA was installed as administrator, it can read the UAC prompts.  Then just train him not to click ""yes"" unless he understands why he should.  

As for word processing, yes, Google Docs works fine.  But I personally prefer Libre Office.  I suspect this is because at 28, I'm already old and cranky and want these darn kids with there web apps to get off of my lawn!  Back when I was young, an office suite was a huge program with a hundred million features that nobody understood, that takes 2 or 3 minutes to launch!  Libre Office continues in that tradition, the way God intended!  LOL. Seriously though, I just don't feel comfortable with browser based word processing, and I can't clearly articulate why.  

GMail eventually did convince me to give up Mozilla Thunderbird for webmail, and I've been fine with that for 3 years or so.  And Docs is perfectly accessible, just like GMail. But...but...I DON'T LIKE IT!  I just don't want to do that in the browser.  

Another app I highly recommend is [Foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org).  When the installation asks you, select ""simple layout"", and it will work perfectly.  It's the best audio player, ever, hands down. It's much faster than iTunes, and much more accessible. It can rip CDs with the right components, it can play formats like flac, and it's just all around a joy to use.  If he wants to play videos and things too, [Kodi](http://ruuk.github.io/service.xbmc.tts) can be made accessible, and is the best media center option available.  

If he wants to read ebooks, assuming you don't have philosophical objections to paying for software, [QRead](http://getaccessibleapps.com/qread) is a good option. Full support for Epub and PDF, and books from Bookshare. And for books with DRM, [Codex](http://jscholes.net/project/codex) is the accessible, free way to crack them.  

If he ever needs it, [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org) is the most accessible way to deal with zip files. 

If he ever wants it, the Twitter client I prefer is [TWBlue](http://twblue.es).

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1461179733,"I find this interface really awkward.  It opens two windows, one of them untitled. NVDA doesn't automatically read out any of the text.  Without feedback when I move, I find it difficult to know where I am or if I'm really moving.  The game says I don't have any items when I press x, even though the item description says I have two swords.  

Things that are needed: footstep sounds on movement, so I know that's actually working.  Either that or a unique description that could be printed on every tile.  A way to get NVDA to read back the text properly.  A fix for the weapon bug.  Environment descriptions just say ""can't do that"", so that needs fixing as well.  Combine the game into one Window; I'm not even sure what the other Window is for.  Though I suspect most of the interface strangeness is because the game is in Java.

Without wanting to generalise too much - I think it's quite a common thing in the disabled community as a whole for someone's disability to be their whole identity.  e.g. I see myself as a person whos visual impairment &amp; mobility issues  are just part of who I am, but it doesn't define me as a person.

I used to 'play' (wrong word but it will do) Second Life with a friend.  This friend had her legs amputated below the knee some years ago.  Her character in SL was just like mine - able bodied and walked around just fine.

She was verbally abused and harassed by a woman she met on there because she didn't have her character in a wheelchair.  This persons whole identity was her disability and what she couldn't do, it was impossible to work, and how society was shit because it didn't bend to her every need.

Meanwhile my amputee friend is raising 6 kids, doing a University degree in psychology and holding down a full time job. 

It's because of her that I have a sort of 'life is tough, deal with it' sort of attitude to disabilities.  Or at least to the people who whine about what they can't do, instead of what they can do.

Every support group I've experienced has been a cross between a pity party and a pissing contest and after 4 heart attacks and a stroke it made me realise I have time for neither.

If my best friend can raise 6 kids, work, do a Uni degree &amp; Stephen Hawking can write a book using nothing but the twitching of a single cheek muscle - then I'm certainly not going to let a little blindness and trouble walking stop me.

It's okay, but it's just okay.  The pros are it is light, easy to use, and cheaper, but it is by no means cheap.  The cons are that it is fragile, the battery life is not so great, and everyone I know who has used one (2 other people + myself) has had the battery completely die requiring an RMA to get a replacement which makes me think it's a flaw in the design, not just a fluke.  It usually happens six months to a year after you start using it regularly.  I'm currently trying to get my hands on a Freedom Scientific Ruby XL which I have used and absolutely love.

I also use an Enhanced-Vision Davinci CCTV.  It is pricey at around $3,000 USD, I got mine through a non-profit.  I find that it has trouble focusing occasionally and will not display pencil marks properly, I think it's because the graphite is more reflective.  I believe since I got mine a second iteration came out that might have addressed these issues.  It also has an OCR feature which should not be a reason why you buy it, for me it has been nothing more than an over complicated gimmick that works 30% of the time maybe.  The second iteration might make it usable, not sure.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry I scared you about the cane a little, there isn't really an easy answer and I don't think it's fair to say that it will never catch the eye of someone who has bad intentions.  It happens, and it's an unfortunate part of life, and I do unfortunately speak from experience.  But to offer a bit of contrast, when I was tripping over concrete, and walking extra slow, and having to constantly scan and rescan the ground in front of me to determine if it was safe to take a step I was also vulnerable.  This also resulted in me having an entirely separate issue with a guy at a bus stop prior to using a cane, my lack of physical confidence when traveling likely had something to do with the reason why he approached me and started messing with me.  I am convinced that the confidence in the way I walk now with a cane makes up for the obvious broadcasted vulnerability.  I also currently live in the middle of a city with a less than ideal crime rate, if you live in a pretty safe area then I can't imagine it being a big issue.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's another thing that was told to me when I was going through the exact same line of thought while I was deciding whether a cane would be right for me, you absolutely, 100% do not have to use it all the time.  If you are in an area where you are not worried about obstacles, you can fold it up and throw it in your bag.  I always opt use mine but that's my personal preference.  I know of a lot of people who just use it when they feel they need it and that works for them.  I would also suggest you get in touch with a local Orientation and Mobility specialist and ask them for their input since it is their job to assess how a mobility aid might help you, many are funded through non-profits or the state (at least in the US) and can offer valuable, professional insight on the situation at no cost to you.  O&amp;M specialists have helped me with every decision I've had to make on this front and I'm very grateful for their insight.  It was one O&amp;M that convinced me to at least try a cane and it increased my mobility and independence significantly.  After one of my aforementioned incidents I was advised to start looking into getting a guide dog by an O&amp;M, and a little under a year and a half later I am just weeks away from flying out to train with my first service animal.  There isn't an easy answer to the question of ""do I get a cane?"" it takes a lot of thought and consideration on your part and there are some huge pros and huge cons.  You just have to weigh them and figure out if the cons are worth it to you.  For me they absolutely are, but for you they very well may end up not being worth it, and that is totally okay.",1,,1,0,0,

I don't want to discourage you from trying a cane though, and reading over I feel like I might have.  It is very much a personal issue, but regardless of the issues I've had, I wouldn't give up using a cane for any of that.  It has been so useful and it has saved me and continues to save me from tripping and being injured countless times every week.  A memorable example of this was trying to find my way in the dark on a light rail platform that I don't travel often where I almost stepped off the platform with what has to be at least a four foot drop onto the rails.  I have also taken extra measures to handle people with less than good intentions.  I think the biggest thing about canes for me is that while I know my home area, there are things I can't account for.  People leaving things on the sidewalk, or going new places where I am not aware of problems can be a huge problem.  For that reason I will continue to use a cane because it really does increase my independence and my ability to travel wherever I went when I want.  Just things to think about.",1,,1,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1459773391,"I use hotkeys constantly.  The problem with using tab is that often, site authors don't label form controls properly, so when you tab to them you just hear something unhelpful like ""edit"". Also, many website authors do strange things with the tab order on a page, so you can never trust that you've been through the entire page while tabbing.  However, on pages I trust to be correct (GMail, for example) I do use the tab key all the time.  Also, Google has created many custom hotkeys that work in GMail, and seeing as I use GMail every day, I use Google's recommended hotkeys over the ones NVDA provides.  I only use the arrow keys the first time I'm exploring a website, and often not even then.  For example, if I'm reading a news article, the first thing I'll try is h to jump to the next heading, in hopes the author has made the headline a heading of some kind.  Arrowing through everything on a web page is just far too clunky and slow.  

I'm really not generally aware of what websites use bootstrap, so I couldn't really answer that question.  The only JavaScript library that is annoying enough that I'm aware of it is CKEditor.  I always turn off rich text editors in every website that lets me, because I find the hundreds of formatting buttons just get in the way.  Plus, NVDA used to have problems reading back any text typed into JavaScript edit fields.  However, over the past year, I haven't noticed the problem as frequently.  Either sites are using different controls these days, or CKEditor has been fixed, or I just turn off fancy editors so reflexively I don't even remember doing it.  

Yup. Apparently CKEditor 4 fixed all of the accessibility problems.  I'll leave the last paragraph in tact, though.  It highlights one of the problems with making accessibility fixes: if a user tried something 2 years ago and it didn't work, the user is going to assume it still doesn't work.  Websites are good at promoting there own fixes to users, but if a library developer fixes something, I'm not sure how we'd ever find out.  ",1,,1,0,0,

There have definitely been points where I have felt sad about the limitations.  The day my doctor told me I wasn't going to drive was soul crushing, especially living where I do where a car is pretty much essential.  I was frustrated with my medical disqualification for certain jobs, and it still bums me out occasionally.  However I think getting past that is part of what becoming successful requires.  Sure I can't get anywhere here in less than two hours, but to remedy that I'm moving, far, far away to a place I can walk everywhere and that move is happening in less than six months.  I can't do those things that fascinated me growing up like piloting, but I found new interests that excite me, and which will probably be ultimately far more rewarding in every way.  Everyone has their challenges, and I don't think disability should be an excuse around fighting back against life's problems.  Stephen Hawking is a perfect example of this, the man continues to be one of the most respected Physicists and like you said he does everything through twitching his cheek muscles.  But to bring that to a blind focus, I can look at people like Brad Snyder or Marcus Engel.  I had the extreme pleasure of meeting Marcus Engel and he discussed how he was blinded by a drunk driver in an accident that really should have killed him.  He could have easily said ""screw it"" and given up but he pushed on and he is doing amazing stuff now.  Brad Snyder was blinded after stepping on IED while working as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal Officer for the US Navy in Afghanistan and now he is winning medals in the Paralympics.  If people can bounce after stuff like that, then I see no reason why others (myself included) can't.  Having rolemodels like those guys is really helpful though, it sets the bar for the level of effort I should be putting in to accomplish what I want to accomplish and keeps me on track.

I am about to start my Freshman year of undergraduate education as a Mechanical Engineering major in the Fall a couple thousand miles away from home.  I grew up with parents that were insistent that I needed to be independent, they avoided the school for the blind in my area like the plague (on the advice of others) and put me through mainstream school all the way through and I'm about to graduate in a couple of weeks having completed K-12 in a regular school system.  My dad has been actively encouraging me to get as far away as I can so that I can figure out life for myself, and as a result of all of this I am fiercely independent and I feel like I've got a really good handle on how to go through life with this particular disability.

Through work and some programs with a local non-profit I've been put in contact with some people around my age who went to the school for the blind and visually impaired who are just not independent in the slightest.  Your comment about not liking most blind and visually impaired people you meet was also interesting because I've joked with sighted friends that I really haven't been too fond of many of the blind and visually impaired people I've met IRL.  There are a few notable exceptions but most are just not people that are fun to be around.  The people I've been put in contact with in my area often have no independent spirit and want everything done for them.  It's not the fact that they are blind or visually impaired that bothers me, I mean I am in the exact same boat, but it's a trend of lacking any kind of initiative or motivation that baffles me.  I kind of thought that was just a thing in my area though and it sounds like this might be more common. Has that been your experience?

If you think about it, being deaf is in many ways a lot easier than being blind, but in terms of communication it is in some was more difficult. 

It is difficult to follow the thread of a conversation between hearing people, as the conversation jumps around.  It is hard to know where it jumped to in time to read what was said on the person's lips.  So, it becomes easier to socialize within a deaf community, thus fostering a unique sense of a deaf community.  

So, while blindness is a more individual experience, due to that lack of a similarly able-ed community, it is in many ways less socially limiting, less socially isolating than hearing impairment.

I am a painter. I am not blind yet, I am going blind. When I was younger I remember playing ""Would you rather"" and the choice was deaf or blind.  At the time, even though I was a painter and in love with the visual world, I still chose blind, because I felt that the sound of life has this beautiful way of enveloping you, of making you feel wholly within the center of living. I felt being blind would be more debilitating, but that feeling connected was more important. 

It is pure coincidence that I am now going blind. When I heard the news I even regretted (superstitiously) ever playing that game, as though I must have jinxed myself somehow.  Silly really.  It also occurred to me that I ought to have chosen deaf instead.

Many sit-down restaurant chains will also have Braille menus available; in the US, I've gotten them regularly at Ruby Tuesdays, in Canada Swiss Chalet usually has them.  But any large corporate chain should have some; smaller individually owned places never ever do.  

Perhaps talk about audio description?  It's available on most Disney DVDs, and children's cartoons seem to be the things that have description most often.  As a quick example, here's [the Frozen trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7j4_aP8dWA) audio described.  It's an especially good example to use, because listening to it with your eyes closed, you couldn't get anything at all out of that without someone describing it.  

Accessible computer games, played only with sound, are also a thing.  Unfortunately, most of them are difficult enough that I don't think kids that age would enjoy them.

You can hear the audible lights at Toronto's Yonge and Dundas intersection in the background of [this recording](https://audioboom.com/boos/1357257-walking-around-yonge-and-dundas-described-for-asilapple) made by our own /u/fe8d9b36-291b-48b6-b739-23272de5c0cd.  But there may well be some audible lights somewhere near you.  

Blind people are also the reason subways and buses in Canada, the US, and the UK usually announce what stop they're at.  On the off-chance your local bus doesn't do this, here's [a recording](https://audioboom.com/boos/532333-subway-sounds) that I made back when that feature was relatively new on the Toronto subways.  Why did I record that for five minutes?  And not say anything?  Good grief!  

I also made [this recording of a Braille Printer](https://audioboom.com/boos/482056-index-basic-v4-braille-printer-longer-with-voice-and-chatter) printing out a page of Braille.  It's more interesting...slightly.

They weren't nice at all, after all my messages the only answer that I got"" there is no other platform in this moment where you can access the game.
I am not copying their words just explaining the answer that I got.
This was very disappointing once I already play this game on the iPhone and I got pretty excited with the news that it would be available for mac.
So in the end I hope that they open their eyes for the fact that steam is not accessible for everybody.

About the money if it helps to make steam accessible I will see this as an investment, but I am scared that it was just lost. But totally by my mistake of not checking steam.",1,,1,0,0,

A fun way of showing braille might even be teaching them grade 1. You can use a cupcake tin with 6 cups and six tennis balls to go through the whole alphabet in a large and fun way.

Canadian paper currency has braille markers on it to help the note what kind of bills they are. Any street crossings with audible signals will usually have braille on them telling you what street you are about to cross. The more high-tech ones have buttons that vibrate to help tell you when to start crossing, and if you press and hold down the button it will even speak to you to tell you to wait to cross a particular street.

If not, I'd have to scan and OCR the book myself.  Just the fact that you exist, and have a set of guidelines to follow, is a huge step forward.  

As for the text itself...it depends what the image is used for.  If it's a chart/graph, how will it be used in the classroom?  Sometimes, you might need to provide every single datapoint, and sometimes, that might be overkill.  The same really applies to other images as well: if they're just to ad flavor to the book, they don't need as much description as if they're integral to the text.  I guess the question to ask yourself is: why did the author of the book include this image, and is my description serving the same purpose as looking at the original image?  

I know I experience frustration on some government websites where the description isn't in sync with the purpose of the image.  A stock photo of, say, a man standing next to a tractor really doesn't need a 2 paragraph description.  Especially when the article is about something unrelated like the environmental impact of farming, and the article never mentions men or tractors at all.  Information about the man's overalls and hat, and what kind of tractor it is, just distracts from the article, and thus takes away from the author's original purpose, rather than adding anything useful.

Whatever reasons you've had to call police for are what really worries me about using a cane.

I have never used a cane of any kind, no. At first I was given the impression that my vision impairment was temporary. Then at my first ophthalmologist appointment last February they told me it would never improve- and that was when I still had diplopia. So I was never really in the position to try a cane out.

As for web accessibility, Drupal is doing absolutely incredible things there.  Not only does the Drupal CMS create accessible content by default, but they've made the administration and content creation portions of the system completely accessible, as well.  It happens far too often that developers make the public content accessible, but apparently assume that no blind person will ever work at that company, or no blind people ever want to generate there own content.  Wordpress used to suffer from this problem: it could make accessible blogs, but the administration and posting sections used to have huge access issues.  Over the last year or so, though, they've made huge strides in fixing them.  However, I still find it far easier to picture a Drupal theme in my head, and it seems to be better at not making ugly websites when the person responsible for choosing themes and layout is totally blind.

I think it's most similar to fandoms (trekkies, bronies, Potterheads, etc) in the way it manifests.  There are a few big conferences (NFB, ACB, CSUN, etc) where a lot of the people in the ""blind subculture"" get together once a year.  Otherwise, it mostly exists in specialized websites that discuss shared problems and interests common to blind people, and on Twitter, Facebook, various voice chat servers, and so on.  It's also similar to fandoms because not everyone who is blind chooses to be involved in the subculture, in the same way not everyone who has read Harry Potter chooses to go to Harry Potter conventions or hang out in online Harry Potter communities.  I think that's different from the deaf culture, because I don't think there are as many deaf people who aren't part of deaf culture as there are blind people who choose never to participate in the blind subculture.  I'd suspect that over half of blind people aren't active in the blind subculture at all.  However, those of us who are active in it are quite closely knit, just like active fans.  ",2,,2,0,0,

I have been pretty lucky to find a couple of people who are actually fantastic, highly motivated people, but they are by far an exception for those I know personally.  As a result I have friends that joke about me as being the blind guy who hates blind people.  Which is not really the case at all. I have some great friends who are blind or visually impaired in addition to being legally blind myself, but the majority of people I know have a mentality that really gets to me because it just strikes me as people deciding to be helpless.

I'm basically in the same boat: due to the VI teacher that I had from k-4, my parents were encouraged to make me be as independent as possible. They wouldn't do anything for me that I hadn't attempted myself; I attended mainstream schooling my entire life, and I'm currently living on my own while completing my freshmen year at college. The latter has been a bit nerve-wracking (naturally), but I feel that I've gained confidence in leaps and bounds because of it.  This is all something I'm terribly grateful for though, naturally.

I also have found that I don't really associate with a great deal of blind people due to the reasons that many people have stated above: so many are dependent, use their blindness as a crutch, or are just so apathetic of how they come across in general. It's horrific, and embarrassing, and I personally don't even attempt to hide my disdain for people who adopt that mentality. They make the rest of us look like utter plebs, amiright?  

I actually can't even begin to explain how happy I am that I went out of my way to seek out this subreddit; as you yourself stated, it's pretty evident that the demograph that frequents this seems a lot more independent and... isn't overwhelmingly 'blindy'.  

I realize that I'm a little off-topic now, but I get into a somewhat gushy mind set when I get excited over something, and finding people that agree with me on this is just... amazing! (especially when most sighted people think you're being hypocritical if you make this argument).

But as for the sub-culture comment in of itself: I think that /u/6b71e46e-9c9c-43d9-bb9e-90dfc13ffcd9 , really explained things accurately. At least, that's been my perception of blind culture.

If you live in a place with good public transit, that might not be a huge deal.  But especially in North America, public transit is poor enough in most cities that it can make everything from shopping for groceries to getting a job much harder.  There are, of course, ways around these problems, and it doesn't stop any blind person from living a happy, fulfilled life.  But speaking from a ""what will I notice most"" point of view, that's probably going to be it.

The second thing to keep in mind is that it's going to be ten times harder for her to find work.  Unemployment is, I would say, the largest issue effecting blind people right now.  So counting on her to bring in half of your combined income is probably not reasonable.  

However, those things aside, blind people can do pretty much anything we want.  If she lives on her own, you can assume that she can do everything associated with that without a lot of help: cooking, cleaning, etc.  If you move in together, the only changes in your life that you'll probably need to make is that you'll have to make sure and put things back where they go when you're done with them.  Assuming you're even somewhat organized, you shouldn't have any trouble.  But I have lived with some really messy people, so I feel like that shouldn't be taken for granted.  The DVD cases a roommate left in the middle of the floor for some ungodly reason are the DVD cases I'm going to step on, and I'm not really interested in listening to any complaints about broken DVDS after the fact.  

The best thing you can do is talk to her about your worries.  Let her know your future plans, and discuss how she can be a part of them.  If the relationship is going to work, you need to build it to the point where you can both be open and honest with each other, and where you don't feel weird asking her questions.

There are two windows because in one of them it shows the UI (so visually unimpaired can still enjoy the game) and the other is the one that generates the sentences and read them out loud. I'm also using NVDA and it works fine to me (the sentences are being read okay), so probably it has to do the Java Access Bridge not being activated or an incompatible version being installed (I had to install both the 34 and 64 bit version to make it work).

Pressing the button ""x"" allows you to attack. You can't attack if you don't have a weapon equipped. If you press the button ""i"" it will read out what you have in the inventory and if you press the numeric numbers you'll be able to equip them.
Pressing other buttons like ""b"" or ""n"" will give you information about the environment around you, so you can see where to go.

The idea of adding footsteps whenever you move is a great idea, as well as naming the second window.

There was a lot of childlike behavior; I often witnessed 14-16-year-olds who had no issues besides blindness behaving as if they were 10 (banging on tables, making weird noises etc). Surprisingly I did make a few friends while I was there, all but one of whom were also new and attending due to inadequate accommodations from their schools. Of the 3 I still talk to only one is totally blind. I've tried to bury that part of my past but have gotten curious once or twice and looked at the Facebook posts of people whose names I knew there. Some of them must be at least 22 and the quality of their posts makes them seem like they might be 12. It is very disheartening but I'm sure it's true for any minority to some extent.",2,,2,0,0,

Drag a pen over a keyboard, and then a desk to get a bit of a idea.

I learned oh &amp; M using a sweeping technique with the roller tip on my cane, so it keeps in constant contact with the ground and gets me full feedback of what surfaces I'm on. From the sound the cane makes, I can generally get some spatial reasoning of obstacles in front and around me, like shorelining walls or if I'm about to walk into a parked car, etc. I can generally hear the sound reflected before my cane hits an object.",2,,2,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1461005023,"I deeply disagree.  I never liked custom platforms like blinknation, Klango, The Zone, and so-on.  I find my most valuable interactions tend to come from places not meant specifically for the blind, but where blind people developed groups and a large population anyway.  Audioboo, before they turned it into audioboom and ruined everything forever, was one of those places.  Something about being on a popular, well maintained platform, where sighted people could pop in if they liked, or ignore us if they wanted, seems to promote much more value in my mind.  Maybe it's because these places tend to draw in blind people from outside the blind subculture, so we get more of a variety of people.  If I can toot our own horn for a minute, I find /r/blind is a near perfect platform for exactly the kind of interaction I want.  Most of the people who post here are involved in other subs on Reddit, not just this one.  We get interested sighted folk popping in and out regularly.  So we have a huge variety of topics here, with input from people in all walks of blindness, and all walks of life.  The sort of people who go out of there way to sign up for Klango or Blinknation tend, honestly, to be the kind of people I don't find particularly interesting.  I'm not insulting you or anything, I'm sure you're an interesting person.  I'm just speaking on average.  And anyway, you're here, aren't you?  And even people who would rather just talk to other blind people all day...I have nothing against them, and I don't think they're bad people.  I'm just not interested in talking to them.  ",1,,1,0,0,

The best thing I was told was that if it helped me, I could use it. If it didn't help in a situation or made me very self conscious, I could opt to not use it. The cane is really there for you, there aren't set rules about when you use it. 

I personally really like the cane. It took a while to get used to but now I feel much more comfortable using it. It's great to know that the sidewalk doesn't end right in front of me, or there isn't a sudden curb. 


I don't know much about ID canes but even with a long cane people don't seem to realize what it's for. On the plus side, people move out of my way and pull their kids out of my way too!  ",1,,1,0,0,
