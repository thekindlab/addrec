I am a visually impaired software engineer so I know a thing or two about programming :-)  The most useful tools for me is a LARGE monitor (on a movable arm) and a screen magnifier. He has to decrease the font size to code efficiently so the magnifier is a must. The screen magnifier and/or screen readers are also so important for improving his sitting position.

The constant contact sweep works very well for me, and as I got better with orientation and mobility, my trainer upgraded me to a 61 inch version so I can move faster and because of my height.

I ended up getting one of those free NFB Straight canes, and use it every now and then around the house or going outside to the garage, but not much more than that. When going out and about, I much prefer a cane that I can break down. 

I grabbed an Ambutech  aluminum cane with a jumbo roller tip for hiking, although the joints feel loose even with it being new, and recently got an NFB sectional cane with a metal tip for more Advanced orientation and mobility practice.

I have been noticing that more and more people run into me or don't understand what the Cain signifies when using the totally white NFB Kane. When I use a cane with the lowest section painted red, more people get out of my way. I also think that much sleeker and thinner canes don't pose as much of a threat as the heavier looking revolution canes, so that's also a problem as people notice it less and tend to walk into the sleeker ones more. I wonder if it's a cultural thing as here in America, blind people are usually depicted using canes with red tips/lower sections.",1,,1,0,0,

I have friends that are extremely (read: EXTREMELY) affluent. And I personally have dealt with bouts of manic depression that often resulted in thoughts of suicide.

From what I can tell, she's fairly right. Being able to support yourself without a college degree can be incredibly difficult (but it is not necessary). This is doubly so for the visually impaired. Yet all of my V.I. students have tons of mentors, most of whom are blind themselves, that are accountants, mathematicians, psychiatrists, you name it, and all are very much independent. Professionals. It CAN be done, though usually with the help of a support group. There are services and organizations that help the blind. One of my students lives in a shelter for the visually impaired and is part of a local charity that supports the blind for many of their academic needs. There are options out there, but I'm not sure how it is effected by the income of parents. This leads to my next point.

Being that her parents are affluent, unless she is 24 and is not being filed as a dependent on their tax return, she will have a hard time getting financial aid for school. Until then, she will have to find a way to pay for it. I would suggest starting with community college as it is much cheaper and easier to transition into a equally cheap senior college. If she is being filed as a dependent by her parents, you could have her file her own tax return (and NOT as your dependent) so that she will have the necessary status for financial aid. I don't work for the financial aid office and I hate personal tax, so you'll have to double check most of this. From what I gather from my friends who are very well off and have since cut ties with their parents, being labeled as a dependent on the books fucks you over for aid based on the provider's income.

Finally, if she is having suicidal thoughts, she needs to seek professional help OR (and I fucking hate saying this because everyone, even my loved ones said the same to me) she will have to deal with it on her own. I think (read: know) I dealt with it by self-medication and by doing things that i loved. Reading comics, drawing comics, writing comics, getting shit faced and having pre-marital sex. I dunno. I find I still deal with this every now and then, so that might be another way of saying that professional help is NECESSARY.

This is the only insight I can provide from personal experience. It is probably all far from correct, so take it all with a grain of salt.

Uh, this is going to be a hard one; I don't really think about it when I plug things in.  First off, I'm in Canada, so I'm using North American style plugs.  I've never been to a country that uses any other standard.  Maybe other types of plugs are harder; I wouldn't know.

OK, so I'm holding the plug in my right hand, with the two prongs at the top, just as though I'm about to push it in to the socket.  I place the thumb of my left hand above the two holes on the top of the socket, so that when the prongs of the plug in my right hand are touching the bottom of my left thumb, it's lined up to go in.  Then I remove my left thumb, and push the plug into the socket with my right hand.  

That makes it sound way more complicated than it is!  I do it with so little thought that I actually had to unplug something and plug it back in before writing this, just to even be aware of how I do it.  ",1,,1,0,0,

So how much can you see at the moment? I remember reading how people described being blind as absence of sight rather than it being all black. Would you agree with such a statement? Do you ever get any visual hallucinations? Do you find your dreams to be more intense?   

Oh those children would never know what hit them. You should pimp out your walking cane, so you could blind all those around you with shiny jewels.

I have some vision, bu treading labels and prices takes so much longer and other customers are pretty rude about it unless you're carrying a cane (...and even then). Also, bigger trips aren't possible without getting a ride or calling a cab making the delivery fee as cheap if not cheaper than actually going to the store myself. 

I would like to see more stores offer a ""order for pickup"" option with a low or no fee. This would allow for smaller grocery orders (as opposed to the delivery options which usually have a $50 or more minimum). It would also allow for a shorter turnaround time. Frankly, it'd be useful for sighted and blind alike. I think I've heard Amazon is already planning on something like this in Seattle.

Everyone here in /r/blind/ of course knows that playing ""pretend blind"" in no way simulates the skills and abilities that an experienced blind person with the right tools and training has. We know that blind people can competently ""eat a meal, make your bed,"" and ""get ready for the day."" (activities the campaign suggests for your challenge.) 

The worst part of the campaign in my opinion is the video on their site simulating blindness. 

If you go to the ""howeyeseeit"" site (I will not link to not promote them) there is a video link (not audio described) which reads ""See what it's like to lose your vision."" This leads to a youtube video which reads ""#howeyeseeit"" and ""foundation fighting blindness"" and then ""FOLLOW YOUR KID."" It is a park scene with kids in it, and your kid runs off in the video as your field of vision slowly decreases (simulating RP.) 

That is offensive and dangerous. We live in a time where blind parents still sometimes get their children taken away or unnecessary evaluations into their personal lives just because they're blind, and where every blind parent has stories of doctors, or social workers, or teachers who question their ability to parent. There are real life consequences to making people believe that a blind parent couldn't safely take their child to the park and supervise them there. 

Throwing blind people under the bus by making people think we're helpless and incompetent shouldn't be the way to fundraise for research. It's just not right. ",6,,6,0,0,

1. If you have a SAT score over ~1950, you can get a free ride and free/subsidized housing at Baruch College, for example, in NYC. They will definitely have excellent accommodations for the blind. 

2. If your girlfriend is a New York resident, but doesn't have an excellent SAT score, you can expect the cost of tuition in public New York school to be less than $6,000 a year, which still isn't cheap, but could be doable. 

3. Some countries, like Germany, offer free tuition to all, including foreigners. Their rational is that half of the foreigners who go to university in Germany end up staying, which is a huge boon to the German economy.

(https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm09/bm0905/bm090504.htm) here. 

In my opinion, some of the biggest issues are:

Among children: 

- Braille is relatively expensive to produce, requires relatively expensive equipment, and requires a teacher who is competent with braille (which there is a shortage of.) Schools have a financial incentive to discourage braille use.  

- Children who are ""just"" legally blind are often encouraged by schools and/or their parents to rely on their remaining vision under the (highly misguided, IMO) mindset that they aren't ""blind enough"" to need it. 

- Parents or teachers might fear stigma 
about braille reading, and parents can be in denial about the extent of their child's visual impairment. 

- For more severely blind children, ""text to speech is enough"" is an unfortunately common belief. 

- There are a lot of misconceptions about braille being very hard to learn or use, being impractical or too slow, or that children with even minor developmental disabilities couldn't possibly ever use braille. 

- Legally, schools [must]
(https://nfb.org/braille-and-vi-students) provide braille for children with substantial visual impairments. In practice, many parents either do not know, do not exercise, or are denied their child's rights. 

Among adults: 

- The cost of braille equipment, such as a refreshable braille display to use with a computer or phone, is cost prohibitive to many blind people (especially those who can't or don't want to receive devices through govt. rehab services.) This is a situation that is very soon changing with the introduction of a [20 cell, $500 braille display]
(http://www.aph.org/research/orbit-reader-20-details/) a severe drop from the approximate $2000 that comparably sized braille displays roughly average. 

- Adults who have been blind many years may feel they've gotten along just fine without braille up until now, so why change things? 

- Adults who are newly blind, especially later in life, receive many messages that braille is difficult or impossible to learn as an adult, that it is cumbersome and outdated, and why should you bother when TTS is everywhere? 

- Adults often carry the same mental hangups about braille being for people who are ""more disabled"" than they are, that using braille will make them look strange, etc. 

- There is a shortage of qualified, sufficient braille instruction for adults, especially among adults that don't live near major cities.",3,,3,0,0,

- Use a screen reader with speech. Getting training (through school, local blindness organization, etc) to use a screen reader can make or break the experience. At the very least, find a tutorial series on the screen reader you choose and go through it to start with. [JAWS]
(http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS)  is very popular on windows, but expensive. [Window Eyes]
(http://www.windoweyesforoffice.com/) is free if you have a copy of Office 2010 or better running on the PC. [NVDA]
(http://www.nvaccess.org/) is a completely free Windows screen reader that has actually turned out very excellent and competitive with some of the commercial options. (But if you can, donate if you use it!) The only thing you might want to (legally) buy to add onto NVDA is the [Eloquence and Vocalizer]
(http://codefactoryglobal.com/app-store/voices-for-nvda/) voices package, which adds nicer sounding speech. If you have a Mac, Voiceover is included free and is excellent right out of the box. 

- Use a screen reader with a refreshable braille display. This can be very helpful for some tasks (like coding) where seeing a detailed version of the text exactly as it appears on the screen is helpful. If your son doesn't know braille, he is legally [entitled]
(https://nfb.org/braille-and-vi-students) to be taught by his school, and learning braille has far reaching benefits well beyond making computer access easier. Any of the above screen readers can be used with a variety of braille displays. (A bluetooth braille display can also be connected to an android or iOS device as well, although iOS is recommended.)  If he gets a notetaker with a braille display for school purposes as well, this can often also be used as an external braille display for his computer or phone.

I'm going to be blunt, because I believe this is something you need to hear as people who love and care for her:

There's one option you seem to be completely ignoring here: helping her accept her blindness (by personally accepting it) and helping her get the resources that she needs to move on with her life. 

Being surrounded by family members who are treating blindness like some kind of terminal illness and shuffling her around to doctors desperately trying to cure it is not going to make her sight loss less ""incredibly hard to deal with."" Giving her the message that you're ""out of options"" if she doesn't regain some sight isn't going to help her. Giving her false hope or encouraging the fantasy that one day she might regain her sight will not help. 

If her doctors are saying that her sight cannot be recovered, that means her sight cannot be recovered. It's entirely possible that in 10 or 20 or 100 years there might be a cure for her condition, but encouraging her to hold out hope for that is going to be so harmful to her. It's no way to live, stopping your life waiting to ""get better"" or chasing cures. 

Look at the [NHS information about blindness]
(http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Visual-impairment/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and also get her in touch with the [RNIB]
(http://www.rnib.org.uk/) if she isn't already.

She's been hit with a terrible blow, and there's no doubt that she will benefit from some kind of professional or group support (or both) dealing with the emotional aftermath of developing a new disability. But she also needs you guys to get out of being surrounded by your own fear of blindness, to realize that she can do almost everything she used to with the right training and experience, and to help support and encourage her as she makes this adjustment. 

You aren't out of options here. You have a choice, but I strongly urge you to consider making the choice to learn more about blindness (and the many ways she can go about doing almost everything she used to) and to help her get what she needs to be able to do what she wants. ",10,,10,0,0,

For Windows, they can use Eclipse. It's probably the most powerful IDE for Java out there, and it's totally accessible.

Aside from that, teacher can/should e-mail any piece of code they wrote during class. That will help student to have a better understanding of what teacher was talking about when working on that code.

Second, this sounds super, super confusing.  Back when I used to organize notes, I was deeply in love with hierarchical outliners like [Keynote](http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_main.html).  When that went away in...2005, I guess...I just started making folders on disc full of text files.  Not as easy to deal with, but effectively did the same thing.  That's the only form of ""mind mapping"" I ever did, or ever felt I needed.  However, based on the entirely graphical mind mapping software packages on the market today, it's entirely possible I don't understand the concept.  

At the moment, though, I don't bother to organize anything into any system at all.  Sounds crazy, I know!  But one huge advance in the past several years is that text based keyword search is just blazingly fast!  In spotlight on mac, or the start menu of Windows 10, I can type ""cook chicken"", and have every text file I've ever created with those words pop up in less than a second.  Same goes for my GMail; I've kept and imported every email I've ever gotten or sent since 1998, and Google can search my hundreds and thousands of emails in just a few seconds.  So when searching is so fast and accurate, it seems utterly pointless for me to spend time thinking up reasonable folder structures and file names for things.  Just stick it anywhere, and name it anything, and search will find it next time I want it.  This has freed up vast sections of my brain formerly devoted to remembering file paths or other organizational structures.  It has also allowed me to save absolutely everything, because I no longer have to worry about where to put it, or how to organize it.  If I ever want it, assuming I can remember one or two vaguely associated words, it's there instantly.  ",3,,3,0,0,

In the UK there are alternatives to braille like the [Moon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_type) which is claimed to be easier to learn for those who already know the Latin script in print, so my understanding is many adults are taught that instead.

Further, as you say, there's a lot more ways to access information now.

&gt; I tried to use a cane. It didn't work for me. I get around ok with out it.

At 20/400 vision in my opinion you are putting your safety (and certainly your mobility and independence) at risk by not using a cane at least some of the time and not employing non-visual travel techniques along with your vision. ""Faking it"" can work a great deal with even a small amount of residual vision, right up until it doesn't (and then things can go terribly wrong.) For example, you describe becoming completely blinded at night for a while after a car's headlights hit your eyes. What would happen if this happened to you while crossing a street, and the cars don't know you're blind because you don't have a cane? 

I think you're totally on the right track to be questioning how your travel needs are going to change going from a small town to a university. You're going to encounter a lot of new places, new travel scenarios, and the need for skills you might not have fully developed at home. 

Any person of sufficient intellectual capacity and physical mobility can use a cane. Yes, in the beginning it is awkward and difficult and might seem useless when you can ""see enough."" Sometimes people, either because of a bad instructor or because of their own hangups about blindness, never really get out of that stage. I urge you to consider giving it another chance, and maybe to think about the things that might benefit you (like extra O&amp;M) in terms of not only being ready for a guide dog (as schools want you to have good cane travel skills before getting a dog) but also being ready to independently attend college regardless of if you decide to get a dog or not. 

The dog is a tool with many benefits but also some downsides. It will be completely useless to you if you don't have the travel skills required to work with it, or if you continue to try to rely exclusively on visual techniques. I know absolutely no blind people who have expressed regret in developing better cane travel skills. I've encountered a few who worked with a guide dog and discovered that it didn't work for them. One was a college student (who got the dog shortly before beginning college) that discovered that a dog didn't work with their busy lifestyle or make them feel as secure as traveling with a cane did when encountering challenging terrain. (But I also know plenty who say that a dog really improved their confidence and mobility and they're never going back.) 

If I were in your shoes, I would work on getting my cane travel skills up to a level where I would feel confident traveling a college campus (going to and from dorms, finding classes, the dining hall, and so on) and the nearby community without assistance. Having then developed those skills and started college, I would personally look at my needs and desires when actually in that situation and consider a guide dog at that time. 

&gt; Some people tell me that they are surprised to find out that I have a visual impairment because I get around so well.

I've had people tell me that when I'm carrying my cane! I know completely blind people (or those damn close) who have been told that. The general public's image of what a blind person ""should look like"" is often of someone who is poorly dressed, disoriented, with ""blind eyes"" or sunglasses, etc. When you do not fit into this mold it is very surprising to a lot of people. 

The issue is it's not that you aren't visually impaired ""enough"" to need those things, or that you wouldn't benefit from using non-visual skills. Their perception of blindness has no impact on your real needs or what will help you do the things you want to do. 

I've personally struggled with the trap of feeling not ""blind enough"" quite a lot. When I first started using a cane I had a little folding cane and more often than not that was exactly what it was, folded away in my bag like a secret. When I started learning braille I felt a bit like I was ""playing really blind"" because I can read very large print. When I started using a screenreader instead of magnifier, it felt silly learning all the keyboard commands when I could just turn zoomtext back on and find the thing ""faster"" using a mouse or so I thought. Every ""but you don't look blind"" and ""you're looking right at me"" and ""how could you see this, but not that?"" chipped away at my confidence. 

I am now incredibly thankful to the people in my life who encouraged me to give blindness skills a real try and to stick to them. 

With a cane, I walk quickly and confidently. I don't have to worry about how changing light conditions will impact my ability to travel. I no longer walk slowly and cautiously, or have frequent ""oh, I'm just clumsy!"" accidents. I have the skills to cross streets no matter the conditions or how complex, and the knowledge that cars can see that I am blind. Because of the travel skills I've developed using the cane, I know that I can go just about anywhere on my own. I don't think ""oh, I'll just wait for someone to give me a ride"" like I used to. Sure the cane has saved my skin plenty of times (something I only realize in retrospect) but the bigger effect was expanding my world and giving me the confidence to explore new places, to travel alone, etc. (And drawing parallels, because of braille and speech, I can read so much more than I thought was enough. I read much faster non-visually. I don't deal with eye strain or headaches or missing out on half of what I was supposed to read, or the discomfort of broadcasting the contents of my screen across a mile when using zoomtext in public! Reading became one of my favorite hobbies. Through this, the world that I previously thought was ""big enough"" grew even further.) 

Especially at a time when your world is going to be rapidly expanding anyways (going to college) I really encourage you to give blindness skills another chance. If that's through a cane or a dog or something else entirely, sometimes you don't figure out what you were missing until you have it. ",9,,9,0,0,

(http://www.duxburysystems.com/) is the standard in translation software.

There's also http://tech.aph.org/lt/ for a quick, passable solution. 

That said, you can't produce grade 2 braille in a high quality manner without a human braille proofreader who checks the software output. Software makes a lot of guesses as to the correct way to contract text, but it isn't always right. Computer-translated braille is fine for most things, but if the message must be absolutely correct then a human should be verifying the content. 

Depending on her note taker (which is what I assume you mean by braille reader) it may natively support .doc or .pdf files, and display them as either grade 1 braille or as software-converted grade 2 braille. 

Does this student have a braille teacher you can work with? Is her aid an experienced braille user who produces braille for her? Who is generally producing braille materials for her such as textbooks, worksheets, etc on an ongoing basis? If the answer is nobody, that needs to be addressed as you can't be responsible for producing text in a code you don't actually know. What decisions were made to actually *provide* the braille for the student in her IEP? 

(And as someone who teaches multiple blind students, one of the most effective things you could personally do to enable braille instruction in the classroom is to [learn braille yourself,]
(https://nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/fr/fr12/Issue2/f120209.html) and advocate for experienced, effective braille instruction and braille materials for all your blind students.)

I went through high school believing university was the only path to success for a blind person.  I wanted to do computer science, but thanks to a few terrible math teachers, I couldn't get the math marks required for any computer science university in the country.  What I should have done was graduate high school, do MCSE, CCNA, and perhaps work towards math in night school or something.  But instead, I was so convinced that university straight out of high school was the *only* path to success because I was blind, that I wasted thousands of dollars and years of my life doing a different degree I didn't care about and hating every minute.  Also, turns out I don't actually enjoy programming!  The aspects of computers I enjoy tend towards server administration and software deployment.  And you don't need a degree for those things!  So even if I *had* gotten into computer science, my focus on university to the exclusion of everything else would have lead me to spend the rest of my life not enjoying myself.  

Anyway, to make a long story short, university or college are just not required to be successful as a blind person.  To be successful, as a blind person or anyone else, you need to be doing what you love and are passionate about.  Hopefully you can offer your GF some encouragement not to swallow the ""college or failure"" BS.  What does she actually want to do with her life?  Does that thing really need a degree?  College isn't some magical cheat code for life that will bring success or happiness.  I bet that unless she wants to do something super technical (doctor, lawyer, etc) she can do it without the degree.  Also, when she thinks about what she wants to do with her life, it's so important not to fall into the trap of thinking ""Well, I want a job, and these are the sort of jobs blind people usually get"".  Often those of us born blind tend to look to what other blind people have done before us, and think that if they can do it, so can we, so we'd better do one of those things, like it or not!  What we forget is those other blind people were able to do what they did because they loved doing it.  If she's doing what she loves, odds are she'll make it eventually.  Speaking from personal experience, if she just tries to be ""successful"" as a blind person, without regard to her personal feelings, she never will be.  

TL;DR: ""blind people must go to college"" is BS forced down our throats by well-meaning educators, and it's a dangerous lie that caused me to waste years of life and thousands of dollars.",2,,2,0,0,

On the other hand, I picked up my boyfriend's iPhone/iPad, looked up how to enable voiceover, and pretty much figured out how to basically use it in about 15 minutes. I can type quickly, it's easy for me to find what I'm looking for and only activate that thing, and the whole experience is so much better. I'm now faster when intermittently using someone else's iPhone than I am using the Android phones I've owned for 6 or 7 years, and that's pretty damning. 

(And if you have useful vision, the magnifier on the iphone is better too. The zoom ""controller"" makes it similar to using a computer magnifier for faster scanning of long text, and the magnifier is easy to keep consistently open and closed when you want it.)

At many steps throughout this process, I've asked myself ""has Google actually ASKED a blind person what makes sense?"" I'm glad to see that they're asking, and I hope that they can actually hear the answers. ",2,,2,0,0,

Unfortunately, if the DVS was produced by a third party like AMI, they do not provide that DVS to Netflix; so there are still a few shows that had DVS on TV, but have none on Netflix or DVD.  

Also, the new CBC on demand website provides DVS audio for programs where it was aired with DVS, like Dragon's Den, Murdoch Mysteries, etc.  The TVO on demand website does the same thing.

0ce20fc4-3fd6-43af-97c7-4874225ec47e,1473546811,"Some general questions: 

- How are you getting along right now?  Are you getting along alright at school and home? How do you usually communicate? How do you read? Do you travel alone, go grocery shopping, etc? What are you struggling with? I'm asking to get a better idea of where you're at in terms of adjusting to your recent vision loss. 

- What are your hobbies and interests?

Some thoughts:

- Looking at your post history, you talk about how your O&amp;M instructors ""teach you routes you have to take"" and that you feel very uncomfortable in unfamiliar environments. Are you also being taught how to plan trips, orient yourself, gather information, and make corrections when traveling to new places? Do you have a smartphone with GPS that can help you? Are you able to effectively use it with speech, large print, or a braille display? Are you able to ordinarily communicate with people you encounter on the street for directions using speech, a communication device, or a print-braille communication card? Can you work with another O&amp;M instructor if you're not getting all the tools you need or aren't being encouraged with the mindset that with the right skills and training you can live and travel independently?

- Do you sign? If not, there's [groups]
(http://www.ableaustralia.org.au/what-we-do/deafblind-services) that can help you learn Auslan as a deafblind person. Depending on your vision, you might be able to view it normally, view it closer than usual, use a hand to track the other signer, or use fully tactile (hand over hand) sign. I'm not going to lie, there's a pretty big bridge of misinformation to cross with the Deaf community and blindness, but it's only going to happen if people are out there and doing it. There are many Deafness-specific events that would be pretty accessible to you, such as Deaf coffee chats that tend to have a lot of one on one or small group conversations. Since you're a uni student, there might also be a Deaf or Auslan club at your uni with regular social events. Reach out to them and see how you feel about it, if it's not something you've already been involved with. 

- Regarding blind people, the bridge of misinformation goes both ways unfortunately. A lot of blind people view the world as extremely dependent on auditory cues and struggle to relate to those who do not. But this is certainly not all blind people, and it can be overcome. Be assertive about what you need (such as interpreters at events) and be creative about how you accomplish tasks. Do you have an amplifier system that connects to your hearing aids you can use with events or one on one conversations where you give the mic to the speaker? If speech is still difficult, you can use your own phone or laptop (with speech and large print or a braille display) or a braille notetaker to allow a blind person to type to you (using the TTS) and you to be able to read it (using large print, or braille) and reply. 

- Do you read braille? If you haven't, why not? Braille can open up a lot of opportunities not only for in-person communication, but online communication as well, and it'll work for you no matter what your vision or hearing is now and in the future. A braille display can be used for in person communication, for text relay phone calls or TTY calls, reading and writing, and accessing a great deal of the internet (including communities for just about any interest you might have.) 

- Braille also makes a *lot* of games accessible, if you're interested. http://www.64ouncegames.com/ makes a lot of accessibility kits for a ton of different mainstream board and card games, and ships free worldwide. [There's also a braille-adapted scrabble board and tactile chess sets.]
(http://shop.rnib.org.uk/home-and-leisure/leisure/board-games-and-dice.html) There's probably many existing tabletop gaming groups in your area that you could join and bring your own games to, and I find that gaming can really break the ice because you all have something you're there to do together. 

- Braille also makes books accessible, which can also be an ice-breaker for socialization through joining a book club if you like to read. 

- There's an [annual deafblind camp]

Alright, so that's probably way more than what you were looking for, but if you want to know more please do reply and we can chat about what you're interested in, what you'd like to do, and what you're struggling with and see if we can't find some solutions or resources together.

They have a reference point to ground their perception of their appearance to reality - granted they have limited use for this reference point because they have trouble judging what they see in the mirror objectively, but it's still there. 

A person who can't physically see the reflection of their face in the mirror has no objective reference point - they have to trust other people's perceptions of what they look like. People all have different types of looks they find attractive - so you would would not get consistent feedback from others on your physical appearance, and you would have no way of comparing what they see to how you see yourself in the mirror.

Regarding reading, a [video magnifier]
(http://shop.rnib.org.uk/magnification/video-magnifiers/desktop-video-magnifiers.html) may make text easier to read. The RNIB library offers giant print books as well as audio books (and easy beginners braille books, if she is interested in learning.) She can also use a computer, tablet, and so on to read with either large print, text to speech, or audiobooks. Reading is a very easy hobby to get back into after sight loss, and there's likely local book clubs she can attend for a chance to get out as well.

If she likes to watch TV, [audio description]
(http://www.rnib.org.uk/information-everyday-living-home-and-leisure-television-radio-and-film/audio-description) can help.  

Technology wise, an iphone or ipad can be readily used by blind people. If she has trouble with fine control or wishes to see things zoomed up, the ipad or the larger iphone is definitely the way to go. http://www.applevis.com/new-to-ios If you have a device already, you can look up tutorials and get her started using it just by enabling voiceover. 

Some apps that people find especially helpful are: 

[Blindsquare]
(http://blindsquare.com/) which helps you know what you are nearby, look for places, get GPS directions to those places, and so on. 

[Voice Dream Reader]
(https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader-text-to/id496177674?ign-mpt=uo%3D8) Very accessible reader of ebooks. Can't be used with DRM books, but good for everything else. 

[KNFB reader.]
(http://www.knfbreader.com/) This product is nearly a must have if you have trouble reading print. It can be used to read books, mail, signs, menus, so many things. It will read out loud all the text to you and present it in large print. It has features to help guide you to taking a full picture of the text, so you can use it independently. 

On the computer, screenreaders such as [NVDA]
(http://www.nvaccess.org/) (for windows) or [Voiceover]
(http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/) (for mac) can also be used for speech. [Zoomtext]
(http://www.zoomtext.com/products/) is in my opinion the best computer magnifier (windows and mac.) It is simple to get started with. It has very clear text compared to the built in free magnifiers, focus and color enhancements, as well as (in the Reader and Fusion versions) options to read out loud and view at the same time web pages, documents, everything.

Is the reason she is not working purely her sight loss, or the other issues due to the stroke? If she does not have the stamina for full time work now, can she get part time employment? Why not help arrange for some volunteer opportunities for her? There are many things she could do to feel more fulfilled and productive outside the home. If she likes to cook she could help prepare meals for needy people, for example. If she is good with people, she could work at a front desk or answer telephone calls for a nonprofit. 

If she is struggling with depression and with the emotions of having suffered a stroke, therapy and group support can be absolutely life changing. Reach out and help her get those services if she isn't already. 

There are really so many hobbies, activities, and paid or voluntary work that she can still be fully engaged in. It is just a matter of getting the right adaptive skills or tools, addressing her limitations in terms of fatigue, and deciding what she wants to do with her time now.

That is a rough outline. If you have any specific questions or issues I would be happy to try to help. ",4,,4,0,0,

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is pretty fun, although I find the audio description voice to be really annoying. We recently caught all the way up with Bojack horseman, a tremendous series with pretty decent audio description. And of course there's daredevil and Jessica Jones. 

Netflix is getting better at audio description, and I think is more audio describers are getting work from them they are figuring out better and better ways to describe things with more efficiency and detail. Definitely check out making of a murderer to experience audio description and documentary format, something tremendously difficult for all of the information being presented in the show.

As for Narcos season two, I'm really really happy that they finally made the decision to have a female narrator speak over the female subtitle parts. They did not do this in season one, as they only had the audio describer and a male translator voice that spoke over all subtitles, no matter if it was female or male.

Other than that, I mostly judge by the type of people out and about.  If it's a crowded area with lots of families (mixed gender, young children, etc), tourists, and people going about daily life, I feel pretty safe.  If it's a totally quiet area, with absolutely nobody out on the street, I feel slightly less safe, but not really ""in danger"" or anything.  If it's mostly adult people, who seem as though they've been drinking/smoking, or are just hanging around for no reason I can tell, and there's lots of loud music around (especially when it's just blasting from random parked cars), that's when I want out.  To be fair, that last perfectly describes a lot of nightclub districts, block parties, and college towns, that are generally perfectly safe!  However, they're generally places I'd rather not be alone.  In that type of environment, people often don't pay attention to where they're going, making it harder for me to avoid them. Also, the car traffic is generally harder to deal with, because the foot traffic might not be following the street lights (if any), and the general noise in that type of environment can make it hard for me to hear the traffic flow.  So even if I'm in a totally safe college town, I am less safe traveling there. Plus, it can be hard, just by hearing alone, to tell when things get unsafe in that type of environment (bar fights spilling out into the street, etc).  But if I'm with someone, I'm perfectly OK. And if it's somewhere I know well, that's fine, too.  ",4,,4,0,0,
