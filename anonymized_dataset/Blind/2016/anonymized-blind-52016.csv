eaa0af7b-30f0-428b-928d-af4a5d3d24b9,1463597738,"Painting description for the redditers of r/blind:  It is almost a black and white painting of mountains in a snow storm, very stark and expansive.The only color is a hint of blue in the billowing storm clouds and a dark black-green for the pine trees, but it is hard to see the green in the trees for the contrast of white snow they are covered in.The objects that are closer appear crisper and darker and with more color. The objects  fade the farther away they are, so that the mountains in the middle of the canvas, which appear to be the farthest away are little more than a swipe of crisp white paint against the billowing clouds. They are distinguishable  more for their texture than their color.

For those born blind, a description of distance as seen by the sighted (also this is for the sighted, as few but painters and photographers are aware of how this works)… On a clear day there is still air between you and everything.  Air, being mainly made up of nitrogen, scatters light in a blue range.  It actually scatters green, purple and blue, but the net effect is blue, which is why the sky appears blue. If you look directly up on a clear day, the sky is a darker blue at the apex and lighter around the horizon, this is due to the fact that when you look up on a clear day you are actually seeing the dark void of space beyond the reassuring haze of nitrogen blue, and the color combination is a deep blue color.  At sea level there is more nitrogen between you and space, so the color of the sky at sea level is much lighter blue than in the mountains.

Being from the mountains I prefer a high altitude blue sky.  It feels more vibrant, more alive and dangerous, because you can see just how precariously we sit, perched on this small speck of dust, floating in the infinite. A sea-level blue is like a blue for babies, the atmosphere thick and reassuring, like baby’s blanket.

Anyway, around the edges the of the horizon you are actually looking through more nitrogen than when you look up. When you look out across a vast landscape the things that are farther away will actually appear bluer than things that are closer, because there is more nitrogen between you and farther away objects.

However, nitrogen is not the only important gas to consider when painting distance. There is also water vapor. Water vapor scatters white, so in humid places, things in the distance appear whiter, more faded and hazy.

In the painting the subject is a series of mountains. At higher elevations the air is much thinner, so there is less blue fade, however there is also less water vapor, so things appear very crisp even at great distances.

I lived for many years in a very humid part of China. I always remember being shocked by the crispness of the mountains when I would come home. I never really thought about how amazingly crisp they are until I had lived away from them.

This painting is of a winter storm, so the main gas to think about is water vapor. In the painting white swirls across the canvas obscuring the distant range of maintains, making them fuzzy and soft and just barely there, while in the foreground ghostly white aspens throw up their thin branches against the stark contrast of the black-green pines. The overall effect is one of space and distance, as the closer land on each side of the canvas, crisp, and jagged, swoops down and away from you, into a  valley, made soft by its distance from us.  Beyond the valley, in the haze, is the softest whisper of a further range of mountains.

If you enjoyed with description and would like more, just let me know.

In the same way young men get random uncomfortable and unexpected boners, young women get random uncomfortable and unexpected wetness. So knowing if it is menses or vaginal discharge is unclear. However, if she is legally blind, that doesn't mean totally blind. She might be able to check in the bathroom  like anyone else that age.  However, if she is too blind to tell with a little bathroom check, I would probably go with a sniff test (also in the bathroom). Blood smells metallic. Vaginal discharge smells sort of salty, but not metallic. And with the sniff test I can not emphasize enough the importance of washing hands PRIOR to going to the bathroom, as well as afterward. Vaginas are moist places, that are highly prone infection.

Also, maybe get her and her girl friends to sort of look out for each other. Leaking through one's pants is something that could happen to anyone new to menstruating (or even not so new to it).

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1462844732,"I use Google Music exclusively, and would rate it the most accessible of the music apps (Spotify, Deezer, etc).  It works perfectly on Firefox or Chrome with NVDA.  I'm not sure how it works on other screen readers or browsers, because I don't use them.  On IOS, it works almost perfectly, with two major issues.  The first issue is that it can't always scroll propperly through long lists of songs.  Lists of artists and albums, for example in your library or search results, work just fine.  But as soon as you get into a playlist, album, or anywhere else displaying a large list of songs, voiceover will scroll through the first 10 songs just fine, and then jump up to the top of the list.  To get around this, you're going to need to start the first song playing, and then use the next and previous buttons in the player to skip through the list.  The second issue...may not be an issue, per say.  What Google has done, in order to make the player more accessible, is whenever the player screen is open and it transitions to a new song, Google tells Voiceover to focus on the title and artist of the song and read it out.  Yeah, that's kind of a cool feature. But the problem is, if your focus was on, for example, the next button, after the song changes, Google Music has ""helpfully"" changed the item you're focused on back to the title and artist currently playing.  You're now going to need to swipe back over to the next button again.  If you have a headset, this won't bother you at all; just use the next and previous buttons on your headset.  If you don't have a headset with next and previous buttons, the best thing to do if you want to skip through songs quickly is to lock your phone, and then use the next and previous controls on the lock screen.  When you tap next on the lock screen, you stay focused on the next button, so can tap it multiple times quickly.  Useful if you need to play song 36 of an 80 song playlist.

There is one other issue that might affect you, but if you have sighted help for initial set-up, it won't be a problem at all after that.  In order to upload your music into the cloud, you need to download the google music manager.  Unfortunately, that app doesn't work at all well with a screen-reader.  In order to get it working, you'll need a sighted person to install the app, log you in, and point the app to a folder on your computer where you store your music.  But once that set-up has been done, Google Music Manager will watch the folder for any new music you add, and automaticly upload it.  The app even starts at boot.  So just get someone to set it and you can forget it.  If you want to check on how it's doing, you can find it in the system tray and click on it, and NVDA will read the progress (something like ""895 songs uploaded of 1426"").  It hasn't ever broken or had any issues since the first time I set it up, so it's never been touched.  It uploads automaticly, and keeps itself up to date, without needing any input from me.  

To tell you the truth, I actually did set Music Manager up without sighted help, just by randomly banging on it.  I think what I wound up doing was typing my email, pressing tab, pressing enter, typing my password, pressing tab, pressing enter, pressing tab a couple of times, then space, then an accessible ""brows for folder"" thing opened, and I pressed enter on the folder where I keep my music.  But it took me an hour or so of fiddling to get that figured out, because NVDA offers no feedback at all during the sign-in process.  Fortunately, the only thing Music Manager does is upload music. So once it's uploading, you never ever need to touch it.

I personally use a screen-reader (jaws for windows), and I find that it works well for me. Obviously the mouse doesn't play a part in website navigation, hence where arrow keys, and keyboard commands/short cuts come in. This system is generally good for browsing, but there are obviously things that you miss out on: pictures with no description, mostly, though sometimes buttons on webpages are unlabeled as well, which can also provide a disadvantage (tumblr is the epitome of inaccessible and I hate it for that). Also, most people that use screen-readers tend to gradually speed up the speed of the speech so that browsing goes a lot faster than one would think.  

However, I do know some friends that use braille technology hooked up to computers via different formats (bluetooth, usb, etc), and they read webpages as opposed to listening to them. I believe that in cases like these, they use the braille device itself to input text via braille itself (so the idea of 'braille keyboards' themselves isn't really a thing since it's a completely different format), but I'm not entirely sure - as I said, I don't really use this way.  

Also, for people using keyboards in general: most people take it upon themselves to just remember where the keys for whichever letters are, and use touch-typing.  

And as for using things on the go, my screen-reading software is on my laptop, which goes most anywhere with me. However, I also have an iPhone, which - along with many smartphones nowadays - has screen-reading software automatically installed.  

I hope that that is was somewhat? informative. Haha. Let me know if you have any more questions!

267eaf88-3daf-447b-9f7e-e526756784ce,1464370415,"Hey there! I also have RP and can somewhat understand what you are going through: most of the visually impaired community around me are elderly persons and I'm still somewhat young and haven't found a lot of common ground in the local visual impairment groups. There is a small group of younger people that meet the next town over but getting there can be problematic.  

Anyway, I personally wouldn't be upset if someone came up to me while I have my white cane out (was just at a weekend long festival and with drunk people it happened almost constantly!) but it can get weird if the person approaching me has little to say other than pointing out that I'm visually impaired. If you encounter a visually impaired person and think you might have something in common or something interesting to talk about (and you don't get the impression that you'd be bothering them: often times I put in ear buds to avoid people talking to me for example), go for it! Blind people are people too and people are social creatures. I personally love meeting new people. 

Apart from that, I don't know how far along your visual degeneration is or if you've sought out someone to help you get and learn to use a white cane, but I did just that a couple years ago and it was great! Well it's still scary/embarrassing to use my white cane but it's helped a bunch in crowded and dark places. As an added bonus, my orientation and mobility instructor took it upon herself to arrange a meeting between myself and 4-5 other visually impaired people in my area who are all between the ages of 23 and 32. Now we meet about once a month for drinks to see how everyone is doing. 

I'm rambling but: TL:DR - If you have more to say than just ""I noticed you're a blind guy or gal"" and are fairly sure you wouldn't be bothering them, normal people meeting rules should apply! Go meet that lady or gentleman! Also: while I'm sure it's not always the case, an O&amp;M instructor could be a resource for you meeting visually impaired people around your age from your area.

She generally doesn't seek out other blind people and connect with them solely on the basis of their blindness. I think she would be totally willing to talk about her disability and yours, but only in the context of an actual friendship.

I think during your transition you'll want and benefit from meeting blind folks and learning skills and stories from them. But I'm guessing that a lot of blind folks don't want to be defined by their disability, even though it's an essential attribute of their lives.

I think if you meet a blind person that is perfectly fine to introduce yourself, but you might want to focus on the person more than the disability.  If you put in the effort to get to know someone, then you may sort of earn the right and trust to discuss their experience with disability.

But I have to say, I'm answering on behalf of someone else, and this is not my direct, lived experience. I'm mainly relating what has been told to me, and I hope I'm doing justice to my friend's experience. And your experience may be quite different, of course.",1,,1,0,0,

This allows a small development team to focus their energy on story, characters, music, ambiance, game balance, and level design.  They can bring their vision to life without blowing their entire budget on textures and shaders.

A great example of this would be FTP, which is a top-down strategy game where the player controls a spaceship.  Visually, it's very underwhelming; it's low-resolution with almost no textures to speak of.

I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, it's a smartphone, I will probably be changing it out for an iPhone this coming January when I am due for an upgrade because of accessibility issues.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What kind of traffic situations in your daily life frustrate you or do you try to avoid?

&amp;nbsp;

My biggest issue is people not following traffic laws.  I'm not just talking running lights or stop signs (although that is an issue that freaks me out), it's also people freezing up and not going when they are supposed to.  The cane puts drivers in a panic I guess but it ends up causing me a lot of confusion because I was trained to know when it is safe to go without having to depend on visual queues and when people don't do what they are supposed to do assuming that I am going to just walk out it causes much more confusion.  If everyone just stops and goes when they are supposed to it makes my life a lot easier.  I don't avoid anything though, if I want to go somewhere I try not to let things like traffic navigation get in the way, I have had the training I need to do it safely, it's just a matter of executing.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this helps!

I oscillate between feeling like I am running a race with time in which I furiously paint and hustle to find a new direction in life that will be able to support me, and feeling like I am deflating. All the air just escapes. I collapse in a sad heap on my couch and I do anything to not listen to the voices of doom in my head. I play video games, listen to hours upon hours of ASOIAF theories, and drink (or smoke). And when I can't drown out the doom, I cry and go to sleep. 

Some days I wake up and I feel like I am unstoppable, like I am happening to RP. Cause if this is happening it is happening my way, I am going to be in charge, I am going to live my life on my terms. I happen to life! Life doesn't happen to me!

This might sound simple, but blind parents often attach bells to their children to make it easier to hear them when they're running around, like at the park. But the kids don't always like the bells, and they can be uncomfortable if the child falls and lands on the bells (like, an anklet with big jingle bells attached). Design something that's soft and squishy on the outside, easy to put on, loud enough to hear when children are running around, and with a fun design so kids will want to wear it.

I wish I can upload an image, but that would give away too much of where I live. Imagine a 4 way intersection. We come down from the north on the east side of the street, and cross to the south eastern corner. Going the other way, we just go the other way.

All of these streets are technically 2 lane, but the eastern street has a 3 lane ""parking lot"" exit, which makes that crossing 5 lanes wide.

The cars going south from north line up at the northern edge of the eastern street, even though the western street is only 2 lanes, so the corner is much further south.

There are no beepers, and the light is too far for me to see.

A car or two can be driving from south to north, and if I start crossing right as they hit the intersection, a car that's been waiting at the north to turn east may be waiting in the middle of the intersection by the time I hit the south eastern corner.

So, I'm almost certain people frequently run the lights, and the corners are so awkwardly set, it's a nightmare.
