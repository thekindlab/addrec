As /u/0ad6d92c-5ad0-4632-a117-417104738e12 stated, the typical method of guiding someone is allowing them to walk about a half step behind you while holding onto the back of your arm, right above the elbow. This is called ""sighted guide"" or ""human guide"" technique. Here is an article about it: http://www.afb.org/info/friends-and-family/etiquette/being-a-sighted-guide/235 and here is a detailed hand out with pictures explaining how to go about it: http://www.cnib.ca/en/about/Publications/vision-health/Documents/CNIB_STEP_BY_STEP_2012_ENG%20FINAL-s.pdf

I got her a talking microwave, which she loves.  I got her a talking watch, which she loves.  But I've tried a couple of different voice recorders, and she hasn't liked any of them.

One the reasons your post made me laugh is because it's true.  I'm a computer geek, but put me in front of a computer with a blindfold on, and I'm useless.  I've tried voice software, just out of curiosity, but I can't always remember all the commands, and even so, I'm watching the screen to make sure it's doing what I want.

Everyone here has my admiration and respect.

My biggest challenge right now is phone numbers.  She used to be able to remember phone numbers and birthdays for the extended family, out to 3rd and sometimes 4th and 5th cousins.  She was a human smartphone.  Now, not so much.  I've been looking into voice control options on cell phones, but with the demos I've watched and the apps I've tried, there always seems to be some point, somewhere in the process, where a tap on a button is required.

It's frustrating (I'm sure you know), because I remember having voice activated calling in 1999.  The kind you didn't have to train.  Now it's 2016 (Happy New Year!), and voice control is still lacking.

I unfortunately can't give advice on driving myself, I have never gone out for a license/ permit and would not pass the vision test if I tried.  What you should be mostly concerned about is safety.  When you get behind the wheel of a vehicle you are responsible for the safety of yourself, your passengers, other motorists, and pedestrians.  If you don't feel like you can operate a vehicle safely with those responsibilities then you may need to make a really hard reevaluation.  At 12 I was told by my ophthalmologist that driving wasn't going to happen for me which was absolutely soul crushing at the time, but I got over it and moved on.  The flip side is that I know several people who are clinging to their licenses barely and it is extremely unsafe and frankly irresponsible.

&amp;nbsp;

What I would say is go to a new ophthalmologist for a different opinion, but instead of asking ""Is it legal"" ask ""Would it be safe for *me* to drive.""  They may say yes, they may say yes with some restrictions, they may flat out say no.  I think the concern should be about safety, not necessarily legality.

&amp;nbsp;

I won't speculate on whether it is safe for you to do it because I don't you, I'm not an eye care professional, and I'm not a driver.  Like I said, I know a guy who drives with one eye just fine, however an ophthalmologist can give you a professional opinion about whether you should.  This is important because everyone is different so you really need an individualized analysis from a professional.

Some of my apps on both android and apple, they work for android but not for apple. and vice versa. You can't tell me that voice-over is vastly superior when I can't even get the back button to be read aloud to me when I'm in the app store. And, yes, android is much better then it used to be while apple voice-over has slipped dramatically, at least as far as accessability goes. 
I, personally, was misled by apple fanatics about how much voice over reads aloud to me. In fact, quite alot of blind apple users flat-out lied to me when it came to apple being greater then android and game access. 
No matter how much we want it, there is no one is better then another. Frankly, if I were being honest, I'd recommend android for a new blind user before I would apple. Why??? Cost. Plain and simple. For 400 united states dollars I can get the same tablet as the apple one but at half the cost. Some of the same specs in apple phones at 600 can cost someone 150 for android. but I tell people , if you have the money, then get what you want. 
But don't do people the disservice of telling them how wonderful apple is over everything else. Everything has itss ups and downs, and it is going to depend on the person to make that decision for themselves. ",2,,2,0,0,

A great deal of people, visually impaired and not, have difficult with dating and meeting people. I myself am completely blind, and can tell you that this doesn't need to be a barrier. I been travelling as a nomad for a couple years and imagine I meet women through various means once or twice a month or more. It really comes down to how you portray yourself. At risk of being pedantic, go to bars. If you're in a bar, conversations are easy to start and frankly, people don't care about your background or anything else there. If that doesn't appeal to you try meetup groups or local community events. If you're near a waterfront go there, approach people. Walking around the city with your cane and hoping to start conversations is fine, but 80% of those conversations require you to initiate them. If you bump into someone who sounds nice, say hi. Engage them, look for common interests, make them laugh. I think there is a general misconception within the blind community that blindness is the first thing that a girl will notice. In my experience this is rarely true. They might see it, but they don't think about it in that context. And if they do, they are more likely to be curious than repulsed. Indulge their curiosity, be open to questions and have anecdotes that will make her laugh. If the blindness is what you're worried about, make a talking point of it and disarm those fears that she might have. Or for that matter, that you might have. 

And lastly, I actually disagree with one of the other comments. I would actually avoid going to events in which groups of visually impaired people come together looking for other single members. These might work, I wouldn't know. But statistically speaking, if we assume that a girl is looking for someone based on personality or other factors, rather than just some common connection like blindness, then you are cutting out vast amounts of people from your search. Sticking within our own community limits us to those with common backgrounds and doesn't allow us to meet new and interesting cultures and points of view.

I can't do that as easily because it requires pushing a cart.

I didn't do it this year, but I've helped out with Trivia nights for local charities logging scores in Microsoft Excel.  This works well if you have someone who is tallying score cards that knows what is going on with the low vision/ blindness.

I either have to just order groceries online from one of those delivery services (and that can get really expensive), or go with someone.  I feel like with the [recent advances](http://www.cnib.ca/en/news/Pages/20150930-CNIB-install-indoor-navigation.aspx) in technologies for indoor navigation like iBeacon, and things like RFID tags and NFC, it should be possible to create some sort of off-the-shelf grocery shopping app that could integrate directly with the store's inventory management software, and guide blind shoppers to the aisle they need, and tell us what's on the shelf.  But to get that to work, you'd need the involvement of multiple grocery chains; I suspect most of the challenge would be integrating with the systems they already have.  Walmart already knows, in detail, exactly how every store is organized.  The difficulty would be getting them to hand over that info.  But once you've got it, detecting the users location in the store and guiding them to where the products they want are located should be quite manageable.

I have a funny thing with colors.

Foods and drinks taste of colors. Not the colors they usually have physically, but the best way is still by color. So for instance red wines can taste like blues, violet shades, night sky colors (my favorites), some even... Shades of red. White wines usually hace greens, blues, or yellows as their taste.

I used to also organize my itunes years ago by color (years ago when i had functional sight). I would make playlists of music, individual tracks of any kind that remind me of some color. 

Now... I still like colors. And still hate some colors (shades of pink). 
I have no clue what some color names of colors mean, so an approximation works. 
My other half is colorblind - that's so cool. Because sometimes for the daily life purposes it will be enough to know if a color is pretty or not. Like, i have a pair of running shoes neither of us can figure the color of (dark) but they are still pretty shoes :)",1,,1,0,0,

I'd go File&gt;Save then click the config file that's already there, it should read something like zten-US.zxc.  Press save, and confirm the override.  That's always worked for me.  Also I've found that storing a backup of this file somewhere off your computer is super helpful if you have to re-image your machine.  It saves a ton of re-configuring.

&amp;nbsp;

With regards to the Zoomtext keyboard, I have two, and I use neither.  Besides the fact that I just like mechanical keyboards, I have never been able to get the Zoomtext shortcut keys to work.  I can't even remember, but did it come with a driver disc?  If so maybe try that.  I prefer hotkeys but if you want the shortcut key functionality that is probably your best bet.

&amp;nbsp;

I unfortunately can't help so much with the reader.  The reader is just not that great as I think you'll find.  It is indeed very buggy, it freezes, it misses things, it flat out doesn't work sometimes.  I like Zoomtext for magnification and color correction, but the first thing I do when I set up Zoomtext is turn off the reader.  It misses too much to be useful.  If you want a good screen reader I would check out NVDA, it's a lot more advanced than what you'll get with the Zoomtext reader.  It is also free so there is no harm in trying and I think they work well in tandem.

&amp;nbsp;

The last piece is that I totally get the freezing on the screen.  I use two computers right now, a 3 and a half year old Lenovo laptop, and a desktop that has hardware that's about one and half years old.  I find that these issues vary from computer to computer.  So my desktop which is pretty powerful has fewer issues, but my Lenovo will slow down, especially if I'm trying to run some semi-intensive stuff in the background.  It doesn't even take that much to be honest though, I've had Zoomtext crash while working on a particularly large Excel spreadsheet because the system ran out of memory.  My desktop has fewer issues, but they are still there.  I'd talk to your tech consultant and have them check the amount of RAM in your Toshiba.  This is something that can be upgraded easily and inexpensively on most PC laptops and could fix a lot of your problems with freezing.  For reference I have 16 GB in my desktop and 6 in my Lenovo.  Having at least 8ish is probably ideal.  Having a better CPU/ GPU is probably ideal too, but those aren't so easy to upgrade in a laptop and usually straight up impossible.  I think you should be able to run it just fine, but having more RAM might help.  My theory on RAM is completely anecdotal and uncorroborated, but my system with more RAM runs better with my system with less.  Take that however you want.  Sorry if this part wasn't so helpful, it's mostly just me saying that it happens to me as well and that you can kind of sort of make it a little better but ultimately it's still going to be buggy every once in a while, that is just the nature of Zoomtext.

aa5b4781-e117-4c9d-864c-c572c93f7eee,1454200737,"Daredevil is a great show. Unfortunately, due to the previous movie that made Daredevil way too powerful, and his heightened senses, some blind people, a lot actually, dismiss the show as stereotyping blindness. Netflix Daredevil spoilers below, you have been warned.
To be clear, Daredevil is actually blind. He just can't prove it with his supersenses because things that we actually do as blind people he could do, but much better. For example, in the scene where Matt is stitching up Vladmear in order to get him to give up information, there is no way in hell an actual blind person can stand in a room and rattle off the precise number of something in a first aid kit, or even examining his surroundings like he does, amplifying his hearing when he needs to, and the audio changes accordingly for these scenes as well, if you listen closely with headphones on. The ease with which he cauterized his wound is something you wouldn't see a blind person doing either. Sure, he was nervous as he followed the instructions given to him as he was running up against time.
Basically, blind people--probably not a lot of you guys, but a lot in the blind community, are up in arms because Daredevil doesn't act like a blind person should. I'll say this though, as Matt Murdock, he's pretty much on par with us. If Marvel were to honor the requests of blind people to make him like us as far as when he's in costume, they'd have to completely redesign his character, and I don't think those changes would make a very good drama. People need to understand that Daredevil is not to be watched just because the main character is blind. You watch it because the relationships of the characters are dynamic, the show is gritty--this ain't no Ironman or Spiderman, and the villain, in this case Fisk, keeps you on the edge of your seat and really goes all out to make Matt, Foggy and Karen's life a living hell. It's a testament that Netflix has fantastic writers on their payroll and even more fantastic is that the writers write the audio description script.
All that praze for the show aside, I find it disgusting that people overlook what I said above and treat blind people like trash. I bet that guy probably thought blind people were helpless, so he started groping you to try to get you to bed--we all know how these things can end if you let them at parties like that.
That's my two sense on the show and on what I think of people to use the Daredevil character as a way to try to relate to blind people. Stop doing it, because you're taking the positivity out of the show. Look past his blindness if you have to in order to enjoy the show. Stop thinking, ""Oh, that's not how blind people do things"" every time you see something like that on Daredevil. Netflix's Daredevil is possibly the honest form you'll see of the character.

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1452180169,"I live in San Francisco and we have access to to AMC theaters along with two Century theaters. I only went blind two years ago, and my girlfriend and I got really into seeing movies with audio description last year. It's not just AMC, century also has issues every now and then with poor audio description and workers not understanding the difference between hard of hearing and description for the blind. My poor girlfriend has missed the first 10 minutes of a few movies because she takes it upon herself to run out and get customerservice to fix the headset when it doesn't work at the beginning of the film. Happened with interstellar, inside out, Mockingjay part one, and a few others. Thankfully it did not happen when we saw Star Wars, and the headset works beautifully both times we saw it. Really sorry to hear that it didn't work for you.
We definitely got a ton of free guest passes due to all the screw ups, but now we have a few contingencies when we go to the movies. We call ahead to make sure that the projectionist has tested the device in the specific theater that the audio described movie will be playing, and most of the time this ends up with me leaving my phone number for the guest service person to call me back after they check. This so far has never failed for us. The next is to pretty much do what you did, but directly explain the difference between hard of hearing and audio description. It is very unfortunate that they mix this up. I've had a few cases where the device itself just didn't work at all, and to prevent that we have a guest service person come to the theater once it starts with their own headset and check in on us to make sure that it's working.

The memes generators let you change/add/edit the text, but when you publish it, the generators create a new image, now including the text (like a screenshot). There is no way to separate the text from the image. 

The only way to get a screen reader to read a meme is via its ""alt"" attribute. This is in the code. Developers add that code (and it's not mandatory, but a really really good practice) in order to give the visitor an explanation of what the image is in case the path is broken (if the image is deleted from a website, if the path is not written well, etc). This is what screen readers read when they end up on an image. 

After a quick review, imgflip.com, for example, adds the ""alt"" attribute. However, when posting on Facebook (via the link provided on the website), you lose this element. The same thing happens on memegenerator.net. So those meme generators are doing their job, and all the memes can be read on their websites.

The TWBlue program I mentioned previously has 49 keyboard shortcuts, just for working with Twitter.

That way, when she feels herself stepping onto the rug, she knows she's in the living room headed towards the kitchen, not the bedroom.  How is your home laid out?  Blind people can often get turned around in large open spaces.  Could you make it so she can follow objects (a wall, a sofa, etc) between rooms? If she's following a wall, not only will it help her keep going straight and not get turned around, she could also use it for support if she feels the need.  Can you leave the TV on low in the living room, especially when she's alone in the house?  That way, if she hears the sound of the TV, not only can she follow the sound to get to that room, she can also use it to help orient her in the rest of the house (the TV is behind me, so I must be walking towards the front door).  Similarly, consider leaving your bathroom fan running; the sound of the fan will give her a clue about where the bathroom is, and it will help her keep track of what direction she's facing when she's moving around the house.  Those are just some examples.

First off, many blind folks don't have that kind of money up-front, so it strictly limits the market.  Secondly, Apple (and I think Google) doesn't allow app developers to charge for upgrades.  So once all the blind people who can afford the up-front cost have purchased the app, it means no, or almost no, on-going revenue stream for the company to maintain the app and do future R&amp;D.  And that means that eventually the app dies, and I lose the money I spent on it.  Personally, I'd much rather that the KNFB app was a monthly subscription, at say $3 a month.  In the long-run, they get just as much money from me, and perhaps more.

Oh, and as an aside, many organizations have a list of vendors they will purchase products from.  In general, these are dealers in accessible technology (ATGuys and similar).

One interesting contrast was one guy who went into ""complete darkness"" and pretty much forgot everything about what everything looked like. 

Another guy somehow still used his visual cortex and ""imagined"" the entire world around him, to such a high level of functionality that he was confident enough to go up on his roof (I think redoing the shingles or something like that).

Oh my goodness no!  If you're blind, unemployed, don't have a car and can't drive (for obvious reasons), and live in the many many places in North America where public transportation is a joke, the Internet may be the only social life you have.  I'm speaking from one or two years of personal experience, here.  Get up in the morning, grab breakfast and eat it in front of the computer while hanging out on voice chat (teamspeak, team talk, ventrilo, etc), and...pretty much hang out there all day.  Nowhere to go, and no way to get there even if there was somewhere to go.  Almost everything anyone needs can come from Amazon or one of the food delivery services, so just never leaving the house for weeks on end is a perfectly viable option.  Of course, the ""Internet addiction"" started as far back as high school, because nobody talks to the weird blind kid at the back of the class.  So leave school as soon as possible, get the homework done (entirely on the computer), then hang out on IRC talking about nothing until 3 in the morning.  Thankfully, things got much, much better, for me.  Today I'm working and happy.  But then, my job still involves being on the internet 8 hours a day.  And when I'm sad, the Internet is still where I turn for comfort, rather than to the real people in my life.  But today I'm productive, have a social life that involves real people, and can and do frequently spend time offline with family and friends.  So I wouldn't call myself an Internet addict.  

&gt; And finally one last curious question for fun, if I type :), how is it perceived by you?

Depends. The software I'm using right now says ""colon right paren"".  But it is possible to change that with dictionaries that tell the computer how to pronounce things.  I just haven't bothered, though some software does come with those settings by default.  ",2,,2,0,0,

1a8aa46a-0519-4ead-b75a-9a3e5392ba8b,1452882298,"This really depends on how the page and content is constructed. If a brand-new page loads, voiceover will give an audio queue telling us that new content has loaded. If the page stays the same and the content is dynamic, screen readers were generally not automatically start reading changes. And example I have run into about this involves Twitter surveys. Twitter sends out surveys every now and then to its users, and I generally interact with it using the Twitter app on my iPhone using mobile voice over. A question comes up, and if it's a radio button question, as soon as you click an answer the content/question changes to the next one. Voiceover does not automatically start reading the new question, rather it stay silent and you have to swipe or search for the content on the screen with your finger to find an update.
All screen readers have settings that change the way they read web content, whether to start reading a page from the top down as soon as content loads, or giving the user the ability to control it at their own pace. Everyone uses them differently, so there really isn't a universal answer here. And even when it is set this way, it's not always consistent. Survey monkey is a survey system in which the user advances to the next page after answering questions. Most of the time with voiceover, once you hit the next button, the voiceover cursor doesn't immediately jumped to the question on the next page but actually stays focused in that area of the page so the user only here's the next button announced once the new content loads. This as one extra step, making the user jump the voiceover cursor to the top of the page which can get a little annoying after a while.
Ultimately, stay away from JavaScript in your construction, and learn the various navigation commands that each screen reader uses to get around content. The basics of that kind of navigation are very simple and are easy to pick up. Personally, I would also recommend not focusing too much on ChromeVox as it is annoyingly convoluted and an extremely small percentage of people actually use it. I believe the last numbers that came out show that only eight people out of almost 2000 actually used that particular screen reader so I'd focus on voiceover and jaws.",3,,3,0,0,

They broke the ability for screen-reader users to sign into our Google accounts in the Chrome settings months and months ago, and haven't yet fixed it.  There are also tons and tons of other bugs in Chrome, all symptomatic of the fact that google doesn't seem to do any automated accessibility testing on anything, so every update of every Google app on every platform breaks something.  I'll stick to Firefox, where I can depend on the fact that even the Beta's don't usually cause accessibility reversions; it sometimes takes a while for Mozilla to make new features accessible, but once something starts working, you can count on it to keep working.  Every Google update is an adventure in ""what did they fix this time, and what new thing is now broken?""

&amp;nbsp;

A couple things about physical contact.  The first is you would usually offer an elbow and walk about a half pace in front of them, this gives a pulling force.  Pushing isn't so great, although it is generally people's first reaction.  It doesn't sound like you pushed so that's good.  The other thing that goes along with asking, is to ask about physical contact as well.  Some people won't care, but some people, myself included will very much.  I've seen FAQs from organizations that suggest that you should always touch the person on the arm so that they know that you are talking to them which I firmly disagree with.  For me it's a safety thing and while I'm generally pretty relaxed, if someone touches or grabs me with out telling me first or asking my reaction is usually to jerk away and tell the person to leave me alone.  This comes from a few bad experiences with people on public transit so I don't take chances anymore.  Because I can't effectively assess body language or visually interpret a situation I have a very low tolerance for touching without permission.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said, a lot of people really won't care, but those who do really want that respected.  It never hurts to ask :)  Otherwise I think you did a great job.

:-) yes I realized that.

This is my vision.
The ease of use relies on computer that already know what, how, why to do things.
User should be just asked to confirm one option or the other.
No UI should be required to (say) show you tons of folders,
you should say (not type on the keyboard) what you need and why.
Most important: all this high level of automatism should be organized entirely 
by user (and not by Microsoft :-).
I'm sure AI is not central and probably is not required at all.
Few tools, strongly based on audio synthesys and vocal commands.
One not-so-gentle initial learning curve, and then mental discipline.

So I am blind, and around summer 2010 I was graduating in law. We were at the graduation party, which involved some speeches, a dinner, and dancing and getting pretty drunk (at least that was the general script).

This dude that I pretty much never talked to in the whole 5-year degree approaches me and tell me how he really admires me, and how it's amazing a blind guy could finish the degree and so on. By this time I'm a bit annoyed (I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't like to be thought of as a hero for not curling into a ball and dying) but anyway, I'm trying to be polite and so on.

He goes on about how I must be so brave etc etc, and how I'm like Daredevil. He asks me if I know about it and I answer yes, though I'm not incredibly familiar with it (just know that it's a blind lawyer superhero who fights crime). So he get closer and starts rubbing his hands all over me: chest, arms, etc, and telling me how fantastic I am. Then he starts pinching me. I'm like what the fuck is even this, but again, don't want to make a scene, don't want to cause trouble, so I sort of politely ignore it.

For the rest of the night he would approach me every half an hour or so and tell me some of this crap, and touch me all over the place in a way that I found incredibly creepy and inappropriate.

At this point I just laugh at it, but at the time... I was thinking ""fucking sighties, can't they get themselves off some other way?""

Anyway, that's the story. Off-topic for a Daredevil post, but that's the biggest impact Daredevil has had in my life ;-)

But I have one of these, that I take with me when travelling because it's an easy way to carry pills, and make sure I don't forget to take anything while on the go.  Assuming it's like mine, the container for each day has a flat lid on the top, that flips up from front to back, revealing that days pills underneath.  On mine, there are two braille characters on each lid, for some reason. The first is always a braille dot 6, indicating that the next character is capitalized.  Braille doesn't have uppercase and lowercase letters; capitalization is indicated by a different character before the capitalized letter.  The braille dot 6 is followed by the first letter of the weekday in braille.  So perhaps it's the capitalization that's throwing you off?  

Getting out the container as I type this, directly above the braille letter on each lid, the letter is also in raised print.  So it's probably not the same container, because it's just a single letter, not an abbreviation.  Oh well.  It could still be that the braille letters are capitalized, though.

And some Braille Displays can pair with the iPhone by bluetooth.  There's also the [Blaze ET](http://hims-inc.com/product-store/blaze-et-multi-player-with-ocr), that looks like exactly what you're talking about, just with speech not Braille.  Personally, I use the KNFB Reader app on IOS, so I'm not likely to carry around a different device just for reading printed text. Plus, the inclusion of Braille means the battery life will probably be not that good, meaning it'll never be charged and ready to go when I need it.  

But if you can figure out how to make cheap and tiny Braille displays, I don't think you could go wrong making a Braille display case for the iPhone.  IE put the iphone in the case, and then your iPhone has maybe two lines of eight braille cells each, just as though they were built into the iPhone.  Connect it directly to the lightning port, meaning no hastles with bluetooth pairing.  Plus, when I connect the case to the charger, it will recharge itself and recharge my iPhone, meaning I only need to remember to plug in one device, not two.  Yes, it would make the phone a little larger and a little bulkier, but that would be a sacrifice worth making; most people use bluetooth headsets these days anyway, so it isn't like we need to hold the phone up to our faces anymore.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1453860920,"&gt; What are your biggest issues with organizing around the house?

For me, it's mostly absent mindedness.  For example, if I'm carrying an object, let's use a tea cup as an example, to be put away in the cupboard, and the phone (or doorbell or whatever) rings, I tend to put the cup down somewhere convenient (a countertop, a table, whatever), and run and answer the phone.  After I'm done talking for 5 or 10 minutes on the phone, I now have no idea where on earth I put the cup!  That's assuming I even remember what I was doing before the phone rang, in the first place.  If you can see, you'd probably glance over the kitchen, and notice the out-of-place tea cup on the counter. But for me, I won't even notice it, until the next time I happen to touch it by chance.  And if I put it down somewhere out of the way, who knows how long that could be?  Unfortunately, I don't think any technology can really solve that problem.  The only thing I can really do is better train myself that the answering machine can take the call, or the person at the door is just going to have to wait, until I finish what I was doing.  Because ""out of sight, out of mind"", and anything I'm not touching is pretty much out of sight, for me.  I actually have a similar problem when I have people over.  A friend of mine once finished his drink, and put the empty bottle up on the TV stand next to the TV, for reasons...I still don't entirely understand.  I guess it was just a convenient place to put it down, and he figured I'd grab it later.  Well, obviously, I didn't see it there, so the empty bottle stayed right next to the TV for something like a week, until I happened to touch it when I was doing something else in that area.  Again though, I don't think that's something technology can solve.  These days, I just make it a habit to dust the day after I have company, because in the course of dusting I'll find any misplaced or forgotten objects.  

&gt; What are your favorite organizing products?

These days, I find myself using the KNFB Reader app for IOS quite a lot, because it frees me from having to label every single can or box in the cupboard. And that saves me time, and money that I would otherwise spend on a labelling system of some sort.  Unfortunately, while It's accurate enough that I can tell what something is, it almost always misreads expiry dates and cooking instructions and the like.  Apparently, there are ways to look up items based on UPC barcode, and get that information. But barcode scanners tend to be yet another bit of hardware I have to carry around (like the I.D Mate or whatever), and...I think you have to put the scanned barcode into some site on the computer?  Any barcode scanner I ever tried was just too much hassle to be worth it.  So there could be a product there, maybe.  

&gt; Are there any clothing organizing tips you would recommend?

Buy clothing that all matches when you can.  If you must buy a few oddball items for whatever reason, make sure they feel so different that you won't put them on by mistake.  But then, I'm not someone who cares about fashion at all; I'm perfectly happy with a closet full of nearly identical shirts.  I know there are many many blind people who do care about being fashionable, I'm just not one of them.  

&gt; If you are in school, what items do you bring daily?

I'm not. When I was, several years ago, I brought a laptop, headset, cell phone, and cane.

&gt; What issues do you face with mobility and bringing your tools and devices for school/work?

I often feel unsafe carrying a laptop at night on public transit, so feel like I have to spend extra money I might not always have on a cab.  But that might just be me being a little paranoid rather than an actual issue.  Though I do know 2 or 3 blind people who have had equipment stolen while riding/waiting for the bus.

&gt; What methods do you use to identify different types of clothes?

Texture.  Most of my clothes are so similar that it doesn't matter, and the few different items I can identify by feel.  I find making sure I got any stains out in the laundry to be more challenging than identifying clothes.  I usually manage it, though.  But there have been times when I just had no idea that I'd gotten a stain on my clothing somehow, until someone let me know.  

&gt; Do you live with a spouse, friend, roommate, or parent who assists you?

Sort of. I share the house with my parents, one of whom is also completely blind.  But I have my own bedroom/bathroom/living/cooking area and pay rent.

I have it all set up, from the gloves I wear so that I don't get sick from touching a poll that everyone in the city has touched, to my bag which has only one way to get into it so that it would be very difficult to steal from without me noticing, to my jacket with pockets that hold all of my gear.  I have a mobility GPS, spare canes, basically everything I need to make sure that if something goes wrong (like a cane breaking or loss of orientation) that I can get home safely.  I've put ungodly amounts of time and effort into perfecting this system and I am now pretty efficient.  I have memorized light rail platforms, I know where the first car in the train will stop... Basically I know what I'm doing and I am really happy about this because it lets me be a super independent traveler.

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason that I have yet to figure out people see me traveling alone and automatically assume that I need help.  This assumption in and of itself doesn't bug me, but it is the physical contact that people seem to think is okay that drives me up the wall.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll give an example, a few months back I was riding the rail system home.  I heard the train approaching I was walking towards the spot where the front most door opens on the platform.  I always get in the same door so that when I exit on the destination platform I know exactly where I am.  Some dude, just grabs me, by my cane arm and drags me into the second car.  Not a word of warning, no request, he just did it.  It threw off my orientation, freaked me out (I don't know who this guy is), and frankly it was insulting that he assumed I wasn't capable of handling boarding a train by myself.

&amp;nbsp;

This is of course one of the more egregious examples of what people do, but it happens to me often on smaller levels.  I'll be crossing a street and someone will grab my arm and help me across.  I don't need it and I don't want it, but no one takes the time to ask first.

&amp;nbsp;

I am grateful to the people who ask if I need help, I think it's super cool that people are willing to go out of their way to help a stranger.  However, if I ride transit 5 days a week I can usually expect to get grabbed or touched without permission at least once.  By anyone's standards this is unacceptable, and it's the reason that I'm getting more and more defensive when people touch me, I honestly don't know who they are or what their intentions are and I am completely unwilling to risk anything based on the possibility that they are just trying to be helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm moving in a few months and I'm hoping the new place won't have as many people doing this.  ",1,,1,0,0,

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1453347192,"Eh flaming isn't really my thing :)  It's good to get different opinions and insights, especially from someone within app development.  The problem is that it ends up being a lose, lose situation for everyone involved when these things are so expensive.  For those that have access to state funding and non-profits, getting technology isn't so hard, it's super easy to request that an organization with funds set aside for this to fork over thousands of dollars for technology.  Unfortunately there are a lot of people without support systems to help, I was just commenting in another thread about that very problem.  This means that the blind individual has to go without the tools necessary to function and the company doesn't get anything.

&amp;nbsp;

I do get that it is a niche market and that companies have overhead.  I bet it's like this wheelchairs, FM loops for the deaf, and really any other product for those with disabilities, but I go through some of the prices on different products and I can't help but think there has to be some kind of middle ground.  I do like what /u/6b71e46e-9c9c-43d9-bb9e-90dfc13ffcd9 said about a monthly subscription, that feels like a good first step that keeps technology within reach of those who don't have all of the support they need while making sure companies are getting paid.  However I don't think it's a perfect solution, I for one don't like paying for subscriptions, and I know I'm not alone.  I think a lot more thought has to go into this and it starts with better support systems for the blind and visually impaired community, but I think that the manufacturers and developers are also going to have to make a concerted effort to try to make their prices more reasonable.  NVaccess is able to maintain one of the most respected screen readers for free, and I'm not saying that's a viable option for every company, but it is something to be considered when talking about the state of inflated prices in the blind/ low vision technology market.",2,,2,0,0,

Some of these companies charge higher prices because the needs of the market are really unique.

If a website is well done, and the developer is not using bypasses, a screen reader should be able to go through the page chronologically without missing something. However, mostly for design purposes, developers are willing to use shortcuts in order to give the client what they asked for. That said, it might explain why some texts can't be read. If the text is not behind read, it might be a question of tabindex, which is, like I said, in the code. Outsiders can't change that code... it has to be done by the programmers behind it.
