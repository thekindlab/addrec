Tap tap see takes a photo and provides it to the Amazon Turk interface, where someone out there quickly writes an image description and sends it straight back to you.

Whoops, didn't see this right away. Well, I do have an excuse for that.

&gt;It has forced him into retirement, and my mother has to drive him around everywhere. 

This is your ticket to paradise. The Department of Rehabilitation. 

Since he is not understanding what he is seeing, he can still be retrained to do something, which will empower him and be almost like training someone that is profoundly blind. 

DOR has been wonderful for me. They referred me to all kinds of training programs that provided orientation, mobility and travel training along with technology.

I got life skills training training and it's been invaluable. Since I am in their retraining program, they provide a lot of the equipment that I needed to get up to speed. 

New Jersey has a Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired. That and the Braille Institute are your shoehorns to get into the programs. Even if you do not think you want to work (which will limit what they will provide), there is a lot of training for life skills available. How to get around, how to cook, how to clean. 

What getting into a program will do for your dad, is show him that there is not only hope, but support. A lot of the places offer group discussions weekly, so that he knows that there are other people going through the same thing. I went from being suicidal to adapting reasonably well (I am still pissed off). 

All of my trainers have been visually impaired and super inspirational to me with regards to the effort that I put into learning new skills. 

You can get different sized silicone buttons to attach to remotes (or in my case, your home keys). There is a fabulous Infila needle threader. I have braille and audible kitchen tools. 

I would take a look at [MaxiAids website](https://www.maxiaids.com/). You will find a lot of cheap and simple products that are super helpful there. Talking watches, silicone bumps, writing guides, canes. You don't have to buy them, you can just figure out what they do and compare it with what you might need. 

I can't recommend cane/mobility/orientation/travel training highly enough. Realizing that you can be independent will be a revelation to him. It will lift his level of frustration and buoy his mood. 

I made a call to my tech trainers at Blindness Support Services to get info on what readers are best for the less tech savvy among us. Since they see a variety of clients, they will know. They will give me a call back later and I can tell you what the recommend.

db15b614-4c83-42fd-804c-702320519d44,1479451565,"&gt; My first idea was to have poles at certain places around the university that would act as a directory for particularly new students to help find their way around campus. You would approach it and it would tell you where you are and give you directions to the near by buildings. I'm not entirely sure if it would actually be helpful at

You could do something like this with [iBeacons](http://www.ibeacon.com/what-is-ibeacon-a-guide-to-beacons/) and a custom mobile app with info about what's around campus. There are many places this would be helpful (airports! please!), and while most people will learn their way around a university campus pretty quickly, it would help folks who are new to campus or who just somehow get turned around. 

&gt; My second idea was to instal different texture patterns on the sidewalks to help indicate various locations or obstacles. Like if you are approaching a cross walk or nearing any other place were extra caution is required. An issue with this is I don't know how well people would be able to feel it under there feet.

Many other countries do this a lot more extensively than we tend to in the United Sates, but to an extent in the US, it's [required by law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving#United_States) so your campus should already have some tactile pavement in areas where warning people with visual impairments is particularly important. If they don't, then this is certainly something they need to work on in order to be compliant with the ADA. 

&gt; The last idea I have is install something like haptic vibration machines in certain places, like coming up to a sidewalk. This one hasn't been thought out as much.

I don't think this is as practical/useful, particularly in crowded areas. An alternative may be to use the iBeacons mentioned above and have the app vibrate the user's mobile device, so it's available if people want it and individual to them. 

My biggest problem as someone who's visually impaired with low visual acuity, no depth perception, and a very limited visual field is walking into things like low-hanging street signs that stick out over a sidewalk, low hanging branches, etc. Canes are great for finding obstacles low to the ground, but obstacles at head height can be problematic. 

I also see (or, you know... don't see, because blind) a lot of steps along sidewalks, particularly on our college campus, that could really use some contrasting/textured strip along the front edge of the step. This would make both cane travel and seeing them with low vision much easier. ",,,2,0,0,

**Science**

[Science Vs](https://gimletmedia.com/show/science-vs/)  What does science have to say on a particular subject.  They just recently did one on Forensic Science which you would probably be interested in.

[We Have Concerns](http://wehaveconcerns.com/) A Comedy/Science podcast.  The hosts take a science story as a starting point and do improv.  Short 20 minute episodes.

**Science Fiction**

[The Black Tapes](http://theblacktapespodcast.com/) This was sold to me as Serial meets The X Files.  

[The Message](http://themessagepodcast.com/)  Only one season not ongoing, but a pretty good story.

[Homecoming](https://gimletmedia.com/show/homecoming/)  I haven't listened yet but from the description: ""A new psychological thriller from Gimlet Media, starring Catherine Keener, Oscar Isaac, and David Schwimmer.""

**True Crime**

[Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one) I'm sure you heard this one, but just in case.

[My Favorite Murder](http://www.feralaudio.com/show/my-favorite-murder/)  Two comedians talk about true crime.  The tone is more about like telling your friends a true crime story rather than it being presented dramatically, but you might like it.

[Someone Knows Something](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/sks)  Each season is about a different cold case.  Season 2 just started.

[Stranglers](http://www.earwolf.com/show/stranglers/) Show about the Boston Strangler

[Crimetown](https://gimletmedia.com/show/crimetown/) Producers of The Jinx on HBO (which you absolutely should watch) bring a show about organized crime in Providence, Rhode Island.

I could go on about how great she is (and she is!), but the main thing for you to know is that blind people have just as much inner life as anyone else in this world. My girl is creative, funny, sexy, smart, thoughtful, introspective, sassy, affectionate, and quite capable of getting what she wants out of this world.  

I've found that her blindness is often *relevant*, but rarely much of a limitation. Of course there are things she doesn't want to do, but there's so much else in the world that we can do, that it doesn't feel limiting.

Every blind person is different, of course. Pay attention to the specific person in front of you, and what her needs and desires and preferences are. But don't write her off just because she's blind. You could be missing out on so much.",,,1,0,0,

Another thing to add, vision loss from glaucoma has no pain (depending on the form of glaucoma. Closed angle causes extreme pain and is counted as a medical emergency). So visit your doctor regularly and have them check the pressure and do the fields test as necessary.

One more important thing, too. Over time, some forms of glaucoma meds can cause cataracts, which would cause a different kind of vision loss. However, cataract surgery is generally fairly safe. You will want to talk to your doctor about that and discuss when that surgery may be needed (that generally takes a fair number of years to form, though)

956626d1-649a-41bc-990e-06ac1faf0297,1478723141,"I went to vote at the registrars office and it was packed. I had tried to go and early vote at the mall with a group from Blindness Support Services, but the group voting never materialized. I will be on that organizing next time to make sure that it goes off without a hitch. 

I had to vote early at the main office, because the local precinct is not available by public transport and it an hour and 15 minute walk each way in areas with no sidewalks. This is something that I complained about vociferously since before the primary to the registrar's office. To my state representatives, my county supervisors and my congressman and my senator. To no avail. 

The location had really bothered me when I had gone before, because there are a lot of disabled people riding the busses from the downtown terminal here. This location makes it difficult for everyone in a rather large downtown area to vote on election day. 

The registrar's office, they finally added a bus stop reasonably close to it after my literally months of bitching. I only had to walk 1/4 mile each way from the stop to the office. Not ideal, but manageable. The bus ride was about an hour and 15 minutes each way but the bus drivers here are sort of awesome and the driver pointed me in the right direction. Nice, nice drivers here... most of them. 

The security force in the parking area was great and led me politely to the line. There were a lot of workers around to help direct me places and the people in line are always helpful.

However, the sorting rubric inside was not particularly fabulous. I had to check in at a series of windows that were hard to hear through. They gave me a queue number that they didn't bother to tell me what it actually was, and a slip of paper to fill out that I couldn't see to fill out. No large print options or anyone to help me fill it out. I had to drag out my Smartlux magnifier to do it. 

Luckily for me, I get handicapped access for the speaking machines to vote so I didn't have to wait all that long. The people working the machines were super helpful about directing me in and out of the area. They were happy to hook up my earphones for the audible and explain how they worked. 

My bigger problem was in actually getting to the precinct from the bus. 

As I was walking towards the precinct with my *white cane,* some strange man grabs me by the sweater and starts yelling at me to take a flyer from him. I repeat... **I am walking with a white cane.** When I begin to consider whacking him with the cane, because frankly I was freaked out, I pointed out that the flyers would need to be in braille.

He would not let go of me. He was trying to put a flyer into my sweater pockets, shove it into my purse, and actually yelling at me. 

He actually frightened the nice Hispanic man that was walking with me while chatting with me and patiently tolerating my abominable, broken Spanish and making sure that I got to the actual office. 

He was trying to get the man to let go of me and was polite to a fault. He ran and got two of the parking security people. It took 2 security workers to get him to leave me alone, who called the sheriff and the cops hauled him away shortly thereafter, while I was waiting in line outside the building to the cheering joy of others in line that had witnessed it.

He was yelling ""Vote for Trump.""

When I began mobility and orientation training, I had more vision and I spent a lot of time blindfolded with my travel trainer. I still find the way people leap out of the way of the cane when I am walking sort of startling, because I can't see them until they hit the periphery.  

I went back for a refresher recently... and found out that I wasn't sweeping far enough over the the right, which explains why I have walked into so many poles. I leave my cane lower now, so I do not have obstacles which turned out to be my breasts. 

You do get a lot of first class treatment, but I am not quite sure if it's respect or fear that they will get hit. ",,,2,0,0,

Nothing in the interface is telling me which camera I have turn on or if the flash is on or off. The controls you exposed are just buttons with no VoiceOver toggle states telling me what I have selected.

The text and overall presentation of the image scan is all one chunk of text. This should be broken up so it's easier to navigate with the line Road or selection. There currently doesn't seem to be a way to save the results, meaning I have to use another charge and take another picture if I need to go back to something I've done previously.

One definite problem with the function of the charges is that since I am blind, I will be prone to making photographic mistakes and may end up wasting a bunch trying to get the information I'm looking for. Perhaps I forgot that I don't have a light on and struggle wasting charges in the dark. If possible, exposing more of the iOS camera description features that happen while you are pointing and aiming your camera would be nice. Potentially use some form of recognition to see if the image is super blurry or way too dark before processing a charge?",,,1,0,0,

My genetics came back and it looks like like it is just a recessive type for me. Still waiting to discuss it with the geneticist.. but anyway... I digress.

What is up with using your real name? Maybe it's because I am a girl and super paranoid about stalkers and murder and stuff, but geeze! That was a lot of details.  Anyway, I go by Claudette Monet.. after Claude, who was a painter who almost went blind. I am a painter and I am hoping that I too will only almost go blind... I am an American... I now live in the country of America.. tho I was previously an expat in China.. I speak Mandarin. So that's the abbreviated intro to me. 

As to finding a way to not freak out about the future.. idk I think those who are blind from birth have it easier in a lot of ways. There isn't  the same sense of loss and mourning, nothing new they have to adapt to. I am not just saying this. Fastfinge is blind from birth. We've  had this convo before. :)

So, as to what you are looking for in your post... Killerlag pointed out some very good things in terms of  finding resources and mentors and finding ways to adapt. She is pretty awesome sauce. And if you every have a specific how to do a thing question, someone will always come up with an answer if you post here. It can also be a VI question, not strictly for blind issues.

I also picked up on a desire for some emotional  support.  That's about all I have to offer. I am not blind yet. I vaguely know about resources.. but don't  really need to start adapting yet...I mean I tried to but the peeps there turned me away with a shrug...not much to do yet.

Anyway, the people I have found (I mean apart from everyone on this awesome sub) have been John Hull and Ryan Knighton. John Hull is very somber and thoughtful. So if that's the mood you are in, look up some stuff on him/by him. (That short film that won a bunch of stuff this year, Notes on Blindness, the audio was John Hulls audio diary)  If you need something more lighthearted, Ryan is your man. There was also a talk between John Hull and this other blind guy, Zeigler maybe?  It was a very good talk. Both men lost their sight and had very different approaches in terms of how they moved forward with their lives. I think it was on NPR. 

Hope that helps. Don't  be a stranger. And as Red Green says, I'm  pullin' for ya.

depends on how you define reasonably priced.  I'm just not feeling the need for something like this in my life right now.

I agree with you on having more features for the camera. I have a personal belief that less is more when it comes to making a product so I take all the considerations about a feature very carefully. This is also v1. With your guys' feedback, I'll build a v2.

I'm definitely thinking about removing the object recognition out or at least make it toggle-able, so that people don't have to hear unnecessary information all the time. However, the technology will improve over time, hence the term 'machine learning'.

I wanted to ask you about the text interaction. Like Marconius said, do you also think it would be useful to have an interactive text box with all the text in it?

So far,  the two most important things are having written text that you can read with voiceover. And having more enhanced camera features.

They can get contacts in nearly any color and they also sell sunglasses they can let you try both with and without the tinted contacts.     
     
I bought two pairs of contacts (one with prescription and one without so I could go ""monovision"" but still have the tint in each eye) and two pairs of sunglasses.      
     
The tinted lenses do make your eyes look a little weird, especially if they are naturally a light color like mine (sky blue).     
     
On the negative side, they are not cheap. By the time it was all said and done eye exam, two pairs of contacts and two pairs of sunglasses I spent about $3,000. I used the contacts for a while but then stopped for a couple of reasons.     
     
1) I had trouble in low light conditions. I know that seems like a small thing, but when you are naturally more attuned to low light for most of your life, going out at night gets a little scary. It's fine if you can plan on taking them out. Not so much if it was light when you went to work and dark when you leave.     
     
2) They are not terribly comfortable. I wear the AccuView 2  lenses normally and don't ever even feel them. The tinted lenses are okay at first, but as the day wears on they get increasingly less comfortable. By the end of the day they feel ""gritty"" and I noticed that even though I would take them out before bed, I expirienced some pretty severe eye dryness in the mornings which only made it harder and harder to want to keep wearing them every day. I kept up with the regimented cleaning schedule, but the problem persisted.     
      
I still have the sunglasses, but I really only wear the contacts if I am going to be out all day in the sun.

* is he reading a lot of books? Audio books are nearly as good. At the very least they offer the same ability to flee into the authors fantasy.

* is he keen on keeping track of time? Make sure that there is at least one chiming clock in the house so that he can somewhat keep track himself.

* newspapers are often available as audio files as a special subscription. If he usually spends an hour and a half in the morning reading the paper, he can just as well spend an hour and a half listening to the news.

* if he enjoys gardening, he still can. Within reason, of course. It's hard when you can't *see* the result but have to *feel* it instead. The trick is to find the plants that offer a rewarding smell from the blossoms, or the berries that he will pursue for the taste. Or apple trees. Because, hey, apple pie.

* if he is embracing technology it's probably a lot easier. There is screen reading software for both smartphones and computers, and if he is somewhat familiar with either already it's a lot easier to start there and let him adapt to the new way to use it than if he is to start from nothing and make use of the new technology.

* some sports are so much about technique that you can still do them despite not seeing a thing. Golf and boule comes to mind; if you have a pretty flawless technique and a sighted partner able to tell you what to do, you can probably get by anyway.

* some sports, like airgun target shooting, instead offer a special technical aid so that you depend on your hearing instead of your eyes.

* most of the classical board games like chess and so can be played just as well despite not seeing the board. If he is already good enough at it to enjoy playing, he might also enjoy the challenge of memorising the board and all the pieces.


My point is that the first question you should ask yourself is what he is usually doing during the day, and the second thing you should ask is *""alright, how can he still do that in the same or a similar way so that he is not forced to forfeit a hobby he enjoys?""*",,,2,0,0,

1) Find a good glaucoma Specialist.  We mean a really good one.  You want to build a relationship with this doctor because you will be seeing this person much in the future.  If you don't feel comfortable with this doctor we recommend finding another.  This doctor will be the person that you trust with your sight for now on.  You need to be able to trust them.  

2) Take your meds.  You're aiming to preserve as much vision as you can.  You'll most likely be on a few eyedrops and a pill.  Take these on a religious-like schedule.  Don't skip, but if you do forget (we all do from time to time) then just make sure to pick it back up on your next time that you're supposed to take them.  

3) Connect with your state agencies.  It depends on your state though.  Some states will have more resources that can help you with your disability.  We moved to Washington a year and a half ago and it's better compared to where we used to live back down in Tennessee.  Most states will have the services for the blind under a larger service, such as DHS (Department of Human Services), while Washington has its own department known as DSB, the Department of Services for the Blind.  Depending on the state once again, they can potentially also help you learn how to maneuver with a cane and even teach you how to cook.  

4) Try to connect to other people that are going through similar situations.  Not everyone has the same level of vision loss, but we can all relate to not recognizing a face, but you can hear a familiar voice.  This will help you gain more advice, tips, potential resources, and the best thing yet... friends.  Just like any other person, we need other people in our lives.  There's the National Federation for the Blind and the American Federation for the Blind if you want additional tips and potential help.  We're not too familiar on those two though to be honest.  

5) If you're in school then get in contact with your college's disability service.  They will provide you with accommodations and assistance.   

6) This is important.  Don't let people coddle you.  Don't let people get you down.  People will underestimate you.  People will discourage you from doing things in life, but don't let them get you down.  

We hope some of these help, and if we think of anything else we'll try to post more.  Good luck.",,,5,0,0,

&gt; Over the last 24 hours, influential Republicans in both the Senate and the House sent letters to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler essentially telling him to cease work on the remaining big-ticket items on his agenda.

&gt; Tech policy experts expect Trump&amp;#039;s FCC to be much more sympathetic to the views and wishes of cable and phone giants like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T. Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, whose name has been circulated among tech policy insiders as a potential candidate for the top job, has been an outspoken critic of the agency&amp;#039;s proposed set-top box reform.

&gt; Trump, who has lashed out on Twitter against net neutrality, the principle that all internet content should be equally accessible to consumers, is expected to work with the Republican-controlled Congress to install FCC officials who will seek to dismantle current US rules safeguarding net neutrality.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1478047985,"This afternoon I spent my 10 free shots evaluating this app, as compared to The KNFB Reader. I didn't compare it with TapTapSee, because I don't use that app; I'm not comfortable with pictures I take getting sent to random humans to be described.  While the results may be better, I value my privacy more than I value the best results.  

First off, two features that The KNFB Reader (KNFB for short) has that Eye of Providence (EoP for short) does not are tilt guidance and field of view report.  In order to keep the evaluation fair, I turned off these features most of the time while comparing KNFB and EoP.  This is a huge deal because, for whatever reason, I am the worlds worst photographer.  I find it challenging to hold my phone straight and steady, and other than ""kinda...hold the phone a little bit above the thingy..."" I really have no concept of what gets in any given photo, or how focus works, or anything like that.  When using KNFB, I generally just press field of view while moving the phone vaguely at random, until it tells me all four edges are visible.  With EoP, I can't do that, and I really expected this to be a huge issue.  But read on!  

I started by taking pictures in low light conditions.  Well...that's a really fancy way of saying ""I was in a dark room and forgot to turn the light on before starting this review.""  I did warn you that I'm pretty terrible at all things camera related!  KNFB was able to recognize some text anyway, though it was less accurate than if I'd had the light on.  EoP, on the other hand, just said all my photos were about ""lense flare"".  I had the flash in KNFB set to ""auto"", so I assume that's why.  It would be nice if EoP could detect low light conditions and use flash as well, or if not, at least notify me if the photos were too dark to be useful.  Especially when each shot I take costs money, though an admittedly tiny amount, it'd be nice if at least some sanity checking could be done on the device, to make sure what's about to be sent to the API actually might contain something useful.  I also need to note that in order to get text that was accurate enough to be helpful with KNFB, I had to re-enable tilt guidance and field of view report.  In low light conditions with these features off, I couldn't get KNFB to detect any text at all.  

But it's when I turned the light on that the counter-intuitive magic began happening!  I started off by taking a picture of a warranty card for some turtle beach wireless headphones.  On my first shot, EoP recognized all the text, including the web address required to register the product, nearly perfectly.  In KNFB, without tilt guidance and field of view reports, I was able to get some mangled text, but even after multiple tries, I couldn't get accurate enough recognition to be used if I had actually wanted to register my product.  Once I re-enabled those features in KNFB, I was able to get accuracy that matched EoP.  But of course, this meant my usual method of taking 2 or 3 shots to get field of view right, and being extremely delicate in keeping the phone perfectly level.  This already makes EoP an order of magnitude faster for recognizing text, for me.  However, to add to that, EoP is quicker at uploading the photo and getting the results back from Google, than KNFB is at doing OCR directly on my IPhone6.  This might not be the case for newer phones, though.  

Another object I tried was the back of one of those small, slightly rounded containers that water flavouring additives come in. The idea is you squeeze it once into your bottle of water, for flavour.  This has always been a weakness of KNFB, at least for me. I have huge problems getting it to recognize small print, on rounded or curved surfaces.  EoP was able to read most of the nutritional information, on the first shot.  No matter what I did, tilt guidance and field of view or not, I couldn't get KNFB to recognize any text at all.  It's a really tiny bottle, about half the size of my palm, so it could be that I wasn't getting it framed properly.  But that didn't seem to matter to EoP.  

Lastly, I compared results on a plaque for an award that I won years ago.  Again, EoP got all of the text, on the first try.  KNFB without tilt guidance or field of view reports, was able to get quite a bit of the text, but with several mistakes.  Using those features, of course, I was able to get equivalent results. Though again, the fiddling meant it took much longer to get usable results with KNFB.

The next surprising thing was object identification.  Based on Google's tech demos, I expected that this would be really impressive, and a major win for EoP, seeing as KNFB doesn't have this feature at all.  However, disappointingly, it wasn't.  It was completely useless.  It identified a can of deodorant as a computer mouse.  When I took a picture of my bluetooth keyboard, it read back the text on it (""Logitech K-10 Wireless Keyboard""), and then proceeded to identify it as a laptop.  Even though it could read the nutritional information of the flavouring bottle, it still thought the important thing in that picture was my floor.  Apparently most people just have random information about calorie and fat content written on the floor, I dunno.  Sadly, this feature could be removed entirely, without making the app any less useful.  If this would make the text recognition cheaper, I'd be all for it.  As it is, might as well leave it in if we're already paying for it.  But it really is useless.  

Unlike what /u/4bea6c51-f5af-404d-b740-cc0d60ccd023 said, though, I did find the colour recognition useful.  I know the colour of my floor and bed, and it was right about both of those things. I've tried colour identification apps in the past that can't even manage that much!  

However, all of the other issues /u/4bea6c51-f5af-404d-b740-cc0d60ccd023 mentioned are right on the nose.  In the case of the warranty card example from above, if I'd wanted to register my product, I'd have had to replay the text multiple times, until I'd typed the included web address into my computer.  What I'd like is the text displayed on-screen, so I can review parts of it character by character with VoiceOver, or copy it to the clipboard.  What would also be nice is a ""share"" button that would open up the share sheet, and let me send the recognized text to other apps.  That way, I could email the recognized text to myself, and open the email on the computer to click the link.  

TL;DR: EoP is faster and more accurate at text recognition if you find KNFB fussy about not tilting your phone, and you need to try multiple times to get the object you want to recognize perfectly in frame.  If that isn't an issue for you, they're equally good.  The other features the app offers aren't compelling enough to make it ""better"" than KNFB.  I might be switching to EoP myself, but YMMV.",,,1,0,0,

Thanks for the review. I worked on a couple things today:

1. Better button state notification with VoiceOver. When you 'hover' with VoiceOver, it should tell you the flash mode and what camera you are using.
2. I split out the text with breaks.
3. I put a brightness detector on the app. So when it's too dark and user takes a photo, it will now prevent you from taking a photo until luminosity levels are at a good point.

In regards to camera blur, the app does the job of focusing for you. It will not take a photo until focus is at a good point for most cases. But if you are intentionally making it blurry by, for instance, shaking the phone, it will take a photo after a second or so when it gives up on focus. Unfortunately, users will have to trust that this is the case and that the app is doing what it can to control focus and blur. Of course, users will have to do their best to keep their cameras still.

The update should be out in a couple days (smiley face)

Cheers and thanks for the great feedback,",,,1,0,0,

Browsing on Nintendo's official site -you CAN use the d-pad to ride Pokemon- which came out in Pokemon X/Y but this time seems to be better, as you can ride any Pokemon, not just those you have in your team, in certain places...

&gt; Essentially, you can call forth various Pokemon in order to help you overcome obstacles that would have previously required a HM. You can register up to four Ride Pokemon to the - 3DS' D-Pad - in order to summon them at any time. Better yet, these Pokemon don't even have to be in your party in order to benefit from their aid.

But I think that's d-pad for selection, like selected items in Pokemon Black 2/ x ECT.

1. I miss playing video-games and coding.  While some people can still code blind I personally find it too uncomfortable and error prone.  Other problems I face are navigating unfamiliar places and finding entrances to buildings without touching doors and walls around them.
2. I rarely go outside without a guide, but when I do the biggest danger I face is probably the traffic.
3. I rarely travel alone, but when I do it's either by train or bus, and I use Blind Square to alert me when I am arriving at my destination so that I don't have to ask other people for assistance (which is what bothers me the most about being blind).
4. Euro bills have distinct sizes, so I wrap them around my middle finger and check the size.  Coins also have different sizes, but I distinguish them by their textures.
5. I've never been scammed.
6. I use an iPhone loaded with Blind Square and Google Maps, and a white cane.
7. I learned to use the white cane in rehab, the iPhone is the same phone that I had before going blind, Google Maps has been installed on my phone since iOS 6 came out with the clusterfuck that was Apple Maps, and I learned about Blind Square here on reddit.

Voice actors are unionized.  I would be extremely surprised if the subscriptions from all Netflix blind customers, combined, are even enough to pay the voice actors who read the audio description scripts.  Never mind pay the producer who has to edit the description into the original audio, and whoever writes the scripts in the first place.  Unfortunately, the reason closed captioning always comes before audio description, is because it's much much much cheaper.  The only hope I can see for audio description is if it's included as some kind of subtitle system that TTS systems can read out, to eliminate the cost of voice acting, and the AD lines themselves are written by whoever does the captions, to save on the cost of writers.  Government requirements are nice while they last, but governments aren't going to keep requiring every production in the world to effectively higher an extra actor and writer for every production.

Have you contacted your local agency to start training on skills you would need as your vision loss advances? Things like Daily Living Skills, Orientation and Mobilty, Technology, etc. 

Sometimes, the tools you need to do what you want don't exist. You need to evaluate what your skills are, and how to build those tools to allow you to do what you want to do. I saw a TED Talk earlier this year of a blind astronomer. Most people will think, ""Wait, don't you need to see the stars to do astronomy?"" Well, her speciality was gamma-ray bursts... which are not visible anyways. She worked with some colleagues to develop software that allowed the light curves to be translated into sound.

(Link if you want to learn more:  https://www.ted.com/talks/wanda_diaz_merced_how_a_blind_astronomer_found_a_way_to_hear_the_stars)

In a similiar manner, infectious diseases are usually small enough to be not visible. You need tools to magnify them and some of those tools can be adapted. If I'm not mistaken, they already have microscopes that can automatically count stuff they are looking at. Instead of a visible display, you need something that can auditorily read it out for you. I know someone with RP that works in the field of research, and he was able to get some stuff adapted (although I think he did a lot of computer stuff).

One of the biggest things that will help you will be to find a mentor. Someone to help guide you through the path, and knows what things are coming up that could be a problem for you. With that heads-up, your responsibility would be to figure out how to adapt your equipment and prepare your skills for that inevitable challenge. It might be as simple as learning to use adaptive technology to read off numbers, or as difficult as memorizing stacks and stacks of legal briefs.

An article you might find interesting.

I know it's not the end of the world, and I know there are people who still do these things while blind. I guess my feeling is that I just don't want to. I'm already doing development more because I need to and less because I want to, and being forced to do it through a bunch of visual aid tools isn't going to make me like the job more.

You might find that a lot of us listen to audiobooks rather than podcasts, though, as places like the NLS/RNIB/CNIB offer them to us for free.  But personally, I subscribe to around two hundred podcasts, so maybe you ended up in the right place after all. :-)

If you enjoy audio drama, I highly recommend the [BBC Drama Of The Week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrv5m/episodes/downloads.rss).  Every week it's something different, from a wide variety of genres. Not every drama is a winner, but each episode is a stand-alone drama, so if you're not enjoying one, just skip it.  Speaking of audio drama, you might be interested to know that /r/audiodrama is an active place where people post knew episodes of audio dramas, share recommendations, etc.

Also, if you enjoy science fiction, I'd strongly advise you to check out [Big Finish](https://www.bigfinish.com).  While they do have a podcast, it's usually actor interviews and so-on.  However, the audio dramas they offer for purchase, while they're quite expensive, are some of the best acted and produced science fiction audio being made today.  If you enjoy DR Who, the monthly series is worth the money.  

If you like radiolab, you'll probably also enjoy [freakonomics radio](http://feeds.feedburner.com/freakonomicsradio).  It has a similar sound, and a similar variety of topics.  If you're up for something a little more in the style of standard science radio, [Quirks &amp; Quarks](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/quirksaio.xml) is also worth a listen.  

Unfortunately, another good explorational podcast I enjoyed seems to just be gone; I have no idea when or if season two of [Mystery Show](https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show) will happen.  The five episodes that exist are still good listening though, if you're up for something a little different.  This is one of those podcasts where the host, Starlee Kine, makes the show.  Those topics, in that format, couldn't work with any other presenter, I don't think.

The makers of The Mystery Show also make another podcast I enjoy called [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all).  Unfortunately, the quality of episodes varies widely.  If the topic of the episode seems uninteresting to you, don't be afraid to skip it right off!  The latest episode (number 82, ""hello?"") for example is just a silly gimmick that makes terrible listening.  However, most of the episodes are much, much, much better.  

Those are a few to get you started!  Most of the other podcasts I listen too are specialized to particular topics like Canadian news/politics, tech discussion, fandoms,  bitcoin, or blindness, so I don't think you'd enjoy them much.  ",,,5,0,0,

I'd say go with a hat with a wide brim to warn him of low-hanging branches, so he doesn't hit his head on stuff. He may also want a pair of protective glasses, or sunglasses if bright light makes his vision worse. 

Also, he should take a trekking pole he can use for support/probing. It'll be better on the rough terrain than a travel cane and he can use it to quickly put some weight on if he stumbles and needs support. If you're guiding him the whole time he should use one. Otherwise he should get and use two. 

Also, he should wear hiking boots with great ankle support, since he could be prone to stepping wrong and getting a sprain if he can't see the terrain that well. 

Finally (you should be doing this anyway), bring a basic first aid kit with you. The reality is that falls, scrapes, and cuts are more likely to happen to someone who's visually impaired. You can minimize it a lot, but better to be prepared. ",,,2,0,0,

Today I was at the county building and people were very nice in directing me to the elevator and figuring out which one was going up or down. By all means, hold a door and direct me by voice. I appreciate that. But grabbing me and directing me makes me nuts. And yes, people do this. If you want to lead someone, let them put their hand on your shoulder, instead of you touching them. 

There is a big emphasis in mobility/cane training about keeping safe. As a female, I am suspicious of men that might be overly helpful... for obvious reasons. 

People often give completely useless help. ""Over there"" is not a direction that works for me and is generally the directions people give you on a bus. 

""Five feet to your left"" or a clock direction is better. We know the clock, because we sweep 10 to 2 with our canes. 

One of the tech trainers that works at my local center, I knew from riding the bus to and from school. I had a car, but parking at the school was ridiculous and they offered free bus passes. He is completely blind since birth, as is his wife. I used to offer them rides when I would see them at the store and they never wanted to take them. 

I have come to respect him immensely, he is awesome. He can use echo location indoors. But now that he knows me better, and knows that I have peripheral vision, he will happily put his hand on my shoulder outdoors to be led somewhere. 

When you see someone that is blind, you don't know how blind they are and you have no idea what their level of independence is. Asking is fine, we won't take offense. Don't be pushy. Blind people are just like regular people, some of us are happy to accept help and some of us want to be left alone. Sometimes, it just depends on the situation.

The Apple Watch voice over was impressive, I had no idea it could do so much. My main problem was that the haptic time only worked when voiceover was on, and half the time it spoke the time instead. If my Bluetooth headphones were paired then this was a problem. 

But that leads to my biggest issue: Bluetooth pairing. I listen to mainly podcasts, live radio, and audio books, NONE of which can be downloaded onto the watch. Only two gigs of iTunes music can be downloaded onto the watch. If the audio is not downloaded onto the watch itself then the watch only controls the music playing from the phone. However, if my headphones are paired to the phone to listen to music then they can't be paired with the watch to control it. If my phone is close enough to me that i can listen to the audio without headphones then it is close enough to touch and i have no need of the watch to control it. 

Basically, the Apple Watch is pretty cool, but for the way I wanted to use it the price was way to high. If someone made a watch app that would tell the time haptically without voice over having to be on then I might buy an older version of the watch. But currently I've returned the watch.

It sounds like you're using some kind of Graphical Interface to enter the text? (Sorry, I'm a sighted programmer so I'm extremely familiar with how difficult it can be to parse text on the web, unfortunately I'm not familiar with many of the existing products to do it for users. The ones I've seen are terrible.)

I've written my own simple, interactive fiction frameworks in Ruby and Python in the past but I'd recommend using a more mature framework like PyF or others that let you enter the gameplay in simple markup like XML, YAML or Json. There's also Inform7 for non-programmers but I'm not experienced with that. 

Here's a link I found with some good info on what's out there now and it appears to be Windows focused: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/interactive-fiction-text-adventures--gamedev-9996

Your picture, which shows a somewhat sparse hold layout may make climbing more difficult, but it does have an optimal route up, no? So the strips would indicate that route.

Have you always had a visual impairment? Do you know what causes yours? Do you get frustrated when you can't see things that fully sighted people can see but feel like you don't totally fit into the blind community either? 

It's rare that I find other people so close to in the same shoes as me. 

It seems silly but sometimes it feels isolating. I'm sighted enough even close family forget but not sighted enough to go through life without making adjustments and trying to figure out skills to see things. 

How do you explain your vision to people? People in my life don't seem to understand that you can have a visual impairment that can't be corrected but isn't total blindness (or passed the 20/200 threshold at least). 

Do you use any tools to make day to day life easier like bioptics or a monocular? Maybe purple sunglasses or zoomtext/accessibility features on your computer? 

How do you watch tv? Do you ever add descriptive audio? I have a normal smart tv which is great but if I really want to keep up with a new show or movie i either pull out a folding camping chair i own and place it directly in front of the tv or I just use my phone. When I'm tired even if I don't really care about the show I use my phone because it's just easier. 

Is your close vision (like reading distance) fairly unaffected? 

What other tools do you use to more seamlessly blend in as a fully sighted member of society? Do you ever get frustrated when you can't see things that you feel like you should be able to see? 

Sorry...this is a ton of questions. It's hard to meet people with a low level visual impairment.  ",,,2,0,0,

If we didn't do audio, the only other options to entertain ourselves would really either be sports or drifting off into space, and I don't think either really suit my fancy as prospective hobbies, just imo.
Anyway, to answer your question, right now I mainly follow Pain Killer Already (PKA) but it's definitely not content for everyone and I'd imagine it's also a really difficult one for new listeners to get into. Other podcasts I've followed include the Joe Rogan Experience, RAWTalk (a photography-Centred podcast that occasionally discusses business), and I think one that'd suit your preferences would be the How Stuff Works podcast.
Hope I got the names right there, it's late here and I can't be bothered to check. Please don't crucify me if I spelt something wrong, heh",,,2,0,0,
