Depression is treatable. Most people feel better when they get the right treatment. You've had something really awful happen to you that's life-changing and permanent.

18fd7e1b-5d04-4b57-a988-c175b0dca721,1458187635,"Ok so I have a few thoughts here. I love that this sort of thing is being worked on and the possibilities really are endless as long as it works well. I'm totally blind so honestly any information is usually useful. Even something as seemingly simple as locating doorways would be great. I was recently at a VA hospital and had one hell of a time navigating the maze and finding exactly what I was looking for. Having something that would let me locate doorways without having to hit them with a cane would be great. It would make following instructions like ""It's the third door on the right"" so much easier.
At the same time being able to find and read the info signs located in a place like that would be awesome as well. They have signs everywhere that say where things are located but again having no vision and therefore no clue where to look I often have to resort to just finding someone then asking them for directions.
I have always loved rock climbing and even after losing my vision it's something I continue to do. I can imagine what it would be like to be able to just look up and see the next hand or foot hold again without having to sweep an appendage around searching for it like a mine sweeper.
The city I live in has good public transportation but the bus sign posts are right next to the street and unless I already know where it is there's no way I'd be able to find one so again having something that would be able to help with that would be useful even if it just made a beep or chime when I was near it.
That brings to mind street crossings. While I can do it and rarely have issues having a system I could trust to guide me strait across the street would be amazing! Walking in a strait line can be a pain in the rear and any help would be an improvement.
Since I'm just rattling off ideas, getting info on other people and how close I am like in a mall would be great. If I could tell where they were walking or standing I'd be able to avoid cracking ankles with my cane in crowded places. Most of these things really aren't major problems but even small bits of info would be extremely useful.  
The ideas you have listed already sound great but I think one of the biggest issues I've experienced with vision assist devices is the lack of actual usefulness. I was able to spend six months using the Brain Port device and while it sounds super in reality it was cumbersome and the effort it took to figure out what it was displaying made the whole thing more work than it was worth. I was able to sort laundry with it but there were wires everywhere and the battery didn't last very long so once I was done with the clothes I'd have to put it on the charger for an hour just to be able to use it on something else. At the same time the refresh rate was so slow that even a person walking past my line of vision would just confuse it. I could tell that something just happened but it wasn't good enough to even be able to figure out which direction the person was going. 
I love hearing ideas like this and I always try to get involved wherever I can but so far I haven't found anything that's worth the time to use. The Orcam is another device that comes to mind. Sounds great when you read about it but when you try it out it's just not as useful as they make it sound. Even useful things like product recognition take too long, not to mention that you have to add products on your own and it can only remember 100 before the storage is full.

The text I used comes from [this page](http://badmovies.org/movies/ymir), and I believe it's a short enough passage that it qualifies as fair use.  It reads as follows:
&gt; A number of Sicilian fisherman are hauling in their empty nets when a huge rocketship crashes into the ocean. Two of the alarmed men overcome their fear and row out to the half-submerged wreck. They rescue two people, one of them Col. Calder, before the rocket begins to sink. Judging from the angle, it appeared to be embedded in the sea floor. Why did it suddenly start to sink? Anyway, the ship had traveled to Venus and back. The mission was top secret and the public is not informed of the achievement until later. 

Based on all the hype about Watson and how wonderful it is, I was really expecting a lot better!  Maybe it's me, but compared to state of the art speech engines like voiceware, or even Google's TTS offering, I'm really not impressed.  Speaking of Google, I also played around with the [Watson Translation Demo](https://language-translation-demo.mybluemix.net), and I wasn't impressed with that, either. Based on translation of French to English, Google is much much better there, to.  ",1,,1,0,0,

&gt; 2) Is it annoying if you have to turn off a screen reader if it is picking up closed captioning on top of audio?

I've taken a couple courses put out by the ARRL, and they were pretty good, other than a few images that needed description.

Unlabeled buttons and controls, and no alt-text on images.  In education, image descriptions can be especially important, because a quiz or exam question found later on may well depend on information that was only shown in an image.  

&gt; 6) Have you ever used eLearning Software, if so, what was done right/wrong?

It sounds like part of the key with these devices is that they have to be accurate and fast enough to be reliable and worth the time to learn how to use them.  I'm very curious about your experiences with Orcam and Brain Port.  One of the challenges in designing these devices that detect objects, people, text etc. is balancing the sensitivity: if it's too sensitive, it might miss something, but if its more sensitive it tends to give more false positives because of noise and other objects in the image.  If you don't mind me asking, when using those other devices, did you find either of these two problems particularly frustrating, in addition to the device being slow, needing frequent charging etc.?   What I mean is, did you find it to be more of a problem when the device gave a signal when it wasn't appropriate, or when it didn't give a signal when it should have?

Instead on just moving his eyes around to scan the table, he'll have to learn to move his head around a lot more so his field of vision covers the whole table -  a bit at a time.

If it's a gradual sight loss, he may learn to do this anyway as it progresses.

By switching to a smaller, square monitor I've been able to continue gaming, even shooters.

You'll be surprised at how much he'll adapt as it progresses.  He might get down or frustrated occasionally but if you give him the support he needs then hopefully he can continue to play for years to come.

It's a short demo paragraph explaining that an online order can't be fulfilled.

It sounds extremely sarcastic and condescending, as if the person speaking is 'talking down' to someone they feel are beneath them.

It definitely suffers from the 'uncanny valley' effect where in it's attempt to sound lifelike, it sounds even less so due to the over expressive voice.

Definitely pretty disappointed considering how much IBM brags about how powerful and adaptable WATSON is.",2,,2,0,0,

It's fine when the change is of little relevance, such as the number of votes on a post or a post's elapsed time here on reddit; it's also fine when the changes appear at the screen-reader's cursor or immediately after, such as the comment reply form here on reddit, which appears right after the reply link; but it sucks when it is, for example, a pop-over div, because those usually do not appear near the screen--reader's cursor in the HTML, forcing us to navigate to wherever they appeared for the screen-reader to read its contents, and this is because screen-readers read content by the order it in which it appears in the dynamic source HTML, regardless of where the screen CSS moves it to.

Regarding form fields, it is acceptable to have them filled; what is not acceptable is when you try to dynamically change them as I type, such as, for example, to provide completion.

I think he could have some mental stuff, but I can't be for certain.  He is just very untrusting and we have known him for 6 out of 70 years of his life, so I can't enlighten as to why he is like this.  So we proposed getting him his Social Security card and trying to get him on the grid, and he got a bit spooked. 
 Without that, though, an organization was willing to help, and we thought we were close, and my wife just asked if she could see the place, just so she could tell the guy she approved.  They never responded and went silent after that, and we tried to follow up, and nothing.  So not sure what happend, but my wife is overly polite. 

The other place for the blind does not do homeless things--it was one of the places the other commenter pointed me.  They help once the person is settled, to get around the basic challenges of life.  My wife is going to try to go to the housing office tomorrow -- we are visiting NYC tonight to see him.  Other places we looked at were for women only, and he absolutely will NOT go to a shelter. Says he gets robbed and beat up sometimes there

So it is a touchy issue, because we don't know why he is so untrusting and reluctant to get on the grid, or if that is a psychological out ome of fending for himself on the streets so long.

f1e5eab4-f220-4392-b8a3-dd5163fb070b,1458671099,"Hi OP-

Teacher of the Blind/Visually Impaired here. Does your son have a vision teacher? I'm hoping he does, as he/she would be a great resource for you on some things you could do at home. The ipad is fun for kids with CVI, you're right. I've found that apps that have stories that are read out loud are enjoyable, as long as the graphics are not too complex. 

As a general rule, that is something to keep in mind for your son. He probably likes/needs to keep things visually simple. Visual clutter is way too overwhelming for him, so one or two bright colors that he can focus on at a time will capture his interest. Classically it is usually red and yellow, but I try everything- some of my students with CVI love bright fluorescent colors. Most of them are attracted to things that shine or shimmer, like pom-poms, bows, etc. and you may notice that he will look at something, look away, and then react or grab it later. That is because his eyes and his brain aren't quite ""synced up""; this is normal for CVI. 

If you have some money that you can spend, you might buy a light table for your house. Teacher supply stores have them, and kids with CVi will almost always react favorably to them. Pinterest has tons of activities that you can do on a light table, from fun to academic (he can do all of his schoolwork on a light table, actually), if he enjoys it and it keeps his attention. The American Printing House for the Blind makes a big one, but it's very expensive, and even with blind quota funds that can pay for it for him to have at school, it's kind of limited use.

Talk to your son's vision teacher, if there is one, and if you have more questions, you can PM me anytime. :-)",2,,2,0,0,
0ce20fc4-3fd6-43af-97c7-4874225ec47e,1458341028,"I think you'd have a real case to make for vocational rehabilitation to pay for a braille display since it would be an important tool to help you work. 

There's also state specific programs that can help you fund AT. I don't know if all states have them, but if you can get an individual development account for AT you can put savings towards an AT purchase and have your funds matched from other sources (making the overall purchase cheaper.)

If you're paying cash outright (or credit or via a loan), you can often get used braille displays for less outrageous prices (I've seen many in the $500-$1500 range used, sometimes less if you're a hawk for deals.) I've bought one off ebay, but there's also the blindbargains classifieds, state assistive technology exchanges (I would recommend contacting the coordinator of your state's program and asking specifically if they can look out for a braille display, sometimes you can get one being retired out of a state program for free), etc.  

Vocational rehab would be the first stop if you otherwise still would like to work, but even if you're cash paying it doesn't have to be some ridiculous $6,000 or more hit. 

While obviously that doesn't immediately solve the issues of you being slow to read braille, at least my personal experience has been that I utilize a braille display way more than paper braille, and that using a braille display has definitely improved my braille skills over time. When I was still learning to read braille, having the option of audio feedback along with braille was very helpful as well. I can't read braille anywhere near as fast as I can listen, but braille (and a braille display especially) is indispensable for a lot of tasks. ",1,,1,0,0,

I read about the problems you were having with the guide dogs and looked into the schools.


I've raised service dogs since 2007 but have never been hired by a school. This is my personal research and opinions.


The Desert School is lacking in information about the kind of training that is done at the campus. I don't know enough to make an opinion on the school itself but street guiding is a *fundamental* part of guide dog work and should never be an issue. 



The Eye Dog Foundation of Arizona is not listed on Charity Navigator. I'm going to mention them in detail because I have heard of them. They were started with good intentions in CA but spilt after a dispute in the 70s. There has been concern in the past about fund management. The *Braille Monitor* also did an [investigation in 2008](https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm08/bm0811/bm081103.htm). If you have time give that a read.


Secondly, what to do you with the funds you raised? As you said, you do have two options. One is donate it and the other is try again for a dog. 


There are a few questions you should ask yourself:


1. Is your friend responsible and self-sufficient enough to have a guide dog?


2. Will having a dog improve the quality of his life in ways that other assistance might not?


3. Is he willing to try again?


If the answer to all three is ""yes"" then I suggest The Seeing Eye in Morristown, NJ. It is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. I have raised puppies for them and know their training quite well.


The Seeing Eye is the oldest and most established guide dog school in the U.S. Their [student expectations](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions/expectations.html) are pretty straight forward. They also provide their expectations of [themselves](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions/our-commitment.html) which are great. 



Each training session lasts 3 ½ weeks. [Here](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions) is some information about admissions. What I think The Seeing Eye does best is their gradual, off campus training with the people and their dogs. There is constant contact with the outside world during training and it is reflected in the quality of the dogs and the skills of the trainers. Morristown is great and a good size city to learn in. A university campus would be quiet compared to downtown - and that is the idea of getting practice in there.  


Furthermore, the cost for a dog has not changed in a few decades - each dog is 150 USD. Housing and materials for classes are covered by donation. I pulled the full service post from [this page](http://www.seeingeye.org/about-us/faq.html). 150 USD covers:

The cost of the dog and its initial equipment

The student's instruction with the dog

Room and board during the 18 to 25 days the student spends at the school

Round-trip transportation from anywhere in the United States or Canada

Lifetime follow-up services



Average time from [admissions](http://www.seeingeye.org/admissions) to acceptance to the program is about four months. I suggest calling (973) 539-4425 and explaining your situation. 


From Mike's past experiences with guide schools would donating the funds to those schools be appropriate? I honestly would hesitate on that idea for now.  


If you have any questions or comments or anything at all do not hesitate to contact me and I'll get back to you ASAP.


Have a good night.

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1457960585,"Just downloaded it and installed the app.

First thing I notice: join us with Facebook is a little flaky. The first time I hit the button, it asked me if I wanted to allow the app to open Facebook and I allowed that, then I pressed ""continue as Samuel"" in the facebook app. Then it just returned me to the same screen it had before.  I pressed ""join us with Facebook"" a second time, and it did some stuff (the screens changed too quickly for me to examine with Voiceover), and it let me in.  

Second thing I noticed, after saying ""yes"" to download Bryan, it put me on the main-screen of the app right away, before the download had finished.  When the download was complete, the message didn't get focused with Voiceover, so it took me a minute to figure out why nothing on the main screen was working. I had to explore around the screen to find and press the OK button.  

On the saved tab, everything works.  However, I can't figure out how to delete the ""men walk on moon"" article now that I've read it.  If there is a delete button somewhere, Voiceover isn't finding it.  

Reading articles seems to work just fine. The close button is identified by Voiceover as ""CloseModal"" rather than just ""close"", but other than that, everything here is labelled OK.  I might strip off the word button from each label though, because at the moment, voiceover is saying things like ""ButtonPlay button"" ""ButtonJumpPrev button"", etc, when all I really need is ""JumpPrev button"".  After pressing close on this screen, the play button becomes labelled ""ButtonPlaySmall"".  That's fine, but it could probably stand to be just ""play"".  

On the discover tab, though, things aren't in nearly as good shape.  After pressing the personalize button, I can't choose favourite channels. All of the options on this screen voiceover just reads as ""button, button, button, button"" and so-on.  Each of these buttons needs to be labelled.  Selecting ""top stories"" isn't any better.  This tab is just full of buttons that haven't been given any labels, either.  

On the settings tab, everything works perfectly.  No changes at all are needed.  

Lastly, it sounds like you're using the Ivona text to speech voices.  Are you aware that those voices will be [discontinued](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3t62ca/voice_dream_other_text_to_speech_users_whats_your/cxlocil) on December 24 2016?  You might want to change TTS providers in the near future.  My favourite, by far, are the Neospeech voiceware voices. Though they're also the most expensive. So you might want to consider Acapela or Cepstral instead.

One thing to keep in mind, though, most of the stuff it does has an associated cost on top of the echo itself. For example, Pandora requires a monthly subscription, as does Amazon Music (you need Amazon Prime), Spotify, etc.  Personally, if I were blind and bedridden, I'd much prefer an Apple TV.  However, the Apple TV, while it does more, is harder to use.  So it depends on how comfortable he is with technology.  But keep in mind that the echo is an audio only device, so it'll never do Youtube or play movies.  There's lots and lots of good audio-only content and music on youtube, so that's kind of a shame. Also, Netflix has lots of audio described TV shows and movies to listen to, that will never come to the Amazon Echo.  On the other hand, the echo does integrate with TuneIn, so it can play pretty much every radio station ever, and most of the mainstream podcasts.  And developers can apparently add new skills, so it'll get more and more useful as time goes on.  I'm already aware of an audio-only RPG for the echo I'd like to play if I could get one.  And being voice only, assuming the voice recognition works well, it would be the worlds easiest device to use.  I've heard two or three blind folks using it, and they never had any trouble getting it to recognize commands.

3: astigmatism isn't a 100% death sentence for your sight, and the eye doctor, assuming they were at all competent at their job, would have spotted it anyway. The fuck does the dog have to do with any of this?

4: I love dogs, but the amount of adoration and mystical abilities attributed to this one is almost enough to start a cult. Licking a spot where the tumor grew? How do we know the dog isn't secretly an evil bastard and was like ""mmmm yess, your impending doom is delicious to me mlem mlem mlem.""

I think all you need is that initial confidence boost - that 1st step getting back into the drivers seat.  Once you do some simple driving, even if just round an empty parking lot and doing some simple maneuvers like three point turn, parking the car etc.

You have to take that first step though - remember the feeling when you 1st got your licence and the sense of freedom &amp; independence it gave you - focus on  that.

I'd kill to be able to drive again, although we have (mostly) great public transport here I can't use it due to mobility problems so I'm pretty much like yourself trapped in my local area.

I saw someone else mentioned driving simulators - 1 game you could try, that I've played myself is European Driving Simulator (I think there's an American truck version too).

Obviously the act of driving is going to be different than a car, but - it's almost like driving with reduced peripheral vision.  Your mouse controls your view, you have to look around the cab while driving, turn view/head to look at the mirrors, turn your view to check if the road is clear at junctions etc.  

It might help you learn a bit about how much you will have to compensate by turning your head more to make sure you are aware of any hazards (which I think is possibly one of your biggest fears - not seeing hazards etc)

I have Homonymous Hemianopsia which means I basically have no visual field on the left side of both eyes. Had a stroke during heart surgery so I went from 20/20 vision to my current state instantly - a big shock to the system.

Playing FPS games helped me as well - teaching myself how to look around more with my head and not just moving my eyes.

I know where you're coming from with the lack of confidence, I took a major confidence hit but I'm a stubborn bugger.

Focus on regaining your freedom and independance again.  Book some lessons with an instructor with dual controls, go for a simple drive with your friend - even if just driving in a straight line down a dead road.

I am completely blind and find that sometimes things like this are annoying, but only that. I would say it's comparable to them guiding you by letting you grip their arm. Receiving assistance is often going to be a physical interaction, and prescribing limits on when and where seems like something that will be very difficult to enforce.you can keep telling people not to touch you, and it will work each time, but it sort of requires that you say this after the fact, so you're not really solving much. I found it was much easier to just worry less about the personal space issue. We interact through tactile  sensations, and it's unlikely that that will change.


On the other hand, I do find that the amount of overprotective assistance is often dictated by the blind person's confidence level. Most of the time I ask for help rather than having to have it offered to me, in which case I generally speaking control the dynamics of that assistance. In those cases you generally initiate the contact. This depends on personality though, I think.",2,,2,0,0,

Personally, I just use GPS.  Braille maps are too large, too expensive, and too slow to be practical in my every day navigation.  I haven't felt a raised map of anything in the last 20 years or so, and if you gave me one right this second, I doubt I could do anything useful with it.  

The one thing that did help me as a student was focusing on what we were passing during travel.  My family always had a car when I was growing up, and as someone who is totally blind, the car might as well have been some kind of magical transporter. Get in at home, sit in the car for four hours, and get out at my Grandparents.  Unless someone made a point to talk about the streets and highways we're taking, and the cities we're passing through, they just wouldn't register with me at all.  So it took a long time before I was familiar with the main streets of my own city, or what cities and towns were nearby.  

As for world geography, I have a vague idea where most countries are, but I mostly know them by things like statistics (size, population, climate, etc).  But if you asked me to name all of the countries that share a border with France, I'd be at a loss.  France is in Europe, across the channel from England, and has the sort of climate that grows grapes. That's really all I've ever needed to know.  ",3,,3,0,0,

I am US based, so I'll let you know what I do here.  The first thing is to get in touch with your Department of Social Services Rehabilitative Services for the Blind.  They can set her up with a caseworker who can provide training and technology which can be helpful.  The training you want to get her right away is Orientation and Mobility Training (O&amp;M).  This will be the fundamentals of traveling on a white cane which is absolutely (I cannot stress this enough) crucial to her maintaining independence.  In addition to that they can work with her on using computers with screen readers like NVDA and JAWS as well as provide said software and equipment.

&amp;nbsp;

You can also look into non-profits in your area which may be able to supplement what the state can provide.  The rest just comes down to maintaining composure.  I'm sure your whole family is going to make it through this, it's an adjustment and it takes time to figure this out.  I was born with my condition and it has taken as many years as I've been alive to get the whole legally blind/ low vision thing sort of figured out and I'm still learning.  Your mom will figure it out though, the best thing you can do is be patient and help her through this.  Good luck!  Let me know if you have any questions.",1,,1,0,0,

I'm not a current guide dog handler but I am going to train in June with my first guide dog so take what I say with that in mind.  With that being said I can say I have successfully navigated the application and admissions process to two schools.  I did it with a lot of guidance from my orientation and mobility instructors and with a lot of research.  I have heard of both organizations you have talked about and I have heard mixed things about each.  I very rarely hear negative things about a school but I was advised not to apply to a certain set of schools if I possibly could, and unfortunately those two schools were a few of the ones that I was told to skip when applying.  I like what /u/1b5cd32b-0b27-4bc1-a906-5b3423a18cff said and would encourage you to look at some of the bigger, better known schools.  I have never heard anything bad about the Seeing Eye and it is probably the most famous, but I would also look at Guide Dogs for the Blind which is where my SO's has gotten his past three or four with nothing but good coming out of it, or at Leader Dogs for the Blind which is a very well respected school.  I met a guy who has been going to the Seeing Eye for years and who has had massive success, and I hear nothing but good about the other two.  I think those three are your safe bets for success.  If he wants a guide dog I would say don't give up, he clearly has an awesome support structure and definitely has the financial means to do it now.  I'm going to have to shoulder the cost of food and vet bills during my first year of undergrad starting in the Fall and throughout the rest of my college career which is a sacrifice I decided is worth it, he is incredibly lucky to have an awesome group like your fraternity who put together $10,000 to make this possible.  Basically shop around and make it happen, I don't think you should give up though.  Again, not a handler, but I have been told by so many people that it is absolutely life changing when you have an effective guide dog team and it isn't something I would personally give up on.  Best of luck man, if you have any questions let me know.",3,,3,0,0,
