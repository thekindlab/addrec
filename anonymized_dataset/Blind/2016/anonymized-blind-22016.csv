I asked the creator of the product there why it was so expensive (something like $2,000 at the time). I pointed out that I could purchase two eeepc for $200 each and maybe set up a program to communicate with each other via Ethernet or USB. Total cost coming under $500 including taxes. The guy could only say that it was priced for it's durability and whatnot. I didn't believe him. So that really galvanized my view on accessibility equipment pricing.

Yeah, I'm thinking about prioritizing my focus on figuring out a standardized braille 'block' that can be put together on top of an easy to make electrical grid to take advantage of multiplexing. I am currently looking at microblock (A type of lego style blocks thats smaller). I'm thinking that these microblock are closer to the normal braille size than the usual lego. I could try sanding the nubs on the top of these bricks off. Since these nubs are hollow already, that should give me a very precise standard holes laid out in a very predictable size and distance. If I could use these holes to create a type of plastic pistons through, that should reduce the complexity of such a brick to only how to pop up these pistons in the first place.

As far as I can tell, it's the braille mechanic that's keeping the cost high. I chose the Raspberry Pi for two reason, low cost without needing to solder anything other than the GPIO holes. An arduino can be made very cheaply but that still require raises more of a skill barrier. I want to try to make this as accessible as possible. A Raspberry Pi could theoretically be used as a headless (no display attached) computer. Since no images or display would be needed in the first place, it would be more than strong enough to be a nice standalone browser and word processor device that's braille based.

Whenever VoiceOver reads a tab it spells out ""tab"", but in Xcode all tabs are converted to up to 4 spaces, and VoiceOver simply ignores spaces (it would be total madness if it didn't).  Speaking of madness, the following is how VoiceOver reads a hello world in C++ in the highest punctuation setting:

Number include less iostream greater new-line new-line int main left-paren right-paren left-brace new-line tab std colon colon cout less less quote Hello World exclaim quote less less std colon colon endl semicolon new-line tab return 0 semicolon new-line right-brace new-line.

And this is why I find writing code blind so confusing; a simple hello world is a mess, let alone anything meaningful.  I doubt I'll ever develop the skills to code like this.

White-space is only ignored by screen-readers by default.

At first I just thought something was in it, but I waited a month, and it didn't go away, so I decided I had to go.  Apparently part of my eye was...too thin? Or something?  Anyway, the doctor prescribed eye drops that I used for...a month or two, I think...and the problem went away, never to come back again.  As a side-effect, I regained some of the light sensitivity in that eye I used to have when I was really, really young.  But it's not enough to care about; I could never see shadows or anything. The ability to tell if a light was on or off, and ""see"" some of the flashes from fireworks, was about the extent of it.

I'm not a current handler, I'm going to train and get my first guide dog in June, but I've done some research on all of the schools.  Your friend will have trained with the dog using the school's techniques and he knows what he is doing.  Furthermore many schools (including the one I'm going to I believe) don't want handlers to use equipment on dogs that wasn't issued or approved by them.  If they issued the dog with a chain collar then there is probably a pretty good reason why they chose to use a chain over another type of collar.  So I wouldn't suggest encouraging your friend to change equipment.

&amp;nbsp;

To answer your question about safety, it is safe.  This is something that happens across all of the the schools I researched.  It's not something that is supposed to happen often, but in certain extreme cases where the handler needs to quickly regain control of their dog it can be necessary.  In my lecture notes that were sent to me there is actually a section that talks about it.  It doesn't look great to the public, and if you are in a situation where people are hassling your friend about a necessary leash correction you can explain to them that he was trained how to handle his dog and that leash corrections are sometimes necessary and that it doesn't happen often, you could also explain that the schools focus on positive reinforcement.  In addition you could direct them to the school that trained him and the school can explain what leash corrections are and why they are sometimes necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't say it a lot, but it's out there on reddit, so sure.  I live in St. Louis, MO and the plan is to move to the Pacific Northwest this Fall, I'm strongly considering Seattle.  Unfortunately we have a pretty large homeless population, and our city is not doing a whole lot to try to remedy the problem.  I actually spend a decent amount of time volunteering with them but, for certain individuals the white cane appears to attract them.  They like to try to help me across roads and then ask for money etc.  I had one guy follow me home off of my bus and corner me by an industrial building and I got very close to getting physical before he backed off.  It happened again in Chicago just the other weekend, I was at a conference, a friend and I were walking to a convenience store and then back to our hotel and in a crosswalk this random dude just grabs my arm and doesn't let go.  Whether he listened to me yelling at him or saw my large friend, he ended up backing down before things escalated.  Your comment about not acting like a mugger if you don't want to be perceived as one rings true.  I can't tell who these people are, but grabbing is a fantastic way for me to think I need to defend myself.  Unfortunately it happens a lot, most people let go when I firmly tell them I need them to get off of me, those that require yelling frustrate me.  I'm hoping my new city will be better about this, I've also been told that guide dogs cut down on this idiocy, so basically June can't come fast enough so I can get mine.",1,,1,0,0,

I have a desktop that I built which is liquid cooled and all of that fun stuff.  That is definitely my baby and something I play around with a lot.  My friends often complain that my computer is way more high definition than my eyes.  I used to use it for gaming, but most games are really hard for me to play now so it's kind of just there because I really like to tinker and I'll attempt a few games every now and then with friends who don't get annoyed at me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also really big into open source everything.  I love my Arduinos and RasberryPis.  I'm trying to do another cool big project like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEiO20YEI2Q) that I did with a friend before I lost more vision.  For those who can't tell what it is, I sent a weather balloon up to just about 100,000 Feet with a payload containing a GoPro and DSLR to do high altitude photography and video.  I'd like to do something on this scale again.  That involved Arduino as well as an Amateur Radio License that I earned.  That was four years ago, but working on that developed my love for these kinds of things.  I still have that license but I don't really use it all that much.  Still an interesting thing, and a good skill and set of qualifications to have in case I ever need it.

I really like going out disc golfing with a friend.  We adapt it a bit.  He'll usually give me a heading and a range and I'll throw until I get it.  It's a good time.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had a lot of others that I have dropped either because it's expensive or not fun with vision anymore.  I used to be big into modern military simulation, it got too dangerous for me to continue doing that with my vision though, and running while holding the elbow of a friend killed the immersion of everyone and wasn't fun for me.

I would pick up a Texas Instruments Ti-84 Plus Orion.  It is exactly a regular Ti-84 but the Orion module allows you to plug in headphones or just listen to actions on the speaker.  It is so intuitive and really just completely awesome.  I love mine and I totally recommend it.

They only get funding if they have clients, and if they actually help people through the system, they won't have as many. Either way, they'll hook him up with a company who will help him find work. It might take years, but it has been known to help.

Personally, I would help him find a way to make his own money. I like to find a good deal on used items and resell them. If he has some start up cash, a couple hundred bucks, he can sell weed. He just needs to buy an ounce or two, depending on if he knows someone who can get that for him, and break it in to smaller bags which average stoners will buy for marked up prices thereby giving your friend a profit.  No, I'm not joking. Weed sells like pussy at a naval port, and you don't have to risk your life to sell it. You know people who smoke, and their friends smoke. Plus, you'll meet more people who smoke. Once you know they're cool, just tell em you have some, and boom, instant customer.

It depends on what your friend is good at, but there is some kind of self employment he could make some money at. He might not make enough to get by on that alone, but it will likely help. My guess is that he gets disability right now, but that isn't enough to pay his bills, and that's why it's better that he find work.

There are jobs such as independent freight agent or real estate agent where you work as an independent contractor, and it is easier for blind people to break in to the business, because you have more freedom to do it your way.

The problem with jobs is that they have a set job description. Your friend can likely do most of the things required of him, but there will be one thing that gets in the way. Other than negotiate some kind of deal where another employee does that work while your friend does some of that person's job, or simply making minor changes to the job description, we call that job-carving, they say, ""I'm sorry, company polasy says, bla bla bla,"" so you don't get the job.

Plus, sightedpeople, especially with discrimination law suits and strict rules about what you can ask a prospective employee, don't quite know how to have a conversation with a blind person. If he is anything like me, he is very approachable about the subject, but of course, the employer doesn't know that. Plus, they've often never heard all about what technology is available to help your friend function like a sighted person.

They have generally heard that something is out there, that computers can talk, but they don't know the details. Your blind friend will have to explain it to them, maybe even demonstrate.

Even then, the employer will have concerns. We don't use the same software programs this guy has, will his software work with our computers? Can he do the job fast enough? Aside from adapting to his blindness, is this guy an overall good employee? Does he know how to interact with sighted customers?

The employer has to take a chance on this guy when he has a pile of applications from people who he doesn't need to wonder about. He knows they can do the job, he/or/she just needs to decide which one best fits the position, so your blind friend finds himself being left out. It sucks, but there's only so much that can be done.

His best friend at this point is someone who is willing to give him a chance or someone who already knows him. I got a job once, because my uncle knew the higher ups. To be honest, that's how a lot of people get jobs. Instead of going through the classifieds, they go through their own personal network. Either way, the folks at this company trusted my uncle, so they gave me a shot, and I wound up getting a job. I left because of personal reasons, but if that hadn't happened, I'd still be working there and not looking for a job now.

I guess, after reading this wall of text, sorry about that, you can see about your own workplace. Be open to the idea of your blind friend doing all kinds of jobs. If your current employer is hiring, ask your friend if he might be able to do the job they need. If not, ask why. He might've just never done that before.

To be honest, having no depth perception makes us no different from anyone else on the road.  My right eye was the bad one, so I'd compensate by adjusting and using the passenger side mirror in addition to over-the-shoulder checks before merging back into the right lane.

Also, practice practice practice!  I wouldn't have gained so much confidence in my own driving if it hadn't been for my female classmate calling me up and asking me to give her a ride to this house or that house.  Bonus points for letting her take the wheel so she could get her own practice in.  It turned out that she wasn't really my friend and was just using me as a taxi cab because she knew I had no friends and wouldn't say no, but at least I gained enough experience in driving to pick up some tips and tricks.  For example, always leaving a large gap between my own car and the vehicle in front of me and not caring if someone cuts in.  I was also that annoying prick who drove at exactly the speed limit in the right lane, simply because I didn't want to have to go through the whole check-the-mirror-then-over-my-shoulder routine, in addition to giving myself ample time to brake if a problem arose.  There was even an intersection on one of my commutes where the left turning lights were much dimmer than the standard through-way ones, so I simply handled it by making a right at the next stop followed by two more rights around the block so I could safely ""make the turn"" without incident.  Better to lose ten minutes to a detour than ten months to an idiotic wreck.

They do not provide advocacy or mediation between your friend and his employer should he experience any sort of work discrimination.

As a matter of fact, I've reached out onto reddit over a year ago with a situation regarding two co-workers making a show out of exhibiting discomfort whenever I was around, i.e. brightly warming up to everyone who says ""Good morning!"" to them except for me, going around collecting lunch orders for the food truck from everyone except for me, et cetera.  Despite the many suggestions and helpful responses I've received, it was obvious that the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation does not provide advocacy to their clients once employment has been secured; neither does Social Security's Return to Work program.  Job Assistance Network was a ghetto call center where the lady said she'd e-mail me pertinent info and hung up before I could give her my e-mail address.

As a result, I was too anxious to continue working in late 2014 and went homeless for a while as a result, had to reapply for disability all over again.  Got reapproved but have to pay off overpayments for my attempt at establishing a stable financial foundation for myself and my future, so my monthly check is $425, half of what it should be.  Recently found someone very understanding who was willing to take my disability money in exchange for a room to rent last November, but I'm still suffering until my overpayment is balanced out in January of 2018.  Oh, and also I did try to contact Free Legal Aid about appealing the overpayment garnishment of my benefits -- they dragged their feet and dropped the ball on providing me with a representative to speak for me at the social security hearing.  So I'm being punished for the next couple of years because I had to learn my lesson the hard way that I'm forever a social liability.

Not to be such a downer.  I just wanted to give you a heads' up so your friend doesn't have any above-and-beyond expectations about work resources for the blind based on my own extensive experiences.  It's just that:  Work resources.  The most generous thing he'll get is free paratransit access to his job training programs, and maybe a free pair of prescription sunglasses.  He'll have to provide his own cane and tips, though.  I highly recommend he learn from my mistakes and take the following two steps that I am currently executing:  1.  Get a disability rights attorney on retainer, and 2.  Document literally every little thing.  Vocational rehab and your friend's employers have no more stake in his work ethic other than his caseworker bribing your buddy's potential boss with a fat check to reimburse them for training.

Edit:  The customer service class I am currently taking is sponsored by the Lighthouse Program in a school for the blind that has no braille translations for the many inspirational quotes on the walls.  My favorite is ""Being blind is like being born:  It's what you make of it.""  Try making something of it when they won't even provide you with the Braille version, and the only way you'd know of its existence is if you become a weak little helpless codependent and implore a passerby to read it to you. They have no resources for advocacy either.  If your buddy's employers decide they felt uncomfortable around him for any reason and kicks him to the curb, there's little he can do.  I'd personally love to know where all these fairy tale news stories about disabled people suing because they were treated like dirt at work and getting a settlement are coming from.",3,,3,0,0,

I haven't seen a physician since I went blind because I don't feel any pain or discomfort, and I stop putting in eyedrops because it's just pointless now.  I can still perceive light but I don't care about preserving it; it will eventually fade to complete darkness.

In my case doctors failed to  diagnose my optic atrophy  before it was too late because they couldn't see the back of my eye (my pupils don't dilate).  My complaints of loss of contrast and color perception were all attributed to a cataract that they didn't want to remove before I was completely blind because it was the only remaining eye with vision and the surgery could go wrong.  It turned out that my intra-ocular pressure was OK during the day but peaked at night.

I wish I had been told about rehab before going blind because I believe that I would have assimilated everything better if I could still see.

I use a white cane to go outside alone (which I rarely do) and VoiceOver in OS X and iOS to read me the contents of the screen.  Before going blind there was a period in which I gradually lost color and contrast perception as well as visual acuity.  During this period I used the inverted colors, contrast, and zoom accessibility options in OS X and iOS, and a scanner to read from paper.  I also used my iPhone a lot as an illuminated magnifying glass with the ability to invert colors.",3,,3,0,0,

But I figured that a open source Pi Zero based display design can accommodate far more use cases than an arduino could. And it would be easier for people to just create an image for different purposes to be burned to a SD card rather than having to figure out how to install the codes directly to the arduino. Like I mentioned, skill level barrier is something that I am keeping in mind for all of this. Installing an image to the SD card is something that there are many utilities for. Not the same can be said for Arduino.

I'm not an engineer or a programmer. I have a good understanding of the general concepts of many thing related to this project. So I may need to rely on the experience of those more familiar with anything specific in this project. I am hoping to figure out enough to pull all the right components together. I'm expecting programming such a brick would be the main challenge for me. Especially once I start to get into multiplexing all of the braille dots properly.

I've seen some rack and pinion style braille display but it seems to take too much space for it to be practical to be taken anywhere. I am hoping that such a brick design can really help anybody figure out how to streamline the braille display design enough to be brought everywhere. Here is an example, http://www.utopiamechanicus.com/article/open-source-hardware-braille-display/

Right now, I am looking up ideas for raising the dots that can fit multiple times in a single brick. I have some minor ideas but I have no idea how feasible it is. ",1,,1,0,0,

Are you in the US?  If so then for sure there are tons of options.  If you are in a different country someone else will have to offer advice, but I'll give you the US perspective.

&amp;nbsp;

First thing he needs to do is contact the local Department of Social Services Rehab Services for the Blind (Or something along those lines, every place has a slightly different name).  This is the number 1 resource available to your friend.  This government agency will pair him with a caseworker who can work to get him orientation and mobility training, job skills training, job search help and connections, and technology/ equipment.  He may also be able to get the funds to go back to school depending on his situation and the agency he works with.  They may also be able to set him up with a temporary pension while he gets things sorted out.  The key advantage here is that the caseworker will work to create a plan that has actionable steps to employment and independence and then will provide the necessary resources to execute said plan.  This is the most valuable resource he has.

&amp;nbsp;

The next thing you should do is look for local non-profits.  They often go by names like Society for the Blind and Visually Impaired or Lighthouse for the Blind.  Do some Googling or check our Wiki for local organizations.  These places can provide supplemental help, and can sometimes organize things faster than the DSS because there is no governmental/ bureaucratic red tape to cut through.

Between these two he should have enough resources to get back on his feet.  Best of luck to you and your friend!",3,,3,0,0,

This understanding of being visually impaired vs. totally blind (no light perception at all or only minimal) seems to stump most medical professionals and cause them to assume that patients may be exaggerating their vision difficulties.

One of the most difficult struggles I face as an author is killing the mood, tone, and flow of a book by over describing the details, traits, and landscapes. I've come to realise that the reason for this is because I miss having my sight. And as someone who does have a subscription to audible I can tell you that I do enjoy the fact that really good writers have a knack for giving exactly the perfect amount of detail without the tale becoming oversaturated with things that are better left out of the flow. 
Most, if not all blind or limited vision readers know what an apple is. There is no real need to spend more than a single sentence describing it. 
Now, that being written, There is however a need, almost a duty in my low-valued opinion, a need, a strong need, to describe enviroments. Both physical landscapes and emotional enviroments that set tenor and moods. 
The real answer to your question will honestly depend on the reader. I have plenty of blind friends who I don't think have ever read or listened a book in the whole of their lives. I have some friends who have, and can't detest the 140 page book with over half of it detail to the nth degree. Then, there are those few, who find it perfect detailing. Painting that verbal landscape in their minds and help them forget their day to day struggles and tribulations. 
""I"" myself, being a writer, wouldn't write a book to satisfy solely the blind and visually impared. Instead, I would try to craft a novel that seeks to appeal to as many readers who like that genre as I could possibly could. 
I hoped, if nothing else, you can maybe get a better understanding to this important fact. No matter how much detail is in a book, there are those who will say that it isn't enough. And there will be just as many who bemoan how much they had to trudge through, uphill, both ways, ten miles to school, in the rain adn snow to finish your book. 
For most, nothing is ever perfect, and for few, nothing is ever good enough.",5,,5,0,0,

I know that there are blind programmers out there, but I haven't figured out how they do it yet; writing code with just a screen-reader confuses me.

It replaces a lot of the numbers with sounds, and provides shortcuts to just read the particular number you want (just type hp, and the screen-reader will say ""47"" or some other number).  The trouble you're going to have is that ""You are a master at swords"" is far, far more verbose than ""swords: 100%"", and so will take the screen-reader even longer to read. It also gives the player slightly less information: what is ""a master""? 100%? 80%? Is ""you have some scratches"" more or less damaged than ""you have some bruises"" or ""you have some cuts"".  This can be a good or bad thing, depending on the design of your game.  

As for single player, I really do like the idea. I find myself fascinated by single player, turn-based rpgs, like final fantasy, and so-on.  I feel like they give me the most opportunity not only to plan a strategy, but also to appreciate the world around me. In MUDs, I always just set brief mode right away, and then feel bad because I'm totally skipping all of the hard work some builder somewhere poured into writing room descriptions. While my screen-reader is telling me about the room description, it isn't telling me about the slavering monster that is even now eating me for lunch.  

The other thing that appeals about single player games, to me, is that they can be much more of an open world.  If I want to screw the world over entirely, I can do that in a single player game.  In a MUD, I can't be allowed to permanently kill even the lowliest of shopkeepers, because they need to respawn for other players.  So everything I do as a player on a MUD is ultimately futile.  

TL;DR: don't worry too much about including numbers in stats. IMHO, focus on making an extremely open world, turn-based, single player game.  Because that really would be something new and fun in the genre of accessible RPGs.  ",1,,1,0,0,

A foggy memory is telling me that Voiceover on OS X can do the same, even with spaces in XCode, but I can't find it for the life of me.  Spent 20 minutes looking and drew a blank.  

As to the hello world thing, if you read all your code line by line, it's really not that bad.  I'll admit a small preference for basic-like syntax (if...endif, etc), but by now I've written so much PHP and JavaScript that c-like languages really don't make me any less productive.  I can't program using read all, of course.  But if you split your hello world example up properly and read line by line, you should be just fine.

I have a job, and I'm actually in the industry I want to be in, but I'm still working a low-wage entry level job and I want to move up. It's hard to explain to people how much you're judged for having a vision impairment, and unlike most other discriminatory behavior, judging someone based on disability still seems to be culturally acceptable to a large extent. I just had a long conversation with my mom about this. She kept saying ""just wow them in the interview and it won't matter"" but unfortunately you can't always overcome someone's misconceptions in a few minutes. Over the course of weeks or months? Sure, but you don't have weeks or months to prove yourself; you have a short meeting. When I started working at my current job, I know there were several people who asked ""how is he supposed to do his job?"" I'm low vision not totally blind, and most of my job involves reading the computer screen. All I need to do is pull the monitor closer to me, but it boggled their minds. I won them over but it took time. Luckily, I had lots of friends from college working here who relentlessly pushed for my hiring, and my supervisor had met me a few times and knew my reputation. If it wasn't for that I probably wouldn't have gotten the job.

The other frustrating thing is those job placement organizations are overworked and understaffed, and seem to specialize in helping low-functioning individuals find low-skilled work. If you're high-functioning, it seems like you don't need their help and you get overlooked. The problem is that being high-functioning doesn't help you overcome the stigma that others put on you.

Okay, now that I'm done venting I do have one piece of advice. Network! Get out there and meet people in your perspective field. Get to know them and let them get to know you. I work in broadcasting. I was involved in our college radio station which gave me lots of networking opportunities both with people in the industry, and with classmates who would go on to work in the industry.

Especially as I have friends going off and doing cool things that aren't accessible to those of us who are legally blind.  But the fact remains that everyone has their challenges and this is just one that I have to deal with, most of the time I just have to remind myself that there isn't anything I can do about it so I just have to make the best of it.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the ways I handle it is by thinking about all of the insanely cool stuff that has happened or will happen because of the disability.  I have met people I would have never had a chance to meet if I was sighted that are now huge parts of my life.  I get to play with different kinds of technology.  In June I'm getting my first guide dog, that's a unique experience that no sighted person will have.  It has made me a more resilient person with better problem solving skills.  There are good parts about it, you just have to look for them.

It's mostly focusing on what is good, and letting go of what is bad.  You can't always fix your situation but you can adapt, make the most of it, and appreciate what you have.",1,,1,0,0,

Between 2011 and 2014 I gradually lost brightness, contrast, and color perception and had to slowly adjust to it.  What I regret the most is not having gone through rehab while I still had some sight left.

Losing my sight had a huge impact in my life.  I worked as a programmer and lost the ability to do it professionally, but what bothers me most is that every little thing requires a workaround, and I simply don't have the energy to cope with it.",3,,3,0,0,

It has an Intel Core i7 clocked at 2.8 ghz and it is running Intel Iris Pro graphics (1536 MB).  It has 16 gb of RAM and a 1 TB SSD for storage.  I have had it for less than two weeks, but so far it is great, I have the SSD split 50/50 with the latest version of OSX on one end and Windows 10 Professional on the other.  I did this through bootcamp.  I'm waiting for a chance to really put it through it's paces (hopefully with MATLAB soon), but it seems to be a very capable machine.  Windows is running smoothly on the other end, although I'm using the OSX side a lot so I can get used to OS again.  It's nice to have both available.

&amp;nbsp;

A quick note, Bootcamp is pretty badly bugged right now, make sure you are all the way updated before bootcamping or it will be terrible.  Also when it was installing drivers on the Windows side it constantly got hung up on the RealTek audio driver and we had to kill that part of the setup process to get it to finish.  

&amp;nbsp;

For software I just use the stock accessibility on the OSX side, no need to fix what isn't broken.  On the Windows side I use NVDA and Zoomtext 10.1.  I was upgraded to Fusion but it feels very slow and clunky which is something I will have to figure out.  I plan on putting Fusion on my desktop which is much more powerful than my laptop to see if it's a performance issue with my hardware, but I doubt it.  That's about it, let me know if I can help anymore.",2,,2,0,0,
