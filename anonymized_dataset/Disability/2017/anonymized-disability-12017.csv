It seems unusual to me that yours has gotten markedly worse at 25--usually it peaks in the teen years (raging hormones make it worse) and then let's up a bit when you hit you 20s.  

I wonder if you might be carrying an infection at a low threshold level.  Are you familiar with the research that shows a correlation of symptom exacerbation with strep infection?  It doesn't cause it, but it can clearly make the tics worse.  I could always tell when my son was getting an infection because his behaviors would get markedly worse, and they would improve dramatically within a day or two of getting on antibiotics.  We also found that stress makes them worse as well, and some medications.  If you have recently tried to quit smoking with Welbutrin, you might look at that again;  his tics got so bad while on that that he couldn't speak a complete sentence without several sets of tics.

It's really tough for people who aren't familiar with TS to comprehend the involuntary nature of the tics.  Even people who do logically know about them often just don't get it, because they often seem like something you should be able to control; but if you could, then it wouldn't be TS, would it?

I would suggest you find some TS friends through a Tourette's Society branch and maybe attend one of [Tourette Society of America]( https://www.tourette.org)'s social events. There's also a TS Canada.  You need to be able to let your hair down and not have to worry about being judged.  And I'm sure you know self-medication rarely works in the long run.

I don't know what to suggest for your family situation other than educating them.  I'm really sorry you have to deal with that.  Personally I often enjoyed my son's tics when he was young (he's 29 now).  I could always tell where he was in the house, and some of them were amusing.

With my current SD, a mini schnauzer, that is always something to be aware of. Fortunately, he's not a mobility dog... and not any bigger, because while he does a good job most of the time, it's a concern); labs are strong enough to be good at mobility tasks, including pulling a wheelchair.

58c1dba6-a1aa-40ea-9cfe-624db13a3778,1485634059,"I dated someone who used a wheelchair, here are some thoughts:

Be sensitive with language and follow the person's lead about how the describe themselves and their relationship to their chair, disability, etc. Use the same language as them.  

Some people prefer to say ""USE a chair"" rather than ""IN a chair""- it highlights that the chair is a tool, not a prison.

Let them choose the restaurant and table, because they might have insight about accessibility stuff you wouldn't think of.  

If you choose a date space, check ahead of time for accessibility- call ahead and ask, look at the entrance on Google Maps, find photos of the interior on their website or on Yelp. A lot of times people who don't need to think about stairs completely forget about stairs. My ex's aide- who should know better- actually recommended a restaurant for us and when I checked, it had a huge flight of stairs and no lift!

If you know what their disability is called, research it (there are great youtube videos and lots of blogs) so you have an idea of what to expect around things they can do or might need- but also remember everyone is different and this person's needs and wants will still be unique.  You're not researching to help them, you're just researching to make sure you're cool with whatever their needs might entail.

Make sure to get to know them on a level beyond their physical needs- talk about ideas and interests, and don't be obsessed about their body (not that you would be! but I think a lot of times ppl kind of focus on physical traits, as you know).

Don't grill them about how their disability came to be or what accident they were in or whatever- talking about that stuff could be unpleasant or traumatic for them. But if they want to talk, be a good listener.

Make sure to frame them as a badass rather than a victim. My ex was SUCH a good wheelchair driver- like he remembered that I had kicked off a boot kind of behind his chair, and without turning around, an hour later backed up and swerved perfectly so he passed over it without hitting it. I was like WTF? And he was like ""Hey, I'm a good driver."" It was pretty impressive.

My ex sometimes admitted that he felt like a bit of a burden when he needed my help with tasks. I actually liked helping him- I thought it was a nice way to connect and the time we spent together could be special and intimate rather than feeling annoying or task-focussed. When he mentioned that he felt bad for me helping him all the time, I told him that and he said he appreciated it.

Let them ask for help rather than jumping to offer it, especially at first.

Most of all, just enjoy each other as humans, and get to know each other.

Many have shared that they were often provided with tech by their docs/OTs without prompting and that one of the biggest problems with the process is that they end up with multiple pieces of equipment sitting at home that aren't used but were provided because of insurance eligibility (in the US.) This seems to be fairly common with seniors and folks in the VA system but often also reported by folks receiving inferior devices while they wait for pieces that are truly needed/appropriate. Often it's not just about getting equipment but getting the right equipment and having access to follow-up care to address sizing issues, adjustments etc. 

We've been speaking primarily to adults however what you shared is 100% true. Personally I think we need more maker spaces where those who need/want customized gear can get it produced to appropriate custom specifications. With the decreasing costs of tech (Arduino, 3D printing etc.) this should be possible.

RAs for physical issues are usually straight forward. RAs for mental issues can be a bit trickier. If your job required you to keep track of tasks, have strict [legal] due dates, and otherwise be cognitively ""sharp"" then you probably weren't a good fit for the job. 

As for where to go from here, you just have to try to find a new job. Try to do something different, maybe something that isn't going to be so stressful. You probably don't have enough work credits for SSDI, so you could apply for SSI but that isn't enough to support yourself. I wouldn't waste your time with an ADA case. (for reasons mentioned above)

When you do get a new job, you can discuss accommodations with them. But its important to remember that the definition of ""reasonable"" typically lies with the employer. And just requesting them doesn't make them an automatic thing. I would try to figure out what you think you can handle, and then looking for a job that you think you can do.

He went to the mother of one of the girls he was helping with her college applications and said that he couldn't believe she had gotten into this pretty prestigious college. He literally told her that he didn't know why the college wanted her. It was the most bizarre thing I'd ever heard. I don't know if he lacks social skills or what... but he seems to take pleasure in tearing other people down. Empathy is a big issue for him. I don't know if bad teachers, doctors, and others in helping professions start out that way or become ineffectual over time because of the demands of their jobs. I sure hope it's the latter. 

No one from my high school is attending my college but I talk to my best friend all the time. I'm planning to see her over the summer too. 

I didn't skip a grade but my parents sent me a year early so I was always the youngest in my grade. I was in a bad place to start college last year. I'd been fighting for a diagnosis for two years and even though I'd gotten it I was still anxious and very insecure. I was having panic attacks and really doubted myself and my ability to handle college. I think that's just a consequence of chronic illness especially when you're undiagnosed and there are so many people in your life who don't believe you're ill. Most of that has resolved itself with time. So I definitely understand what you mean about emotional maturity and readiness. Even half a year has made a huge difference for me.

I was 35 years old when I had to start using it due to a traffic accident injury. My thought is that if I'm not using the cane, I have no need to pre-board. Most of the time I don't bother pre-boarding since doing so prohibits me from sitting in an exit row, and my leg and back pain would not keep me from operating the exit. I have a spinal cord stimulator in use, and normally can't feel that pain when the stimulator is on. 

That being said, I realize that your need to pre-board is different than mine. I travel with a folding cane, because I may or may not need it at times. If I were you, I'd use a folding cane if you are that worried about what people think, then fold it up and put it away once you are on the plane. No one is going to give you a second look or remember you if you get off the plane without it. 

I always assume the people pre-boarding without assistance are Air Marshals, not people skirting the system. 

In a similar instance, I have a disability parking placard and there are days when I really need it, and days that I don't. I always figure that if I don't need the cane at that time, there is someone who needs that parking space worse than I do and will use regular parking spaces. On the other hand, there are days when walking 50-100 feet can be a real challenge, and I feel no apprehension about using the placard, as my doctor certified me for it and I'm using it responsibly, not abusing it.

In Australia, it varies by state but in most it is legal but heavily regulated. Brothels and escort services have to be registered and approved before opening, and workers have to have health checks every months or so. Condoms are mandatory. The rate of STIs is actually lower amongst legal prostitutes than the general population, because of all the precautions.

It's not unusual here for disabled people to visit brothels, or their support workers to call and make arrangements for them. Some even have discounts. In the last 10 years or so it's become much more accepted that having an active sex life is something that a lot of disabled people miss out on, and the stigma of going to a brothel is lower.",,,1,0,0,

Not necessarily for OP, but for others wondering more about this. If you get a denial letter that says that there wasn't enough vocational information and you can do other work. 

All disability decisions are completed using what is essentially a ""flow chart"" called [sequential evaluation](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0422001001). Once a person has a mental or physical RFC assessment, SSA has to look at whether they are capable of their past work or not. If they aren't, then the case is moved onto the [med/voc grid chart](http://www.ultimatedisabilityguide.com/grid_rules.html). 

If you look at the chart, basically anyone under the age of 50 is always going to be a denial. Regardless of a person's past relevant work, their age, education, or RFC. In these situations, SSA allows examiners to ""expedite"" the process by skipping the 4th step (past work) and going straight to step 5.  Doing a complete vocational assessment can take upwards of an hour, and usually involves extra phone calls for more information. Since the outcome of the case will be the same whether the person is found to be capable of their past work, it just saves time to skip it. 

Legally we have to tell people we skipped step 4, hence the language in the disability notice saying that there wasn't enough information.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1485456449,"HUD housing is going to be your only option. Unless you want to rent a room in a house with a ton of other people. Your rent would be capped at 30% of your income ($220) but then you'd be responsible for your utilities (in a small place maybe another $100/mo). 

How good the HUD places are, and how quickly you can get in, will depend entirely on your area. Some places have a year wait, but I've seen people get an apartment in 30 days. You'll start in a subsidized apartment, but also apply for Section 8. This will take years, but it gives you money to use to rent any place you want. 

The key to living on your own, while on SSI, is to make use of every.single. resource you can. Food stamps, food pantries, Medicaid transport assistance, decrease rate bus pass, free phone program, etc. You can call the United Way (2-1-1) and they can help you locate services. Or, look for your county's HHS or aged/disabled services. 

After you've signed up for every assistance program you can, then it just becomes about budgeting. Mint is a good, and free, budgeting tool that links with your bank account. Track every dollar, spend wisely, but make sure to budget in some fun money for yourself. Even if its $5 a week to get a overpriced Starbucks coffee, it will help you retain sanity. 


Also, if you were found disabled between the ages of 18-22, once one of your parents dies, retires, or becomes disabled you will qualify for CDB benefits. That is SSDI based on your parents record and will [most likely] be higher than SSI, plus you'd be able to work a little.

My family lived in public housing for a few years in highschool and it was pretty good. They would do inspections about twice a year, and at my apartment they only gave 12 hour notice, which was the minimum requires in the state. Maintenance was pretty quick to fix things, but they used the cheapest stuff so everything would break sooner or later. It was a townhouse and while we didn't have central air but there was a window AC built into the wall on the main floor, and we were allowed to put a small portable AC upstairs. We weren't allowed to have pets other than fish, and even then no more than a five gallon tank. However, therapy and service dogs were allowed if you managed to jump through all the right hoops. That said, we were turned down for an ESA for my sisters depression because the letter her therapist sent didn't arrive at their office within a specific amount of time. Later a new property manager was hired and we asked her about trying to get approved for an ESA/service dog again (this time for me.) She told us she would let us have a dog as long as we took it somewhere else when the people that did inspections came around, as the management company tried to turn down as many dog requests as they could. I could also hear my neighbors alarm clock in the mornings, but it wasn't that loud.

Overall it was pretty good. I mean, it was a place to live, we didn't have rodents or bugs (with the exception of one fluke summer where the town was overwhelmed by box elder beetles,) everyone was pretty nice. 

Also, we were on the waiting list about two years.

Remember, social security is not concerned that you have diseases, but how much and what kind of work you are able to do. The majority of your impairments do not impact your ability work.

Positive ana is not a disease. It means you have a marker gene that is related to rheumatoid arthritis. It is not disorder.
Lyme Disease is RARELY, if ever, a disabling condition. I do not think I have ever allowed, nor heard of anyone being allowed, for Lyme Disease.
Asthma is only disabling according to SSA if you end up in the  hospital frequently. Just having asthma and having to use an inhaler occasionally is not disabling. 
Migraines are the same. This is a very frequent allegation. Migraines suck; I get them. I might miss a day or two of work a month. However, I CAN work. They do not make me unable to work, especially with medication. Migraines are rarely, if ever, disabling.

Have you read the listings for vision on ssa.gov? If your vision is not consistently 20/200 or worse in the better eye, you will not be allowed for vision. So the fact that you have blurry vision is not disabling, especially because it is only ""some days"". Other days, your vision is fine, and therefore, those days, your vision does not impact your ability to work.

Rheumatoid arthritis can and often does allow people, depending on symptoms- swollen joints, frozen joints, inability to use hands, and how often. Doctors' notes documenting these observable symptoms will go a long way.

There is no period you have to wait after ceasing work to apply.

Regarding the weight given to the VA examiner, the standards used by the VA in determining disability are different than these used by SSA, and we are not bound the VA's findings (20 CFR 404.1504 and 416.906; SSR 06-03p).  Furthermore, a determination of disability is an issue reserved solely to the commissioner.  

While we can't give the VA findings any special significance, any functional capacity assessments will be reviewed and considered along with the evidence as a whole in making a determination.  In other words, we will  consider it, but the fact that it came from the VA means nothing to us.

In truth, although I am severely crippled, I am hardly disabled at all, since, thanks to technology and my relatively advantaged circumstances, I'm not prevented from engaging in the meaningful activities and relationships the human spirit craves. I'm not putting on a brave face here, and I'm not denying the seriousness of my situation. But I think it's very, very important to distinguish 'disability,' which is a social construct rather than a medical diagnosis, from some of the circumstances associated with it, often by people who have little direct knowledge of physical and mental limitations and their consequences.

I agree wholeheartedly that no one should have to fight for their ATs!  My daughter and I have discussed the 'custom AT shop' idea, too.  It is definitely needed!

I'll attempt to complete your official survey later, but in the meantime, here are a few of the AT resources I've found to be immensely useful (some of which took an **extremely** long time after I became disabled to discover existed): 

**Touch Keyboard &amp; Mouse** http://www.dynamism.com/tech/cool-leaf-keyboard.shtml?

This keyboard/mouse combo requires barely a hair of pressure to use.

I've found it to be a really good tool, as I have limited/no hand strength.

At work, I use it to type in passwords (usually using just my thumb), reset the computer, &amp; for limited navigation (due to my work computer currently blocking voice recognition programs from working - a work in progress). When/if the price comes down, I hope to get one for home use, as well, as this is an awesomely useful, very much needed tool.

**Ergo Chair for Little People** http://www.adaptiveliving.com/chair.html

I'm 4'10"", &amp; this chair has been amazingly helpful in preventing the back pain &amp; shooting leg pains that are caused from legs dangling and being unsupported &amp; the un-ergonomic computer use positions 'standard sized' chairs cause.

**Lightweight, folding, portable footrest** https://m.magellans.com/itemdy00.aspx?T1=MIF507+BL

I carry one with me everywhere &amp; use it at doctors' offices, restaurants, &amp; anywhere with chairs in waiting areas.

I have a second one that I've used at the same time - as a backrest - so that my knees can be bent at the edge of the seat but I'll still have back support.

This is how I adapted numerous college classroom chairs to support my feet &amp; provide back support while earning my degree, &amp; these continue to be extremely useful for job interviews, as we as really long meetings &amp; office wait times.

**Dragon Naturally Speaking** http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-pc/index.htm

THE voice recognition computer program that actually does let you control, navigate, &amp; utilize every program &amp; aspect of your computer by voice.

I purchased the Student Edition through my college bookstore (students of all ages can get a big discount, last I knew), &amp; this is how I completed the extensive coursework, from report writing to complex financial spreadsheets to PowerPoint presentations to extensive internet research, to earn my degree.

Dragon gives me the ability to complete work, fill out medical paperwork, read and post to social media, and access the digital world we all live and work in.

**Samsung Galaxy SNote, 10.1 (2013 edition)**

I use this tablet for note-taking, as I’m able to write notes using just one finger.  It served me extremely well during my graduate classes, and continues to serve me well during doctors’ visits &amp; scheduled meetings.

**Phone App for Writing** - using just a finger http://inkredibleapp.com

This app lets you use just a single finger to jot down notes on your phone. Extremely handy, especially as it's on the device I generally always have with me.

I love this app, as I can't physically hold pens well enough/long enough to write, &amp; had struggled to find a more portable option than my heavier, bulkier SNote tablet (which is excellent for meetings, but not so much for a quick note to 'get XYZ' or reminder to 'call QWERTY').

This app has been immensely useful in filling my need for a portable, always-on-hand note-jotting AT.

I also use an automatic hole punch, an automatic stapler, and can only enter buildings that have automatic doors (which FAR too few have, unfortunately).  I use elevators, as well, because of both asthma and the fact that I can't hold onto/grip a railing to save my life.",,,3,0,0,

I'm in Australia and I find that the people who are the most accepting/helpful are Muslims.

I was mostly using a manual chair until I got a second hand power chair (waiting for my actual chair still) and I have a lot of trouble using it. I've been using it for about 3 years now but I find I have a lot of trouble with terrain. So I've struggled and had trouble in the past with hills and the like.

I've been pushing myself up a hill in a busy train station, people rushing past me and I'm struggling. The person who stopped, asked me if I needed help and helped was a Muslim.

A big hill near my house is really hard and I have to go backwards to have any chance of getting up it. There was a Muslim lady and her child in a park nearby. She gathered up her kid and came over to ask me if I needed help.

I find that from most other people I get either pity or anger.

If possible, I would actually suggest not doing this. The problem with doing things over the phone is that what the examiner puts down is what becomes the record. If you get a good examiner who documents well, and who asks follow up questions, then that will work out into your favor. But if you have an overworked examiner, they will probably paraphrase and leave stuff out. Mailing it in makes your words the official document. 

For example: 
lets say that the question is ""do you cook for yourself""

on the phone you say ""I do cook for myself sometimes, but other times I don't have the motivation to make food. I eat a lot of microwave/frozen dinners because it requires no preparation. I wouldn't be able to pay attention long enough to follow a recipe, and I would just get frustrated and quit. Sometimes I don't eat all together.""

What gets noted: claimant is capable of cooking for themselves. cooks simple meals in the microwave. 

Now, does that accurately convey the information? Not really. Examiners are trained to listen for key phrases and answer central questions as they relate to the case. So those questions about taking care of your personal hygiene, cooking, cleaning, etc is getting at the central question ""can they take care of their daily needs?"" The expanded reply shows difficult with preparing even simple meals, but the condensed version implies that they have only minor limitations in this area.

Part of the reason that SGA and SSI awards were set differently may have to do with the fact that SSI was a program created after SSDI.  A quick look suggests that the disparity between the growth rate of SGA and benefits awarded has to do with the fact that they are calculated using two different formulas, the cost of living adjustment, and the wage-based adjustment (both first passed in amendments from 1972).

The Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) adjusts for increases in prices, whereas the wage-base adjustment corrects for increases in wages. The purpose of the COLA was to maintain the purchasing power of benefits already awarded. The purpose of the automatic adjustment in the wage base was to maintain the relative value of Social Security benefits for future applicants. 

However, the procedure for adjusting for price and wage increases was flawed from the outset.  It almost immediately began causing problems, and needed to be amended in 1977. The 1977 amendments also tried to tackle some funding problems which became apparent almost immediately after the 1972 amendments.  

Basically, it became apparent that Social Security faced a significant funding shortfall, both in the short-term and in the long-term. The short-term problem was caused by the bad economy, and the long-term problem by the demographics associated with the baby boom. By their 1975 report the Trustees said the Trust Funds would be exhausted by 1979. This financing shortfall was addressed by the 1977 Social Security Amendments. These amendments raised the payroll tax slightly (from 6.45% to the current 7.65%), increased the wage base; reduced benefits slightly; and ""decoupled"" the wage adjustment from the COLA adjustment. These fixes restored the long-term balance of the program for the next 50 years (but not the full 75 years used by the actuaries). Despite this, major amendments in 1983 would be needed to avoid short-term funding problems, and to address the remaining long-range program deficit.

To date, we still face major solvency issues with the disability trust fund.  Part of the way congress and SSA try to keep those funds solvent is by limiting payouts to a sustainable amount.  

TL;DR:  The increase is small because the fund will go broke if we increase it much more.  SGA and SSI increase at different rates because they look at different things.",,,3,0,0,

My best diet tips are to prepare your own food as much as possible from whole foods (unprocessed, not the store), and to buy smaller plates.

Preparing your own masks from scratch let's you know what's going into them and helps you control the level of ingredients like butter and sugar.  Also, many unhealthy foods are a huge pain to make.  For example, I never fry anything because it's massively annoying to do yourself.

Then I was on SSDI (because I had worked enough to qualify for that instead of SSI) for seven years until I finished recovering from my injuries and after finishing college. I then went back to work for 26 years, until my initial disabilities, plus secondary disabling conditions that I developed along the way, and simple aging left me unable to do enough work to be gainfully employed, so I now receive SSDI again, and work a little part time, when I am able. 

If you have a diagnosis as being on the ASD from a physician, phychiatrist, or psychologist then you have a disability, in a medical sense. The fact that you’re seeing a therapist also confirms that you are medically qualified as disabled. Having a disability doesn’t mean you can’t work or that you shouldn’t ever work or even try to work. It just means you have a physical or mental condition that impacts a part of your life. There are millions of us out there, welcome to the club :)

I think it’s brave and admirable that you want to work despite the fact that you have a disability. In addition to being disabled, I’ve worked with at least a couple thousand other people with disabilities through jobs I’ve had with companies and agencies that help people with disabilities. There are many people who would give up without even really trying to find work if they have or acquire a disability. They would get on SSI and live their life without even trying to get not only the money, but the fun and satisfaction a person can get from working.  

The Social Security Administration is the government agency that you’d be interacting with if you choose to apply for SSI. While it is clear that you have a disability from a medical sense, they decide if your disability is severe enough from a vocational sense to mean that it keeps you from being gainfully employed. This process can be very technical and it requires a lot of paperwork from your past and current doctors, therapists and any past employers that you’ve worked for.

I would strongly recommend that you find an attorney that specializes in Social Security Disability to help you through this process. They take a percentage of any back pay you receive if your case is decided in your favor (you get the cash benefits you would have received from the date you applied for SSI through the date your case is decided, if the case is decided in your favor). You don’t pay them anything if you lose. You said that your therapist recommended that you apply for these benefits. A lawyer specializing in helping people qualify for SSI / SSDI can give you a good assessment, usually during an initial meeting, whether they think you’d qualify for SSI benefits. Because the lawyers only get paid if they win, they aren’t going to take a case that they don’t believe has a chance of winning. Be prepared for this process to take a while, up to a year or two. Also, you’ll likely be turned down the first time, so don’t let that discourage you. Your lawyers will help with your appeal. It’s a normal part of the process. 

[Every state has a vocational rehabilitation program] (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/WorkingatFDA/UCM277757.pdf). This program is available to all people with disabilities whether they qualify for SSI or not. They can help you find work. I would also contact your state vocational rehabilitation agency and apply for their services. They should be able to take your application over the phone, and they will pay for any tests or assessments they need to determine if you qualify for their services. Once you qualify you’ll develop an employment plan with your vocational rehabilitation counselor. These plans can be simple and short, or long and span years. What they will help you with is the costs and planning associated with getting any skills, education or other forms of assistance that lead to you achieving your employment goals. 

What I’m suggesting to you is that if you want to work, you should begin looking for whatever help and supports you need to address any barriers to being employed that you have as soon as possible, at the same time. 

Tell your therapist that you’re open to pursuing SSI as a temporary support as you work towards being employed, but that employment and financial independence is your goal. 

Contact a lawyer that specializes in SSI to get their assessment as to whether they think they can help you.

Call your state vocational rehabilitation agency and tell them that you’d like to apply for services. 

Lastly, be honest and open with all the people you interact with. 
The better you communicate your reality and circumstances to them, the better they will be in helping you achieve your goals. 

Good Luck!

Make sure you see at least two or three different doctors/psychiatrists. The more documentation you have from different sources with the same diagnosis, the better. Get every single medical record that pertains to your condition. Hospital visits, urgent care, etc. Get written statements from your healthcare professionals explaining why they believe you are unable to work in any capacity. That's the super hard part right there. You have to prove to them that you can't work any type of job, due to your condition. The more you send them, the better. Even if you're not sure if they'll want it, send it. Also, copy everything in triplicate, send two copies of everything to them, and keep an exact set for yourself. Log all correspondence with dates and times. Don't be afraid to contact your case manager after you're assigned one. 

Most people get denied there first time because they are unprepared. You need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've turned over every stone, gotten a second and third opinion on your diagnosis. Have more than enough medical documentation to prove what you've gone through. And make sure it's all filled out properly. A lot of people don't realize that you can request to fill everything out over the phone with a case worker. It's the best way.

If you are on SSI your payment gets decreased $1 for every $2 you make. If that's what you get (maxes at about $733, you get your check on the first) then you're going to owe money back. If there was a month you were owed 0 but used Medicaid you'll have to pay for the services you got too.

I've seen all the usual reactions, and I put them in 3 categories - 1. Pity, sympathy, that look of ""poor you""; 2. Fear - ""he doesn't look that old, and if it can happen to him will it happen to me?""; 3. Disgust, not so much because of the wheelchair but more because of the way the government and media in the UK has demonised anybody receiving welfare benefits, and portray them as a drain on tax-payers.

A while ago my mother took me to Waitrose for a top-up shop. Waitrose is a sort of expensive supermarket in the UK, but I was only getting bread, milk, etc. Sitting waiting at the checkout and and old couple behind me started discussing if they bought a wheelchair would the government give them free money. They soon shut up when I told them I receive a disability benefit for my disability, not my wheelchair, because disability is expensive, and if they wanted to buy a chair then mine had cost me £3.5k personally and wasn't provided for me or funded in any way. Another time my mother took me to Iceland, a shop chain that mainly does frozen foods. Its the usual chest freezers where the lids are about upper chest level to me. I tend to look at what's in the freezer then open it and get out what I want, so was doing that and a woman came up behind me and started pushing me out the way saying ""I'll just roll you out the way for a second so I can get in"". I immediately grabbed my rims, spun round, and literally exploded at her to the point she put her basket down and ran out of the shop. The manager later approached me to apologize as he has just watched the camera footage, and gave me a £20 voucher towards my shopping, which was nice and unexpected.

My biggest gripe though is people always assuming I need help. I specifically chose the rear handgrips on my chair so they fold out of the way to discourage people trying to push me. Even my family - xmas day went to parents and dad hovered and held my chair every time I transferred despite my telling him I have to do this a couple of dozen times a day alone. If I need help then I'll ask.

I was hired to work for a Personal Injury attorney: started off good but of course, there were issues throughout with my health. I struggled with anxiety as well as I try to be as close to perfect as possible and hate letting people down...I get self-worth from my job.

Just because a sibling had the same condition does not mean that your case will also be an allowance. There are 3 conditions that are allowances based on diagnosis: ALS, Downs Syndrome, and Xeroderma Pigmentosum. There are also a few cancer diagnoses, but that is a bit different than genetic conditions.  

That does not mean that you *won't* be allowed, but I don't want you to think of the medical portion as a ""slam dunk."" 

You were working 2 jobs, and going to school. Your main job ended not due to your condition (accommodations irrelevant here) but rather because the location closed. So had the store not closed, you would still be working (and capable of working). And while your school and work-study won't be counted against you on the non-medical portion of the claim ($750 is under SGA) it will be counted against the medical portion. It goes to your ability to function. 

I understand that your job gave you a crazy amount of accommodations, but because that job did it, another job might. You mention the accommodations being the ability to sit and reduced physical tasks; that to me implies that you could still work a sedentary job. SSDI is designed for an inability to do ANY job, and does not take into account how easy it might be to find that type of job. ",,,2,0,0,

Sadly, no one knew about this ""wonderful"" trick my heart does until I was 15 and coded several times. Eventually, they were able to stabilize me and put in a automatic implanted defibrillator or an ICD. Now, this was all pretty traumatic of course and it took years working with my doctors to find the correct medicine and dosage and all those other fun things you have to do when you get diagnosed suddenly with a deadly illness. And lucky me, I live in the US which means that all of this added up to over a million dollars of debt for my parents. Btw, this all happened in a fairly small town so by the end of the day everyone in it knew what had happened to me and eventually what became of my parent financially. 

1) Skip forward about a year and I am happily eating my lunch at school with 2 of my best friends, when one of them randomly says, ""Do you ever feel really guilty about the fact that you are the reason your parents are so poor, like maybe if you would have just stayed dead, that they would have more money now?"" Athe time that thought had never even occurred to me before then. I was so stunned that someone would even say that I just said ""Ha!"" Loudly in his face and went to class. It's been about 11 years since that happened, and now that I am older and understand what he was saying, I really want to hunt him down and punch him. 

2) About 5 years ago I moved across the country with my mom and got really lucky finding a really good Cardiologist who specializes in my disease, and about 2 years in one of his head nurses whom I have never met before came in to ask me questions so she could switch all the paperwork over to digital copies. We get to talking and because I'm an Adult she of course feels the need to ask what I do for a living. I told her that I am on SSI. She then asks me how a girl of only 25 ended up on SSI and I try to explain, Russian Roulette Heart, migraines, debilitating back pain ect. Nope, she wouldn't accept it. She sat there lecturing me for over an hour about how selfish I was wasting tax payer money, how I'm too young and beautiful to be ""disabled"", and how really I should be a better role model for other people with heart diseases, like her son, yes her son, who she claimed always lied about being tired, or dizzy, when really he was just lazy, like I obviously was. So, not only was this lady a Cardiology Nurse whom I had never met before and knew nothing about me, she was also a mother to someone with a heart disease and she was saying all this stuff. I never went back there and ended up bouncing from cardiologist to cardiologist for about 2 years and also pushed me into a deep depression. But now I know that even Health Professionals sometimes let their own bias and beliefs cloud their judgment. At the time I thought she was telling the truth so I never did anything about her, now, I really wish I did.

I'm saying to save about $3,000 as you can get a good/reliable 2000 Honda Civic (try to get one with about 150,000 miles or less if you can). Over the life of that car, you will save a lot more money on repairs than if you bought a cheap piece of crap. In addition, you know the car will run. I've had friend's who cars didn't last more than 6 months before needing some expensive repair. With living on disability, you do not want expensive repairs and then shortly after that, having to junk the car and lose all the money you put into it.

Try to get a 2000 Honda Civic if you can. I would avoid the 2001 - 2004 Honda Civics and Accords as they have known transmission issues, which the 2000 Honda Civics do not have that issue. In addition, that car holds it's value pretty good. In a few years, you could resell the car for maybe a few hundred dollars less than you paid.

If you live in a rough area though, I would get something to prevent your car from getting stolen (there is a steering wheel lock you can get). Get the Sedan version of the 2000 Honda Civic. The hatchback and coupe styles are stolen much more.

I have purchased a 2000 Honda Civic last May and other than New tires/Brakes I have not had to put any extra money into that car for repairs.

- Make sure all correspondence with HR and your advisor is in hard copy. No face-to-face conversations or phone calls. Email and letters only. Request things in writing.

- Politely contact HR by email saying something along the lines of ""I understand I was supposed to hear back from you on X date about Y issue further to our conversation/your correspondence on Z date. I appreciate that HR has been closed for the holidays. I have been unable to work for X period of time, is there any chance you could let me know when I can expect to hear back and be able to work?"". This type of thing is all evidence and pushing them like this (politely) will make them realize that you know it's evidence.

- Only speak about this with people you trust. Think carefully about mentioning it to anyone who has a professional relationship with your advisor (e.g. other professors) as he/she may then use this against you. Could argue you created a hostile working environment. You are the injured party here so don't let them change that narrative.

- Definitely try to seek free legal help if you can, see what resources are in your area or your school. I know that isn't always possible. If that's the case, certainly do not show them that you have no back-up. As far as they are concerned they should conclude from their correspondence with you that you are prepared to take this further. You do not need to explicitly say that at this stage, you just need to appear confident and in control of the process and that means staying on top of things and getting as much as possible in writing.

The RFC is based on your medical records. While I understand you saying you have not been able to lift 10 pounds since 2013, SSA has specific methods of evaluation. They do take your physical limitations into account, and they do read it, but they also read the medical records.

But my #1 recommendation is keto; a number of people with pain issues find help from it, and while it didn't help my pain I felt otherwise awesome on it and was losing weight at a very steady pace. 

As for exercise, perhaps slowly ramp up the distance you walk? Find a distance that tires you but does not flare you up, and work at increasing that distance by a few minutes each time. That approach has worked really well for me, last May I could walk maybe 20 minutes before hitting a wall for a day, now it's hours.

There are small moments where it seems empowering, but it still essentially operates as a modern freak show. There's a very interesting video about a disabled dating show by one of my favourite disabled YouTubers, Jen Campbell, and although she doesn't name the show, they all operate in a similar way. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0igM_5BVA&amp;index=21&amp;t=333s&amp;list=LLs2Ex66BPK927Dr9e4_p69g
For me, they all work off the premise that disabled people are either tragic figures who are burdens and therefore need someone 'really special' to be with them (aka take a bullet for all able-bodied people), or a something to be belittled and secretly laughed at (mostly people with mental disabilities). I don't think this reflects the reality of dating for most disabled people, and shows like this certainly don't help. It effectively reduces someone's identity to one aspect (and while of course disability can be a huge aspect, it is not the only one). I have a chronic, and sometimes pretty severe, heart condition, and my long-term boyfriend is able-bodied, and while some aspects of our relationship are affected by it (such as physical limitations, sometimes needing to spend time in hospital, etc) our relationship is built on a basis of respect and equality. 
Of course, this is just my opinion and experience, but I feel that The Undateables shows dating when you're disabled as either being reliant on an able-bodied partner, or having to date someone else with a disability. Really, Jen Campbell expresses far better, so I recommend watching the video!",,,1,0,0,

Today in my class we talked about addiction issues.  One of the ""tell tale"" signs of addiction according to them was ""being fidgety"".  It got to a point where the professor told everyone that the things they were naming sounded pretty generic and cliche, like all people with some issues basically look the same; practically discriminatory.  

People are so uninformed these days.  They see active shooters in the news and homelessness and think schizo or ""psycho"".  A lot of people generalize.  I stopped seeing my therapist recently because I got this vibe from him that someone like me doesn't need much and doesn't experience much either.  It's like all i need is food and water, that and whatever else I can do to occupy myself. 

In that class today, I don't know, maybe I was making this up in my head, but I felt like I fit the description of what they described a drug addict looks like.  It always seems like people beat around the bush with this issue and yet I'm fairly certain people like me get the idea when this is going on.  I'm fairly certain I have asked people that I know what they meant, you know, not as intimidation by any means, but why people sometimes have these social cues of:  ""oh the disabled person is here, make sure we don't openly say something offensive"". Sometimes I feel like that's how silent racism works.  Everyone seems to agree with each other and when you interject you get ignored or left out of the group.

&gt;Tonight my grandmother made three separate comments that I was mentally slow, when she KNOWS I graduated manga cum lauded from a prestigious college. I finally got so upset when she did the third comment I said ""my legs stopped working but my brain didn't.""

&gt;I don't want to be a bitch but dammit if it doesn't bother the hell out of me.

Have students bring in books they'd like to donate to your cause (college kids always have a ton of books even if they don't have money). Then hold a used book sale on campus or nearby somewhere. 

Let the students who are donating books know what your intentions are as far as using their books to sell for a cause. Selling the books (as opposed to a bake sale) for charity also gives you a marketing point in terms of fundraising for learning disabilities. I.e. Books=written knowledge and reading can be difficult for those with learning disabilities

Any books not sold could then be saved for future sales or donated to groups in need.

I absolutely loved my high school so it was painful to have to leave during my senior year. He wasn't fired, probably because his position as dean was only temporary and he was doing the school a favor by taking on more responsibility. The dean the school had for ten years left, and he filled the position at the last minute because the school couldn't find a more qualified replacement. He was actually the head of college counseling before so he went back to that job this year. I heard through the grapevine that all the teachers hate him. My teachers all expressed to me how disappointed they were with his decision which was comforting. He really messed up the school. 

That's a really keen observation, I never thought about it that way but you're totally right. I don't know if I'm more surprised by people in positions of power discriminating against disabled folks or close family and friends... honestly it's pretty shocking whenever it happens.

That being said I have a hard time believing that nothing medically works, there are some pretty stand up drugs that people who have Crohn's disease are on for many of the same symptoms as IBS, so medically there has to be a med that works.

We have a really amazing zoo in my city, but it goes up a mountain, literally.  I've noticed that it's almost worse if I get the wheelchair than if I just use my forearm crutches here.  I've had people let their children climb onto my lap and physically hurt me, and even had people move me and my chair aside because I'm not allowed to look at an animal for more than 3 seconds?  I have brightly colored hair, and there's a baby orangutan at the zoo that loves bright colors, and she will run to them when she sees them.  So I purposely parked myself on the opposite side of the enclosure from the baby, since all the kids were over there, and this was prior to me finding out about the bright colors thing.  In a few minutes, I found myself literally face to face with the little gal, and all the kids run over because the baby went that way.  I had these parents saying I wouldn't mind if their kid sat on my lap, etc, and I was like, ""Actually, I do.  You don't know the nature of my disability, so please keep your kid off of me,"" as politely as I could, and then that woman said I was mean and unlocked my breaks on the chair, and physically just pushed me hard once away from the exhibit.  All because I'm disabled, and I apparently am not allowed to enjoy things at all.  My husband and I were pretty upset, and I was actually crying because I was so mad.

I've also noticed that people do not move out of the way of disabled people here either.  I'll be on my crutches or in a chair, and have to yell at people to move so I can get by, most of the time, they force me into the gutter.  Apparently, rich people don't like the disabled, because it's always more well-to-do people who do this here.  I've never encountered this prior to moving here, but I also didn't know I had a disability until I had moved here either.  I just knew my body hurt all the time, and I dislocated my joints a lot.

I also see a lot of these same people parking in handicapped spaces everywhere without permits.  I guess their saving a few feet to walk trumps my needing to save those same few feet which would mean the difference between me getting half of my grocery shopping done, and all of it because my husband isn't exactly the smartest or best shopper, so I cannot just leave him to get what we need and make good decisions about which item is better/cheaper, etc.",,,2,0,0,

Your sister may be in denial of the events, but (I don't have TS) is it true that when someone mentions your tics, the stress can increase their frequency? 

I don't know if you can change your sister's mind, but let her know that her unsolicited advice can make your tics worse (if it actually does) and I find that this gaslighting/denial of conversations is less about putting you to shame and more about them being embarrassed. People don't like being pointed out when they do something wrong--I've said some ignorant things before and have gotten defensive. As I'm older now I realize that it's ok to admit what you've done and say ""sorry"". So while her advice was shitty, it's best to let her think that you know she didn't mean it, but you have seen your doctor and so only YOU and your doctor know what is best for you.

When I get diabetes shitty advice, I just tell people ""trust me, my doc and I exhaust all options to help me treat it, and only insulin and xxxx really helps. Thank you.""

....Anyway, I know you didn't ask for advice, but that's how I look at it. It's best just to tell people ""Look, I know you meant well, but I know this stuff already and I'd like you to treat me the same as when my TS wasn't obvious."" Sometimes you gotta give a little (telling her and reassuring her that she meant well....even if it is stuff that really pisses you, and I'm sure others, off) in an attempt to keep people on your side.

Is there a website you can give her the link to in order for her to read up on TS? I sent all my teachers links to JDRF when I began college. I still show family and friends this link and it helps them a little. I even tell them, ""No matter your intentions, please don't ever say these things to me."" 

It's interesting--I've had diabetes since I was really little but I came out as bi to my parents when they said some disturbing things about LGBT folks. They reacted fairly positively....only to hear my dad go ""Just glad you're a woman. Women kissing are hot, guys aren't"" in which Mom punched him in the arm and Mom just went, ""We love you no matter what, but it's just a phase. You're already engaged to a man anyway. Pick a lane.""

I'm 23, guys....but I just keep my bi thoughts (lol) to myself. Nice to have a fiance that can agree with me when I find same-sex female relationships worthy of gushing over.

Anyway....sorry, stole the spotlight.

I'm 44, PPMS, virtually parylised from the chest down. Last time I was with a woman in any way was 12th August 2007, just before my feet started getting pins and needles. These days I have ED (though still get morning wood sometimes, the worst possible time for me to put it to use). I can buy cialis online which works, but no matter how horny I am can rarely reach climax. 

I would love to be with a woman one last time, and wouldn't expect the government to pay, but would like some regulation where the women are vetted and trusted. I'm very physically vulnerable (a 10 year old girl could overpower me, beat the crap out of me, and ransack my place) so don't want to risk an escort service because of my vulnerability.

The government can argue against all of the ailments you listed. A lawyer finally told me to go for disability for mental health reasons because the government can't argue against it. There are no blood tests or x rays to analyze. So if you switch your basis for disability to depression or anxiety you will have a much better chance 

Secondly, check to see if you are still covered under disability insurance, have you worked enough to have the required credits to get SSDI?, if not you will only be eligible for SSI. I strongly urge you to do what you can to qualify for SSDI, which will make you eligible for Medicare not just Medicaid.

Volunteering ended up being too much pressure, but the one that I found I can do is adopting deployed servicemembers.

Since all the servicemembers you're assigned are deployed abroad, there's no guarantee you'll get a response back (it's not a penpals service); I've adopted three over the past few years, and only this most recent one has been able to respond to me occasionally.

How old are you now? And do you have physical copies of the records from when you were 18-22? When they do your CDB claim they will have to look at whether they can extend your disability onset date from 23 (your SSI filing date) to 22. I don't *think* that would be an issue. All SSI claims gather medical records 12 months back from the filing date; so they should have records from when you are 22. But if you have physical copies I would make sure to submit them (submit copies, not your originals) to SSA to add to the file. 

For CDB benefits what they will do is take whichever of your parent's RIB benefits are higher, and you'll get about 75% of it. Depending on how much that is, it may lower your SSI amount or stop your SSI altogether. But even if your SSI is lowered/stopped you'll still be coming out better than before **and** you won't have those asset restrictions and its easier to work some. 

edit: forgot to mention; CDB benefits will terminate if you get married (except for a few specific situations like you marry another CDB beneficiary). Just something to keep in mind. ",,,1,0,0,

Crohn's can be tricky, since the condition waxes and wanes. Your surgeries won't come into play because of how far apart they are from each other. Whether your hospitalizations will help depends on how long each hospitalization was. If it was over 24 hours then that helps your case.

I have been a spastic quadriplegic, and have been in a wheelchair for 18 years. I have only been dating for the last five and can count the number of dates I have been on on one hand. In my situation, I have always been the one to initiate a date. Most guys are very uncomfortable with the thought of being more than friends/acquaintances. The dates I have been on have been the result of charity bachelor auctions, but I feel the interaction would have been the same if they would have said yes to a simple request.
It was always up to me to choose the activities for the date, but I always enjoyed their input because they are on the date as well. They were always very standard dinner and a movie.
One thing I particularly enjoyed, or appreciate, is when they don't focus on my wheelchair at all. Not ignoring it per se, but just acting as if it is nothing to be concerned with. Accessibility is already figured into the night, so there is no worrying or stressing about that on the date. During the date, I usually expect to be asked about my disability, which doesn't bother me. To me, it's no different than somebody asking where I was born or what my hobbies are. It's a part of who I am.
Where I can't use my arms enough to feed myself, it is usually up to them to assist me with eating, drinks, etc. or if we are going to be somewhere a long period of time is uncomfortable for me to have my chest strap on, so having them help me get comfortable. I always worry that they feel like they are just another caregiver in this situation, and I still haven't figured out how to beat that frame of mind. They are always more than willing to help, and with them not having a hesitation makes the night go smoother.
As far as being worried about saying something stupid, we all say stupid things, is a learning curve. That's why you're going on a date, to learn about the other person.

When adjusting your diet, cut down on the things that provide a lot of calories but don't make you feel full for very long. In my experience that's largely plain carbs,  like white bread, white rice and potatoes. Whole grain alternatives keeps you full for a lot longer, since dietary fibre fills you up without providing any extra calories. Whole grain foods also have a lower GI, so you won't experience as much of a dip in blood sugar between meals.

But all you really have to do is log what you eat, and then prioritise as you see fit. ",,,3,0,0,

You sound very judgemental for someone who has a mental illness themself. You seem to think 'If they dont have the problems I have or have it as severely, then they should get over it and learn to cope'. People deal with things differently as well. Nobody has the same mindset, some people with depression can handle it while others resort to .. well suicide. Some people with anxiety can go to therapy and come out stronger and can lessen it and make it managable by counting to 10 or taking deep breaths. Sometimes that just doesnt work/help though. Just because you dont think mental illness is serious, doesnt mean it isnt. You can call bullshit all you want, but that just shows how little you care for others and the way they feel and/or react to things. Ive gone to therapy for years, mental hospital, psychiatrists, on soo many meds and NOTHING has helped. You can say I need to power through it, but that doesnt stop my panic attacks, anxiety, rls, depression, bipolar, migraines. My problems are not things you can just learn to cope with.

And also, it's not clear to me if you disclose late if they are free to penalize you for that.

This is a tricky one. I would probably disclose if I was in Australia because my disability is visible and they'd find out at interview and then wonder why I didn't fill the forms in. In the UK I would disclose after the application but before the interview so as not to make it awkward when they see me.

Because there is this annoying form I think you need to think quite carefully about how much help you're going to need down the line from the company. 

If you are absolutely going to need accommodations then I think your best bet might be to disclose now because if you don't disclose and you need those accommodations then you may end up losing the job down the line anyway because they may say they weren't told at the right time. I would try to find out if that is something they can do. Can they fire you because you disclosed your disability after this form? It kind of looks like they can. I'm not sure if that would hold up in court though. Might be good to get some legal advice?

Normally I'm of the opinion that you don't disclose until the job offer or until just before the interview if your disability is super visible. This seems like quite a unique situation though.",,,2,0,0,

A friend of mine interpreted today, and she said they were contracted *way* before the election, and had to promise to interpret no matter who won.  It has nothing to do with the incoming administration.

As for not being on the stage - interpreters are almost *never* on the stage at presidential events.  Not just inauguration, which is *way too massive* for interpreters to be there, but any time - the interpreter is almost always way off to the side.  *Sometimes* they are on the same level, but more often they are on ground level vs the stage.  A different friend of mine interpreted for Obama multiple times and this was always the case.

Not being filmed for TV, though, that I will give you.  Remember, virtually *nobody* who was there today was close enough to see what was happening on stage.  All the members of Congress are up front, they can see, but the public is further back, and they all watch on Jumbotrons, always.  There should *definitely* have been one with an interpreter in split-screen (I know there was in 2009, yet *another* friend of mine did that, not sure if it happened this year, haven't heard), and that should have been fed to TV stations as well.  The interpreters were almost certainly filmed in *some* way, but that wasn't given to TV at all.  I believe the captions were on *all* Jumbotron screens on site, not sure if those were the same captions used on TV - I stayed home, no way I was going downtown today.

**tl;dr** - It isn't McButtface's fault, interpreters are almost never on stage with presidents, they probably *were* filmed today but that footage was not sent to TV stations.

I can say with a high amount of certainty she does not want to enforce disability laws neither federally or within my state.

It's a philosophical belief that children who are disabled should not be in school because they hurt students who are not disabled by needing extra resources or different approaches.

For the record, I have been to both K-12 public schools which she is fundamentally opposed to as well as a private Christian university (which accepted federal funding so was required to accommodate disabilities). The responses I got from my legislators when asking for help was across the board the same regardless of whether it was a private school or public. In essence they did not feel I was worth the effort.

It should also be noted that I do not have an intellectual disability and graduated with the highest GPA in my university. So this argument makes little sense, particularly when an accommodation I required was something simple like adjusted presentations or speeches, or simply replacing that requirement with a paper. I literally would not have drained the system or hurt other students in anyway, since nothing I requested costed the school a dime and in many cases required my workload be increased rather than the teachers. Yet I still needed to go through the federal governments channels and escalate the issues much farther than should have been necessary.

I'm petrified that she will most likely be the person in charge of the federal laws overseeing these personal issues I have already faced. Particularly since I cannot find work and may need to go back to school. I'm unsure if I'll be able to go back because of this, just from fear of a situation occurring where I do need accommodations.",,,9,0,0,

If they revoke your offer because of a disability that can be accommodated for, that is a violation of the ADA. If you were applying to drive a forklife, and you have a double above knee amputation, the company doesn't have to accommodate that. (I don't know anything about amputations, so it's probably likely there is a way to rig up or use prosthetics, but for sake of the example, let's say there's not). Now lets say you applied to drive a forklift, and you have a back issue that requires a special pillow on the seat. Once you have an offer or are an employee, asking for a reasonable accommodation to use your back pillow, which does not alter the nature of the job itself, would be fine. You couldn't be fired for asking to use the pillow (if you are, find a lawyer lol you're in for a nice payday). 

So, no you do not have to disclose while job hunting.

Your lack of treatment as an adult would probably require you to see an SSA examiner (called a consultative exam) in order to get enough information. This would likely be very difficult considering your agoraphobia; however, if a consultative exam is needed, you *have* to go, because it means they need that information. You can ask for a specific gender of examiner, if that helps. 

The autism listings are pretty specific, so I don't think that is the most favorable direction. Anxiety seems to be your biggest issue, social anxiety specifically. I would focus on the fact that you were unable to go back to school or keep a job due to your anxiety. This shows how your anxiety keeps you from completely daily life. If you get a call asking about function or get a function report, be sure to fill it out honestly about your struggles. 

I think you definitely have a reason to apply. There is no reason to be stressed. SSA will only look back three years, so unfortunately, the issues you dealt with in childhood will not be part of the determination.

I think self-confidence combined with a sense of humor will take you further than machismo -- especially humor about your disability! If you can develop some jokes related to your disability, ones that don't reek of self-pity, you can use that to defuse the potentially awkward situations when you display or describe your disabilities.

Most of my friends have been female, and I know the intelligent and emotionally-stable guy nets better ladies than the angry machismo jerk -- those types often attract women with similar attitudes.

&gt; not trying anymore

Just curious about your age -- high school, college? College could bring a markedly improved situation. It is known. The raw hormonal situation of high school kids leads to a more animalistic, less nuanced set of behaviors. 

About your anxiety: I suggest looking into cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). That could help you learn to manage those situations better, help you keep your cool. Perhaps consult a psychiatrist for a mild medication to ease anxiety.  Those can absolutely make all the difference! I wish I had those when I was in school.

Do you think there are any sports you could handle? Ping pong? Just saying, it is essential that you keep yourself in circulation as much as your condition permits. The more time you spend with others, the greater your chances of making connections. Also it keeps your social skills sharp! 

One thing I used to do when I was younger and was trying to build self-confidence: when I was out around people I would pretend to wear the confidence of a admired movie star.

1. His benefits are ceased for fraudulent activity. This cessation can be immediate ( so he won't owe backpay) or they can go back as far as they can prove. If they go back and do a retro-active cease he will owe back all that backpay.

As long as you list all your sources, they are required by law to request them, also required to read everything you submit, which is basically a huge waste of time, because it is duplicate information.

List every condition in your application. We care less about your diagnoses and more about your functioning. Also, SSDI is not based on ""what you paid into it"", it's not a savings account, it's earned income credits for the quarters you have worked.
