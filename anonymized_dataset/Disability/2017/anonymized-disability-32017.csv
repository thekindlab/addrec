Do you still have insurance? If so, please, please look into surgery for carpal tunnel. I put it off until I was waking up with my hands like this almost every day. If I'd realized just how simple the surgery was - only a 15 minute surgery that doesn't even always require a full general anesthesia, I'd have done it so much sooner. Sleeping with wrist braces was such a pain in the butt, and didn't always help. I had my stitches out within a week, and was back to being able to do just about everything I normally could within 2 weeks, and better hand strength than pre-surgery within a month. I had one hand done and then about 2 months later I had the other hand done. In each case I only had 3 stitches in the palm of my hand, and that was with the ""open"" surgery due to the configuration of my hands not being suitable for the lapro surgery.",,,1,0,0,

If your medical expenses add up to $1,000 you still pay the $1,000. Now if your medical expenses are $1,000.01 the state of Florida will pay all $1,000.01 and you pay nothing.

I fought with him about this, which was hard with me being deaf and him being hearing with some hearing loss and he refused to budge.

SSDI is based on work history. If you've been on SSI since you were 21 then you didn't have enough work credits to qualify for the program. So if you tried to apply now you would be instantly denied. 

*However*, since you were disabled between the ages of 18-22 you can qualify for SSDI based on a *parent's* work record. But to qualify for this your parent has to be either deceased, disabled (on benefits themselves), or retired. 

If your parent meets one of those 3 qualifications, you can contact SSA to see about adding what are called CDB benefits. You would be able to draw about 75% of what your parent gets, less if there are other dependents drawing on that SSN as well.

You can still receive SSI and the CDB SSDI benefits at the same time. But your SSI amount might go down a bit to offset some of the SSDI payments.  This ultimately will depend on how much you earn from each program. ",,,1,0,0,

Does Cigna also offer long-term disability? This would be the point that they would transfer you to the LTD side of the house, since your condition is no longer considered ""short term"". If you do not have LTD insurance, then that is why they are cancelling your plan. STD is designed for people to only be paid for a shorter amount of time with the assumption they return to work. So you no longer ""medically"" qualify because its not a short-term condition. 

I've never worked in private disability insurance, so don't take my word as gospel. But I do have general knowledge since I encounter these companies a lot, and a lot of former disability examiners, when they leave the state, move to private industry. 

A lot of these companies will require you to pay back any money they gave you if you receive back SSDI payments for the same timeframe. Or at least the difference between the two. So if you received $1500 from Cigna, and your SSDI payment is $1000, then you owe Cigna $1000. 

If your onset date is when you stopped working in September though, you shouldn't owe them any money. SSDI payments don't kick in until the 5th month (which for you should be Feb or March depending on the day you stopped work), so you shouldn't be getting any back pay. 

There is someone in that office that is in charge of at least fielding phone calls and questions. Often times its hard for people to just pick up another person's case, because they don't have the knowledge of what is going on, and that kind of stuff doesn't make it into the case notes.

That sounds like the crux of the problem.

I recognise how limited and minor my needs have been, so that's why I ponder the question.

It's a very different experience, and trying to explain it to someone who can hear -- even if they are also isolated due to a disability -- is still difficult. 

We sit at dinner during holidays having little to zero understanding of what others are even saying, and people usually don't talk to us simply because we are too difficult to communicate with. I've had fellow disabled brethren in wheelchairs or developmental delays, ignore me because they can't speak with me. 

It's a special and personal kind of soul crushing hell that no hearing person can empathize with. The closest thing I can think of is to live in a new country, literally not being allowed to learn their language, and being left out because no one speaks English or wants to learn how to. You don't get jobs. You get ignored when you want help at the supermarket. Otherwise kind people don't want to bother befriending you. In general people assume you're mentally retarded because you can't understand them. 

And you can't ever leave. 

Edit: Regarding schooling, it's much easier being in a classroom where you can be fully immersed into the learning experience instead of relying on a middleman (interpreter), in a deaf school. Unfortunately most of them are not of the same quality, education wise.

As the dominant force in the health market with regard to long-term care, births, and persons with mental illness, it is the next frontier of welfare reform. It is simply too big and too flawed to be administered from Washington. Most of the vaunted expansion of health insurance coverage under Obamacare actually has been an unprecedented expansion of the Medicaid rolls in many states. We applaud the Republican governors and state legislators who have undertaken the hard work of modernizing Medicaid. We will give them a free hand to do so by block-granting the program without strings. Their initiatives — whether premium supports for purchasing insurance, refundable tax credits, alternatives to hospitalization for chronic patients, disease prevention activities, and other innovations — are the best strategy for preserving Medicaid for those who need it the most.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1489090712,"Yeah. Here's the deal: SSA can and does contact physicians for more records and more information. You don't know, but they may be holding a transcript from her that says she doesn't believe it's as bad as you say, and that she thinks you need to get back to work. I would have told you to never, ever apply for disability without your physician's backing, but you're beyond that right now.

Given what you've just said -- and remember that I'm no one important, I'm just a guy on the internet who happens to be familiar with the process -- you need to see a reputable attorney *immediately*. They will be honest with you, because they only get paid if you win. If they tell you that you have no case, *trust them*. You really need legal advice on whether to file that appeal/follow through with that appeal.

Remember, if you lose your ALJ appeal the chance of you getting disability in the future goes down dramatically.

You may need to consider scrapping the appeal and going back to work for a few years while you find a good doctor. Have her get very familiar with you/your case, and only apply when you have her backing. Maybe two years. But I don't know your personal situation. And remember that ultimately your disability check is based on your earnings over the last year or so (highest three quarters, I believe).

It's hard to give solid advice without knowing the whole situation -- and yours keeps unfolding -- but I think you definitely need to back up and take honest stock of 1) whether or not you actually can work, especially looking at your ability to have a work-from-home call center job at somewhere like Apple Care or American Express (sitting up in bed and working an online call center is a common bottom measure for the jobs specialist at the ALJ hearing), and 2) whether or not you actually have a solid case for disability.

That's not to be harsh, but 5 ER visits in 3 years alone is not a solid case in almost any situation. You need years of physician and pharmacy records, and generally more than one doctor, all of whom agree that you need to file for disability and who will testify to that when they are called to (because your lawyer may want to call them or get a written statement). Letters of support are not strictly necessary but they help a lot and expedite the situation. It's a long and frustrating process that you need to be really well prepared for. I gave them well over a thousand pages of documentation for my claim.

At this point, the only thing I can say is the same thing I've said since my first post: you need to go find an attorney. Now that I know where your level of documentation is, I would say it's imperative.

You'll want to make your flight arrangements over the phone directly rather than online through a travel site. You can either check your wheelchair as baggage or check it at the gate - I highly recommend the latter! Let the person making your reservations know what level of assistance you will need in getting to your gate. Even though I had my walker, we had someone suggesting that my husband put the luggage on my walker, and that they put me in a wheelchair as it was a very, very long walk that actually involved getting on a light-rail like shuttle to another Terminal at the Sea-Tac airport. I was very grateful for the heads up. The walk would have taken me forever!

Once you get to your gate, go up to the desk and tell them you'll want to gate check your wheelchair if you didn't check in at the baggage desk. Your wheelchair DOES NOT count against your baggage limit! It flies free! Either way it will be tagged like luggage though.

Ask to pre-board along with others with special needs. If you do that you'll be in the first group to board before things get crowded. You'll take your own wheelchair down the jetway to the door of the airplane and at the door you'll transfer to a much narrower, armless (I think!) wheelchair that is made to fit the aisle of the plane. They asked if I wanted to use it but I opted not to. They'll also bring this when/if you need to use the restroom though I don't know how accessible the bathrooms on the flight will be. I am on the larger side and have avoided using airplane bathrooms.

Normally they disembark row by row. That may be different with a wheelchair user on board if they need to get the transfer chair down the aisle. They may get you off first or you may need to wait until everyone else has disembarked. Be sure to let them know ahead of time that this is your stop and you aren't continuing on, and ask how it will be handled before you land. Either way they'll use the aisle wheelchair again, and if you gate checked your wheelchair it'll be waiting for you at the jetway.

My guess would be that you'll want an aisle seat for convenience. The outside arm does not raise/lower so I that may or may not prove to be a challenge in getting in/out of the seat from the transfer chair.",,,1,0,0,

Misunderstanding the rules happens, but it's not enough to get off the hook completely. Depending on how much evidence there is, you may have some success negotiating the *amount* you have to repay, but the fact is - you did work. 

The trial work period is a non-consecutive period of 9 months in a rolling 60 month window. That makes no sense - I don't expect anyone to understand what that means. A trial work period isn't a set span of time, it's a concept. If you work, and your gross earnings exceed a certain amount for each month, you have used one trial work month. You might use one month and not use another for 3 months, or 3 years - just depends on the amount of your earnings. 

*I just had my spouse read this next section - they zone out when I talk about work, so if they understand this, hopefully you can too:*

The best way I can describe it is to imagine an infinite calendar (which shows months only) on a slider. There is a window which only displays a 5-year period at a time. As time progresses, the old months are obscured and new months are revealed. Every time your gross earnings exceed a set amount, that month is counted as a trial work month. If enough time passes between work attempts that some of the older months have moved into the obscured area of the past, then you get more months. If at any point, you have 9 of these months counted within that visible 5-year period at once, you've completed your trial work period. 

Once you've completed the trial work period, you enter the next stage - the extended period of eligibility. This period lasts for at least 36 months. During this period, they look at whether or not you are performing substantial gainful activity (SGA). This is again, a set dollar amount each year, but certain things can be deducted, sometimes earnings can be averaged within a year, and they can take into account special accommodations made by employers. During this period, if your earnings were **below** SGA in a month you **were** due payment; if you were **above** SGA during a month, you **weren't** due payment. A person may work for a while and have their benefits suspended, then stop working and begin receiving payments again. If they earned SGA after the 36 month period was up, benefits terminate. 

Throughout this whole process, unless a person is reporting their work changes and earnings each month, there is no way for Social Security to know whether payments were actually due. Any payments made for a month which was subsequently determined to be an SGA month is now going to be considered an overpayment - as you've now learned. 

That is where beneficiary reporting responsibilities come in. Generally by the time a person gets to where you are, they've received their reporting responsibilities multiple times - in writing. I would love to say that they've certainly been explained to you as well, but we all know that this isn't always the case. 

If you don't believe you are at fault, and you can't afford to pay it back, request a waiver of the overpayment - complete [this](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-632.pdf) form and submit it to your local office. 
If you believe the *facts* that they have are incorrect, request a [reconsideration](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-561.pdf). 

Whichever form you submit, either take it in and get a copy date stamped, or keep a copy for yourself and mail it in by certified mail. Once it is received in the system, they'll halt collection activity until a decision is made. ",,,5,0,0,

I therefore hope it may be of value to make myself available here to answer any and all questions on the subject that people may have. To get that going I will start by addressing some of the points which have already arisen.

1. It is not obvious to me that a congenital brain dysfunction clearly qualifies as a mental illness. For example, Cerebral Palsy is not usually thought of as being a mental illness.

2. A large majority of people with BIID do not seek to reduce their ability to live independently.

3. The disorder is not rare. Almost everybody has met someone with BIID. The 2012 University of Amsterdam study shows why BIID seems more rare than it is in reality. They indicated that around 50% of respondents had told nobody at all about it. The other 50% had told only their psychotherapist and/or their spouse about it. People, such as myself, who are completely open about it are indeed extremely rare.

4. Regarding whether people with BIID have a place in the disability community, I point out that majority of people with BIID already have substantial physical disabilities not of their own choosing. Moreover, in the last three years administrators have invited me to join approximately 20 on line  disability support groups with full knowledge of my openness in regard to BIID.

5. The treatments recommended to me by Michael First, the psychiatrist who is the world expert in BIID, are to use a wheelchair and to not be secretive about BIID.

6. Those who are both transgender and who also have BIID invariably say that the experiences of both conditions are extremely similar to each other.

7. People with BIID almost always get a great deal of mental health care. This helps enormously with self esteem and self acceptance. It is recognised by mental health care professionals that neither psychotherapy nor medications are effective in reducing the feelings of BIID itself.

8. Surgery for BIID is indeed not available in the USA.

9. It is extremely rare for anyone with BIID to go on disability benefits unless they were already on them because of disabilities not of their own choosing.

10. Munchausen Syndrome is not at all in the same category as BIID. Those with BIID are usually introverted and seek specifically to AVOID any attention.

11. Studies on those with BIID who have achieved their needed disability show that they are happier, less depressed, better able to function in life and feel LESS disabled than they did before.

12. I shall endeavor to answer any questions at all, regardless of whether they are about BIID in general or about my personal situation; no holds barred...",,,2,0,0,

e8e9a173-ec1e-4835-9e3b-db832a168a37,1488820438,"One of the reasons I pose the question, as someone who works in the disability community, is actually related to Transgenderism. While I am Gender Queer myself, and not Transgender, it is now believed that Transgenderism stems from gender dysphoria, which, while different from body integrity identity disorder dysphoria, still operates under a similar premise: the person's body, as it is, does not feel right to them.  
There's been a discussion between myself and a friend about whether or not Transgenderism is a mental health disorder. Something like BIID does strike one as a sort of clear mental illness, because the feeling that a particular part of the body isn't right, and wanting to remove it, interferes with daily living. Whereas, in my opinion, the feeling that one's body is of the wrong gender only interferes with daily living in that many people who are Transgendered have to suffer the reactions of people around them, which are often very negative, to the point of being debilitating.  
Circling back to BIID, if we do accept it as a mental illness, then we do accept it as a disability with the understanding that the individual cannot help how their mind interprets their body.  
With that laid out, what it comes down to is not so much the feeling of wrongness, but the acting on it. Since the latter, while understandable and involuntary in the individual's state-of-mind, is entirely unreasonable and voluntary as a choice made to affect their actual body.  
Either way, it's certainly not easy to think about or talk about. But I feel it's important to have a more public discussion about it. Not only may it help us to identify better methods of how to help people with BIID, we may also discover transferable methods in the conversation about Transgenderism and how we, as a society, can better accept the reality that not everyone sees their body as ""right"", and how we respond to and approach that.",,,4,0,0,

SSI is needs based (welfare). To qualify you need less than $2,000 in assets. This does not include your home or your car. If you are married and your spouse is working you do not qualify. 

SSDI is for people who have worked and paid FICA tax. How much  you qualify for depends on how much you made and how much you worked.

It is very difficult if not impossible to win a disability case while you are working. The rules say you can work while applying, but once you are before a judge they will use working against you.

How old are you? (this is one of the most important factors)

The social security admin person here might be a better source for that, but I'm pretty sure you can request a change if you don't like the way it is working out. 

Anecdotally, I was not thrilled when I was told I would need a payee. I am an adult. However, I do have a history (though honestly the last horrific one was over a decade ago) of manic episodes and blowing serious amounts of cash. It makes me kind of laugh though that blowing $30k on credit cards in a little over 2 months is somehow going to translate into me blowing the little over $400 I get a month. I can't have more than $2k ever so I mean, it's not like I can do THAT much damage even if I was able to. I could mess things up for a month. For sure. That would suck. I would also be in a hospital if I got that out of hand again so... it seems silly. I see the reasoning though so I go with it. 

It DOES suck to suddenly have a leash put on you in that way and honestly, there are lots of things that suck about being suddenly on disability that no one warns you about. Obviously not having to worry about a roof over your head or your next meal is comforting, and being able to see a doctor about your condition Is also helpful. Aside from that, the sinking feeling of being ""disabled"" was not something that I was prepared for at all. No one really adequately warned me about the labeling and how that would feel.

An elevator at the metro station had an Out of Service sign on it and instructed ""customers who prefer to use the elevator"" to contact someone; the assumption that it's just a preference made me very angry (which of course I didn't show). It took forever for this person we were supposed to contact to show up, so I said fuck it and took the stairs, and as I descended, EVERYONE stared, literally everyone. For my own amusement, since it was unlikely I'd be understood, I said, without shouting but theatrically enough, ""I'm taking the STAIRS at the metro, AMA!""

For one, as pointed out, mothers are encouraged to use them because they very often put the changing table in there. I really wish they didn't because changing a baby's diaper takes *way* longer than going to the bathroom, but whatever, there's usually not a better place to put it that isn't going to block traffic flow through the whole bathroom.

More importantly, most ""regular"" bathroom stalls are just designed stupidly. In many cases they are barely useable by the people they are intended for. I can only surmise that they are designed by slim-bodied men. I'm not trying to be sexist here, but statistically speaking there are more male architects than women, and quite frankly men and women use the bathrooms in different ways. Men don't have to think about spreading their knees to change a tampon, for example. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a stall and the toilet paper dispenser is right up against one knee and the little trash can is right up against the other with only a couple inches of space.

I've been in stalls where the door barely clears the toilet and, if you're wearing a dress, you have to gather it all up and hold it up so you can straddle the toilet just to open the door to get out. While you're actually using the toilet, your knees and face are within an inch of the door and you're crammed in there like a sardine in a tin. For anyone with any sort of claustrophobia issues this can be very, very unnerving. There's no use having a panic attack while trying to use the toilet - remember, just because a disability isn't visible/physical doesn't mean it isn't a disability.

Most days now I have my walker with me, so going to the accessible stall is a no-brainer since I don't want to leave it sitting out in the aisle outside the stall.",,,2,0,0,

We haven't discussed it in depth but as I understand it she's not ""technically"" disabled enough to qualify for disability, by the DPSS' metric.

&gt;I would love to meet someone that would put up with my issues and accept me. She's very lucky, I think she just doesnt realize it. Why would she yell at you? From the sound of it you do everything for her and her way, yet she yells at you? That's very unhealthy. 

I don't want to give off the wrong idea. She's a great person but she's got a lot of hardship in her past, especially with regards to her disability so it's a topic she's very sensitive on. Her parents basically gave no fucks and treated the list of things you just don't ever do/say with someone who has a disability as a to-do list, they just canned her up in an apartment for several years with no real human contact.

She tries hard to protect herself and I can't say I blame her.

&gt;Is she on medication? I think she should go to therapy, it would help her out with dealing with her issues. If moneys an issue for that would she qualify for Medicaid? 

Oh yes. Quite a lot of it. Mostly for pain management. She's been avoiding therapy because of the anxiety and she's already on Medicaid. Getting meaningful therapy when you're on Medicaid is incredibly difficult.

&gt;I would tell her how you feel. I would just say you feel under appreciated and wish she would try harder. She may not even realize how these things affect you. 

We've had that discussion several times and I do feel like she's trying, she has also acknowledged that this has been a lot harder on me than we thought it would be. There's just...not a lot of change day-to-day.

I understand I don't *have* to stay with her but leaving feels cruel. She has no job, no real money, very few friends, and some serious medical conditions. Leaving wouldn't quite be a death sentence but it would make for a very dark future for her. I'm basically it in terms of a support system.",,,1,0,0,

I feel as though I'm in the opposite situation, that is I'm getting worse and less accepting. For the record, I am a 36-year-old C6-C7 quadriplegic, almost 20 years post injury.

My condition is in no way to generative, but my pain levels continue to increase and there just isn't enough money or funding for the amount of physiotherapy, chiropractic or massage that would keep me at a point of reaching something closer to my full potential. Of course, mindnumbing and liver destroying painkillers are in great abundance. Oh how I hate using those because what if I really need them at some point for something much more serious, and I know that my mental capacity is never at its peak when I use them. That said, when the pain is gone, I certainly can get a lot of work done but it is best if it does not involve intense thinking.

Everybody tells me what an accomplished, skilled and talented photographer I am. I appreciate their kind and supportive words, especially those that come from people who know better than to say things that are false to me. When I need a good critique of an image, I go to those who will give me the honest answer.

What I see in the mirror is a guy who has a pretty decent intelligence level, talent and experience making fine images but a flaky body that either keeps me down because of pain, poor sleep (often because of the pain) and an unreliable G.I. tract. Some of that is caused by those blessed/damned painkillers when I do choose to use them.

I will quit ranting. I really didn't want my post to say that I am happy for those of you that have accepted you as you are. I feel that the older and wiser I get, the more I try to go out and be part of society, the more I see unfair barriers, both physical and attitudinal, that sap my motivation and make me feel as though I'm really not supposed to even try to live up to the potential that I know I have. I loved the accuracy but hated the bitterness of a post on here a few weeks ago, where one of the replies stated that as long as society refuses to create the infrastructure in which we can fully function, why do we owe them anything to even try? Like I said, I don't like that bitterness but some days it just feels like once I'm done dealing with the obstacles of being disabled I have so little energy left to contribute to society, contribute to my own sense of growth and accomplishment and be the best father, domestic engineer and cook for my family, those who mean the most to me.

I'm Currently in a much better place after having taken a 40 hour MBSR (Mindfullness Based Stress Reduction) meditation course designed for people in chronic pain. 

I have had a daily meditation practice for 4 years and have come to understand that I'm still me;  meditation helped me to gain an acceptance of what my life has become and to take joy in comfort in what I can enjoy and to let go of that which I can't control. 

I get great comfort from breathing; feeling my breath go in and out and knowing that I'm alive and this is my life. I may now appear hopeless to many others, but for me being present in the now and not fighting to be how I would be if I was well has freed me to enjoy the existance I have. 

The MBSR course was designed by Jon Kabat Zinn when he was hired to develop a new means to treat the most miserable and intractable
chronic pain patients. The course uses secular and scientifically developed meditation techniques to treat sufferers who were unresponsive to all conventional treatments and were seen as untreatabke.

MBSR courses are offered world wide by trained and licenced medical providers. It changed my life.

The labeling thing sucks. It's been a few years since I got my disability judgement and I am still struggling with dealing with it. When I first brought it up to the psychiatrist I had at the time, she did say, ""I think this is something you probably need but I hate doing this. I have seen so many people do this and then roll up and give in."" I didn't really know what she meant and I told her that wouldn't happen to me. I was still trying to go to college then and she was my pdoc there. I saw her there until she retired and I pretty much had to leave school at the same time really. 

I TOTALLY understand what she meant. She only really said it that one time. I don't think I would have heard it no matter what so even if someone had sufficiently rang the alarm bells, I don't know that it would have mattered. It's been 4 and 1/2 years since I left school and the only thing that has happened is that I have gotten worse. Nothing is better. I live with my parents. I can't even get myself out of the house really to volunteer. I am isolated from nearly all of my friends. I don't really DO anything. I have let my life slide so far that I don't even know where to start picking things up. It is nice to have health care because I have all kinds of crappy health issues now too- but I am now starting to wonder how many of those are caused by the psychiatric issues that I cannot get under control. Honestly. I was suffering and struggling before but I don't know if struggling wasn't better than letting go and just slowly sinking with a really crappy life preserver. Just my take on it. I'd go back to struggling but I am nowhere near as functional as I was when this whole thing started so... now it's like crack and I'm addicted and I don't know how to get off.

As far as a lot of inquiries, I've only made 3 or 4 during the last 6 years. I've been told about the judgement-proofing issue by 2 separate creditors so it must be a thing. I wish it weren't legal but I have a friend of a relative whose a lawyer. He basically said as long as it's not about the fact I'm disabled (that's illegal), but the about the actual source of my income (being the mostly judgment proof SSDI), then it's legal. Stupid, but legal. Maybe it's a state thing. My state is awfully tilted towards the creditors.

As far as the medical debt, Most of it is very old but it's quite high. The hospitals are demanding a payment I can't afford and they won't budge and since sending partial payments won't help anything I just haven't tried. It would also take me the rest of my life and then some to pay it off at the amount I can afford.

I did find out that being an authorized user is almost as good as it being a joint account. In fact, my score jumped over 200 point when we put my name on them. Maybe I'm having some income to credit? ratio problem there. They're all high balance cards but the payments are always on time. 

 I can use those cards for my own things, but I don't want to muddy the waters. Plus it would be better if i had my own. 

I'll try filling out an application with the suggestions given. 

I guess I'm just frustrated. I have a son in law, 20 years old, hasn't held a job longer than 6 months, new to the state, low income on a job he's had for like a month. He started with a credit union and suddenly got not only an unsecured credit card, he went way negative on his banking account (not his fault, an emergency), they gave him a multi-hundred dollar loan to pay it off more easily and he just secured a car loan of over $8k. I don't get it. I've had a steady income for over a decade, a decent score despite the medical debt and the additional good history from the cards I'm on. My bank, who I've been with for over 10 year with a perfect account history won't give me any better than a $200 secured card. And I can forget about a car loan. I'd switch to my SIL's credit union but I have some features that have been grandfathered in for me that are essential. Plus there are no guarantees that the switch would work out.

At this point I'm just venting and musing. I just wish there was an easier way.",,,1,0,0,

This doesn't seem like it should be legal. I would look into it if you can find a lawyer or disability advocate who has knowledge on the subject. 

Credit score is only one thing they look at. Your total income versus your current debt and other expenses is more important because they want to make sure you will actually be able to pay off your card or if you default they want to make sure your income is high enough that they can garnish wages. 

Also you will hurt your credit if you apply and get rejected from getting loans/credit cards. When a company makes an inquiry into your credit history to see if you qualify for a credit card or loan that inquiry shows up on your credit report. If a bank sees a bunch of recent inquires on your report they consider that a bad thing. You may have already put yourself in a bad place depending on how many times you have done this. Those inquiries stay on your report for something like 3-5 years (I don't remember the exact time offhand). You might just have to accept that you can't get a credit card at this time and work on building credit other ways. 

You can help build your credit however by continuing to make your monthly payments on time with the debt you already have. Also being on your parents card can help, however I think you have to be a joint account holder and not just an authorized user. But I am not 100% sure on that so you might want to look into it.

It's entirely possible that your consistent - albeit limited - income is going to make you more attractive on a mortgage application. You may be surprised to find that it's easier for you to buy a house today than it is to get a credit card tomorrow.

The 'all women are fat/going to leave me anyway' bit certainly isn't helping you. For the record I'm a male, happily married for 5 years to an amazing woman who loves me, is happy to help me, and kicks ass when people are rude or stupid about my disability. That isn't to rub it in, but to say caring, kind people who look past the physical issues are out there. I don't know what your condition is, but these women do exist; you just have to put in the time and effort, and be willing to understand that the person most likely to understand you is someone who has struggled similarly. 

When you're disabled, it's more important than ever to be friends first. 90% of women will discount you at the bar, etc. because people are stupid. But find a hobby/thing you enjoy doing and go to local meet ups or events for it (or even a support group for your disability!). There will be people there. Get to know them. Hang out for a few weeks. Offer to do dinner. Don't *rush* things. Don't hide your feelings, but don't lay it all out there before they're ready for it. If they hint that they're trying to date someone else while y'all are hanging out, cut bait. Find someone new, start over. Worst thing to happen is you get a few happy months with someone cool.

I'm com him ing up on 20 years post injury, as a C5-C6 quadriplegic. I used to love all of those outdoors things, creating things with my hands, hunting, fishing, archery, the satisfaction of hard physical labor and all of those things that I enjoyed and perceived as masculine, making me someone who is self-sufficient and independent. Then comes a broken neck.

Finished school, got a business and accounting education, which was my second choice but I would've rather had my first (won't get into that now). Ended up dropping out of a more advanced accounting program because I couldn't meet the work requirements. Until then, it was minor accommodations to allow me to complete my education. Following that when the real world hit me, I realized my limitations and have been grateful to have the income I do (from an insurance settlement) but I know how much more money I could've made and how much more mental capacity I have than what I am using now. To me that is the feeling of accomplishment and sense of success that I want. Even with income aside, the opportunity to pursue and try harder is what I want. Should I do that, I risk that comfort cushion of insurance income.

Now, a lot of people on here are going to be scoffing at me. So many are just fighting for the basic money they need to stay alive. I have that, recognize the value of it and I do appreciate it. But that does not diminish my desire to push myself further, but risking everything should my accomplished hobby of photography be discovered or deemed as an employable income is so counterintuitive it hurts. And that's just it, I don't make money at it but I might be able to make some if I wanted to. It's just the fear of any kind of success removing my ability to feel safe if I do push harder. Then, the times where my health is not so well I wouldn't be able to earn that income, there's no sick leave when you are self-employed and you know that no insurance company is going to happily reinstate something once they've taken it away, even on a short-term basis.

All of that said, as my pain levels seem to increase my capacity is further diminished and my mind feels restless at times. I try to take solace in the fact that very early on I recognized my limitations, mourned them, then pursued what I could still do reasonably well, even as a hobby but with the potential for a career. I recognize the safety net of that income but I really don't want to be a hermit, hiding from public trying to be satisfied in TV, movies and video games. Whatever I do, I want it to have a greater and further purpose. I also recognize the beauty of my daughter the value of my precious wife and the good things that I do have, including the support of family and friends.

I don't like the idea of giving advice, but what was most important for me was recognizing limitations and working toward something where I could succeed almost as well as an able-bodied person. However, before that disability income came in a residual employability evaluation was conducted on me and the greatest insult, when the questions were being asked about my aptitudes and interests, was the indication that I could be a receptionist at an auto repair shop because I was interested in working on engines. As if answering the phone, even to discuss something I was interested in, was the same as working on it.

I hope you're able to find a solution that you are satisfied with and that will push you, without your limitations feeling like an impassable barrier.",,,3,0,0,

Honestly the best lesson is to just let her drive in the house (block off stairs!), she'll rearrange your furniture, run over your toes, and dent every wall possible. She'll pick it up pretty fast though.

Once she masters inside (where the terrain is flat) you can start going outside where she can start to handle bumps and small hills. You'll notice she'll handle rough terrain differently than nice floors. 

Just make sure she's strapped in tight, arms and legs are inside the chair's foot print (lock the foot rests so they don't fold up on her when she inevitably hits a wall full speed), and the speed / torque settings aren't crazy.

Technically the person reviewing your case at the first stage *could* have gotten them. But that depends on whether you provided them with the hospital's name and address as well as phone and fax for the medical records department. They're employees like everyone else -- they may try to get the records, but if the hospital is delaying/too frustrating, or they're just not feeling up to it -- you might discover that they were never added into your file (and thus never considered as evidence). But that's the *first* stage. No additional records are gathered by the SSA on the second stage, and I don't believe they gather any additional records for the third stage (ALJ) either. In reality, it's all your responsibility to provide when you file.

**But**, you don't need the records at this point -- you just need to file that appeal. I'm not sure about the online system, but I don't think you're supposed to attach any additional forms/records/etc. to the appeal itself. Anything extra (those records in your case) will be brought into court by your attorney on the court date.

You have *plenty* of time to get those records. In most parts of the country the time required between an appeal and your actual court date is in excess of 12 months. I imagine that it's worse in LA.

So don't worry about the records at the moment, I think. Just get them for your attorney, and let him use them on the court date (or submit them beforehand if he thinks that's necessary). 

Of course, I assume you already have your actual DX paperwork, as well as a letter in support of your application from your primary doctor(s)? That should have all been submitted with your application. If you don't have it at all, you might have trouble finding an attorney until you *do* have it. That's because your case is basically unwinnable without formal DX paperwork, and less than average if even your own physician won't write a letter in support.

This is not entirely true either. Your examiner would have requested records from any source you listed in the necessary time frame. Many people give examiner's documentation, and usually 80% of that is useless or not helpful. It's out of date, general hospital paperwork, or duplicate. The examiner would have requested records. You were sent to an exam because an NP is not an acceptable source by DDS standards. That does not mean her opinion and records were not considered, it just means a diagnosis by a PhD was needed.

If your second appeal is denied (which it almost certainly will be. It's only an administrative review, and ~~something like 95%~~ on average 87% of them *are* denied) *then* you find a lawyer. You'll be able to refile the appeal paperwork on your own, and rely on the lawyer to represent you in your hearing.

I always, always *always* tell people to get a lawyer before you file at all. It does help, and then you have them to keep up with the appeals paperwork and to make sure it gets filed in time. In your case, since you have to do it yourself anyway, I'd just wait until you've filed your next appeal to get an attorney. 

I can't underscore this part enough: *Do not go in front of the ALJ without an attorney.*

There are two outcomes, a) I am completely cured and can live a full life why wouldn't I want this outcome! b) My friends and family grieve my loss, I'm not there to care or regret the choice. those closest to me will understand my choice and remember me as having ""died fighting""


However

50/50 for a full life or worsening my current condition - Probably not, I would wait until my current functionality is less (only a matter of time) It's not severe enough now to risk making it worse and having to cope with that sooner than I would naturally have to.

33/33/33 Full life, Worse dysfunction, instant Death - Nope, because this is just a 66% chance of a bad outcome.

50/25/25 - Full life, Worse dysfunction, instant Death - I probably would do this, because it's only a 25% chance of a worse life, which is ""minimal"" compared to the above scenarios, and I have a 50% chance of a full life, or a 25% chance of not caring about the outcome because i'll be too dead to care.



---------------------
This question is somewhat related to my actual treatment plans;

I'm hopefully having surgery this year which has a 2% chance of making my *other* symptoms much, much worse, a &lt;1%-17% chance of killing me (&lt;1% chance in the standard population, 17% chance in vEDS - No data for cEDS so my surgeon quoted 17% just to make sure I have no false hope) and a 5%-75% chance of causing a secondary condition. (5% chance in the standard population, 75% chance in cEDS). The secondary condition can be managed surgically with a 95% success rate, my mum, Grandma and 4 cousins all had it happen and they're all pretty much fine now.

Why take the risk? it's a 100% chance to fix the symptoms i'm trying to mange with this surgery (I'm having a total hysterectomy to resolve my menometrorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, partial uterine prolapse, adenomyosis and issues associated with my bicornate uterus, and prevent the return f my cervical cancer). Other than death, it literally can't fail at fixing those problems. But it can increase my abdominal adhesion's, pelvic organ prolapse, and there's a 2% chance I'll enter menopause, which based on family history and a trail of Lupron in 2007, Will make my other cEDS symptoms worse.",,,2,0,0,

Your authority on the subject does not come from you having the condition.  Are you an expert on what causes blindness since you are visually impaired? Saying that a person with a disability knows the disability best doesn't work when someone is profoundly disabled. If you have someone with severe autism who is non-verbal, do you really think they are the ""expert"" on themselves? 

I am going to be real blunt here, you sound like you are in the wrong major. Calling people who want to help special needs children ""benevolent ableists"" is incredibly insulting. You sound like you want to be an advocate for disabled individuals by...stopping someone from trying to help them? 

There is a lot of knowledge that comes from experience. When I graduated college and joined the workforce I thought I had it all figured out. But then I spent 5 years working directly with the disabled population and it completely upended a lot of what I thought. Working with special needs is not academic, its intuitive.

Its an advantage because it gets you to the hearing faster, and the ALJ has the highest allowance rate (around 60%). The allowance rate for initial claims is about 30% and reconsiderations are about 10%. Reconsiderations are low because they happen right after the initial claim so there isn't really any new evidence in file, so you'll likely get the same decision. 

All that really happens on a recon is someone else looks at the file to make sure the first examiner did what they were supposed to. Sometimes new information is gathered (if you've been back to the doctor) but otherwise its the same information. While each examiner is a bit different, most of the time they are going to make the same decision. A lot of those 10% are the second examiner catching clerical-type errors. 

Skipping the recon has a greater chance of getting you a favorable decision faster.

You mean to say that you meet the eligibility requirements for SSI and SSDI. SSA will decide if you meet the qualifications.

You appear to be seeking disability due to a 3mo-old BP diagnosis.

Are you speaking for Paris specifically? I'm wondering how things may or may not differ between the capitol city and the rest of it.

I meant to ask: When your friend was in Morocco and getting ""helpfully"" grabbed (being grabbed, ugh, they do it in the US too if you're on crutches and I'm guessing moreso if you're a woman, but I should make sure about that) did he have a way to communicate what he wanted while working around the language barrier?

1a37967a-86e1-4963-8431-6d95bf91dfe4,1488684965,"YES ON THIS THREAD, let's DEFINITELY start the disabled traveling discussion!! I had the same concerns about Japan and Korea but GO GO GO it is NOT like that at ALL. In Japan, awareness of other people's needs with regard to anything is paramount, and this includes disability, so that there's a beautiful harmony between always being cognizant of something someone might need and never being overbearing about it. I haven't been to Korea but my partner taught there and can vouch for all the students and teachers being truly sweet to the one boy in the middle school who had a disability. I taught an adult ESL conversation group when I lived in Boston to a Japanese and Korean student who had just arrived in the US, and both never gave a single thought to my disability. They'd gladly help with anything I needed, carrying things etc., but it was never an issue, not even a little bit.

The appearance thing you're thinking about is actually an interesting paradox. Koreans will judge their OWN appearance, out of fear that other people are judging them, and that's where you see the early plastic surgery and whitening creams, but it's VITAL that they never JUDGE OTHERS based on appearance; there's just a culture-wide assumption that other people will so they're armored against that. Not sure if that was as coherent as I'd like it to be so let me know if I can clarify at all or if that makes sense.

I'm guessing it works similarly in Japan. One thing I can definitely say for myself is that a lot of my childhood issues with appearance did come surging to the surface in Japan but that had nothing to do with the way I was treated. There's just an attentiveness to composure the likes of which I'd never seen, so I realized that I have to be VERY comfortable with myself and the way I move the next time I go. This is completely internal though, and I seriously can't emphasize enough, nothing to do with how I was treated in Japan. Both cultures are founded on communal values of always looking out for other people, and you can definitely tell that.

He lost his leg to osteosarcoma as a college student and in 1980 ran across Canada starting in Newfoundland to raise money for cancer research I think.

After Terry's Run, another local guy, [Steve Fonyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fonyo) tried to complete his mission and ended up completing the run across Canada  and later the U.K. He ran into legal troubles later in life and sadly is more infamous than famous.

They handle your case directly and can give you specific answers based on your situation. However, the Ticket To Work program is handled by a separate group within the agency, so questions relating specifically to TTW should go through their help line.

[Ticket To Work](https://www.ssa.gov/work/)

/u/84d9d6a7-4f03-4523-8cd9-5743ff8bbeba is getting the Ticket To Work (TTW) program and the Trial Work Period (TWP) confused...and the TWP info provided isn't correct anyway. 


**Quick summary of the Trial Work Period:**

*Note that this only applies if you're getting SSDI, not SSI.

If you earn over the trial work amount in a month ($840 gross in 2017), you'll use a trial work month. If you do this in 9 separate months within a 5 year period, you've used your entire Trial Work Period. After that 9th and final TWP month, you begin a 3 year period called the Extended Period of Eligibility. During this period, if you earn over SGA in any month ($1170 gross in 2017), you're not due a check for that month.
After the 3 year Extended Period of Eligibility ends, if you earn over SGA, your benefits terminate and will not restart unless you file for an Expedited Reinstatement (EXR) or file a new claim. 

Here are some links for info on the policies mentioned above:

Right now I'm looking forward to resuming therapy because that's the only human contact I get outside of immediate family or the occasional doctor.

Thankfully I am not as limited as I was two years ago, but my world is tiny in a way most people who are used to freedom and autonomy would have difficulty imagining. Not impossible though. I'd accept most people have not considered such a thing. I cant drive which is huge. Being able to work again would be great but the hurdles are near insurmountable.  As far as most are concerned I have no value as a person, I'm only a leech, a taker. In a world where value is defined by ""hard work"" (monotonous shit that will be automated away completely) I'm dead weight. I used to feel like I did something that mattered (not in the grand scheme of things) now I'm just a chore.

Much like the people that wont try to communicate with a deaf person because its cumbersome, people stop talking to you. I've become inconvenient, people that were once friends ignore me. I'm no longer the guy that can do favors, I'm pretty much the guy that needs favors.
I guess I don't have to worry about children though, I'll never have any. I expect to die alone and in extreme poverty.

I have to object to any pissing contests about how other people cant know how bad a certain disability is. or which one is worse etc(so I'm not trying to do that here). I know what its like to use an interpreter, its cumbersome as hell, and the communication barrier that presents is huge, but people can still imagine what all of this is like.

If you're looking for soul crushing, all too many people experience that unfortunately. Imagine what if feels like to feel your life ended before you even hit 40. you get into that ""would it be better to not know the way things were before my life changed forever"" I'm not going to tell anyone they cant imagine that though
IMO its not that no person can empathize, its that you are really saying its a collection of hundreds of things people don't realize and don't have to cope with. Maybe many people don't even care.

I understand that the cost of CCing 20,000 videos is huge, but I don't think they expected immediate results. It could have been done over a period of time, or even just start as making sure to CC all new videos. Since it's the law, they could have received some help from the State for making their videos compliant, so if they were taking their time doing it, it would not have been a huge expense.

They just tooked the easier road of ""fuck it, let's just remove the video"". I'm not going to blame the people of Gallaudet for it (you spelled it wrong, by the way).

People in their 70s volunteer at all of the above, you can and should start by trying these jobs out to gain experience, confidence and professional references.

You love animals? Guess what, so does just about everybody else. That's like saying you think babies are cute. ""Animal lovers"" are a dime a dozen. That's why jobs in the animal care field are hard to get for *anyone*. Nobody, no matter their ability, will have an easy time walking into anywhere that has animal related jobs and getting hired without education and experience. Don't worry though! You can use this to your advantage, because experience is the most valuable thing you can have - your abilities don't matter as much as your knowledge and skill. 

What animals do you want to work with that you think you're going to be lifting 60 lb bags? In what situations? Most (read:all) facilities use carts, wheelbarrows, etc to transport food. Animal care staff are usually supported by a crew of cleaners, facilities managers, etc that do things like lift huge bags and help out with maintenance. Are you talking about a pet store? Try to get a job in the fish, bird or pocket pet departments. Be upfront that you can't lift 60lbs and they won't put you in a position where you'll be expected to.

The only thing holding you back right now is your attitude, OP. I have RA and epilepsy and I've worked at shelters, clinics and the zoo. I'm about to graduate vet school and take an internship at a zoo. Today I spent the day taking care of a foal with short bowel syndrome after 10 ft of her small intestine was resected on day 3 PP. It was a lot of work. I had to spend a lot of the day standing, wrestling an uncooperative baby horse, and walking her mare so she didn't go stir crazy and bite another person. I'm in pain now, but it was 100% worth it because I'm going to get up tomorrow and be able to do it again -- and the only reason I'm going to be taking care of that foal tomorrow is that I took good enough care of her today that she's going to live another 24 hours. Probably.

The good news is that I'm better at my job because I know a lot about autoimmune disease, neurologic disease, steroids, anti inflammatories, opiates... And I know a lot about pain. I am a better doctor because of my illness. It helps me save more animals than I would if I were healthy.

I work out a lot to stay strong, even when it hurts. It's always going to hurt, so I might as well do something productive while I'm in pain. I do my physical therapy. I am upfront and honest about my professors and employers about my needs, like personal protection from infectious disease (I'm immunosuppressed) and breaks every so often.

In my state, they only pick you up and drop you off, not escort you into your destination.

However, if you want to have someone accompany her, you may want to look into a visiting nurse/aide service. You can hire an aide to transport and be there with her or bring her inside and come back for her. Some agencies offer transport services and others do not. My only caution with that would be that you might not want someone like that to sit in on the proceedings, to maintain saftey and privacy regarding their finances. You can stipulate that they remain outside the courtroom/mediation room during proceedings, or see if they can just transport and bring her in, then come back when she's done.

I'd strongly recommend on doing that **if** your father has concrete evidence that they fired him because of his disability. If not then he won't have a good case. They could say his performance got worse or some BS to hide the real reason behind his termination. 

Has he been deaf his whole life or his hearing got worse as he aged? He can definitely apply for disability income. 

I'd also go with the other user's comment on asking DRS for job assistance with disability as they can help your father. I've used DRS in the past and they helped me get my certifications through their system.

Edit: I'd also recommend researching the Americans with Disabilities Act and educate your father on his rights as a disabled individual as many disabled people don't know their rights. I've exercised my rights many times in Ohio because in Illinois (I lived close to Chicago), I have not exercised my rights because everything was accessible-ready. ",,,3,0,0,

She's from Jamaica I think. She has a heavy Jamaican accent and is not sympathetic towards my wanting to apply for disability. Not sure if I should switch psychiatrists but it's looking like maybe that's for the best. 

She's actually told me what to do before (I was told psychiatrists aren't supposed to do that, EVER. Unless your trying to harm yourself) concerning wanting to apply for disability and other things for example she told me I should end a relationship because my partner is borderline/bipolar and  is unmedicated and a handful.

I finally found a good therapist and psychiatrist just to lose them a year later due to my age. I would keep searching, look up reviews online. Therapy would truly help the most if she finds one like my previous. After a year in therapy with mine I am finally able to talk on the phone to schedule appointments. I also feel more comfortable talking.  May not seem like much, but to me it's huge. 

If she's unable to work and you do everything for her, she should have a good chance of getting approved. I would apply, the worse they could do is deny. Which most get denied til they hire an attorney and see a judge. It's a long process so it's better to get started sooner than later. 

That's sad that her parent's are like that. Mine do not care about my problems, they act like the only reason I don't work and do normal things is just cause I don't want to. So they force me to take care of them(since I don't work) when I can barely take care of myself.  I feel for her. Does she have any other friends? I would suggest a support group on Facebook. I'll give you the exact name if you want. It's for mental health but really people vent about all kinds of stuff on there. Everyone's very nice. Only support group I've found like that.

It's definitely a tough spot to be in. I would try encouraging her to get out of her comfort zone, just little things. Keep talking to her and telling her how you feel. ",,,1,0,0,

I have wet myself in line for the bathroom plenty of times. On my good days, I queue in the line for regular stalls, On bad days, when I have my crutches, I use the accessible stall.

I've peed myself in both situations. When you've got 1 stall and 2 people, someone misses out. When you've got 5 stalls and 6 people, someone misses out. Doesn't matter if they're regular stalls or accessible stalls, It's a limited resource, and it's first come first served.

Not getting to the toilet on time because someone else is using it is not exclusive to the disabled community. Yes, it sucks that there are other toilets for able bodies people, while you're sat waiting for the one you can physically use, But what difference does it make to your bladder if the person occupying the store is fully able or not.

If the 5 regular stalls are in use when a 6th able bodied person walks in, and there is no one else in site, and the disabled stall is unused. Why should that woman have to wet her pants, just to leave the disabled stall free on the off chance someone comes in right after her.",,,5,0,0,

""bound"" implies the wheelchair has you trapped. But in reality, the illness has you trapped, the wheelchair is your key to independence. 

Some people still use ""bound"" because they want to express that sense of still grieving lost function. 

I have EDS so I'm in and out of wheelchairs all the time. I'm a part time wheelchair user in that regard, but if I've gone and fully dislocated my hip, I will be using my chair full time for 2 weeks as I heal, during which time I will say ""bound"" to help express that it's temporary and distressing for me to be back in the chair.

Calling me a wh-re, or talking about selling out as ""wh-ring out"" is still the same. 

Both remind me that there are aspects of being a woman that I can never escape and that I never chose. 

That's the thing with slurs. In a way, they're just words. 
Of course. 

The problem isn't the word itself but the experiences of the world that they are connected to. 

Had my best friend not been bullied and called a wh*re after having been raped, had I not heard ""you wh*re, that dress makes me want to put my cock in your mouth right now"" in an empty subway from a man much older, had my sex worker friend been believed by the police when trying to report an actual rape, then maybe o wouldn't have a problem with the word. 

The problem is that it reminds me of how my body is treated as public property for others to touch and comment on when I leave the house even when I'm on my way home from the gym. 
It reminds me of the people I thought were friends until I let them know I wasn't interested in sex, after which I was apparently a dumb wh*re. 
It reminds me of how if I don't want to have sex with my tinder date, I am scared of being raped, beaten or threatened and I'm scared that if I do want to have sex it won't be on my terms and i won't be able to stop the person if they do something i don't like. 
It reminds me of every single time I've been in a professional situation and completely ignored and talked over. 
It reminds me of how I every single day have to choose an outfit that is revealing enough to be seen as a real person, but not so revealing that people lose respect for me. An outfit that is not so feminine as to be viewed as a child, but still feminine enough as to still be seen as a peer. 

Do you get it? 

Slurs are slurs because they remind marginalized people of the power dynamics that surround us.

They make sure that the white person/the man/ the able bodied person/ the straight person/ the cis person/ the rich person and so on, is still in power. 

It tells us that even if we are treated as equal, there is always that one thing that makes us different and we will never really be on the same level. 


Slurs are slurs because they strip us of our dignity, reminds us that there are aspects of us that will always be sub-human and an insult, no matter what. 

An aspect of us IS an insult, no matter how far we come. We can never get away from it. You feel me?

I strongly advise you go to CAB. Take all your paperwork. If you do not have a CAB, or cannot get an appointment, go to your local social work department and ask about an advocate for the PIP appeals process. Both services are much better at dealing with this absolute bullshit system than you or I are and have much more experience.

Epilepsy is unfortunately seen less favourably under PIP than DLA, I have it too but nowhere near as bad as your own. You do your mandatory reassessment, which they normally refuse, then you take it to appeal. The appeal is separate from your original assessment and impartial, a huge number of cases are overturned here.

Seriously, go and get help. If you can't get a CAB appointment or help through social work, please come back and PM me and I'll give you what help I can.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1489404991,"How the payee system works for you will depend, in large part, on your current living situation and who is your payee. I'll give you some basic info, and then tell you about how it worked when I was a payee. 

First, a payee's sole job is to make sure that your basic needs are taken care of (food, shelter, healthcare, etc). If SSA has designated that you need a Rep Payee, that means there is some doubt that you can manage your own finances. We see this most often with significant mental illness, history of drugs/alcohol, etc. It is *not* a life sentence, it can be reversed. 

There are basically two ways that this can go - you can get a private payee (a family member usually) or you can go with an agency payee. Many community mental health centers have payee services, or if you live in a group home they likely have payees, places like that. *sometimes* agencies will charge a small fee for payee services. I can only think of one agency I've every work with that charged, but that was *only* if you were not a client of their other services. 

If possible, I would **strongly** suggest that you try to find an agency payee. You know how they say ""don't mix family and business""? Same goes for your SSDI money and family.  Your payee is in charge of your check, and what is considered your ""needs"" is a very subjective term and up to them. So, lets say that you get $800 a month. If you live with them and they determine that your ""room and board"" is worth $700, they can then justify giving you only $100 a month. You may be saying to yourself, ""but RambleRamble, I love my mom and she won't do that to me"". You're probably right, but being someone's payee can change the dynamic of the relationship. What if you want to buy something that she doesn't think is ""necessary?"" A payee is ultimately responsible for you, they can get in serious (ie criminal charges) legal trouble if they mismanage your finances. 

Anyway, now to the specifics. I was an agency payee for a number of years. I think I had anywhere from 5-8 clients at a time. I was on all their bank accounts, and they were only authorized to see their balance and cash checks that came from the bank account (so from me). At the beginning of each month I would go around to their houses and gather up all their bills (utilities, medical bills, etc). I would then sit down and pay all their bills, to figure out what was left for the month. Now, here is where a divide can come between how payees operate. For my folks, they needed money in a piece-meal way, but other organizations might just give you a check with all the left over for the month.  

When I would gather the bills, I would also gather ""money requests"" from them. This would be things for the month (outside of normal expenses) that they wanted money for. So, if it was their mom's birthday and they wanted extra money to buy her a present, they needed to tell me then. I would always do my best to accommodate those requests. From there I would look at what money was left, and budget that out for their other needs - food, supplies, and fun. On Mondays their staff would bring them to the office and I would bring them checks that were made out to the grocery store and walmart. They were given a verbal budget on how much they could spend. After they were done shopping they had to immediately bring me the receipts. At that point I would then give them their cash for the week - this was theirs to spend on whatever they wanted. They had to keep the receipt, but this was only for accountability because we had some who would claim their staff stole their money and they needed more. If the client spent more than their budgeted amount at the store that was their choice, but then I would either take it out of their weekly cash or the following week they would get less money. Those that habitually broke their budget lost their shopping privileges, and I did their shopping for them. 

Now, the fact that you're on the computer and using reddit tells me that you won't need the level of payee services that these folks required. But it usually works in a similar manner where they pay all your bills and then you get the remainder. But it is a complicated process sometimes, and I can tell you that the people whom I payee'd for were really unhappy with me several times per month. They'd see me as the ""gatekeeper"" for their money, and they didn't see why I couldn't just give it to them. It caused a lot of strife sometimes.

forms to indicate that only you should have access. That way they won't be able to talk to your parents if they call, or release any medical records to your parents, no matter the situation. 

However, that doesn't really address the main problem you have, which is that as long as you are on your parents insurance they are going to get statements from the insurance companies that detail diagnoses and any tests done or treatments given. In fact, it will likely even complicate the situation, because once insurance since this information to your parents, if they need any additional information — paperwork receipts prescriptions etc. — then your parents will have to talk to you in order to get that paperwork since your doctor can't release the paperwork to them. So, more intimate discussions with your family regarding your care.

You could always call your insurance company to find out about getting bills mailed under your name, citing your age as a reason, but they may or may not be able to help you. 

Ultimately, you'll have to get your own insurance policy to remove them from your medical care. I don't suggest it.

You would have to rely on Medicaid (citing your inability to work) for the 3 to 4 years it takes your disability claim to be processed.

Remember that everything starts over -- essentially -- for the ALJ hearing. You can bring in new evidence, and anything else you need.

Then tell them that your anxiety is preventing you from working, and you'd like to get it under control but have a disability app pending. When you get closer to your court date, ask her to write something in support. 

An attorney will know what data you need. They can also send you to special doctors for vocational assessment -- those docs have weight in ALJ hearings because their job is basically only to determine if you can work. 

Get a Primary Care Physician that you see monthly to deal with any other health problems.

The key word here is documentation. You need medical records, and lots of them, proving why your issue is so bad that you can't work. Anything you can do, any doctor you can see, who is able to support that assertion will be beneficial to you.

Most parents still had to send their kids to public schools because the waivers only covered a fraction of the cost.   Public schools are funded based on the number of students  so if public school enrollment drops so does their funding.   School overhead costs won't drop so there will be less funds per student.    

Add into this Medicaid cuts.   Many kids that have 504's or IEP's consume medical services while in school and the school in turn can bill Medicaid.   Schools that have a high number of ESE and 504 students will lose funding in both directions.   Our schools are already underfunded.   

My son attends a dedicated ESE public school dedicated to all students who cannot be mainstreamed into a regular education environment.  Every year my son's school has to have two major charity events just to make up for funding short falls charity golf tournament and a motorcycle fundraising event.   This administration very well may bankrupt schools like my son's unless they cut back on essentials like nurses or therapists or equipment.

Or perhaps the review is triggered automatically in your state. There's no way for me to really be sure, but it sounds like you're heading into your final appeal before the ALJ.

Generally speaking, the process is 

1) Apply for Disability, 
2) G notice that you've been refused, 
3) File an appeal for Administrative Review, 
4) Denied after review, 
5) File an appeal for a hearing before the ALJ, 
6) Go to court and plead case before ALJ, 
7) Final decision made.

It's also important to note here that I am neither a disability lawyer, nor an SSA employee. I've just been through the process and have helped a number of other people with theirs. I can only tell you things based on my experience, and it's always wise to get advice from more than one person.

That being said, my advice would be to start calling lawyers immediately. Ideally, you'd like to find one sympathetic to you who is willing to meet with you immediately, and have their paralegal file the appropriate paperwork for you prior to that deadline. The reason it's important is because of that 200-word summary there -- you want to make sure the right words are included, and the lawyer will know what needs to be said.

You absolutely want a *local* attorney, not a national one. Local attorneys know the people in the SSA offices, and generally know the judge you'll be seeing quite well. It is always an advantage, but more so when you are on as tight of a timeline as you are, since knowing the staff can sometimes provide wiggle room.

If that is too much work/you can't get out (many lawyers will do this consult over the phone if needed)/some other reason it won't work today or tomorrow, then you need to fill out that form yourself and send it in. Make those 200-words your best as to why you can't work; you need to directly contradict their assertion that there isn't enough evidence that you can't work. If you need an idea on what to write, read every page on the [SSDRC website](http://www.ssdrc.com), and pay special attention to the pages related to filing appeals and about your state. That should give you a good idea of what you need to say there.

Make sure you get that submitted before the deadline. I cannot stress that enough. If you miss the deadline you're in for a world of frustration, since you'll have to start over from step 1.

After you get that submitted, immediately start looking for a lawyer. You're at the point where you need one badly. You absolutely cannot walk in front of that ALJ without one. The approval rate without one is something like 40%, but approval rates for those with representation jumps up to 65%+. And once that decision has been made, either way you're done.

~~~~

tl;dr: Ideally you need to try to find a reputable attorney who will meet with you early tomorrow morning, or who is willing to do it by phone this evening. They're going to want to hear all the details, and they'll want all the documentation you have and gave the SSA. Make sure they know the deadline you're on, and specifically ask them to call you once they've submitted that form.

If that doesn't work out, make sure you read up on that site, write your appeal, and get it submitted all before your deadline. As soon as you have submitted it, start the process of finding a lawyer.


**Edit:** In case it wasn't clear, you *absolutely* want to appear at that hearing. Make sure you check that box, and not the one that lets them decide based on evidence already submitted.

I meet curious children in Malaysia all the time whom I can't converse with using words so we smile, we wave; one little girl, her father explained, wanted to shake my hand (after we exchanged eye contact and smiles), so she put her hand against mine as is custom and then she took my hand and put it on her cheek!

When I managed a community based program (we provided 1:1 24/7 care along with some 1:1 hourly services) I always found that things worked best when our clients knew who to come to with a complaint (me). I made it a point to work at least 1 shift with each of our clients each month. That way we could talk about anything without any other staff there, and they had permission to ""speak freely"" about the program, their staff, and me. That trust would carry over and they felt comfortable coming to me other times of the month with concerns.  

Now my system may not work depending on your company structure, and the number of service users. But I think the point rings true that you need a system where they feel heard, and sometimes that comes best with interpersonal interaction. ",,,2,0,0,

This sounds like a crash course on the subject where you'll be in and out of the topic of autism in a week or two, so be sure to give everyone a whole lot of leeway. The course material will be rushed, and rather introductory. There will be shortcuts and generalizations, and while they may offend you they aren't intended to do so. Engaging with this kind of material leaves little room for arguments as it likely isn't empirically wrong just poorly conveyed, interpreted, or extremely broad. The instructor is probably trying to get through as much material as possible in the horribly short semester windows we're given, and has no time to argue what could easily become a Master's program. If you find it really bothers you try to schedule some office time with your instructor and raise your concerns in a more appropriate environment. 

There's a neat opportunity for you here. You have a chance to see your condition from the outside, identify educational mishaps, and hopefully come out with a better sense of how to approach the topics of the educational system you dislike outlined in your post later on in your academic career. 

If this is a more advanced course, 4th year or higher, then you should know how to academically construct your arguments without getting emotional about them. You may have to endure for a while, but each bit of misinformation is just a paper waiting to be happen. 

Regardless of the course do your best to keep a level head on this matter. Approach your class in an academic manner and not an emotional one. This is likely just another topic to most in your class, but for you it's an assumption on your life. You'll likely find evidence in this or later courses, of misinformation and generalizations, that explains some of the past hardships you have endured from misinformed people, but don't let it get to you. Attack the material, attack the institution, but do not attack the people. 

You're just one biased opinion no matter how right you think you are and that's just not how academia works. Argue, research, publish, and convince your peers throughout a career of study if that's what you want, or brush it all off and try to protect the kids on a micro-level. It's a life-long battle you're proposing, and one you've probably already begun. 

If there is just one thing you take away form this course, let it be a sense of how easy general knowledge can be twisted to an agenda. As offensive as this course may become, know that you've probably done this to other people (experts) on completely difference subjects, and maybe even to some with different disabilities, and will continue to make this mistake throughout your life. We're human and we're fallible, and all the more so when our woefully short lives are being rushed.

Almost everything depends on what country or state your live in. Your note does say that she is in school.  

If you are in the US,  then probably your state has a system where, after the student finishes school,  they transition into some kind of support network.  This is often funded through what is called a ""medicaid waver"". [http://medicaidwaiver.org/](http://medicaidwaiver.org/)

So if this applies,  she might be eligible for money to pay for her to go into a day program of some sort (for example).

I could hear the nurses behind the counter ridiculing him and making jokes... At first about his appearance and then about him being on medicaid.  And speaking of his being on medicaid, when his aid mentioned his insurance was medicaid while standing at the counter, half the people waiting in the lobby rolled their eyes like he was some kind of bum leeching off them.

Do you mean the ones you've grown up with Cuz they gained weight as they got older like what happens with a lot of folks of any gender? I also wonder if telling them you love them was sort of out of the blue. The way you describe it sounds like there wasn't a deep relationship there before hand. No girl is just gonna fall for you out of nowhere cuz you've harbored these intense feelings for so long and finally just say so. That may work in movies but it doesn't work in real life.
      
Also, you may not wanna hear this, but dismissing them because they are overweight is the same thing as dismissing someone because of their disability. 

Before I go further I want give you full disclosure: I am paraplegic and have been for 10.5 years now. I also have achondroplasia, which is a type of dwarfism. Some would say that's 2 strikes against me. I knew a guy through someone else that used to joke (to my face) that I was ""double fucked"" and I would pretend to laugh but in reality I didn't find it funny. I didn't get mad though, because I was dating an amazing girl who was drop dead gorgeous in my eyes. This dude was an asshole who thought he was funny but coincidentally never dated. He wasn't especially ugly or anything, average height, decent job, etc. But girls could see what a schmuck he was and that he had no self confidence so poking fun at others was all he had to make himself feel good. 
      
  I didn't date her forever, and in fact I'm lucky enough to have dated a lot. But it actually wasn't luck at all. I built up my confidence by going out with girls who may not have been the thinnest or most attractive, but were really amazing people. I know, you've heard that before but its true. You're never going to find someone if you don't like yourself. I mean, I know you said you don't dislke yourself and that what you hate is female's reactions to you, but you're kidding yourself if you don't realize its the same thing. 
       
Have you ever heard people say that if you aren't confident, pretend you are and eventually you will be ? Guess what? Its true. Start by asking someone out you can be yourself around/be confident with. No one is saying marry the girl or even kiss her. As long as you don't lead her on, aka tell her you wanna take it slow or you aren't looking for something serious right now. Just make sure you don't forget to say something or else you will hurt her feelings for no reason and that is shitty. I know , I've done it and its not a good situation.

  In the end hopefully you can and up with more confidence, or maybe even look past someone's weight and find they are exactly the right kind of girl for you. I've dated plenty of, shall we say, ""extra curvy"" women and had wonderful experiences .

ea2b8d99-8bd1-4ae9-a821-e59ecd38bdd8,1489441738,"Thank you Tesagk. People with disabilities comprise the group which is numerically by far the most accepting and supportive of those with BIID. I shall attempt to address some of the reasons for this:

1. As I previously mentioned, the majority of people with BIID also have physical disabilities not of their own choosing. These include Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injury, Spina Bifida, Degenerative Disc Disease, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Club Feet, Multiple Sclerosis, Marfan Syndrome, Polio, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy and such. Therefore people with disabilities often recognise something in common with those who have BIID.

2. BIID is believed to be caused by a congenital dysfunction of the right superior parietal lobule, and other brain parts. Adult onset BIID does not exist, and clearly there is no element of choice in having it. Thus there is a parallel with those who are physically disabled, also not by choice.

3. Trans men and Trans women often have great mutual empathy and understanding because they are traveling the same path, just in opposite directions. The same is true in comparing those with disability who seek to decrease their impairment versus those with disability who seek to increase their impairment. Both groups may share a feeling that their degree of impairment is different from what it should be. Incidentally, people with Gender Variance also tend to be particularly accepting and supportive of those with BIID.

4. Disability tends to facilitate the acquisition of empathy. BIID tends to facilitate the acquisition of empathy. Two empathetic groups with common interests, wheelchair accessibility and such, will be predisposed to get along with each other.

5. Those with BIID are very willing to donate functional body parts. Many with disabilities would like to have functional body parts. Clearly, mutually beneficial arrangements can be made with medical technology that is already not that far away. Similar discussions occur between Trans men and Trans women.

6. The neurologist Oliver Sacks has described his own experience with Alien Limb Syndrome following a substantial leg injury. This phenomenon occurs most frequently following stroke, as he has also described. Thus it is not completely unexpected for the intensity of BIID to increase greatly following an incomplete Spinal Cord Injury, such as is the case for myself.

7. Try to avoid thinking of people with BIID as seeking to be disabled. It is simply that the body map of someone with BIID corresponds to the social construct of disability. We want neither attention nor benefits. We just want to feel ourselves as being normal, and get on with our lives.

The computer testing portion (2/3 had this) of the minimum 3 hour appointments was over an hour long, then there was paper forms and tests to fill out and this was followed by a very long and exhaustive history by the doctor, which was followed by an hour long quasi-counselling session (2 of the evaluators were complete assholes grilling me, accusing me of lying, being a cheat and a fraud, in 2 of 3 of the psych evaluations I felt compelled to file ethics complaints with state medical boards for the unethical behavior of the Physicians, but that's a whole other story). 

Do not believe these psych evaluators at their word they are not your physician they may not adhere to the Hippocratic Oath. They do not have your well being in mind. 

I have a masters degree in Education and have 2 years of graduate and post graduate study in Psychology and Counselling and when I called out the unethical behavior, lies, and deceptions of the evaluators things got ugly. 

Be prepared to conflict with your evaluator, 2 of mine tried to coerce me into signing statements, or verbally agreeing to complete and total fabrications that would have destroyed my chances of recieving disability. By my third evaluation I was very apprehensive to the point of recording my entire interaction with the psych (check state and local laws). This final evaluation was over an hour but the evaluator appeared to do her best to understand and acurately report on my mental well being without bias or preconcieved notions. She also accomodated my physical needs so that I could be physically comfortable throughout my time with her- the other evaluators intentional tried to provoke pain and discomfort and refused reasonable accomodations. 

Be cautious, honest, well rested and prepared for a lengthy grueling process. Also be suspect of their motives and refuse to be bullied or coerced by their ""authority"". Be sure to read the purpose and limits of what a Psych evaluation should be, do not rely on your evaluator to be honest or forth coming with you.  Of course they could be ethical and upright but I found the two terrible evaluators no longer had private medical psych patients only evaluation clients and expert witness testimony businesses. 

The internet will be your friend in investigating your evaluator, search tax records, legal searches and see if they have under oath testimony, expert witness business, or censures for past transgressions from medical boards-- they are investigating you, you should investigate them. The terrible evaluators had both ended any personal couselling practice years earlier and solely performed psych evaluations, and expert medical testimony for hire business for the past decade plus-- I don't know if that is why they were assholes but I suspect a corelation.  

The good evaluator recommend I immediately recieve acceptance for complete and total diasabilty back dated to the date of application (this was 4 years into the process) but the Judge ignored her recommendation and I was forced to further appeal and eventualy was granted full disability.

If you do and are denied all the way through appeals, then you will have to prove that there has been a ""substantial change"" in your condition to warrant a new application. Generally this requires an additional dx being made, but with progressive diseases you just have to get a doc to prove you are substantially worse than you were during your first application.

SSD is for people that cannot be gainfully employed. It may be harsh to hear, but you obviously can. Companies like American Express, Apple Care, and many others hire at-home customer service reps; even if you were terminated at your current job, you could find work there. That is what they would look at during your hearing anyway -- not whether or not a job opening actually exists, but rather whether there is a job that you can do according to its description. If you're working from home now, without your condition deteriorating to the point where you can't do that any more you will be denied. In fact, once you do apply, you'll likely be grilled on why you had to stop working from home.

Sorry to say that -- from an SSD application standpoint -- you likely would have been better off just leaving work rather than drawing it out like this. Since you have, though, and you know that you won't be able to work for very long, take this time to save every penny you can.

I've only ever been to one amusement park, so I'm just going to post links to the rides so you know what i'm talking about.

Or if we go to the night-rides, they brake slower because half the riders are tipsy.


Suggestion to theme parks: have a section on your website that either explains what warnings are on each ride, or a way to view all rides, and filter by warning. Like you enter your height, and health status, and the website generates a list of suitable rides from it's database, and highlights their position on the park map.

And remember that all the things I just mentioned are helpful for functioning in certain scenarios.  But therapy could help with the underlying issues.  If you can't find someone local,  there are lots of options to do sessions over the Internet.

Thank goodness I'm on a much better medicine cocktail now than I was back then, but I still have to sleep with a pillow between my knees because I can't stand for them to touch, and there's a couple of other spots that are sure to get a knee-jerk reaction out of me, too. Just not ALL of them.",,,2,0,0,

d48cb943-6248-47fd-87b0-6d5244455f93,1488744668,"Very true for physical disabilities. But I just want to point out that many neurodivergent people, those who see their ""disability"" as not really being a disability/necessarily a bad thing but just a part of who they are, reject person-first language, for similar reasons as why Deaf people do. Therefore it's ""autistic"", not ""person with autism"". ""Multiple system"", not ""person with Dissociative Identity Disorder"". etc.  (I'm sure there are more examples, I just can't think of any off the top of my head.) 

Edited to add: One particular note about multiple system/multiple/person in a multiple system vs person with DID is that the first acknowledges everyone in that body as being a person, but that person-first language inherently assumes there's only one ""real"" person in that body, an idea which many multiples find incredibly offensive.

2ae69041-931b-494e-b9d1-9d266647bf38,1488482021,"I live in Florida and going through something similar. I have twelve hours of nursing every night because I use a ventilator when I sleep and I also have an aide for two hours per day which I am looking to increase to three hours. I want and need to work, but I too cannot afford to lose my Medicaid Long Term Care. I did not have it for two months last year and my nursing cost me $15,000 which I still owe on my credit cards.

I have a Qualified Income Trust and an ABLE account. These are great in the fact that they allow your assets exceed $2,000. The ABLE account cannot receive more than $14,000 per year.

The issue is in Florida like many states is not only the asset limits, but also the income limits. I cannot have income that exceeds $2,199 per month. I was told even if I have an employer that writes my paycheck to my Qualified Income Trust and or my ABLE account it doesn't matter because I will have a W2 or a 1099 that shows my income.

I have been trying everything. The only thing that sounds remotely hopeful and legal is Section 1619(B) of the Social Security Act which is title Continued Medicaid Eligibility. You can find it at http://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/1619b.htm. I still cannot figure out how to use it and if it applies to all Medicaid programs including Medicaid Long Term Care.",,,2,0,0,

8678158d-3ddc-4920-ac29-98f574855a46,1488583323,"Just ask when you make a reservation. Most public locations (in the USA) have to be accessible. Sometimes their website will have pics or info.

As for hotels, again ask questions, but I have less worry about it since I'm a little more (not much) mobile than many and need a travel companion and rely on them if it's not ideally accessible. The worst part about a hotel is the bathroom, without fail.

I don't plan as much in advance as you might think. Instead I just adapt my plans if something isn't accessible.",,,1,0,0,
