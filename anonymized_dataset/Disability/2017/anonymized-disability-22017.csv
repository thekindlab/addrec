2dc97b14-e32f-4552-b99c-8efe37420c6a,1487378320,"Yeah, I'm flying to my home state to live with my parents for a while until they get me set up in an apartment near them.  So I won't be homeless.  I am definitely grateful to have family that cares, it's just that soul-sucking environment they live in that is so toxic.  And every single member of my family lives in that state.  

My brother lives with my parents and gets SSI for his OCD.  He gets about $750 a month and works part time as a janitor.  Unless it's doing online surveys for $3 a pop or selling things online, I cannot think of a job that I could reasonably do.  My problem is going to bed and getting up at a set time every day, getting work done by a deadline &amp; interacting with people.  I can't think of a single job that doesn't require one or more of those three things.  I also have serious issues commuting to a job site by myself.  

The reason I've put off documenting my illnesses and working toward getting disability is due to my paralyzing anxiety and fear of judgment.  It literally has prevented me from doing ANYTHING I need to do, including going to the dentist, getting hernia surgery or having my endometriosis removed.  Most days I'm too nervous to even walk to the mailbox alone.  I really need a full psychiatric workup because I honestly don't know the full extent of what's wrong.  I just know that it impacts my ability to function like other people, and that mental illness runs on both sides of my family severely.

I have sold ""things"" (supplements, research chemicals, etc) online in the past but that's not a steady job by any means, and my gf helped me get to the post office.  

Thanks for listening and not judging, by the way :)",,,1,0,0,

I've seen some wheelchairs in some museums but I'd call in advance. I'm not sure who you can call to rent one. I'm certain there's places that do. I see a lot of tourists do the segue tours. If you can stand that might be a fun way to have a guided tour outside of the museums and such. One thing I would definitely emphasize is to do your research on when you're coming. Marches and protests can make traveling difficult and long even when using a wheelchair. It can be challenging when you're trying to plan out how to use your energy.

b14162e0-51df-4449-b4d6-9d4039bc3338,1486320403,"My husband has constant pain and muscular/numbness issues. We've been together about 15 years and he's been my only sexual partner. He's always had these issues to some degree, but they didn't really escalate to the point of negatively impacting our sex life until seven years ago.

The hardest part for me is never feeling comfortable initiating sex because I don't know if he's having a bad day or a worse day. But once I make it known that I'm interested, he genuinely wants to oblige, and then I feel guilty/ashamed because it's so one-sided. Or he's trying to do things he physically can't do anymore, which I can tell makes him feel bad, which makes me feel bad. And then when he makes the first move and I'm not ready, I feel obligated because there may not be another good day for months...and we're limited to one position.

So we just focus on the things we can still do together...which are eating and watching movies. We try to get liberal with new food places (no chains) and watch a fair amount of indy/foreign films. Sex is basically off the table. If you can't tell from my tone, I'm still struggling with this idea. I'm in my 30's and never going to have anything resembling good sex ever again.

I had to pay for it, and it wasn't cheap (about $900 a few years back), but like my attorneys, worth every penny. 

At my FCE, I had a certified physical therapist put me through the wringer. Over the course of a few hours, he interviewed me, and made me do all sorts of physical activities, while asking me my pain levels, and measuring things like inflammation, range of motion, and observing my ability to complete tasks. From this, he wrote up a 15 page report, complete with charts and graphs, comparing me to standard insurance and government measures for both disability and ability to work. It's all the stuff your doctors don't have time to do (and my doctors loved seeing the report).

To be honest, in my case, the FCE was like gold. My LTD appeal was approved immediately; my SSDI hearing took forever, but it was very helpful when the time came as well. 

I know that worrying about money is one of the hardest parts of this process; I think we focus on it more because the reality of disability is a tough one.

Every state in the US has a referral line for social services, dial 211. A case manager or social worker to coordinate services for her would be really good, if you can find it. For Social Security, if she isn't represented, some lawyers accept cases on a contingency basis, so call around.

Not only am I disabled, but I am in school to become a special education teacher. So I'm furious on both sides: for my safety and health, my students' safety and health, and my job prospects. I keep myself engaged in our community so that I know what's going on and how others feel about stuff, like the shift to person-first language for some people while others (like autistic and Deaf folks) prefer identity-first. Both are perfectly fine for each individual, but my professors for example refuse to believe me and argue that the people (the actual, disabled people) who use ID first are wrong (wrong for the label THEY chose for THEMSELVES). It's infuriating on a personal level.

But then to hear on the news day in and day out about the protests and the new bills and people arguing left and right on everything and nowhere...*nowhere* am I finding myself in the discussion. Sure, there's the women's rights movement, which caters to part of my needs. But there is nothing about disability. No one is talking about it. No one mentions it in the discussions about health care. They might mention elderly people, but never disabled people. All the talk about a living wage, and yet those on SSI and SSDI are on or below the poverty line unless they have help from friends and family. And No. One. Cares. No one mentions it in the slightest. Even in the media coverage: there were enormous numbers of disabled people in the women's march, but nobody said a damn thing about it on the news. And the thing is, unless we can organize and participate in out own marches and rallies (which we generally can't in large numbers due to accessibility and a lack of energy), nobody will listen. We can scream and cry and do everything in our power to make our voice heard, but it will be silenced until it causes a big enough disturbance in the daily life of the public. And we just don't have the resources or ability to do that in large enough numbers. Not to mention the idea the public shares that our lives aren't worth living (while at the same time insisting we have it better than them because we ""don't have to work"" and better than people in other countries because they don't have the laws and regulations to protect them, which I doubt is true for many first world countries). 

And I am mad. Your anger is justified in my eyes. I'm sorry if this made you feel worse by stirring up your feelings about all this. ",,,9,0,0,

We had to apply via our county attorney's office - there was no application fee but I'm assuming it varies from state to state. We paid $400 for a new psychological evaluation, a copay for him to see his regular doctor so she could complete the form, and a social worker from the local adult protection office came to our home to do an assessment of his functioning. 

We were granted emergency guardianship the day we applied due to the fact that our son isn't med compliant and was already 18 (we had no idea we would need to do all this stuff so we were scrambling). We went to a hearing about 45 days later where a jury was presented with the info from all the evaluations. The whole proceeding took maybe 20 minutes and they voted unanimously to assign my husband and me as legal guardians. 

Overall nothing has really changed, but all doctors, therapists, etc. have a copy of the guardianship order and I carry a copy in my purse at all times. Once my son turned 18 we technically had no right to be involved in his medical care without guardianship, so it's comforting to know we can make needed decisions if there is an emergency or he sees a new provider.

Nowadays though, every demographic is extremely centered in its own fight and when it comes to both raw overall numbers and, more importantly, the amount of us who can get seriously politically involved, we are becoming the least present demographic and our issues are not a political priority.

I would add that every state has a vocational rehabilitation agency that helps people with disabilities find work. They also help keep working people with disabilities in their jobs. If you work with them, you might find they can help you keep working longer even though your condition is worsening. 

If it ends up being that the progression of your disability makes work impossible, then your interaction with the vocational rehabilitation agency will provide you with evidence  that corroborates the severity of your disability.

They just have you apply and I had to have a doctor fill out a form. Then you also provide documentation from social security. Then you wait for quite awhile. 

Once you're approved the loans go to zero on your credit report. But they can be reinstated if you don't follow the rules during the three year monitoring period. This actually happened to me after a year because I neglected to send back a statement of how much I earned during the first year. Once I provided it they wiped the debt off my credit again. So make sure to provide them with documentation as is requested. 

The loans aren't officially gone for three years - you're under a monitoring system where you're not allowed to make more than the 15k a year (social security is not counted against you- just a job - and only you. It doesn't count against you if a spouse works) and you cannot get any student loans again during the three years. Not that I imagine any of us would want too anyway. 

I work part time doing statewide driving for a car rental agency. I work maybe 20-25 hours twice a week. It's perfect for me though a little bit tiring driving all over the state. Of course how much you can earn depends on a few factors. If you're on ssdi as I am I think the monthly limit is something like $1100 or close to it. If you're on ssi it's a lot tougher I don't think you can earn much money. 

Of course how we spend our free time is both a challenge to us all and will differ based on interests, lifestyles and type of disability. 

I definitely encourage everyone to apply for this it can change your life for the good! Nothing's worse than having a debt hanging over your head you feel hopeless that you can ever repay. ",,,7,0,0,

The fact that you're thinking ahead to the future is already a great step.  In my opinion, going for a further education is worth the debt you might incur.  Colleges, as a rule, are better nowadays in terms of disability accommodations, so that might help with the classes you're concerned about.

As for Medicaid, it would really depend on what your state's Medicaid Buy In (known as Medicaid for employees with disabilities or other names) allows. In Connecticut, I could make up to 75k a year and still keep my Medicaid as long as I pay a premium that gets adjusted to how much money I make.

I would advise just being as organized as possible in advance of travelling. So check that you know what type of batteries your wheelchair has, how to disconnect them and if you need any paperwork from the manufacturer proving the battery type is safe for flight.

I assume you have Duchenne's right? Airplane seats can be a bit uncomfortable for people like us so have a think if there might be some cushions or supportive seating stuff you might want to take with you. I strongly recommend that you ask to go to the gate in the chair. Once at the gate, they will transfer you into a super slim aisle chair. For the transfer, I've found that it's easier if my family brings a hoist sling. Pop sling on, transfer into aisle chair by having someone lift from the front of sling and someone lift from the back. I sure as hell don't want to be lifted by hand. I suggest that your family members tell the people at the gate that they will seat you in the airplane first and then go outside to deal with the chair. Once you're seated, a family member can go back to the airplane door to show the people there how to disconnect the chair and to give any final instructions.

Some other tips: 
- Make sure to request assistance to transfer to airplane at check in (and in advance of your flying date if possible but not necessary) and to specify your chair is coming with you.

- Make sure you say outright that you are not capable of walking at all.

- Arrive at the airport several hours in advance of the flight so that you are at check-in as soon as it opens.

- Arrive at the gate approximately an hour before the flight is due to leave (or earlier if told to do so) and alert the people at the gate that you are there.

Basically, communicate with everyone as if you're the first person ever to fly in a wheelchair.

* Take a picture of your wheelchair before it is stowed, just in case there is damage

* Aisle seats are the easiest to transfer into

* Use a transfer wheelchair to board plane with flight attendant (provided)

* Bring transfer belt and/or sliding board - airline employees are not required to help you transfer, but many will help

* Bring your seat cushion if needed

* It’s good to travel with a companion if you have limited postural strength for takeoff and landing

* Avoid connecting flights because getting your assistive devices back from baggage claim can be a lengthy process

And our current residence isn't in a good condition due to previous tenants that lived here, it's not really the kind of place more kids should be around.

b14162e0-51df-4449-b4d6-9d4039bc3338,1486419035,"I'm on the flip side of this--my husband of 10 years has various medical problems affecting his mobility. He was very honest about his conditions when we met, but he's deteriorated significantly and unexpectedly over the last few years.

To answer your original question, preparation depends on what you're trying to accomplish. We were fortunate in that when he lost the ability to walk, we had just moved into a home that was more accessible, thinking ""one day"" he might be in a wheelchair. We never expected it would be two months later, but physical stuff like that you can plan for. Emotionally, it's a completely different deal. I've kept much of it to myself because I don't want to hurt him, but it's eating me alive.

If I can give you any kind of advice to avoid that, you have to keep the lines of communication open. I don't feel burdened by him (I love him and I'm very used to caring for him when it's needed), but I feel alone in my marriage. I feel like I have no right to complain because he's the one who lives in constant pain. I have no right to be upset about any aspect of life we're missing out on because I knew he had medical problems when I married him. I committed. 

He encourages me to do things without him, but I can tell it makes him sad when I do. And it doesn't make me feel any less alone, I'm just alone and doing things. I also know how he reacts when we try to discuss his conditions and how they are likely to progress, so if I tell him how I feel, I know he'll shut down, divorce me, and/or take his own life. He would be devastated if he knew any of this. So what am I supposed to do? I either keep bottling or I risk destroying everything. 

Anyway, you don't have to be alone to avoid those things. You can recognize your concerns and deal with them head-on, but how it plays out will depend on you and your partner. ",,,1,0,0,

Once this form goes back off, it should take about four weeks for them to process this and get to the next stage. This is where they decide if they need to collect more info about your disabilities and they may want you to go to a medical assessment.  At this point, timescales are pretty much up to them and deadlines can be extended if they need them to be.  But, they should be able to tell you why they need more time.

If you can't get him to leave the house at all, even to see a psychiatrist/psychologist though, he may not have a shot.

SSI is a different application, and only part of it can be done online. You will either need to go into a field office or do a phone interview. There is a subset of SSDI (called CDB) where you can draw on a parent's record if they are deceased, on SSDI, or retired and you became disabled prior to age 22. This would be your birth parents, I don't believe step parents apply unless he legally adopted you. 

* Your stepfather's income counted against your mother's SSI claim because married couples are considered one unit. His income won't count against your SSI eligibility, all that matters is your resources ($2,000 max). If you are approved, because you're living at home, likely you will get a smaller monthly amount

* Your age is going to count against you, also the fact that you have almost no work history. You'll need lots of documentation from your treating providers, particularly your psych ones. Honestly your GI/reproductive issues aren't going to allow you. I'm sorry about your miscarriages, but the effect of work on the reproductive system would not be considered in your claim.  I hope that you see your providers often, only going in every few months is not enough documentation of your issues. 

* There is this myth that everyone gets denied the first time. The national allowance rate for initial claims is between 30-35%, depending on where you live. You can try to get a lawyer, but most disability attorneys I know won't take on SSI-only claims until you get denied twice and go before a judge. Reps get paid a percentage of your backpay award, so there is almost no money in SSI claims. 

* Its good that you have old records, but SSA is only going to look at 1 year back from your SSI filing date for your medical records. Now, if you submit additional records, they will look at them, but it won't necessarily change the outcome. If you want to submit records, for the love of God make sure that they are copies and not the originals. Were a large agency so paperwork does get misplaced. ",,,4,0,0,

I was surprised to read that this was a university project to be honest. Where I live (a little town in semi-rural Scotland) we have completely automatic doors to social work, courts and council offices, and larger shops/chains have chosen to install them by their own initiative. Some others have the push-button semi automatics, presumably because they are cheaper. Smaller shops, family run newsagents etc, are almost exclusively manual doors. I'd imagine they don't have the budget which is understandable. 

We are a poor area (and yet still awesome) so it's not like we have the most up-to-date equipment, not by a long shot. It's been around for years, it's definitely not new technology. But if disability access is limited I can imagine many people will not have come across such tech before. Or if they do not have or have someone close to them with a disability, they may not have recognised it if/when they have!",,,3,0,0,

We started our trip in Singapore, which is impeccably structured and very easy to get around. No one stared at me after I changed out of a scoop-neck shirt (women dress conservatively in Singapore by the standards I'm used to) so my disability wasn't an issue. In Malaysia, the traffic is insane. Pedestrians share the road with motorbikes and tri-shaws as a matter of course and sidewalks, which I hadn't realized I see as a human right, often don't exist. But the people are incredibly caring and attentive, and I realized early on that those drivers are calm in these chaotic circumstances and strangers would often move large objects out of my path as I was walking by. What really made an impact on me, though (besides the transcendent food and blissful cold drinks) is the shock shared by the citizens when they found out I wasn't in an accident, I was born this way. A lot of kids in Malaysia have CP, but none of them have access to the surgery and medical care that makes it possible for me to lead a ""normal"" life. One mother in Taluk Bahang, whose son attends the Center for Spastic Children, asked if she could take my picture to show the kids, ""for, what is the word, motivation?"" She was practically breathless talking about the experience of seeing me walk around, and she even took a separate selfie of us together.

In Thailand, unfortunately, attitudes have not been so accepting and warm. Never mind that Bangkok's traffic makes Malaysia's roads look organized; even up in the North, where we are now, there are people so unaccustomed to disability that I've been treated in ways I'm SO grateful that my own culture finds completely unacceptable. Tonight, at a restaurant in Chaing Rai, two of the waitstaff simply stared at me unrelentingly as I walked up the stairs. When we got to our table, one guy immediately pulled out my chair, but I had planned to rest my crutches against that chair, so this was a hindrance, not a help. I politely asked him to leave us alone, assuring him that I know what to do. He brought another waiter over and the two of them hovered over us, making me nervous, and I assured them once again that I knew what to do and they were free to leave us alone. So convinced were these particular people that Good Service looks a very certain way, they brought their boss over. Now I have 3 people hovering and staring relentlessly at me and I'm starting to lose my appetite. We decided to leave, and I thought I'd say something, politely of course, on what the protocol should be for disabled customers.

""They don't mean anything,"" she assured me of the relentless starers, though of course I've known all my life about the difference between well-intended Not Helping and actually listening to what a person needs. ""Thai people, we like to be helpful!"" she said. ""We help, and we smile..."" she demonstrated. I tried to explain what is and is not actually helpful but she was clearly uninterested in changing her narrative. She believes she knows what works for everyone and there's nothing I can do about that, frustratingly.

When I entered a massage parlor during our two days in Bangkok, I was swarmed by a group of older women who wanted to grab my arms and ""help"" me up the stairs. I didn't know how to insist both politely and assertively that I want to do this alone, and one of the women even kept her hand fixed on my buttcheek as I ascended the stairs! This made me extremely uncomfortable and I ended up having to de-stress from my massage, though the massage itself was worthwhile and certainly an unbeatable price.

So I'm missing Malaysia with all of my heart and I'm not so much liking Thailand. We're sticking to our plan, though, to spend a night or two even further north and see if things are better there. We'll be spending some time in Indonesia and definitely going back to Penang for a spell before we return to America. In Malaysia we visited Malacca, Ipoh, and the Cameron Highlands. Then we discovered Georgetown and felt so relaxed and welcome there that we remained for about two m weeks.

I never realized how lucky we Americans are that George Bush Sr. pushed for the ADA and made mandatory the kinds of infrastructural adaptations that I had come to take for granted in my day-to-day life. This has really made me want to see what I can do for disability rights in this part of the world, because so many people have no idea what kinds of lives it would be possible to be living if where they lived was actually built for their bodies.",,,3,0,0,

An activities director likely regularly takes the residents places as opposed to if you were only required to do it on an occasional basis. 

The crux will be if they can have another person drive while not causing an undue burden. So if you will always have a second coworker with the group, then that person could always drive and that is not an undue burden. But if you normally take the residents out alone, then they might have to pay a second person to go along which could be seen as an undue burden.

It also hurts you that you weren't offered the job or are already employed. While they can't discriminate based on a disability, if you can't perform the essential job requirements they don't have to hire you. Sometimes it's best to not request accommodations until after you've started working, but in your case it would be more practical to look for jobs where driving isn't an essential function.

027a1edc-29da-4b66-aaf2-22f18a400f4e,1486695553,"Well background -- I was an Air Force pilot. The contract I took was with my old training squadron -- mostly different people by now but a handful of familiar faces. Anyway when I took the job, it was a really simple computerish scheduling gig. Then the boss *wanted* to move me into a 'doing simulators' sort of role -- and I pushed back pretty hard, because I was pretty sure that wasn't gonna work out. Then a *bunch* of other people on the same contract got fired, so we had to rethink our various roles; for a while I was just doing MORE computerish work, then I was doing 'registrar' duties (which it turns out involves lots of standing, walking around, and being pleasant -- those things didn't mix for me at the time, still kinda don't). Then the commander -- who's actually the customer in this case, but also the boss kinda -- was like ""no, no, stop that -- I know exactly where I want this guy."" So now I'm doing *largely* computer-ish work, but it's a lot brainier. I move around for meetings all over the base, which is a chore, but also pretty good exercise so w/e. It's interesting work, for the most part, with plenty of down-time to recover after doing stuff.

What I *ultimately want to do*, well.... big question, lol. This all started because I wanted to see if I could handle a full-time job. The plan has always been to prove it one way or another, then head back to school and think about the NEXT step. I know exactly what I want to do -- write novels. Buuuuuuuut so far I haven't found any Vocational Rehab deparments that consider that a reasonable employment goal (with good reason -- though, I mean, they haven't read what I can do!), so what I think I'm gonna do is aim for a teaching job, reach as high as I can with that, and write on the side until I'm rich and famous.

HOURS! Right. I'm doing full-time, and that was (A) a mistake, but also (B) one that I'm not sorry for making. See if you're smart, you go ahead and do part-time so you don't burn up your Ticket-to-Work months while you're building endurance and employability. I mean, be selfish with that, honestly, nobody wants to see you screw yourself out of money *especially* if it turns out that working is bad for your health! **BUT**, if you *do* find a full-time gig, there's no harm in pouncing on it -- you just have to be honest with yourself, and be ready to walk away if you need to. 

Last note -- I lined everything up myself, and managed to really confuse myself about the rules of working while on SSDI. There are people whose job it is to explain the finer points to you, either at the SS buildings or a vocational rehab department or SOMETHING -- that person exists, find that person, talk to them, figure out what you wanna do, etc. Or, I mean, or screw 'em, you don't NEEEEEED help, it's just, you know, helpful probably.",,,1,0,0,

No, when Republican politicians say how most people on disability just have sore backs or feel sad I'll talk about it. When they want to get rid of the ADA I'll talk about it.

Things involving Social Security (if she gets benefits), Medicaid, medical paperwork, etc. She will become eligible for a lot of different programs once she turns 18. Deficit or not, at 18 she is entitled to the full rights of every other adult unless deemed otherwise by the court. 

This is more of a legal matter than a practical one. Yes things are going to stay the same, and you're not going to have to produce your guardianship paperwork all the time since it will be obvious to all those involved in her care. But legally you still need it in place.  

But think of this scenario - you all are in a bad car accident and she needs surgery. Hospitals take patient rights very seriously, and if she verbalizes/indicates ""no"" to the procedure, then they can't do it. Hell, I think they wouldn't even be able to give her informed consent so the hospital lawyers would have to get involved either way. After she is 18 you can't just say ""well I'm her parent"" to override her rights. In that same hospital scenario, if you have guardianship you can immediately consent to the procedure for her.

We have held bake sales to donate to charity &amp; have hosted many events to promote our message and provide opportunity for discussion. Our biggest goal is to provide opportunity for anyone, whether they have a disability or not, to talk about these issues. 

-We are sponsored by the school's Disability Services department, but they have shown in the past year to be unwilling to assist us with much. Calls and emails go unreturned, concerns are not addressed, and in general they are the ones who just don't seem to care. So unfortunately, we have been kind of left on our own to improve things.
-We are NOT a fraternity or sorority, or in any way associated with Greek life. Greek life at my university is something you have to do recruitment &amp; rushing for, and have fees. Our group is open to anyone who wishes and there are no fees.
-In order to keep our organization going, we need more members in order for them to actually run it (every current active member is graduating at the end of the semester). We are not the only organization with similar issues, as there's kind of saturation in student organizations that make it hard for newer or smaller groups to get people's attention. With fundraising events, all profits would go towards a charity. For example, if we do it in march, we might give the money to United Cerebral palsy (CP awareness month) or National Center for Learning Disabilities (march is also learning disabilities awareness month). 

I have reached out to people I know in larger organizations who are interested in doing events with us. One of them agreed on the condition we plan most of it, because they have already used a great deal of resources on fraternity sponsored things for the semester, and because they'd provide more of the marketing side of things (get people to show up). My idea was some kind of fundraising event for charity. But I have never held a fundraiser ever so I just wanted some ideas that aren't too expensive and that people would be interested in. I am sorry if you misunderstood what I was trying to say, but all of your assumptions are completely wrong

**Clarification: the fraternity I refer to is one that my boyfriend's brother is in, and they have agreed to work with us under those conditions. I also have reached out to my boyfriend's fraternity and my sister's sorority, both of whom are also interested, though they want to have more input, so I am not concerned about those. While our group is not directly involved with greek life, we have chosen to reach out through my contacts because greek life on our campus has a big influence and are very good at marketing and doing successful events.

The thing is though, I dunno about everyone else, but I always inform the airline in advance that the wheelchair has a dry gel battery. 

Then, I also present paperwork when at the airport, from the manufacturer, which shows that these batteries are safety certified for flights and that they are immediately disconnected by a plug in the joystick and are *not* disconnected in the battery box. I do this both at check-in and also when the chair is taken away from me by the people who will load it on the plane.


Then, to go a step further, before my chair is taken away from me by the airport people (so at the gate of the plane) I make sure to tell them clearly that the batteries are disconnected from the joystick. The person travelling with me disconnects the battery and demonstrates to the airport people that the circuit is broken and that the batteries do not work if the joystick is unplugged. We make sure to state that the batteries themselves do not need to be touched.

bae039b7-c536-4cce-be53-be23811dc5e1,1487741511,"Ok, now I'm going to explain why I asked about your chair. (english is not my first language so I'm sorry if I make a lot of mistakes)

There's a huge difference between flying with a manual chair than with a powered chair. When it comes to flying with a powered one the first thing you gotta do is check what type of battery it uses. If it's a solid state battery or gel type battery then you shouldn't have any issues when you dispatch the chair along with your luggage. There's no weight limits or  ""over the top"" restrictions when it comes to dispatching your mobility aid items if they use said batteries.

Now, if what you have is a wet cell battery, then you will have more issues and restrictions. I dare to say that most airlines won't allow you to dispatch your batteries along with your luggage, unless you remove it from the chair and store it in like 7 different type of regulated-high-security cases. Having said that, there are some airlines that won't make you go through such a hassle and let you dispatch the chair without removing the batteries as long as you take some security meassures first such as:

- Protect and recover the battery terminals with non-conductive tape.

- Disconnect the power of the battery (this is usually done by removing the fuse or fuses).

- Protecting the cover with more tape to avoid spillage.

- Pray that the airplane doesn't get into too much turbulence so that the acid comes out and sets up a fire due to a shortcut. (I'm joking obviously, but that can happen if you don't shut down the circuit completely)

Having said that, I'm pretty sure that some of these security meassures will also be requested for the gel or dry type battery too.

My recommendation would be to go personally to as many airline counters or commercial stands as possible to ask them what they allow and what they don't allow and how they handle this type of situations and then, when you picked the one you are flying, go again personally to buy the ticket and request the wheelchair passenger treat at the airport as well and also have them pick the most accessible seat on the aircraft . I recommend you to do this personally because usually telephone operators are very basically trained and they just read through rules and regulations they barely understand.

When you do the online check-in, also call the airline to remind them know you are flying with a wheelchair. Also, call again the same day you are flying, not joking, just in case they forgot.

If you are flying an international flight, most airlines will ask you to be 2 hours prior to the flight time and to add 1 extra hour if you requested the wheelchair passenger service. For domestic flights it's usually 1 hour prior to the flight time plus 1 extra hour because of the wheelchair.
 
Other important tips I can give you are:

- ALWAYS carry your joystick in your personal luggage, as well as other sensitive, fragile and/or recomovable parts of the chair.

- Ask and demmand at all times to have your chair carried carefully and in vertical position all the time. Stick a huge piece of paper on the chair indicating how it should be handled just in case. Also ask the check-in employees to mail the destination airport so that they know beforehand that they have to treat it carefully and unload it from the plane in a vertical position (that's even more important if it's a wet cellbattery)

- If you use a special cushion, try to have a person near you when you are beeing transferred to the pre embarc area wheelchair (usually it's an old manual and regular wheelchair) so that person can slid it under you while the airport guys lift you up. Spending 3+ hours in those chairs is hell, so you can do either that or ask the check in recepcionists what's the latest you can check out your chair so that you can spend most of the time on your onw chair. Also, once you are about to be sitted at your plane sit, have a person near you to put the cushion on the sit plane as well. 

- Be always polite and show good attitude to the guys that will be transferring you from your chair to the manual chair and then to the tiny ""between the aisles"" type of chair. Tell them how you need to be lifted and accomodated, they will not know unless you tell them. 

- If you use an inflatable cushion and you are travelling to a higher altittude place, deflate it a little bit once you get there.

That's about all I can think of right now. Sounds hard but it's not impossible. Don't hesitate in pm'ing me if you need further tips or info.",,,1,0,0,

815e1c0b-cfd8-40cc-a943-ba187fec8ee7,1487452588,"The biggest difference between manual and power is access. Powerchairs are bulkier and heavier. If you find a curb with no ramp, you're pretty much screwed, because they're too heavy to pick up. 

The turning radius is the other barrier. Powerchairs have a larger radius making maneuvering harder. 

Then there's the power issue. A dead battery can suck. 

A manual is the best option if you can handle it. A regular hospital chair is going to be a nightmare though. You really need a custom chair or a lightweight one somewhat your size if you're lucky enough to find someone willing to rent or lend one.

The parents placed him in a private school with 24hr supervision and sent the public school district the bill. The school district refused to pay it, so the parents filed for a hearing. The lower panels/courts that heard the case/hearing sided with parents. Gorsush overruled them, arguing:
1- the school district did enough for the kiddo's education because they'd met 25% of the goals outlined in the IEP. Apparently independent fact finders corroborated this, although in the notes it indicate the parents disputed this. 

2-'generalizing' is not required under the IDEA, meaning public education doesn't have to be carry over to the home; therefore, since he was doing okay at school (even though he was doing terribly at home), placement in private school is not warranted

He cites the Rowley case, which was the first supreme court case that dealt with the IDEA. In Rowley, a deaf kiddo wanted an interpreter, but since he was making SOME progress in school, an interpreter was not warranted.

To me, he's placing way too much weight on the IEP goals. One of the goals he cites is about the kiddo being able to recognize spatial patterns (or some such). Since he's making progress on this goal and some others, we can ignore the fact that he's wiping shit on his bedroom walls in the middle of the night? Some goals ARE more important than others. And SHOULD have special consideration. 

But he writes: ""The difficulties Luke faces in the classroom and at home are no doubt considerably greater in scope and severity than those faced by the student in Rowley. But the legal principle outlined there by the Supreme Court controls equally here: a school district is not required to provide every service that would benefit a student if it has found a formula that can reasonably be expected to generate some progress on that student's IEP goals.""

Bottom line: BE CAREFUL WHEN WRITING YOUR IEP GOALS!

Other Bottom line: this case may be nuanced, but that's why it's so telling. I'd be willing bet (and the rulings of the lower court support me here), if he were more empathetic he could have come up with a very sound legal argument, as compelling as this one, that sided with the parents. If they were without means and could not afford the private school, the kiddo would have continued to suffer without the adequate help. People construct their syllogisms out of perverted ideology and the world suffers, unless of course you're rich.",,,2,0,0,

This can't be the first time this therapist has encountered people applying for SSI unless the therapist just graduated.  Ask the therapist what they usually do when their clients apply for SSI.  Do they usually refer to someone else, or what?  Something about this sounds fishy, though based on what you've written it's hard to tell if it's the therapist or your roommate.  I've heard of therapists declining to sign off on paperwork, but only because they thought the client was malingering (faking it or exaggerating symptoms), not because they won't sign lawyer stuff.  Maybe if the therapist has only just started seeing your roommate, that would make sense because they don't know your roommate well enough.

Does your roommate see a psychiatrist who would sign off on his conditions?  If mental health is his disability, it's going to be difficult to get support if he doesn't have a mental health professional signing the paperwork.

I understand why your roommate wouldn't just want to start over with a new therapist.  Is there any way he can consult another lawyer to see if they recommend anything different?

There is a link to a general information page. But, again, you really should not do that. It sounds like the issue is NOT them paying their rent, but its a slumlord/credit situation. Neither of these things will be helped by you being a rep payee.

A rep payee is only for people who truly cannot manage their own money. You would be **legally** responsible for their finances. I've been a rep payee (as part of a job) and it is a lot of work and responsibility. 

If you think that you can just be their payee and be ""hands off"" and let them manage their own benefits then you run the risk of them getting into trouble. If they go and blow all their money on lotto tickets and can't pay their rent, guess who gets in trouble? You. You'd have to be on the bank account with them, which means that if they go and overdraw their account and rack up fees, that goes on your credit (and you'd be legally liable if they can't pay). 

So in order to ensure that their needs are met, you have to actually manage their finances. This kind of thing, no matter how well intentioned, changes the power dynamic in a relationship. They will see you as the ""gate keeper"" for their money, and that can breed a lot of resentment. If you truly think they need a payee, there are community organizations who will do that for a small monthly fee (or they are free if you get services there)

I seriously cannot stress enough how much you should not do this.

I would bring in the response letter and have your doctors address each point specifically.

I have Mounds of paperwork documenting my conditions and how it's affected my ability to work that are very recent. So I think I'm good proof-wise. 

Never make a proof-assumption. Seeing each doctor monthly doesn't necessarily equate to severity. I see my therapist twice per month. 

&gt; I don't really understand why my female and gi problems don't count as a disability

The conditions that may affect your reproductive system can contribute to disability, but the effect *on* your reproductive system will not be. From your post you made it sound like the stress of working caused miscarriages. The stress is one issue, but the fact that the stress caused a miscarriage is another issue. 

So if you have PCOS the pain from the condition can be considered, but the fertility issues will not be. 

&gt;  I live in a state where lots of people get it for less then what I have. Even people who work afterwards get it

First, SSI/SSDI is a federal program, all states have the same eligibility requirements. You can't compare yourself to others, you don't know why they were granted benefits, and you don't know what struggles they have that you don't. 

&gt; I also don't understand why me being disabled since I was a minor doesn't mean anything. Don't kids get disability without the credits required? I know they don't get SSI for the ones that do get money. 

There is a SSI program for those under 18. However the disability rules for adults and children are significantly different. Most people who are on SSI as a child are cut off at 18. The childhood requirements are much looser. Your old records will be considered, but SSA will really only look at the last 12 months (that is the legal policy of the program). 

&gt; My fiancé and I have been wanting to move out and get our own place but he doesn't make more than maybe 240 a week, but if we lived on our own would that mean if I got approved for SSI, I wouldn't get a dropped rate monthly? 

How much you get will depend on your living situation and how much your fiancé makes. Marriage affects your non-medical eligibility (like your mom) but even cohabitating can affect it. A person has to earn less than SGA ($1190/mo) **gross** to be considered for the program. You didn't say if the 240 was net or gross, but if it is net there is a chance his income will disqualify you. 

&gt; For me to try to get SSI, I have to get denied twice for that before taking it to a judge

No I was talking about getting an attorney here. Most attorney's will not take a SSI-only case until you go before a judge. There are some community organizations (that work pro-bono) that might help you at the first two levels. You could be allowed at the first level or you could be denied every time you apply, even by a judge.

&gt; I mean the whole point of aid and disability is to help people who can't work or get an education to get a job, I'm pretty stuck. 

Yes the program is designed for this, however, (and please don't take this the wrong way), there is a very strict definition of disability. What you think you can/can't do isn't necessarily what your medical records are going to support.",,,2,0,0,

However, for anyone under the age of 31, the formula is a bit different because they haven't had the opportunity to build up the credits due to their age. 

For those under 31, the basic formula is that they need 50% of the available credits from the time they turn 21. So if the person is 25 years old, then they would need 8 credits (2 years) worth of work within the last 4 years.

Typically once a person is insured (the full 20 credits) that insurance will run about 5 years, even after the person stopped working. However, if you become insured on the under-31 formula, that insurance will run out much quicker. So the person who is insured after 2 years of work and then stops working loses their insurance much quicker.

It can become a tricky area ethically for them because often times the paperwork presented to them (from a lawyer) is written in such a way that it over exaggerates a person's capabilities. Providers don't like to get involved because there is always the legal threat from a patient to sue for what they said (its happened).

It can also be a tricky area for treatment. Most offices have these blanket policies to protect therapists from having to tell a patient that they don't think that the their patient is disabled. A situation like that would ruin any sort of treating relationship, including in your friend's situation where he is seeing some benefit from treatment. 

SSA does not even need this form from the therapist. Have you actually seen the form itself? I find it very suspicious that they want the therapist to sign just a diagnosis form (when the diagnosis is in their records); they likely want him/her to sign a Residual Capacity form.

But, working while applying will lower your chances of approval. That SGA threshold is what SSA considers being ""gainfully employed"" so if you work barely under that that signals that you could work over that amount if you chose to do so. 

You don't go too much into your work history, but to me it sounds like you aren't insured for SSDI (you can make a MySocialsecuirity account to find out); that will leave SSI which maxes out at $750 per month which might not be enough to help your situation. 

You may want to consider trying to find work you can do from home. I know a lot of people with significant anxiety issues find they are suited best to this type of work.

I think in the US it's something like ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual"". 

Now, I suppose you could technically argue you have some sort of mental impairment if you like and perhaps some courts will accept that. But before saying anything else, I would ask you if that's what you really want? Do you think that you are mentally impaired? Haven't we worked so hard as a society to move beyond the idea that existing outside of defined gender identities is some sort of sickness/disease/condition? Do you consider yourself sick or impaired in some way and do you want others to consider you to be sick or impaired? I would argue that pursuing this from a disability angle undermines your cause, but more importantly your rights, in the long-run. 

And then there are issues beyond that. For example, I believe the medical community has stopped viewing trans issues as ""mental conditions"" and has moved towards a model of acceptance. I believe the law will likely follow that. And then, think about what you wrote in your post. You said ""I haven't talked to a psychologist because it has never been a problem but I prefer to play as a girl in video games etc"". I think you will find it difficult to convincingly argue that you fall under the definition of disability because a) you yourself have stated that it hasn't been a problem so it is unlikely others will see it as a problem, b) your post also suggests you likely have little medical evidence to suggest any form of impairment and c) the impairment caused by disability is not a matter of preference, it exists regardless of the desires of the individual.

So, in summary, I would say this is not a reasonable accommodation issue. Like someone else said, this is likely more of a gender/LGBTQIA issue and that is in no way less important than a disability issue but it does mean that you should try to pursue it as such - provided of course that the employer doesn't have an extremely good reason for their dress code.",,,6,0,0,

As a person with a disability, I’m feeling ignored, neglected and marginalized by the current administration. Unfortunately, like every marginalized group in American society, while progress has been made in the past, it hasn’t led to anything approaching equality with our fellow citizens. 

The feelings that you and the other people responding to your excellent post reminds me of the theories of [Wolf Wolfensberger]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Wolfensberger), an advocate for people with disabilities. He coined the term “deathmaking” to describe how institutions in society work in a way to discriminate against us in a way that literally sickens and kills people with disabilities, while at the same time completely denying their existence. This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGR_UUMBB_E)  is worth viewing for more insight into his theories and conclusions about how societies treat people with disabilities.

During the civil rights era, while the public focused on the fight for civil rights for people of color, there were also people advocating for increased rights for people with disabilities. The [“Independent Living Movement”]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_living) that started in the 60’s by people like [Ed Roberts]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Roberts_(activist))who from an iron lung helped expand self-determination for people with disabilities, and increased access to higher education. Later, people with disabilities like [Justin Dart]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Whitlock_Dart,_Jr.), helped bring about the ADA, which passed in 1990 under a Republican administration.

The problem we have in the present is that our current president has denigrated and insulted so many groups, that it’s hard to get a platform to state our needs and positions. I was heartened when many people reacted very strongly to Trump’s mimicking of the reporter with arthrogryposis. Unfortunately that was one of his first inhumane acts.  There have been so many other acts of discrimination, racism, sexism, and just about every other negative “ism” in the book, that it’s easy to lose sight of what happened last week, let alone last year. It’s like living in a noxious cloud of dust that obliterates compassion and everything else that was ever good about America. 

One thing that separates people with disabilities from other groups who are marginalized in American society is we are stigmatized not only because we’re different, but because our equality has been unfairly characterized as Un-American because our equality might cost a business or the taxpayer’s money. But they’re very slick about how they approach it. Consider two these examples:

1.	In public education, providing a free appropriate public education under the [IDEA Act]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act) (something our current Education Secretary, Betsy Devos, didn’t even know existed) is framed by society as an “unfunded mandate visited on the states through federal overreach”. 

2.	When discussing people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, in reference to Obamacare, they call us “preexisting conditions”. That’s because it’s easier to make budget cuts when people with disabilities and chronic illnesses aren’t even discussed. At best we’re going to get put into “high risk pools” that will demote us to third world class healthcare in the name of conservative principles. 

In both cases, we are reduced to an abstract concept. Our humanity isn’t even an afterthought. We’re just a financial drain that stands in the way of MAGA. We’re a line item on a budget that can be wiped out with the stroke of a pen. 

So what to do? I spend time communicating with my city, state, and federal representatives so they know I care about my rights. I remind them that people with disabilities and their families take careful notice when we’re ignored or demoted to being a societal afterthought. I encourage everyone with a disability to positively assert their right to be treated equally. I encourage everyone to know that they matter, and that they deserve equal access to life and liberty, and that there are others who care.

It is much better to have a briefly upset client you were politely honest to, than a client who doesn't trust you. ",,,12,0,0,

I am in education volunteering, and I work with preschool children to help them learn to read.  I have also just started marathon training, and part of my shows is advocating for and informing recently disabled folks.

  What I do for extra money is through apps like busker and periscope.  These apps allow you to live stream whatever.  Busker is a bit better, because it has built in tipping where on periscope, you have make make little signs.

  I put on a wide variety of shows to let people see that disabled folks are capable of a lot more than they thought.  My most common is chat shows.  Once a week I do an in depth chat show about my disability in particular.  I let people ask me all the questions I ignore in other shows.  I also do cooking shows for folks on food stamps to teach how to make good stuff with what you can afford.  I put on art shows where I do canvas work.  I also put on workout shows to let people see how strong we can be sometimes, and to help fellow chair bound folks to see how to become stronger.

  If you want to use busker, it's free.  You'll need a smart phone of course.  And I'm part of a disabled live streamers group that accepts new members all the time.  We don't share profits or anything, we just support eachother where we can.  My biggest earners are the chat shows and the cooking shows.  I made 20 bucks from making an elvis sandwich.  Quick and easy, but the viewer never heard of it before, and made it with me.  Ended up tipping 20.  My biggest tip was 230.00.  That was a good month.

  For live streaming, just be confident, or pretend to be, and put yourself out there.  People respond well to earnest, open folks.  Trolls happen sometimes too; I just play into whatever they're saying and mock them.  They actual help bring in money as folks love to see assholes torn down.",,,1,0,0,

I've traveled a lot and I find that just the act of traveling regardless of where I go makes me notice this sort of response more often. 

As for French and German tourists, I've never encountered any ignorance from French or Germans when I travel beyond the usual ""I'm unfamiliar"" kind of thing but here's my theory. Certain kinds of crutches (forearm) are common in Europe for acute short term injuries that in North America are pretty much only used by people with permanent disabilities. I wonder whether you are attracting disapproving looks more out of an assumption that you are a clumsy American tourist when in fact you're traveling with a permanent disability and don't have another choice?!

It's a weak theory, I'll give you that. I generally find Northern Europeans more accepting and willing to accommodate than most others, but I use a wheelchair and sometimes that's the ""magic emblem"" of disability that people defer to.",,,5,0,0,

I'm thinking that the status above means the individual was medically approved, and the field office just has to do that last part.

As for the models, all the photography and literature was handled by Betabrand and I wouldn't be surprised if the people in their photos were their own employees putting their regular jobs aside for a moment. I'm glad they were able to get a photo with a wheelchair in, but you're right; it's clearly not a disabled model.",,,1,0,0,

As someone who lives in Romania, I sometimes read horror stories here on reddit, about people with disabilities being treated like shit in the US. I've seen countless stories of people doing the baby talk to a person in a wheel chair or making rude comments. I'm used to getting weird looks as I'm walking with my wheel walker, and most of the mean comments/pity comments (which I HATE) are usually coming from old people.

I've also lived in Belgium for a while... it's a little better over there, but I don't recall having people patronizing me or treating me differently over there, ever.",,,1,0,0,

All you're doing is demand that someone else solves the problems, but if you can solve it yourself then why bother? Make compelling arguments and people will be convinced. 

IOW, don't offer problems, offer solutions.",,,1,0,0,

The sub is for college kids that make money doing stuff on their phones like watching videos, answering surveys, etc. You don't want these apps on your regular phone so an old one works great (or tablet or computer even). I've seen kids there clear around an extra $1000 a month really pushing it, I just keep try to keep something always happening on my 2 old phones and usually get around $250 a month. Just check out the sub if it sounds interesting to you, a lot more info there. (Hint- you're getting paid to play some video on your phone- no one said anything about watching it, for one example).

I also do a bit of freelance writing though that is a really nasty game to get into and can turn into a full time job with very little pay if you aren't careful but I'll sell a few-thousand word article for like $50-100 every now and then. I've put together some click-bait articles that have sold for $500. If you know a lot about something no one else does or few people do, someone will pay you to write about it. You just have to figure out who. There are websites for that but be very cautious- a LOT of those sites take a HUGE commision out. There are some good ones. /r/freelanceWriters/

I am also not opposed to dumpster diving when I am able to. Have found all sorts of stuff that I turn around and sell on Ebay. Have probably made more doing this than anything else. /r/DumpsterDiving 

I'm a bad human and don't report any of this.
