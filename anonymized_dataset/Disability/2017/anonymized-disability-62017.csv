I know the feeling of figuring out how best to pay bills like that and it makes me mad when somebody says that as long as you're paying something, they won't send you to collections.  That's not true.

Try calling the hospitals and explaining your financial situation.  That's what I did and a lot,of hospitals offer financial assistance, even if you have insurance.  You might have the hospital's part of the bill written off.  If your costs are really high, you might qualify for the Spend Down program that helps with your medical expenses.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1498482733,"When you go through a full medical review (called a CDR) it is **not** like the initial decision. When you were initially allowed, you were compared to SSA's disability standards. However, when you go through a medical review, your current condition is held up to *your* standards when you met disability. 

A CDR comes down to one question ""has the beneficiary had substantial medical improvement *related to work*"". So they first look at why you were allowed (lets assume it was the POTS), if that is not significantly better then they stop and continue your benefits. If your POTS is significantly better, then they start to consider all your other conditions and whether or not they would be disabling. 

In my definition I made sure to highlight the ""related to work"" part. Your improvement has to be enough that it would change what you would be able to do vocationally; just an improvement in your medical condition is not enough. 

A good example of this: imagine a person had a stroke and only retained 25% of their usage of their left arm and left leg. When their CDR comes around, they are now up to 40% usage. So in this case the person has made medical improvement, but we wouldn't consider this medical improvement *related to work*. That 40% is still no where near what would be required to work.  

If you are regularly seeking treatment and your condition(s) and health are more/less the same as your initial approval, your benefits will likely continue. The important thing at this point is to cooperate with SSA and the DDS. If you don't they will cease your benefits. 

Now, lets say that they *do* cease you at this CDR. It is vital that you appeal right away and elect for benefit continuation. That allows you to get paid while you appeal; you have to agree to pay it back but most people end up getting continued at the DDS hearing level, so it becomes moot.

Worked in a factory for 5 years.  Went to college full-time and worked full time.  Got an internship that turned into a full-time job.  We had a son, I was working full-time, and went finished grad school.  I was working in a career I loved.  Then I had a stroke.  Then I had a blood clot in my brain, treated with blood thinners, that nearly caused me to bleed to death.  Now I'm legally blind, not employed, and struggling with depression too.  

I can't imagine your physical pain.  I have some lower back pain from an injury, but nothing like what you are describing.  Depression is a self-feeding cycle.  The worse you feel, the more you withdraw, and you feel even worse.  I've heard depression can worsen physical pain too.  You mention going to the doctor.  Have you discussed your depression and anxiety with your family doctor?  He or she can prescribe antidepressants or other meds and refer you for counseling get or to see a psychiatrist.  Hopefully this will help you feel more like an active participant in your own life.

Counseling will help you set goals for yourself and help you come to terms with your unhealthy feeling of worthlessness.  It's easy to look at others and feel a little jealous of their success.  But it shouldn't be the measure you use to judge yourself.  Right after I got out of the hospital, I was feeling sorry for myself and was complaining about my circumstances.  My wife showed me the quote, ""I cried about having no shoes until I met a man with no feet.""  Quite frankly, it pissed me off.  Until I thought about it.  It's not even about there being someone worse of than you.  It's about being thankful for what we have.  It sounds like you have a sister who helps you, a stable, but not perfect living situation, and accessibility to healthcare.  Hopefully these resources can help you get the help you need.

  I pray that you can find a way to relieve your physical pain, feel better emotionally, and that you can find your passions again.  Good luck!",,,3,0,0,

I don't like the word disabled. As a definition, it's very accurate, and doesn't have the same derogatory connotation as other words that have been used in the past. *However, I still feel like it puts the emphasis on what a person can't do than what they can do.*  
There will be moments and situations in which one needs to specify what they cannot do, what accommodations they might need in order to fairly enjoy an activity like anyone else. But at all other times, we just want to be seen as human. As people.  
For example, you're a blogger. That's something you can do, and it highlights your capabilities. You also have a prosthetic, because you did have the unfortunate circumstances that led to that being necessary. But, in most of your life, that diminished level of ability isn't as meaningful in a negative sense. Instead, you choose to share your experiences in a way that are meant to humanize your life, and the life of others who go through similar struggles.  
I'll never think someone is wrong or politically incorrect if they used the word disabled (unless they use it in a derogatory manner), but I know I prefer to be thought of as able.

With SSI cases, we only order records back from 1 year prior to the day you applied, so that might be why the older sources are not listed.



""Is there even any point in appealing? Is a case of depression as severe as mine enough to qualify for SSI? I know there's no harm in trying and hoping for the best, but realistically, what are the odds that I'm approved?""

Yes, it's possible to get approved for your combination of impairments and depression alone, and I can't speak to what the odds are, since it isn't about odds, but impairment severity. You're more likely to be approved by an ALJ, I can tell you that much.

As for the lawyer, they do not collect payment unless and until your case is approved, the  they get a portion of your back pay, with a maximum amount, I think, of $6000? I am not totally sure though, since that isn't my area of expertise. How long everything takes depends on your state. Yes you should bring witnesses to testify but don't bring 3 that are all going to say the same thing. If you can get your doctor or therapist to testify, that is ideal. As far as behaviors to avoid, just don't exaggerate or lie.

I'm sorry for all the SSDI/SSI rigmarole you went through, you shouldn't have had to provide all that information twice, the SSA offices are understaffed and overworked, with high turnover rates. I'm also sorry you were denied; with the new listing changes for mental health conditions, they are instructing us to focus on signs instead of symptoms. So you can talk about your feelings and symptoms, but if the doctor can't find signs of mental illness, such as poor eye contact, disheveled appearance, inability to concentrate or pay attention during the exam, slowed or hyper motor activity, observable nervousness, etc., they're going to call it nonsevere.

Ultimately, traveling with a disability is doable, but it requires a lot of planning. What do you want to see?

It's easier to influence voters when all they ever hear about disability programs are stories of ""pill poppers"" looking for a check.

So don't exaggerate or lie of course- but don't downplay the way your condition affects you. Mention anything you think someone who knows nothing about you and your condition would need to know.    
Not sure what your psych issue is, but for example- Is your sleep affected? Do you ever stay home/ isolate due to symptoms? How are you with getting along with others? Have you ever had problems with prior work or school, bosses, co-workers etc? Any difficulty paying attention? Memory problems? Do you take medication? If so do you take it as directed? Do you follow your prescribed treatment? (And still have symptoms) These are just a few examples of things to bring up if they apply.

Most stuff in Santiago is very accessible - not all the subway stops are but it's still better than the subway in NYC.  They also have a relatively accessible bus system.  Most buildings are accessible and the city is fairly flat and easily navigable with sidewalks.  As a general rule I'be found that more bike-friendly cities tend to be more accessible and that was true there.  Valparaiso was NOT particularly easy due to hills and cobblestones.  Pucon and Temuco were decent, as well as some smaller towns in the mountains.  People were friendly and helpful, a little awkward but not overly so.

I was about to turn 17 years old, had just been picked to represent my country in trampoline gymnastics, and was well on my way to becoming a surgeon. That all changed on 6 June, 1990.

It took me two years to finish high school, I then spent six years at university, studying for two different degrees, neither of which I finished, or rather, wrote final exams for. There is not much you can tell me about disappointment, disillusionment, or depression. Been there, done that.

In 2011, I finally found a career I was not only good at but had a passion for. I've been doing online marketing ever since. I can't tell you how, or where, you will rediscover your joy. I can tell you, however, that it's a choice. I'm not saying it's easy, but at least you get the opportunity to decide for yourself. The question you need to ask yourself is, do I want my life to get better and, if so, how badly do I want it? No one is going to give you your old life back. The sooner you can make peace with that, the better. Living with a disability can be very rewarding if you channel your energy into things that you're not only good at, but for which you have a passion. You'll soon discover that you can make a big difference in the lives of others.

Want to make friends? I recently joined my local Toastmasters club. Not only am I learning leadership skills and overcoming any fear I may have had regarding public speaking, but I am meeting some really great people at the same time. Something else I learned along the way was that I would get as much out of life as I was prepared to put in. If there are changes you need to make, make them. Don't let anyone tell you you can't. Don't compromise your future because it's ""inconvenient"" for someone else. It's your life!

You need to know you are not alone. It took me over 20 years to start my career in earnest. I had hardly lived before my accident took my mobility from me. At times, I also wanted to end it all. Nobody asks for disability (unless, of course, your totally cooked in the head). Sadly, however, it happens to the best of us. I want to urge you to try and make the most of what you have left. Try and find one thing every day to be grateful for. Never place limits on what you're capable of, and above all, always be true to yourself! I promise you this; it does get better. Good luck and God bless from a cold and blustery Cape Town.

P.S.if you are serious about writing music again, I can put you in touch with a well-respected classical composer. If you are prepared to give it your best shot, he may be able to put you in touch with some heavyweight musicians – or work with you directly. However, I would be going out on a limb making the introduction, and vouching for you, so don't tell me to do it if you are not 110% committed. Think about it for a while, perhaps. Just be sure. Remember one thing, Beethoven was deaf, and he wrote some of the best stuff in history. Again, it simply comes down to desire – how badly do you want it? You got a fight ahead of you.

First, [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/02/04/people-disabilities-finally-get-way-save-money/97381332/) may help you out some. Definitely read it. 

Second, what you *really* need to do is find a disability lawyer that also handles trusts for the disabled. I used to have a really good contact in CT for this, but it's been a few years. What you need to look for is ideally a disability attorney that works with disabled people who have uncommon/infrequent income -- mine specialized in helping disabled artists, people who might sell a $2,000 painting one month, and then nothing else for a few months. 

I believe it can be handled through a trust, but I don't know the specifics of administrators. The alternative, which will always work if you can keep up with the paperwork, is setting up an LLC. The inheritance would, I believe, function as ownership interest that then reverts back to you (to avoid taxes). You can then pay yourself a monthly salary from the LLC (which you would have to pay taxes on, FYI), keeping it low enough to not trigger your SSI benefits. The downside is that you'd never have access to anything more in one month than that salary. The benefit is that 1) it is completely separate from you, so the company could be ""funded"" by anyone who wanted to give you money, and 2) it will be easier to find a lawyer who can set this up than the disability trust specialist I mentioned above, because basically any attorney or accountant can do it for you. (You can technically form an LLC yourself online, but don't do it without legal advice. You need to know the specifics of directors, funding, and paperwork before you get into any of it). 

Do not take any of the specifics I said above as truth. They are true to the best of my recollection from being involved with this previously, but don't act on anything I said other than my saying to get a lawyer. I'd hate to have been wrong and that screw up your benefits.

You might well be able to find a lawyer who won't charge you for their time, but you'll likely still have to pay filing fees for either option. 

Good luck! Getting this set up properly is incredibly important.",,,2,0,0,

The East Coast has old infrastructure, and there are just a lot of impediments leftover from that. The West Coast has newer infrastructure, and has been able to align better with accessible building codes. I think your concerns about the east coast and the prevalence of stairs were, sadly, well founded. 

However, I gotta disagree here with OP about LA. It can be a miserable city sure, but it's not particularly more miserable for wheelchair users. All the transit is accessible (unlike NYC grr), there are accessible cabs, accessible airport shuttles, curb cuts are good, and 99.9% of shops and businesses have access (it's really the norm, lack of access is highly unusual and never encountered at standard locations, only perhaps at some clubs/bars/ghetto neighborhoods). There are many newer apartment complexes, which mean many more complexes with elevators. And the average housing style is low to the ground, much easier to ramp than townhouses or old Victorians.

I didn't really want to go into my ""disability"" because I don't see it that way anymore. But I have to add a bit of context. I wanted to fly as a commercial pilot. Then comes the day my eyesight starts to really fade suddenly and for no reason (at the time); I am already a very young adult at this time (18). Okay, so I can get glasses and fix the problem for short term and expect in my 40's to be vision impaired to the point that I can no longer fly. I focused my entire childhood on flying (actually started flying at 13). 

At the young age of 20, I started getting an enormous ringing in my ears. Didn't do anything about it until a bit later. That later showed that I am going deaf and the ringing is so bad that I would rather kill myself than to deal with that pain (and there is no resolve to this day). So not only am I now almost blind, I am almost deaf. 

Try living in a world closing your eyes all the time, or while plugging your ears. Then try it together. 

My point here is, this put a new perspective in my life. I never did the things I wanted to do, but I am doing much greater things. I didn't give up, and yes it ruined my life as far as a pilot, but it didn't ruin my life in general. I had no control over it, just like you. I can get mad and upset, but what good is it going to do? I got pissed off and said fuck it to the world; I set out to prove that no matter what challenges you face, it can provide great insight and you have the ability to make the world a better place.

Anyway, most of my training is in bench science, meaning work in the laboratory. At my level of education, I am a technician. (without the degree I am working on, I only have a bachelor's) Unfortunately, I'm also highly agoraphobic (lab space is open workspaces) and have a couple of unfortunate PTSD triggers for a laboratory space (some of the PPE gets me going). If I were in a senior technician position I would be able to set boundaries that keep my PTSD in check, but at the bottom of the hierarchy I will just keep getting fired repeatedly. I had an office job for the few months before I started grad school, but they were so relieved when I turned in my notice that I don't think they were too pleased with me. When I reflect back, I followed the metrics. I did my job very well and was more productive than my peers.

Years ago, I used to have some luck working in food service (not good luck), but that was before my condition evolved into the state it is now. Unfortunately, one of the consequences of the longer denial of accommodations at my university is that it's put me in further traumatic situations that have reinforced my PTSD. 

It kind of sucks too. There are some treatments out there for PTSD, but a lot of them have high dropout rates than chemotherapy trials. But on top of that, the time between when I was first traumatized and when I finally sought treatment specifically for PTSD was very, very long, which reduces the efficacy of the known treatments.

The fact he can do treadmill walking is great, but I think the problem is that by the age of 7 the bones have hardened. His hips aren't ever going to form right. I suspect at this point the VDRO question is more ""when"" than ""if"".

The V stands ""Varus"". I looked it up, and it's a description of the technique of re-angling the bone so it pushes into the pelvis more securely.

Orthos talk in terms of bones, not the whole person, so he's not necessarily downplaying recovery by his perspective. However there is more to healing than the bone getting stronger. The bones may very well recover in 2-3 months or whatever they say, but that doesn't mean the soft tissues do, or the pain goes away, or even that the psychological aspects fade. The entire recovery process is more complicated than that.

I honestly don't know the risks of waiting. My understanding is that the serious problems don't crop up until later in life, but there may be damage taking place now. Our position with Maria is that short term discomfort now will save her years of pain later. We weren't enthusiastic about it, but I don't think we ever really discussed not doing it.

You need to report to SSA or your examiner once it's assigned as soon as you move. This will reduce delay. If you're staying out of state more than 60 days we have to transfer the case if we cannot make a decision. MI has the case until you report you moved, then they may see if they can make a decision based on what they have- if not, need to transfer it.

But, for the sake of the question, lets go down the rabbit hole. if someone who, *gasp* has to put up with you, gets perks because of it, how close of a relationship does it have to be?

So then what perks do they get? Do they get to park in disabled parking spaces? Should we give them student loan relief because they are doing a public service by dating someone with a disability?

Someone is not going to date someone with a disability for the perks. Hell, that is not even going to be on the radar of the ""Pro"" column. They aren't going to think ""man, I really don't know if I like this person, but hell, I love getting half priced bus tickets, why not""

One look at me and all they can imagine is having to care for me and perform emotional maintenance.

Meanwhile these same employers who ""lose"" my applications would go out and offer jobs to homeless people and then put up signs shaming them for turning it down. There was a thread about this the other day. But no one wants to call me out on my bluff and offer ME a job. Not just because I'm disabled, but also because no one WANTS me to succeed and support myself. Our society (at least in the U.S.) have learned their lessons from Aktion T4:  instead of euthanizing us, they just simply force us to do it *for* them by setting up department of rehabilitation services that are intentionally designed to fail so that we may end up homeless and kill ourselves.

Again, no one *wants* to call me on my bluff and offer me a job just to gather material for an anti-disability post called ""Why I'll Never Hire The Disabled"" - because they know that I would do such an awesome job that they wouldn't even be able to say that I slacked off or skipped days or made excuses. That goes against the narrative of many employers.

Because gloves have that added grip to them, it means your hands have to work less to maintain a grip on the hand rims.  As for skin strength, I would assume each person is different with different needs, however, building up callouses and layers of tough skin needs to start somewhere. 

When I play different sports I find that some parts of my hands need to build up layers of tough skin to counteract their overuse. When I hold a racquet for tennis certain parts of my hands need to get tougher and I might form a callous, however when that skin breaks, the skin that replaces it comes back stronger and tougher.   Same goes for basketball.

Edited to add: she is right that there is a service that could provide devices for her due to her disability.

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1496895482,"It sounds like you're looking at something like the Ergoair, where the user can alternate the cushion pads as they sit in it? I don't know much about them or know anyone who uses one because they are so expensive. I currently use a moulded foam cushion on a manual chair, I can look up the model if you need it but offhand it's one of the deeper Jay models. 

Cushion weight has never been a problem for me as foam isn't heavy, same with air or honeycomb. With a gel cushion or one with battery it is something I'd have to take into consideration. I have a light but not ultralight chair, mine is around 10kg total so I'm not scrimping on every gram. Those who have paid extra to shave off weight will likely be more fussy about weight. From what I know of the Ergoair it is heavy as it has to incorporate a battery, not a problem for electric users with a good battery but less helpful for manual users or those who already find themselves stretched for battery life.

Temperature is a huge problem and I live in the UK! Getting sweaty sitting on a cushion in the sun is just asking for chafing and broken skin. The covers that protect my cushion from sweat don't really absorb it away from the skin, so during the summer I put a light wicking fabric over my normal cushion cover to help. I would like to have a cushion cover that had this included (waterproof fabric on inside, wicking on out?) but then you have the problem of removing the cushion cover regularly to wash it which is a nuisance for those of us with lowered hand function. Similarly any cushion that requires regular maintenance is going to be a bit of a pain in the arse.

The best cushions I have heard of for airflow and therefore temperature control are the newer honeycomb style. A friend who has one loves its ability to keep cool and be easy to wash, but is less impressed with its shock absorbency as an active chair user. This is an important feature for me, I need to be able to curb hop and a cushion that doesn't hug me a little when I bump up and down is no good. 

Replacing it is also a problem. I would be willing to pay a higher upfront cost for a cushion that would be guaranteed to last a long period. The problem I have with my foam model is that as it compresses with age I slide forwards in the chair without really noticing. It is only when it starts to rub or I start to have pain in my back or shoulders that I notice my cushion needs replaced, and by then it's too late. It sounds like your model would solve this right off the bat. If you're looking at an air model I'd be concerned about the rubber thickness and longevity before leaks etc. If possible a 'smart' way to check for leaks would be a great feature, to save dunking the cushion in a bath to check for bubbles! Or however you'd even check for leaks in a responsive (and so presumably electronic) cushion.",,,1,0,0,

Your fill out a rather extensive financial form demonstrating hardship, and they discount your bill or even write it off entirely. Your doctor can tell you more. Ultimately, even if you never payed the bill, it's nearly impossible to forcibly collect from someone with only disability income. Because of this, most hospitals (especially non-profit ones) are probably going to work with you and will use the free services as tax write offs or something. I collect medical debt for a living currently and once I see someone is on disability I pretty much give up on the bill being collected.

Your state also likely has a Disability Rights Center or a similarly named non profit that helps people with disabilities get the care they are guaranteed under federal and state laws. My state has a center that's funded with federal money, and I'm in a red, low population state. Our center fights unnecessary conservatorship, helps get people housing, inspects the state mental hospitals, and ensures compliance in the schools by bringing cases against schools who mistreat students with disabilities.

Service Coordinator I've had for many years leaves. The way I find out is from a new service coordinator calling. This service coordinator is just temporary, but I don't see the sense of meeting with her because of that because everytime I ask her a question her answer is ""I don't deal with kids"". And I've had major issues with temporary service coordinator screwing up my child's file. She assures me that the new service coordinator is hired and starting the following week so I should hear from my new service coordinator quickly to set up nursing services for my child's upcoming surgery. 
One month later. No letter. No calls. Call them and now the temporary service coordinator is now my permanent one. When I speak to her, her comments is, you didn't want to talk to me. When I questioned her on the fact that she knew that I was requesting services for an upcoming surgery she now claims that she is only my temporary service coordinator. Tired of playing games. I call the main number again and talk to another woman who I was told is a supervisor. Tell her my story and she promises to help. After she promises me answers today, she tells me that she will have to clear it with her supervisor. Yep, she's just a worker, not a supervisor. 
A week later, no call back. No letter. Call again and told again that temporary service is coordinator is permanent. No supervisor is available and that's the way it is. Really? Call the Executive Director, who has a open door policy and finally got a call back from the supervisor, who apologized because she admitted that they screwed up. Now, I finally have a service coordinator but it shouldn't have taken this much time or work. ",,,2,0,0,

What **REALLY** pissed me off is that the woman who ""told on me"" came up and asked, ""What's wrong with your leg?"" I answered ""it's for my kidney to drain"". So she kind of knew what it was. Could've spent the time tattling on me to fucking Google what it is. Or could've asked if it was safe in the pool. The fact she ignored all of that and did what she did to start shit is what really made me mad. 

Unfortunately (as far as I know) there are 0 laws protecting people from having their picture/having videos taken of them without their permission, as long as they're in a public place. Even when it's regarding a disability or any medical condition. Which is ironic, considering my doctor's can't even confirm or deny any of my diagnoses to anyone I haven't given permission to. And it's not like my bag was positioned how it is in the photo. I had it up on my thigh, attempting to cover it with my shorts. Preventing my kidney from draining properly, causing hydronephrosis, my kidney to stretch out, scar, and irreversible damage. After I got out of the pool I *had* to move it down because I was in so much pain. That was when the woman started taking photos.

Many people would feel it as an invasion of privacy and take someone's head off. I would think myself rude to walk up to someone and start asking questions about their medical matters.

Based on what you have written here, you do sound like a pretty angry, argumentative person. If we are picking that up in words, that tells me there is the possibility that people are picking up that and more in person.

You've alluded many times to privacy and HIPAA, yet seem stymied why people wouldn't walk right up to you and start asking invasive personal questions.

You can't know what someone's intent is talking with management. I understand that you feel very certain that in this case you do know, but as others have said, we only have your very biased account.

Anyway, that's my two cents. I would never think it appropriate for me to walk up to another patron of a place and start asking personal questions like this. I would probably go to the office and ask what their policy is and if anything in their policy covers public safety in the event of someone with your condition using the pool. If they explained that yes it does, I would assume that they found it safe. If they said that it does not, of course I would be concerned because as you kept pointing out yourself, no one knows where the opening is or how it operates.

But still animals. That's all I've ever cared about and it's being ruined. Surgery also took away my parents just letting it go about me not eating meat.

Yeah, it may seem a little silly. However, she was able to see the equipment you had, which means that she would have memorized what it looks like. In a technical sense, what difference does it make for a person to take a picture to record the same thing?

Even if the above rationale doesn't make sense, that's just the law. If you don't like it, I encourage you to petition.

&gt; And medical issues are a private matter. I've been in court and the judge said if you have a medical reason as to why you weren't paying your fines, you can request that everyone leaves the court room.

That's a part of your ADA rights that is meant to prevent you being discriminated upon in the courtroom. Think of it as being like pleading the fifth. ""Medical issues are a private matter"" depends immensely upon the context. For example, if you need accommodations from a school or an employer for your disability, surely it's reasonable for them to know what your disability is so they can accommodate it. Medical issues aren't inherently a private matter in all cases. If it's legal for someone to take pictures of people in public, then why would that change just because you have medical equipment? You might not like it, but that person was completely within her rights.

ce8eeb92-ce0e-4b5f-accf-daa4a2efa592,1497560876,"&gt;There are lots of things about the SSDI system that can use improvement, including wait times.

The thing that the SSDI system needs the most with regard to improvement is more funding from the federal budget.

The loans in question are federal funds, more of which SHOULD be allocated to help people survive in situations like this. It's politically and morally negligent to expect people to wait for years for SSDI, while demanding that they not make any income while waiting for approval. There's no safety net. 

Even websites like Disability Secrets says that you should prepare for the possibility of having to live on credit cards for a few years. That's hardly different. 

&gt;But no one, regardless of reason, should take out loans that they have no intention of paying back.

Not even for literal survival?

The morality you are applying to the situation is not employed by any of the corporations that currently rule the financial game and influence government through lobbyists. They run the show. It is purely legally acceptable for businesses to find every possible loophole and means to bend the system to their benefit in the name of profit. It's what they are expected to do.

With all due respect, I do not believe this is true. Stretch too far one way and you risk pulling the catheter out, which is dangerous for you and the pool. But mostly you, since you'll be exposing your port to pool water, exposing yourself to possible infection, and the catheter will need to be reinserted by the hospital. Catheters are not to be submerged in water, not in a bath or a pool. For your own sake, since you can suffer serious issues from any moisture exposure. Make sure you understand your procedure fully and speak with your physician. ",,,6,0,0,

On topic though... However rude their going behind your back might be, people have a right to know your procedure is safe for them in the pool... 

Its not discrimination to fear something they are ignorant of.  For example, if someone's face is covered in rashes and blisters and some parent tells them to stay away from their kid... That's not discrimination... They don't know what is wrong with them, they don't know if they are contagious... They have every right to protect their kid...

I've had to deal with some of what you're describing. I can relate to feeling exhausted, burnt out, and feeling like no one is listening.

Things: have you considered meeting with a vocational rehabilitation specialist? It may lift your spirits if you can find some sort of work that you can do. They will know of resources for transportation and such too. They may also be able to help with education if you'll need to take some classes to get into a field that would work better for your disability. Also, have you considered speaking with your doctor to see if any physical rehabilitation would be helpful for you? If you're fairly immobile, it might help to get in a setting where someone is helping you stretch and move your limbs and give your muscles a workout. Here in my city, we have an organization that offers outpatient PT, a driving program, day time adult daycare and also psychology services. You could probably benefit from meeting with a psychologist or a mental health professional. It would be a good reason to get out of the house. Vocational rehabilitation will know of transit options for this as well. You may also be able to use a medical transport company if you're in a wheelchair. You may also reach out to the public transit in your area and see if they offer services like on demand pick ups in non-bus vehicles or discounts on cab fares and things like that. 

It might sound awful but if you're on disability, you may qualify for living in a long term care facility. If you're of sound mind, you're free to come and go as you please but have people there to help if needed. 
In my mom's state, she lives in a nursing home and gives a large chunk of her disability check to the nursing home. In return, she has 24 hour care (which she needs) and all medications and medical related things are paid for. She gets a bit of her check for personal spending. She's allowed to leave, take cabs or whatever wherever she wants to go without supervision. Some people see it as a prison sentence but she has more freedom than she would if she lived in her old home... she'd be (like you) stuck there all the time. This allows her to get out and mingle with people... she's someone who lives to take care of others (because she's a mom of a few kids, its her in dna..) so giving her the opportunity to do these things gives her a sense of purpose. At the nursing home, she waters all the plants (she loves to garden) and she tends to all the plants in the nursing home. She alerts the staff when the birds in the birdcage aren't themselves and sees to it that they get care... which is probably an extension of mothering for her. Her nursing home also allows visits from family pets if they're up to date on their shots. They also have independent living type facilities where you live on your own but have care a few times a week or someone to help clean the house or whatever, but you live in a community of others.

The family in the article is not attempting to defraud the government (they do believe the children are disabled. 

I think its a strawman argument that occurs often in the disability community/this sub. One can question certain aspects of the program without ""attacking"" those who are disabled. One of the reasons that the SSI/SSDI program is hemorrhaging money is because of issues like what has been raised in the 2 WaPo articles; that can have very real effects on everybody else. 

&gt; You could have a parent that should be getting benefits, but the amount is so low they have to get their kids in it.

If an adult is on SSI/SSDI and they have minor children they already get auxiliary benefits. Following your logic, it is ok for a parent to apply for SSI, even if their kid is not disabled, in order to try to get more money?

Ok, yeah the problem was that you were trying to just give them the phone number. They need the doctor/clinic name, full address, and a phone number. That is the only way they can ensure that it gets where it needs to go. 

So did they request/receive those records eventually? If not you need to go to the clinic, get the records yourself, and fax them to the DDS (call the examiner first to find out the best way for that to happen).

&gt; they were interested that I have had a job since I got out and also I am enrolled currently in a university. Does that help/hurt my prospects? I was unsure if I wanted to tell them that information but decided to be honest in any scenario. 

Honesty is always the best policy. If your file is full of inconsistent statements it makes you less credible. Being currently enrolled in University *might* hurt, but not as much as losing your credibility.

The process is going along for you slower than most, but it is moving. The best thing to do is stay optimistic, yet realistic. Only about 30% of initial claims are allowed, and that is skewed by people over 50 who have a much higher allowance rate.

Overall I agree w/ what the other commenter RambleRamble said however it sounds like you didn't provide everything that's out there. You need to provide all sources that had treated you for your impairment within at least a year of filing or when you stopped working. YOU are responsible for giving the info about the doctors/ hospitals etc; SSA gets the records, but you have to tell them where to get records from. So yeah that may mean calling around and asking if you were treated somewhere or not. Have all that ready (doctor/ office name, address, phone number and approximate treatment dates) when you apply and report anything new to your examiner.    
Also if you're under 50 the work history form probably won't be looked at unless you're currently working. It factors into a different part of the analysis and typically isn't used to establish why you can't work (it asks about your job duties, not for a list of reasons why you left).",,,1,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1498049685,"Missouri is one of what is called a ""prototype state"" in that you go from the initial decision straight to an ALJ hearing (skipping the reconsideration step).

Do the appeal paperwork as soon as possible, just to get your place in line. Then worry about next steps. Honestly, your hearing is probably going to be 12-18 months away, Missouri isn't one of the worst states for hearing backlogs but it isn't one of the best either. 

I always suggest that a person seek a disability attorney for the ALJ level of appeal. Attorneys make no difference and the initial/reconsideration level but they *do* increase your chances at the ALJ level. You don't need an attorney to file the appeal, so appeal first and then find an attorney. You will have time, so interview a couple of different ones until you find one you like. Here are my two cents on what makes the best attorneys:

*  You want a local firm that specializes (or does a lot of) disability cases.  I would avoid the national firms (Allsup, Binder/Binder, etc), their business process is to take on a lot of clients, but then spend less time with them. They can have a lower win rate but still make a ton of money. As an examiner I can tell you smaller firms will do more work and are better advocates for their clients. 

*  Ask about any fees associated with them taking your case. Legally, they cannot charge you for their services; they get 25% (up to $6k) in back pay if you win. However, some can/will charge you for copy fees, make you pay to go see their doctors for an evaluation, charge you for obtaining medical records, etc. I would avoid these firms as those charges can add up quickly. 

*  If they tell you to abandon your appeal and re-file your claim (with them as the attorney) I would walk out the door. It is always better to appeal than re-file. The *only* exception to this would be if a brand new, very serious illness came up (like if you discovered you have metastatic cancer)

*  If they tell you *not* to talk to Social Security, or suggest that you not cooperate in any way don't sign with them. They will tell you not to talk to SSA because we are all just trying to ""trip"" you up with questions. That is such BS, SSA will go through them for everything, but you have every right to pick up the phone and call them if you want. Same thing for not cooperating. Some attorneys won't let their clients go to any consultative exams, and that never ends well. 

As for your immediate financial needs, I would check with MO's DSS to see if there are any additional resources available to you. I don't think that they offer interim assistance while you are applying for benefits (that is mostly a blue-state thing). ",,,4,0,0,

If you are denied on reconsideration, you can appeal again to the hearing level. This is where you will plead your case before an administrative law judge.

First of all, the idea that you're ""letting"" your disability ruin your life is ableist bullshit. That little phrase is designed to blame you for the effects of your heart condition so that other people can distance themselves emotionally and still feel good about themselves. You don't have a consensual relationship with your heart condition and you're not ""letting"" any of this happen to you.

Saying that you had 19 years to get used to this is another way of blaming you for something that isn't your fault. You can't understand stuff like that as a kid. Your brain is literally incapable of processing it. There wasn't a way for you to get used to it.

You're allowed to be angry and upset that things were taken from you. It's not fair. Your situation sounds awful.

I have cerebral palsy on my left side and I wanted to major in music in college. I can't play a musical instrument and I'll never be able to. It hurt like hell when I was 16 and realized that I would never be able to make music the way I wanted. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. It still hurts sometimes.

The good news is that you're not alone. Other people have felt this way. Also, there's so much time in life for you to discover new things that you're passionate about. The idea that to be self-actualized you need to ""follow your dreams"" that you've had since childhood isn't true. Most people, in fact, find passions later in life, or choose something to do and then develop a passion for it. There are lots of things that you'll be able to do and love in your life.

If he is not currently drawing benefits himself/deceased, then you can only apply for SSI.

aadea78b-0502-4f40-9d26-143cb3231198,1498847013,"Ssi won't let you preemptively apply. You have to be actively ill or disabled 24/7 and be judged by their doctors and work experts to be disabled enough to do no work in any way. It also takes a lawyer(who gets a % of your back pay if you win) and in my case YEARS of hearings,rejections,appeals and Dr appointments before you get it.

I'm in Texas myself. I'm 37 and been applying for ssi for 6+ years now and still stuck in appeals process. I have documented cerebral palsy,degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis and incurable leukemia and haven't worked in about a decade. I'm a licensed cosmetologist since 25 but being unable to do my profession doesn't matter. They look at any job anywhere. From assembly line sitting down to computer work part time at home. Really any job ever (including any job you've ever had) is what they look at. Full or part time, if it's a job on its way to not existing anymore(assembly job replaced by machines), if it's something you'd get fired in a week or two from having to call in, any job or employment any situation ever. 

The disability diagnosis by their doctors is hard too. Usually crappy doctors who know little or nothing about your conditions running you thru a standardized checklist. Same with shrinks. It's about finding you disabled according to that checklist. 

Even when actively undergoing chemo hardly able to walk wasn't enough. The reality that I'm gonna be ill and undergoing chemo on and off the rest of my life doesn't matter. My doctors writing letters confirming my condition isn't enough. Having cerebral palsy from birth with documented damage to my joints isn't enough. Also being under 50,male.single with no kids, and looking very gay and feminine (impossible to look butch or not sound gay. Even toned down me in a button down and tie is obviously gay before you even speak to me) are all factors that shouldn't matter but because it's Texas they matter very much and have probably kept a few judges from ruling in my favor. The last judge I had had the lowest approval rate in 3 states and is currently under investigation and had her licence suspended. All after she denied my case. My lawyer is livid and says I'll definitely get it this next time around but I've heard that a few times before and am not holding my breath. 

Just telling you all this to let you know that applying for and getting SSI is a long process for most people. Even with a lawyer. 
Especially in Texas where the attitude towards any benefits even for the disabled is getting meaner and more punitive and the number of people approved and the amount of benefits is getting smaller. The criteria for getting so much as food stamps is getting purposely restrictive and hard for anyone to qualify for. And being disabled you have to provide documentation from your Dr saying you're too disabled to work at all Evey few months or anytime they ask for it. If you don't then you'll have to go to job training classes/volunteer work a certain number of hours a week or they'll cut your benefits off. Texas is a really difficult place to be disabled and need help ",,,3,0,0,

As far as what I do now for the mental health treatment, I see a psychiatrist who gives me medication (only for the mental stuff, obviously) twice a month or more at a facility near me called PEMHS and then I see a psychologist/counselor (not sure her exact title) for one-on-one sessions twice a month or more at another facility that is a third party, but that is just more general and they do not do anything with/for my medication there.

The first facility (PEMHS) also has a pharmacy attached to it and I believe they have another segment that is for in-patient treatment. My care there is only out-patient, though. The director at Social Security that I talked to over the phone, when I tried to provide them, based on the phone number only, he was able to tell me that they ""do not accept"", them, as in somehow their phone number is not in their database, I am guessing.

The doctor Social Security just sent me to seemed only to be for mental, they were interested that I have had a job since I got out and also I am enrolled currently in a university. Does that help/hurt my prospects? I was unsure if I wanted to tell them that information but decided to be honest in any scenario. 

It really seemed to me as if the doctor that Social Security sent me to was focused primarily on the fact that I was depressed. They gave me some basic cognitive function test (spell a word, spell it backwards, etc.;) and I'm fairly certain I aced that, but the majority of the questions asked there seemed to be depression-related (sleep pattern, hygiene pattern, spent some time talking about deaths in my immediate family (both my brother and sister died), other basic stuff). 

Fortunately, I was able to provide that doctor with some of the records I personally have from the prison system and they *did* make a copy of those records. I'm unsure if that will help my case at all.

Not sure, really. I kind of oscillate between ""this process is going nowhere and I am going to get denied"" and ""it seems like some progress is being made and I may get accepted"".

Add bullying to it and most kids don't want to be unique and different, we just want to fit in with our peers and feel normal. I have Proteus Syndrome and although I had friends in school, a lot of them would be cruel about my disability behind my back. Having a crush was pointless, I'd constantly be rejected in humiliating ways, when I'd go out with friends outside of school, I had grown ass adults shouting names and laughing in the street. A lot of my childhood was spent in either a hospital or locked in my bedroom, drawing and listening to music. I was, in academic terms, a very smart kid, a straight A student, and I threw it away playing truant to go sit in the nearby woods and have a smoke because I was so tired of being hounded by cruel kids and not fitting in. I tried to kill myself at one point. School was a hard time.
Being an adult is so much easier and if you had told my teenage self what my life would be like now I would have swore you were lying. I somehow have an amazing, gorgeous partner, looking for our second house together, a dog that thinks I'm the bees knees and a small but great set of friends, some who have disabilities of their own. My condition is the worst it's ever been, its aggressive, I'm in hospital more than my home at times but I have come to peace with it and I think that comes with growing up and having good people around you.
There are still shitty adults in the world but most are grown ups, with life experience who realise there is more to a person than their illness. My bullies now have kids of their own and some of them have turned into decent human beings.

One option we're considering is just tendon lengthening right now, then re-assessing his hips in a few years. He has lousy balance, but he's strong and a hard worker, enduring treadmill walking for a half hour or so a day. If we can decrease his contractures and manage his tone, we hope he might take to his gait trainer more, which to your point about walking, could help with his hips and get us out of the derotational osteotomy operation (what's the 'V' in the VDRO acronym btw?)

One Ortho said, in no uncertain terms, that just lengthening wouldn't be enough.

Here's one thing to understand: orthos will always recommend surgery and PTs will always recommend against it. I get both perspectives, but it's also a knee jerk reaction on both sides. My sister and I did our own research and decided to go ahead with it. We have mixed feelings about the result.

I'm assuming your son doesn't walk, or at least doesn't walk much, since those are the kids who get this. Walking/running/jumping is important for the formation of the hip joint while the bones are still ""soft"". By this age, the bone has hardened and if the hip joint hasn't formed right, it's never going to and that means the kid will suffer spontaneous hip dislocations ultimately resulting in serious complications and a lot of pain.

Maria is also severely developmentally disabled and non-verbal. That means we can't tell her what's going on, nor can she tell us how she feels. From her perspective we took her to the hospital and then she was in pain and immobilized in casts for a couple of months. To make it worse, she suffered a spontaneous femoral fracture about a week after the casts came off. It wasn't due to the surgery, it's just that kids who don't walk get crappy bones that kind of break for no reason. So one leg went back into a cast for another few weeks.

She got crushingly depressed. I mean I think she was literally clinically depressed. She was utterly miserable because she thought this was her life now. We showered her with as much affection as we could but it was an awful time. But it will get better, right?

Well, sort of. First of all, don't believe what they say about recovery time. It will take a year, maybe longer, to get back to normal. That was our experience, and we've heard the same from other parents. And her new ""normal"" is different than her old one.

Second, VDRO isn't so much about improvement. It's more about minimizing damage from shallow hips down the road. It's pretty much the lesser of two evils. Our bodies need to walk. When they don't, bad things happen. VDRO is an attempt to create a more stable structure for future weight bearing, even if only when strapped into a stander. A kid who doesn't improve after VDRO probably isn't going to without the surgery either.

Maria pretty much lost interest in standing and walking after the surgery. She used to work on both, but between the discomfort and the long period with casts and just the awful experience, she just won't even try anymore. We still put her in the stander, and once in a great while she'll try to stand with assistance, but that's about it.

We think she has pretty regular discomfort in her hips, and her ortho agrees. However I think it's less than if she hadn't gotten the surgery.

Are we glad we did it? Meh. I mean it was probably for the best but it's really hard to tell, and that's the problem. It's not like we have two of her, one with the surgery and one without, that we can compare.

Again, one reason we love her ortho is he can relate as a parent. We've talked to him a lot about the balance you talk about and he's dealt with it with his own kids. His position is you make the best decisions you can at the time, knowing you have the kid's best interest at heart. He's never tried to push us into anything. Honestly, sometimes there are no good choices, just an array of bad and less bad ones.

Do you use any mobility aids, stick/crutch/manual or electric chair? I'm assuming no full time chair as you mentioned walking. Some people find disability sport helpful for mobility difficulties to meet people who have had the same or similar capabilities for a long time but who are still very active. I learned most things through trial and error myself, but some learn a lot about learning to live with a disability through others, particularly with practical physical tips. 

What do you mean by 'perks', can you give an example of some you've already found? I'm more empathetic personally, I put more effort into understanding about other people (although that may also be down to increasing age!). If you use mobility equipment you can pimp it out which I find a major perk. I love being able to go fast. It's great to always have a seat, and most people are happy to offer assistance with anything, though this can go the other way too. 

If you're meaning more financial/material there are things like (here in the UK) discounted travel, adapted parking, carer's discount. I think they've done away with or restricted queue jumps for days out after people started abusing them. There are guaranteed interviews for jobs which is great if you've been out due to illness. You get to board first on planes or be seated first at concerts.

Most of the 'perks' I get are for when I have a carer, normally a discount for them or sometimes free. Still not really a net gain because I'm paying to hire the carer, then paying for their discounted ticket as well. Here you must prove your eligibility for various concessions and that can be a pain in the arse, hopefully it is better in your area. It is also not unusual for a fee to be involved, I have a Blue Badge for example that allows me to park in more spots and for free but I had to pay a small fee (£30) to get it and have to renew it annually.  

I would still suggest you contact your local social work/vocab/community care department. If you're not sure who they are, ask your doctor or whatever medical professional is overseeing your care. I would also try your local library as they often hold application forms for disability-related-schemes here. But ideally you would have a social worker or community outreach worker who knows the options in your area.

Plans that don’t cover cancer drugs or hospitalization, perhaps. Those patients will have no choice but to opt for more comprehensive plans, which will end up with an overabundance of expensive enrollees and therefore much higher premiums.

Disclaimer: I do know that I'm in general someone not bothered much by personal space issues, so take that into account. And also I probably only overlap with half of what you'll experience, because I don't have any braces, which I imagine adds a bit to the process. 

But here's the gist of the process: 

Go to the airport. If you have any difficulty carrying your luggage, you can request special assistance. From the moment you enter the airport, one of the special assistance people can often be hunted down by either spotting them or inquiring with random employees. Or if you can trek to the check in desk, you can ask there too. If you don't really need help with your luggage, but you are super stressed about the security process, it might be worth pretending you do need help with luggage and requesting special assistance anyway. Because they'll guide you all the  way through security and it often streamlines the process.

If walking is difficult, they will provide you with a wheelchair. If this gives you the opportunity to take off your brace and that's easy for you (I don't know your situation), it's worth considering because the brace is maybe the only security hassle. But if not, I wouldn't sweat it too much--you absolutely have the right to keep your brace on. Heck I don't even take off my shoes. They ask me if I can, I say no, and that's that. When you get to security, if you're wearing brace, you tell them you have it and ask if that means you need a pat down rather than scan. I imagine it will, but I defer to actual brace-wearers for that detail. In a wheelchair, I always have to get a pat down. 

I know there are horror stories about such things, but honestly I have flown what has to be hundreds of times now--I fly for work, and I fly for fun, travel addict--and I have yet to have a bad experience. Again that disclaimer: I'm not made uncomfortable by people touching me. But that said, I've never once gotten a creeper. The genders are always matched--if you are a lady, you'll get a lady employee; male, male. They follow a rote script, back of the hands for sensitive spots, pat you all around by in the slightly  disinterested way of someone underpaid just doing their job, takes just a few minutes...I dunno...I've never found it to be that wild. Private rooms are your option if you feel uncomfortable doing that in public. 

As for your devices, cane, anything else--you're allowed to take them onboard and they don't count against your carry on luggage.",,,3,0,0,

82905be6-8ec4-46d7-b1d9-93b9f7796b4b,1497367808,"Just be honest with us as you fill out the form.  The examiners are correct that we have a lot of information to sift through every day, and limited time to do so, but we do (or at least I do) read everything.

There are no ""traps"" relating to what hobbies you can or cannot engage in, or the other questions on the form.  Giving us an honest answer and being truthful about your limitations (or lack of limitations in certain areas) is always best.  It comes across as much more credible to read someone saying something like ""yes, I enjoy reading as a hobby, but I do it at my own pace and with frequent breaks due to impaired concentration"" rather than ""I had no hobbies and I can't do anything ever.""  

Almost nobody wants to be disabled, and most people who are disabled want to be as functional as possible.  Reading obvious exaggerations (based on conflict with medical evidence) in the function report doesn't do the claimant any favors in the eyes of most examiners.  Personally, it makes me generally doubt their statements and assertions.  We see quite a few applicants who view disability as a form of welfare assistance, rather than as a means to help people who cannot work -it's easy to get jaded. 

Meanwhile, an individual who explains that they are trying their best to remain as functional as possible, but who is clearly limited by their impairments, is going to come across as much more credible in their statements. 

TL;DR: Just be as honest as possible in filling out the form.  Be as detailed as you feel you need to be, but also try to keep it as short as possible -we're very busy.

8741039a-2dab-49ab-8987-b989a020f5d8,1498064409,"Were you scheduled for a psych consultative exam? If not, you can speak to your contact at SSA/DDS and ask about whether that's possible given your long history of mental health treatment and difficulty recalling all past treatment dates. Is there someone that you could work through your past treatment periods with, say a partner or family member? All you would need are the names and telephone numbers of the facilities, and then you can call them and ask if they're still holding on to any of your medical documentation.

I'm afraid work history cannot be used as proof of a mental health condition given that there will be no signature by a mental health professional.

Think of it this way - you're in court with SSA and you have to prove to them, beyond a reasonable doubt, that your impairments prevent you from working for at least the next year or could reasonably result in death. What kind of documents will you submit as evidence of your impairment? If you only have one document from your current/recent doctor, chances of an allowance are very low. Some commenters suggest you get a lawyer which could be helpful to a degree, but again, if you do not have documentation of the longstanding and debilitating nature of your mental illness, you will more than likely be denied at the ALJ level regardless of whether you have a lawyer.

I try to dispel the misconceptions about the Social Security Disability program. It is very complicated, and very misunderstood. I mean weekly people repeat the ""they deny everyone the first time"" myth on this sub. I try to bring in some explanation and objectivity. I still have to look up rules and process on a daily basis, so I can only imagine the anxiety that you all feel going through the process without programmatic knowledge. 

I also like to be active on this sub to help show people that government workers are, you know, people. I think this is probably a goal of /u/e76f76df-0247-4667-af5d-b1e0b2ec0bb8 and /u/e05c6193-ace5-4ebd-8c27-5d5db5e2aa36 and the few other DDS/SSA employees I know are active on this sub. It happens with some regularity that someone will make a comment about how we are all heartless and love to just screw with people. But if an individual does not meet the disability criteria that is not on the examiner. Trust me, we are all way too busy to sit around screwing people over. I have a great deal of sympathy for people, and there are times that I wish I could grant benefits to someone but the rules prevent it. If we made decisions based on feelings, the program would be bankrupt. 

It does make me feel better to know that my advice is so helpful to so many people. Seriously, this has made my day. I've been on this sub since I joined reddit, and at first it was just to see what people were saying. But I started chiming in to dispel misconceptions and it just kind of blossomed from there. 

Anyone is always welcome to PM me your questions, if you want to get into more specifics than you might be comfortable with on the open sub. There are obviously some 4th-wall rules that I can't break, but I try to help the best I can.

There is room on the last page, the remarks page, for you to indicate that you deal with overwhelming emotions that limit your functionality. It is best to put what you literally do during the day- ex: get up, shower, eat breakfast, watch television, etc., then use the remarks page to indicate that your activities are limited by your emotions.

Thanks for this.  That makes sense and clears up part of what I was wondering.

&gt; I have to say that I do roll my eyes when I see responses that have filled all the lines and go off the page.

That makes me intensely nervous to know that.  As you might be able to tell from my posting style, I tend to be rather loquacious (I've been rather unkindly described as 'verbose' before) in writing--not because I go into too much minute detail per se, but I'm naturally thorough and it's just the way that I articulate myself.

I did also wonder about that 'hobbies and activities' question.  Perhaps I'm being really paranoid, but that honestly felt just like a trap.  I saw that and immediately imagined that if I really put anything there they'd automatically go ""HA!  SEE, YOU CAN'T BE REALLY DISABLED!"" so I'm not sure how to answer that.  I'm not sure what the purpose of that question is on this form, except to catch people out if they put several hobbies that require energy and claim they aren't able to work.  That's scary to think about.

&gt; 
The function report is used in conjunction with medical records as a supporting document. It is used to show how you are (or are not) able to actually go about your daily tasks. It will not alone make or break your claim.

I understand.  I'm just trying to do everything in this process the best that I can as my medical records are probably pretty sparse.

&gt; It is absolutely not true that everyone is denied the first time; it is one of the rumors I most hate. It stems from the physical rules- the older you are, the more likely you are to be allowed, so people are denied when they first apply at a younger age. For mental impairments especially, the rule of ""denied the first time"" is absolutely NOT a rule.

I never said or implied that *everyone* is denied the first time, just that I'm 99.9% certain that *I* will be.  My conditions are severely disabling but I am very young--23 in fact--and my records only go back to 2014, with only two (both were 5150 I'm pretty sure, after I voluntarily walked into a crisis center, based on what I said there) admissions into inpatient care for three days each time.  I don't have lengthy histories of hospitalizations, I don't have an employment history that illustrates my inability to keep a job, and I imagine that the conditions I'm applying on the basis of (see flair) are not widely or typically viewed as disabling.  So, sadly, everything in my particular case points strongly to denial.  I knew someone who was approved the first time through for both SSI and SSDI at 20 for psychiatric disabilities including BPD, but she was also bipolar (which I'm taken to understand has a much higher chance of approval), had records going back to childhood w/many hospitalizations and an extensive employment history (had this job, lost this job) even by that age.

The only thing I really have going for me in this regard (that is in my records) is the enormous list of meds I've been on and off and how they work inconsistently, the fact that I have genetic variations such that whole classes of meds aren't recommended for me, and that it's been treatment-resistant.

Anyway, I digress.  Thanks for your reply.  It's very helpful to talk to an actual examiner for insight into this process.",,,1,0,0,

Just to be technical, they can work and earn some money (as long as its under SGA) while they are going through the process. I am *not* saying that it is, in any way, close to enough to live on, but the possibility still exists. 

&gt; Even websites like Disability Secrets says that you should prepare for the possibility of having to live on credit cards for a few years. That's hardly different.

I think that there is a difference here. With a credit card you're borrowing against ""your"" money and that of a credit card company. If it becomes clear that you're not paying it back they can stop the line of credit and send you to collections. The thing with student loans is that they are often deferred; so it isn't until the government is $25k into it that it becomes apparent a person can't pay it back. I don't like the idea of someone using my tax dollars to go to school knowing they won't pay the bill.  

I see your overall point, and I think that when we are talking about ""survival"" things become morally grey. I don't think it is right when corporations do it either. 

I think that there are a lot of intermediate steps that one should take before getting to this situation. There are state-funded welfare programs a person should look into first.

What hasn't been brought up in the discussion is how the actions of this student will impact other students. They are taking a spot in classes that could otherwise go to an individual who plans on using their degree; that loan money (or scholarship money if they get anything from the school) could have gone to someone else.

One issue that comes up a lot when people are considering disability is the type of work that they want to do and were trained to do versus the type of work they are capable of doing. 

If laboratory set ups are triggering to your PTSD and agoraphobia then that is certainly a vocational hurdle to your chosen profession. But do you think that you would be capable of working in an environment where you didn't interact with a lot of people? that is something that SSI is going to look at. If its an environmental trigger (people and space) there are jobs where that wouldn't be as much of an issue. 

Are you currently in treatment now? Its not overly clear from your post. To be considered disabling the conditions have to be disabling despite treatment. There is some leeway with mental health disorders on this, but if you are not attempting to get treatment it lessens the credibility of your case. 

My best advice would be to explore some different career options. At your age you aren't going to qualify for SSDI (and even if you did it would be very small amount) so you're only looking at SSI which caps out at about $740/mo.

It doesn't mean that you can plant yourself wherever you wish and say whatever you want. All free speech means is that the government cannot retaliate against someone for expressing opinions. In other countries, people are imprisoned for speaking against their government or drawing political cartoons or any of the things that we do constantly here in the US. That is what free speech is.

The right to protest only applies to peaceful protest in public areas that does not impede others from conducting their daily life. The people outside Mitch McConnell's office were trespassing on private property. Yes, government property is still private property, in the sense that it is a place of business with security concerns, maximum capacity concerns, etc. I suspect the entire thing would have ended very differently if people were protesting right outside the building.

She needs to have medical records detailing her disabling conditions.  Include every condition on the application.  SSA can go back a year or more, but often looks more closely at recent (90-120 days) records.  She should make sure she talks with her medical providers about her disabling conditions so they can be documented in their notes (reductions in hours due to disability, how the conditions affect her work and home functioning, etc.).  You can file online and she can even designate a representative like you to help.  My other suggestion is to be proactive.  Her case will be assigned to an examiner and you will receive his or her contact information.  Call and ask if there are any undelivered medical records, and if so, you can either contact that provider or pick them up yourself and submit them at your local SSA office.  Keep copies of everything you submit and document all the calls you make to the examiner.

The problem is that healthcare has been monopolized, and various reliances on subsidies and IP laws as well as the practice of defensive medicine have caused us to forget about costs of HEALTHCARE and worry more about HEALTH INSURANCE covering our costs. In the past, it was possible to see a doctor, get prescriptions, and even get surgery and pay for it yourself simply because hospitals competed in a market and there was little to no government involvement in that sector. With the rise of Medicare and other great society programs, along with stricter regulation and the FDA basically granting monopolies to big pharma, everything related to medical care started to get expensive, and people started to rely on health insurance more significantly. With the insurance companies having to shell out much more money, they began to raise premiums, deductibles, and start listing those famous ""pre-existing conditions"" as ways to save money. This also, created monopolies in insurance. 

The quality of care in hospitals has gone up significantly, and now American hospitals are the most advanced and technology-packed in the world, however, costs are sky high. When the ACA passed, although it got more people on health insurance and ended most of the ""pre-existing conditions,"" the Act has basically increased the cost of premiums and deductibles heavily in most states, and actually caused many health insurance companies to either opt out or go out of business as a result of the new mandates. The situation is truly a mess, and a solution does need to be found. 

Trying to halt all ends to an extremely flawed system is only going to hurt us (disabled people) in the future. And although I'm not a fan of the Senate's replacement, protesting the end of the ACA will keep causing the prices to go up until there's a fundamental lack of health insurance quality, first for healthy people (as is already happening) and then for those who need it the most. If the cost of HEALTHCARE is logically evaluated and decreased to a point where it becomes affordable, and health insurance companies are allowed to complete, the cost will go down and the crisis will end",,,6,0,0,

I don't really feel like this is the right place to discuss the other issues surrounding him, but healthcare is relevant to this sub and it's silly to pretend like Trump is a generally well-meaning dude who is simply being slandered by evil people. Watching the clip, in the context of him discussing a disabled reporter, it's not a huge leap to see it's a stereotypical impression.

I just searched ""fashion walking cane"" on Amazon and went from there!

If you can get through the detector with just a cane, security is quicker. If you use a chair for the rest of the airport, they can roll your chair around and pat it while you're going through. 

If you have to stay in the chair the whole time, they can roll you through the detector, just know that it can end up taking an interminably long time, because they only allow one person in a wheelchair through at a time and try to space them out. 

They'll want to run your cane through the detector, but should have a wooden cane for you to borrow for getting through to the other side, if you need it.

They'll probably need to swab your brace, but I don't think they are allowed to ask you to take the brace off.

I started crying at security last summer because of all the extra attention. I was in my wheelchair and got someone very thorough and nearly missed my flight because of it.

There are technical experts here who can help answer your question.  As far as conditions, the SSA will look at all of your condions.  For example, if your chronic pain worsens your depression, that can help your case.  Make sure that you are getting medical care for all of your conditions and that you talk to your providers about what's going on with you so it gets documented.  Your medical record is crucial.  As far as an attorney, you can usually get a consultation for free.  I hired an attorney immediately, but if I get awarded on the initial application, I'll be paying $500 for not much more than the attorney getting my medical records and forwarding them to SSA.

In terms of how much detail is best, I have to say that I do roll my eyes when I see responses that have filled all the lines and go off the page. Be specific without giving minute details. If you enjoy reading- are you reading a book or a magazine? When it asks if you prepare meals- what kind of meals are you preparing (TV dinners, sandwiches, whole meals?), or are you ordering, bringing in foods? 

The function report is used in conjunction with medical records as a supporting document. It is used to show how you are (or are not) able to actually go about your daily tasks. It will not alone make or break your claim.

It is absolutely not true that everyone is denied the first time; it is one of the rumors I most hate. It stems from the physical rules- the older you are, the more likely you are to be allowed, so people are denied when they first apply at a younger age.

I'm sure there are other resources available to them--maybe not monetary benefits--that would help them over the long term.  Financial counseling would definitely help this family. There are programs to help low-income families weathering their homes to help reduce their electric bills.  Maybe bankruptcy would help erase the high interest deb that is crushing their budget.

The entire time I was reading the story I was concerned about what would happen to the daughter and her children should the mother pass away.  

I also thought about the boys and the life they are being steered towards.  Being labeled with so many dire conditions can't be good for their self esteem.  Instead of encouragement to do their best, these boys hear about everything their ""disabilities"" prevent them from doing.  And this hits home to me because my 11 year old son was diagnosed with autism this year.  He is very high functioning  He talks in depth about politics, science, technology and other subjects, but he struggles to dress himself correctly or to eat without making a mess, and he is lacking in some social graces.  He wants to be a medical doctor, and I encourage him to work hard to pursue his dreams.  I tell him that he may want to steer towards medical research or something because of his spatial deficiencies, but I would never tell him he can't do something.  I wish those boys could have a strong role model in their life to encourage them rather than make them feel like they're just a diagnosis.

Because the people who weren't me, well, they seemed happy.

They also weren't disabled. So, I tried my best to appear not to be. That drastically failed, but I didn't see that at the time. All I knew was that when I put in a lot of effort with my articulation, when I didn't use my crutches and when I stopped being authentic to myself, and to my experiences- I felt better. Self esteem wise. 

I could convince myself I was like them, the abled masses.

Stigma is a disgrace, and society treats disability like it is a disgrace. As a teenager I was aware of this, but not in a cohesive way. For me, it became /I/ was the disgrace.

So yeah, maybe I am obsessing over it a little. I don't understand what makes me so special that they needed photos of me--the same women whose little grommets piss in the pool every chance they get.

a8864141-94e2-41f7-ac71-8ea5cb48a557,1496760872,"I've been on two so far and I had pretty decent experiences both times. We went with Carnival (two different ships, I can't remember which ones) and I use a wheelchair and for the most part we didn't have a problem. I don't know if other cruise companies have similar layouts or not, so worst case if you have any doubts you could always contact the company to ask.

While on the ship things went pretty well, a lot of the doors were automatic so they'd open on their own, and there weren't very many steps that I noticed outside of the obvious staircases if you didn't want to wait for the elevators. Some doors had slightly higher thresholds which made getting the wheelchair over the bump a little tricky at first. I have trouble with steps as well, but the few times I walked around a few steps I didn't have any problems. I was able to get to pretty much any of the things I wanted to get to, with the exception of their little jogging track and mini golf because it was up a few stairs. Everything else was perfectly accessible.

Off the ship might be a different story, though. Depending on where the cruise stops, it may or may not be very easy. They had a ramp to get off of the ship onto the port of wherever you dock, but sometimes the initial step from the ship to the ramp could be a little rocky. One spot we went I remember there was a bit of a gap as well as the ramp being a few inches lower than the ship so it was a little nervewracking to get on and off the ship, but it was still doable.",,,1,0,0,

ccb3fb93-e321-4429-91b8-3bd113b37f9c,1498777958,"1) things to look for. off the top of my head, here are some things I notice walking people not thinking of:

* small entrance lips that aren't quite steps. Many power chairs suck at going over lips as small as an inch. If you're looking for a smooth entrance for her, make sure it's actually smooth!

* doorway widths. They need to all be big enough. One that is often too small is the bathroom door. Check that it's big enough!

* bathroom setup in general. Can she get in? Move around as much as needed? Is there room for whatever she needs to use bath/shower? Etc

* doors heaviness and other impediments. If she in general has the autonomy to go out on her own, check that difficult apartment door set ups don't prevent her. 

* mailbox location. This is perhaps beyond her needs, but access to mailboxes is often forgotten. 

2) on ramps. A general rule of thumb to ramp design is the ADA requirements of a 12:1 width:height ratio. As a  wheelchair user of both manual and power types, I've found this to be more practical than merely bureaucratic. It's shocking how much length a ramp needs to be safe. Even with power chair. It's not just a matter of strength to get up it--it's often more a matter of it not being so steep you can slip going down it.  12:1 is really necessary in most cases. 

That ratio means that there's a big difference between ramping one step versus even 2 steps. Ramps get long quick! And often this effect is reflected in local building code requirements as well. For a single step ramp, things are easy. But for multi step ramps you might be required to add bells and whistles, such as anti-slip, guard rails...they can get pricey. 

At bare minimum, make sure there's enough space for a 12:1 ramp, and make sure it won't block any pedestrian walkway (pretty much the only reason apartment could deny you building it).

3) rental listing accuracy. I've found this to be so so. The accessible marked ones basically just mean access with no steps, which hey good start. Sometimes complexes will just checkmark that though even if all ground floor ones are taken. By far the biggest error in using that option is that there are many, many perfectly good options *not* listed as accessible. So you're missing out more than being misled.

I have a backpack attached to the back of my chair with a bike lock. In the backpack I keep my chair charger whenever I go out, so that if I get in trouble I can stop in at a pizza shop or whatever to recharge. People have been great and accommodating every time that has happened.

This is sort of a shitty answer, but it sounds like you need one of two things: either substantial chair maintenance (possibly including new batteries), or a new chair. Maintenance should be covered by your insurance, and insurance will buy you a new powerchair every ~5 years. It's stuff you need to keep up with, even if you're only on Medicare.

If that isn't a possibility, the top-of-the-line, new power chairs can be bought unused for less than $5,000, occasionally down to $3K depending on time of year. I know that this might as well be $5MM for most of us (myself included), but my point is that you might be able to get help to get a new chair if you can't do it through insurance. Some of the cheaper chairs (front drive, or more ""scooter-like"" chairs) are around $1K. It's just about money.

Alternatively, you can buy batteries yourself, but they're several hundred dollars.

Aside from that, sadly there isn't much. Paratransit, non-emergency ambulances, etc. are painfully expensive. You'd be lucky if there are any Uber or Lyft in your area that have a wheelchair ramp or lift. Maybe call all your taxi companies and ask if any of them can transport you with enough notice (it takes like two days here for them to get one of the limited accessible vans).

If none of that works, you'd have to go to your city or county. They will have a paratransit option available if there are any options (a bus in your city = paratransit van available). It's frustrating in that you often have to schedule them well in advance, and they often take forever to get where you're headed because they try to pick up other people at the same time. But you need to have an option there if you need to get to a doctor. 

The last thing I would say is don't cross your emergency services. If they've told you not to call again, I would not call again unless it's an emergency and you only option. They can and will send you a bill for their services if they get frustrated enough with you, and that's the last thing you need. 

I hope you can come up with a solution. It's an awful situation, and without insurance and willing doctors it can be near impossible to sort out. ",,,5,0,0,

She has a couple of hundred in the bank. Should she leave her bank account as is and have us make note of it within her SSI (under SOAR) filing? If I have learned things correctly from y'all, the answer would be yes. We basically want her to leave the money be (in the bank, I have now learned) for her eventual utility bill hook up charges and whatnot for when she transitions from the shelter. 

ETA. The program director double checks everything before it is sent off. We are trying to be morally sound and upright towards the entire situation. I thank everyone for trying to help me learn more nicely.

Jay: Don’t End A Word started as a game that my mom taught me when I was a kid that was perfect for long car trips.  When I took a video game class taught by my friend Jason Smith, we had an assignment to come up with our own video game concepts, and I thought Don’t End a Word would make a great mobile app.
Joe (my dad):  I agreed, so I got in contact with Etasham Hasan, a Bangladeshi developer, who turned our road trip word game into a smartphone app.

3e2013ba-335a-42bb-bacc-4a6e31c5ed95,1497310972,"You listed the two broad questions on the form, all the rest get into detail. In a nutshell, explain why you can't work in the first question. Like, I can't pay attention to a task more than 5 minutes, my feet hurt so much I can't stand more than 5 minutes, I call in sick at least 2 days per week, I can't get along with people, etc. In the second question, honestly I rarely read the answer to that one, since the questions about whether you can cook, sleep, clean, shower and change clothes every day, drive, shop, go out alone all come later in the questionnaire. My advice is to answer those detailed questions first, then go back and answer the broad ones. We want to know about your day to day functioning and how it relates to your ability to work. Keep that in mind THE WHOLE TIME. Think about work activities (concentrating, finishing tasks, relating with others, making it through the day without crying or walking off the job), that is what we want to know.

Also, if you write a ton of stuff, we won't read most of it (I read about 15 questionnaires a day, and we do have deadlines) and please don't write in cursive.

I don't necessarily think that any of your accommodations are unreasonable, depending on what you mean by 'decreased workload.' Having slightly less work is one thing, but having to have a significant portion of your work shifted to other people may not go over well. Unfortunately, accommodations for mental disorders is more difficult to deal with than physical (its more ""subjective""). 

Unsolicited advice? If your work environment is so bad that it is making you suicidal you need to find a new job. As an attorney you have a lot more options than most people. Having your own office or getting to work from home 1 day per week isn't going to solve your problems. And in that kind of field, getting accommodations for mental illness you will get treated differently and it will severely hamper your career with that company. ",,,2,0,0,

A non-blind individual on SSDI could earn $1,169 per month exactly and so long as they are never found not medically disabled, never lose benefits. In fact, if the individual can apply certain work Incentives, they can have a job paying well above that and still received SSDI indefinitely.
