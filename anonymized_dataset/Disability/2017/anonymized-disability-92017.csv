I'm not worried about PayPal closing my account, it's all aboveboard and it's a risk I'm willing to work with.

I use my PayPal balance purely for business expenses. I basically re-invest everything back into the business each month. The paypal balance/earnings will be reported to the irs at the end of the year. I just have to show SSA my schedule C to show my income after expenses. 

I think I'm just going to have to kill the business and burn the money somehow and relax for a year or two for my health to get fixed or until I go blind. Kind of giving up on this stuff.

Just a few notes on the survey itself, you have no option for people who have no difficulty opening wine bottles to opt out of further questions. I answered ""I have no difficulty"" but the next question asked what makes it difficult and so on. Likewise if someone does not drink wine there is a no way for them to opt out of further questions.

And a note on the design of the wine opener itself. Unfortunately despite being a bottle a week kind of gal, I live in Australia where our wine is just a simple screw top and hundreds of devices already exist to open those likes [this one](https://i.imgur.com/b4PbeHu.jpg) or [like this](https://i.imgur.com/b4PbeHu.jpg). The second type are given out for free by a lot of OT departments I've been to.

So I don't really know what problems someone might encounter with wine bottles.

I've never had the dough to splurge on a bottle of imported, corked wine.

I've always just used a tea towel and a bench top to pop the cork on a bottle of bubbly. Boxed wine comes with a handy spout, I like the button kind, though I sometimes have to monkey-claw it because of PIP Instability, the ones you rotate are difficult because my wrists don't twist easily. So I end up having to lift the box to avoid spills.

Running away is also not a safe situation, so what the parents are doing is backfiring currently.

The blueprints in my DNA make malformed collagen proteins, so I suffer from hyper-flexibility, constant body-wide pain, joint instability, and frequent dislocations. Some of my organs seem to also be affected as eating a regular diet causes my GI system to randomly cramp and bleed. I practically live in MRI machines and hospital waiting rooms. I have more doctors in my life than friends. My extensive experience using America's healthcare system confirms that healthcare reform is imperative. 


One of our primary issues is that millions of Americans, insured and uninsured alike, cannot afford to go to the doctor when they are sick. Millions of citizens are forced to ration their medicines because our country's drugs are systematically overpriced. These problems are so difficult to contend with, sometimes I literally just want to die and be done with it. In the wealthiest society that has ever existed, sick people are being methodically priced out of being alive. That is morally  outrageous. America overflows with good people, so there has been bipartisan outcry:  WE CANNOT AFFORD HEALTHCARE. Yet the bill being rammed through the Senate does almost nothing to help affordability.


In fact, multiple proposals in the Graham-Cassidy bill are insolently the opposite of what is supported by American voters. Polls suggest that the American people are IN FAVOR of maintaining the Medicare expansions and subsidies granted by the ACA. We are IN FAVOR of protecting citizens with pre-existing conditions from exploitation. We are IN FAVOR of protecting elderly and disabled Americans from exorbitant premiums and endlessly growing deductibles. We are IN FAVOR of requiring all insurance plans to cover hospital visits and mental health care. We are IN FAVOR of banning caps to coverage. Voters are united in asking the powers that be to advocate for the best interests of the American people, yet the Graham-Cassidy bill obstinately sides with the insurance industry.


I've contacted and begged our Senators to VOTE NO to Repealing and Replacing the ACA, to VOTE NO to the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson legislation. 


Repairing the American healthcare system is an issue close to my heart. I know you're all busy, but I desperately need for you to contact your Senators and ask them to reject the half-baked Graham-Cassidy bill, especially if you live in a red state. https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/


If you are comfortable with it, please  also let your representative know that it's time to begin the arduous process of transitioning our great nation to a single-payer healthcare system. The American people resoundingly agree that universal, single-payer healthcare is America's best way forward.


Thank you to everyone who is fighting for our right to be as healthy as we each can be. Let's push aside all the red and blue bickering and create legislation that is good for everybody. It won't happen quickly, but we can make it happen. This is our chance. I beg you, please help me.

Invest in a *good* wheelchair. One that is lightweight because you'll be taking that in and out of your car quite a bit. (unless you become a part time user, but even so, convenience is great)

Get a wheelchair meant for self pushing, so one without the arm rests, or you can choose one with low or foldable arm rests because I've found that they really limit your movement and causes a bit of bruising near my upper arm. 

I can't remember the name, but there are like.. hand guards for the wheels so that you don't jam your fingers into the side. People with TBI or experience numbness on one side or hands, or lack of feeling, etc., find this very useful. 

Umm.... a sturdy foot rest. One that won't lean to one end or the other when you rest your prosthetics on them. It depends on if you'll be using prosthetics while using the wheelchair, but that's an option to have. 

A wheelchair with handles on the back, I've found to be useful so you can put a backpack on it. 

A comfy, soft or sturdy cushion for you to sit on. Trust me... it's great. 

I can't think of anything else right now... I hope this helps and I'm sorry to hear about your accident. It's going to be a long, hard transition.

61864ea6-aaea-45f3-a428-985911146ed7,1504608852,"There are basically two standards for successful disability claims. One is the official standard of SSA found in something called the blue book. You can find it at https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/glossary/blue-book. If you review the mental health standards, you will see that they are a pretty high bar. On the other hand, if you can produce medical records that meet this standard, you're in eventually. If you can't meet this standard, then you have to show that you can't do any (I repeat any) competitive work in the national economy. That is really tough to do with an intermittent disability like bipolar. 
If you succeed in becoming eligible, there are programs that will support you working and not losing benefits called work incentives, but you have to meet the eligibility criteria first.
A lot of people are denied, not because they aren't eligible, but because the first two levels of disability determination don't actually use the standards I described above. They use a more limited mechanical system for determining eligibility and it denies a lot of people who are actually eligible. You should go into this expecting that you will have to reach the fair hearing appeal stage to get someone who will actually use the legal standard to determine your eligibility. Right now the waiting time for a fair hearing is around 560 days.
All of this is the reason why people get an attorney. For disability cases like yours, the attorney doesn't get paid up front, only if they win, and there is a limit on what they can get, which is I think around 28% of your award when you win. If you win the hearing, you get benefits going back to the day you applied. If it takes you 18 months to win, the award is pretty big and the attorney gets roughly 28% of that. They don't get anything of your check once you are eligible.
The other problem with SSDI rather than SSI is that SSDI only gets you eligible for Medicare and that only after two years. During the two years, if you are in a state that went for Medicaid expansion, you can get Medicaid, but you lose it when the two years are up. Medicare is not a good system for people who have a cyclic disability because it focuses on hospitalization.  There is something called a spend down which is a ""whole nother thing"", that would make you eligible for Medicaid for at least part of the month. 
My suggestion to you is to become part of your state or local recovery community of people with a severe mental illness. You can get real support and benefit from other people's experiences with the disability system. If you tell me what state you live in, I'll direct you to that recovery community. 
Good luck in any event.

I have a thing that makes walking and standing painful, and running currently impossible so Moomoo really tugs at my heart because she has a gimpy walk too. I was thinking how when I was a kid, seeing a kitten work past her own limitations in adorable ways would have really lightened my mood about the whole shitty legs thing.

I didn't consider the therapy kitten part, so thank you for putting that thought in my mind. Moomoo would be perfect for it- since her mom rejected her she had to be bottlefed a lot, and adores being cuddled by people. She legit chills with anyone holding her for hours weather they are walking around or sitting and would be perfect.

 Moomoo has made a lot of progress and thankfully seems to have a milder form of CH(she can walk and run just goofy, but can't seem to jump or climb) and while I feel she will be a gift to any family who adopts her, I feel like her uniqueness and sweet passive nature(you can hold her for hours with no protest) would make her even more perfect for unique families.",,,1,0,0,

614ee4a4-834b-40db-bf51-d373640e0ce9,1505919375,"My experience as well with the California Department of Rehabilitation's Blind Field Services.  My counselor was actually legitimately learning-disabled.  I have emails of him sending me replies to other people's e-malls and including their personal info.  I have no idea how or why someone with literal autism could be employed as a job counselor for voc rehab, but if he could do it, then why couldn't we get whatever job for which we apply?

Best advice is to just keep putting yourself out there.  No one will advocate for you or speak up for you and help you keep your job.  We just have to accept that things will always be harder for us because we'll always be placeholders until someone better comes along, even if they aren't as qualified, or [has a criminal history.](https://m.imgur.com/TVaeIg0). Remember that even ex-cons are more preferable in the workplace than us, *simply solely because they aren't disabled*.  I had a part-time job at The Gap without any help from voc rehab, and they slowly whittled my hours away to nothing.  I have a GIF showing my decreasing work schedule somewhere.  My current job was also achieved without any help from voc rehab; just a random ""put myself out there"" at some random Christmas party where some girl saved my number as a joke only to call me six months later to see if I wanted to be a ""waste maintenance tech"".  So now I work weekend nights running a mop all over the restrooms and keeping the trash cans empty.  The one job that had a tangential relation with my voc rehab counselor was only through a third-party school for the blind, and when I was experiencing a hostile work environment and constructive dismissal, literally no one intervened to help resolve or mediate the issue.  Was forced to quit for my own safety and had to be homeless for a while.

So it really comes down to how badly you want to survive and maintain the current status quo of your quality of life.  Just go out and apply willy-nilly and wait for the ""what are your weaknesses and how do you cope with them"" part of the interview to project yourself as being virtually indistinguishable from any other employee.  None of my employers accommodated my hearing loss by speaking up; they simply trusted that I'd get the message by context of what everyone else is doing, or asking someone what was said.  None of my employers accommodated my low vision; they simply accepted that I had to approach whiteboards several times or ask someone what is written.  None of my employers accommodated my height; they simply nodded towards various stepstools or stepladders folded up and tucked away in random nooks and crannies of the workplace.  You *could* mention your arthritis, but any employer would expect you to cope with it in such a way that you'd be able to be 100% productive.  No one wants to hire me for a respectable, full-time job because I *look* like I'd have the potential to slow down productivity by always asking ""wait huh what'd he say let me turn my hearing aids up,"" or: ""hold on let me get my phone out so i can zoom in with the camera app and read the customer's order"", nor would any respectable employer give me a chance to prove otherwise.  Doesn't take much to clean toilets and empty garbage, though.  So just do your applications and resumes and cover letters like anyone else, and as long as you don't expect anyone to bend over backwards and spoil you with ""easy"" work, you too could win the social lottery.

Good luck!  Hope everything works out for you!",,,4,0,0,

[Chuck Close](http://chuckclose.com/) is paralyzed and uses a powerchair. 

[Henri Matisse](https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2014/matisse/) had stomach cancer and was mostly home and bed-bound for the time that he did his famous cutouts. 

[Here's a wikipedia article listing some other famous disabled artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_in_the_arts#Disabled_artists). 

If you move over to the classical music world, Violinist [Itzhak Perlman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C_U7eUbVd8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m58s) had polio as a kid and now uses crutches and a scooter to get around, and plays seated. 

Percussion megastar [Evelyn Glennie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosBfSqdL10) has been profoundly deaf since age 12. 

Ludwig van Beethoven was deaf when he wrote most of his late works, including the 9th symphony which has [the famous ""ode to joy"" chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6E3xem_c2w)

Moving over to writers Fyodor Dostoyevsky had epilepsy, Jorge Luis Borges lost his sight and was blind by his mid-50s. 

In terms of learning disabilities and psychological disabilities there are too many to count (but I'm running out of steam so I'll let you google that one for yourself). 

If you want to connect with contemporary disabled artists google ""disabled artists community"", ""disabled artists collective"", ""disabled writers"" and the like. 

[Carolyn Lazard's work jumps to mind as something that you might be interested in](http://www.carolynlazard.com/in-sickness-and-study/). 

I'll also recommend you check out the book [Daily Rituals: How Artists Work, edited and with text by Mason Curry](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work/dp/0307273601). It has a lot of primary source material of different artists, writers, scientists, etc talking about their daily rituals. A significant number of them either work directly around an illness or there is one implied. It's an interesting read for those of us who need to work a little differently from the norm.

Social Security typically determines SSI eligibility based on your resources at the end of the month and the resource limit is $2,000.00 for individuals or $3,000.00 for couples. So, for example, if you had resources exceeding the $2,000.00 limit at the end of January 2017 and none of those resources were excluded (or not enough were to take you below that threshold), that would make you ineligible for SSI in February 2017 and any SSI payment that was made at that time would be an overpayment subject to collection by Social Security.

""Wheelchair accessible house"" can mean so many things. Can I just get in the door? Can I wash carrots in the kitchen sink?  Can I operate the window blinds? How high is the bed? Can I put trash in the bin?

What I'd love to see on VRBO is copious pictures, and include a wheelchair in every one of them for scale. 

*Be honest*.  Wheelchair users have lots of creativity working around limitations: tell us what they are and then we'll be able to make an informed decision. If a prospective renter asks a question that you don't understand, don't ignore it, seek more info.  

""Just a _little_ step"" is useless, but exact dimensions are great. Describe other accessible facilities nearby: is there a sidewalk? are there bicycle paths? what parts of the property would a chair user not be able to get to?

The ideal way to learn about this is from an expert-by-experience. Contact the Independent Living Center nearest the property (looks like [Catskills Center for Independence](http://www.ccfi.us)) and ask them to put you in touch with a wheelchair user who's living on their own. Do a walk-through of the property, ask them what barriers they see, and take careful notes. Then pay them for this expertise. This would be in addition to the measurements and copious photos.

I always use an even, firm tone of voice. Yelling almost always makes things worse. I find that stating what someone did and asking why they did that. ""I asked you to help me fill out this paperwork, which I am paying you to do and is part of your job. Instead, you have being disrespectful and demeaning, and have not helped at all. Why? Is helping me with this paperwork not part of your job, or are you simply refusing to do the job I am paying you to do, and being a jackass in the process?"" Or if I'm feeling nicer ""I understand that you hate your job, but that's not my fault and I'd appreciate it if you didn't take your frustration out on me.""

Other times there's nothing that can be done and I just vent to someone later or go for a walk.

If you have a genuine fear, I'd look for people in your area who do sedation dentistry: this can involve different things, like being prescribed anxiolytics, laughing gas, or outright knocking you out so you ""sleep"" during the procedure.  

Note: I honestly don't know how common this is or how insurance may or may not cover it, as I have been lucky enough that a) I don't have dental anxiety, b) I've always had pretty great dental insurance.

If you're worried about cost/coverage, your local community college might have a dental program that allows you to get a cheap or even free exam if you let a trainee examine you.  This often means it will take longer, but there is an instructor rig there to make sure they do it right.  Call 2-1-1 (if you're in the US) to find programs like this in your area.

Good luck!",,,2,0,0,

bca7de8a-f3e1-4e32-9f59-905febdeba19,1504720271,"SSA DDS employee here - almost all of our psych allowances require that the claimant have some exacerbations of the illness substantiated by inpatient stints and/or ER visits.  Also, it usually helps us prove our case when the claimant is being treated for a while by a psychiatrist and/or psychologist who can give us a comprehensive and well documented description of your mental status, symptoms, and how you function on a daily basis.

This may sound cynical, but we see allegations of mental disorders all the time.  It really comes down to how that particular disorder inhibits your ability to function.  A lot of people have a diagnosis of something like depression, but they're well-groomed, are able to do stuff like cooking and cleaning, are able to travel alone, able to manage their own money, etc.  You have to remember that we sometimes see very serious functional impairments that inhibit people's ability to do those things.  

I'm just giving an example: If you're really so depressed that you don't shower or leave the house for days, can't concentrate long enough to fix a meal, don't get along with other people, etc.  These things need to be documented by a medical provider who will be diligent enough to give us that information so that we can argue that you meet our standards for a disability.  So often I see medical records from providers who month after month have the exact same chief complaint and exact same vague mental status exam. 

I always say that if the doctors were less busy to actually talk to us, we would allow a lot more people because we can actually get down to the nitty gritty of how people actually are functioning.  ",,,1,0,0,

- when the terrain didn't work for a scooter,  I got a firefly manual chair add-on and loved it!    
  
- working something out with the professor for those rare times I was late (car parked in front of curb cut, disability transport forgot to pick me up,  etc.)      

- definitely keep in contact with the disability services office.  They will probably have some ideas. Next term,  you may be able to troubleshoot before chases start.   

- when possible, schedule classes so that you have more time in between.    
     
- one thing I realized was something I was not going to get was parking near my classes.  My campus just wasnt set up for it. So my first choice wasnt possible,  but there were other options.  
   
Sorry it was a tough day.  Hope you figure something out OP!

Yeah my schedule was just like this becauE I was like one of the lag group of students to enroll since my high school messed up and never sent the school my transcript so that was an issue in itself.

It's not rare when the pain is going strong for me to close myself right up. Sometimes it's because I'm irritable and don't have the patience for others --which is unfair to others, so instead of lashing out I just isolate myself. Other times I'm just too fatigued to care or function. It's nothing personal, and I'm often good to go after a few days. This can however lead to one sided relationships where I get everything I want out of it, a friend when I want one, and the other person is left frustrated and wanting because two weeks a month I'm just not there for them. This too makes me feel guilty and causes me to close myself off and keep people at a distance.

As for ""work on and fix some stuff"", when it comes to pain and disabilities we can put off a lot of simple life tasks. We can let our appearance slide, we ignore responsibilities, we can allow tasks to pile up into nigh unbearable stress until it all topples over and we start piling it up again. Maybe for her it's something much more simple. Regardless, it might not hurt to take it at face value. She may have some personal shit to sort out and requires time --just keep your own time in mind. 

Lastly, be upfront with your desires and expectations, and move on if these aren't acknowledged or returned. By no exaggeration years can pass us chronically sick folk before we look up from our own problems, and that could be an unhealthy wait for you. Find out what she wants and compare it to what you want and see if there's compatibility and/or an acceptable middle ground. 

Talk, understand, and work it out or accept a relationship of half-measures and frustrations.

I remember that my mother unlike other people didn’t have much of a problem with how I look and never doubted that I’ll be successful despite all disabilities, her only real problem was the pain. She could never accept that her child would forever be in pain, she was always desperately searching for miracle solutions. They simply don’t exist and in my lifetime they probably never will. I always knew that and accepted it. Her search for a miracle was stressful for her, for me, it ruined many our experiences. Hope is great, but sometimes, acceptance is more important. I often avoided my mother and speaking to her, because I didn’t want her to know full extent of my problems. I didn’t want her to suffer for me, I didn’t need the added stress. I actually do that with all healthy people, because they usually can’t accept things as they are. 

When the pain is too much, I isolate myself more. That’s what I’ve been doing last couple of weeks. It’s driving me crazy, but knowing other people are hurt to see me in pain would be even worse. All my healthy friends would come up with ideas and try to give me hope. It’s very nice from them, I appreciate it, but it’s not what I need. In my case it would help if people didn’t try to comfort me, solve problems. I just need them to hear me out, accept it and let it be. Perhaps in your case it could help as well.

I have installed a fall detection app on my iPhone called ""fall safety"" that alerts three people of my choosing that I have fallen and may be unresponsive. It calls them to play a recording plus texts them and emails them with my last known GPS location. 

This means I must ""wear"" my iPhone on me at all times and that's fine. I have an otter box with the belt clip so it's always on me. 

The other thing I discovered is that Siri doesn't respond when the phone is face down or the sensor on the face is blocked. Such as when in the otter box belt clip. So I drilled holes in the belt clip to allow light through and thus make the ""hey Siri"" feature always available. 

Now if I fall down the stairs and am in a crumpled ball of broken bones I can ask Siri to call 911. But be sure to say ""on speaker"" in your request. There are instructions via google how to ask Siri to make a hands free speakerphone call. 

I don't have a google or amazon PA and have no intentions of ever getting one.  I feel I am better served with the fall detection app, my modified belt clip and the ability to make a hands free speakerphone call as I lay dying at the bottom of the stairs while my dogs stand around thinking it's a new game.

Another thing is that I leave my phone laying next to my pillow charging with it face up so that Siri isn't ""asleep"" while I am. This way if I am in distress in bed I can call 911 by just speaking.",,,1,0,0,

If the patient has good manual dexterity, you could probably rig up some sort of soundboard with buttons. Each button would correspond to an Alexa command (pre-recorded MP3 file) that would be played by an iPod or something. Unfortunately, you would be limited to pre-recorded commands, and a limited number of them.

If you can find some sort of actuator that the patient is able to use, you could certainly build a bridge between it and the Alexa device. Depending on the actuator, you might actually be better off by passing Alexa and going directly to a PC that accesses a web service.

Generally speaking, a person has to have work in 20 out of the previous 40 quarters (5/10 yrs) to become insured. Once fully insured, that insurance lasts for 5 years once you stop working. However, for people under the age of 31, there is a different calculation, because you wouldn't have had 10 years to build credits (SSA assumes you start working at 21). 

When you're under 31, the 50:50 part is the same, but the number of credits is dependent on how old you are (how far past 21). So for a 25 year old, that is 4 yrs (20 credits) so a person needs 2 yrs (10 credits) of work to be insured. When a person becomes insured based on these special rules, the insured status lapses quicker. The exact length of time I'm not sure, but it is fairly consistent with how long it took you to obtain those quarters. So someone insured after only 10 quarters or work is going to have their insurance lapse faster than someone with 12 quarters. 

So there is a chance you were insured, but that it has already lapsed. The work in 2016 does count towards your quarters, but after not working 2 years it might not be enough to retrigger insured status. This is a Field Office side calculation - I'm the medical side so I dont know it all off the top of my head. 

A person can still file for SSDI if their insured status has lapsed, as long as the DLI (date last insured) is within a certain timeframe of the application - usually a couple of years. If your myssa account is giving you a SSDI benefit amount it does mean that at some point you were insured. As long as they can find that you were disabled prior to that DLI they will approve the claim. 

As to your SSI question - yes the function form is used on all SSI claims. The function form (SSA-3373) is supposed to be sent out on all current-time period claims. Even if you have a concurrent claim with the SSDI being a DLI case and then the SSI being current it would still have to go out. 

It is still best to call the DDS just to make sure you didn't miss anything in the mail. All of those forms come out on one big printer so sometimes things don't make it into the correct envelope, or the examiner could've just forgot to create the form in the system. if they did intend to not send you the form you can ask why - but my guess is that if it was intentional your case is a DLI one.

They would have said I had ""vasovagal syncope, probably"" but my partner argued them into doing a holter monitor instead of a sloppy few EKGs. They would have left the POTS idiopathic but I argued them into bloodwork and a geneticist referral. They would have said I had ""borderline lupus"" but I argued them into doing ALL the bloodwork and I was positive on a very specific test. It's sad that you have to nag and cajole and do half the work for them but that appears to be how it goes. I'm sorry you're in pre-dx limbo. It's so tiring.

What's worked best for me: bringing a friend or partner to advocate, self-research on the internet through PubMed and Facebook support groups, playing dumb (pretending I didn't think I had anything but ""just to soothe my silly worries, could we rule it out?""), finally finding a supportive GP to work around grumpy specialists, taking a month's break when I'm burnt out on fighting and fighting.

Office chairs: They can be a big barrier. Most meeting rooms and offices are full of empty office chairs, and I'm constantly having to move them out of the way so I can have a place to sit at a table or desk. My advice on this would be: (1) Make sure there are no more chairs in a room than needed, and (2) Try to get people to push their chairs back in under meeting room tables/desks when they're done. These two things would help a lot.

Rugs: Don't use small rugs if you can help it. Those black entry mats for people to wipe their feet on are always getting caught under doors and can also get caught in wheelchair casters (not to mention being a tripping hazard for walkers). I don't know of any good alternatives... maybe make sure they're tacked/stuck down somehow?

Bathrooms: I'm sure you will follow your country's laws about accessible bathrooms. But one of the most annoying things is entering a large bathroom with many stalls, only to find that the one accessible stall is the only one occupied. Make sure to put the accessible stall(s) at the very end of the room (so people have to walk past lots of other stalls on the way to it), and put a placard on it with the access symbol. This will help discourage people from using this stall if they don't need it.

Doors: If you're going to put automatic opener buttons on doors, please make sure they are the kind that don't take 10 minutes to open and that don't make the door extremely hard to open manually. Also, make sure the open button is located along the path that a wheelchair user would actually travel. And if you have two sets of entry doors, it'd be nice to wire them up so that one button opens both sets at once.

This is a start. I may update this later...",,,6,0,0,

My mom was in a wheelchair temporarily and we struggled to get her around clothing racks and stuff at stores. 

I agree with the other poster about discouraging use of the accessible bathroom stall. Either make all of them accessible, or put up signs. I never use the accessible stall and it drives me up a wall when I see people use it because it's bigger and not because they need the space or the bars to maneuver. Also you might look at your parking lot and make sure the accessible spots are close to the accessible doors and not near rough patches of asphalt.

You are actually the perfect type of person for VR. You don't need a lot of expensive accommodations or assistance.

As far as ironing boards go you can get small ones with little short legs that are designed for you to sit them on a table and use them - I know IKEA have them and possibly department stores like Walmart might?

You can use a tandem adaptor to attach a pram to the front frame of your wheelchair, as long as you check compatibility first. And/or (easier for me) you can babywear in a sling. It does intefere with your push a bit especially as they get bigger but you're not going to be bombing along the street with a baby in tow anyway. 

As they get older you get them on their feet asap and get them on babyreigns so you can loop the reins round your wrist/waist/belt and push at the same time. When they're tired and you're out without the pram, they sit on your lap. Currently at this with a 2.5 year old, works just fine as long as you have some basic upper body strength. I am female so no mad hulk muscles but I do have some nice Michelle Obama arms going on from carting her about!

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1504804287,"Yep that's the ones. There are different styles but the general idea is that it lifts the back pram wheels slightly or just attaches them so you can push all wheels together. You could also contact [Remap](http://www.remap.org.uk/) and see if they can suggest an Aussie equivelant, there's a US version and this kind of thing is right up their alley.

If you drive I strongly recommend a car set with a swivel base, it's easy to turn around to face you from your chair and as they get older and heavier they can climb into it themselves. 

I'd also suggest a baby harness, a full body one that you can lift from a back point. This means you can lift a young child by the harness when they are old enough to be crawling around and learning to sit up. This is so. much. easier. than trying to bend down to floor level and support all the right bits while picking them up. Great for that stage when they're too big for baby handling but not big enough to be fully ambulant themselves. ",,,1,0,0,

c4c6a003-cc26-4573-8be1-5282e9e1ee65,1505186634,"I was treated like shit by most of my therapists.  I remember being left with a soccer cleat by my OT when she got tired of me not understanding the ""bunny through the hole"" metaphor for tying my shoes (it just confused me, a LOT because it didn't look like a bunny).  I had writing teachers that wouldn't listen to me about any preferences and treated me like I was stupid because of my writing.  Only my speech path was good. The experience eventually contributed to me becoming non cooperative when assessments put me somewhere on the autism spectrum and called for final testing to confirm PDDNOS and rule out Aspergers. 

My middle school and high school didn't accept dyspraxia as a proper disability so getting accommodations of any kind was like pulling teeth.  I ended up just not using any partly out of teenage stubbornness, and mostly because the options I was given were useless. The general consensus was that because (most) teachers could read my writing(mostly) that I ""got over"" dyspraxia and no longer needed accommodations. 

Extra time wasn't readily offered, and when I eventually convinced them that writing often hurts I wasn't offered any reasonable technology for writing(what I was offered would have made it impossible to look back at notes).

By the time I took my SATs, they also didn't accept dyspraxia as a disability.  So I had to handwrite my essay portion, which not only meant my handwriting was horrible(and slanted, I can't keep a straight line), but also that I was unable to properly organize my essay.  I ended up with a verbal score in the 99th percentile, and a written score in the 70th.  For reference,  I took my GREs last year on the computer and scored in the mid 90th percentile on both the essay and verbal sections.   So I'm sure that directly hurt my undergrad applications.

So...yeah.  I was basically treated like shit a LOT because of my disability in school, and it heavily colors how I feel about my own disabilities. ",,,2,0,0,
97c43ab3-4f02-4947-b96f-aa58bff15209,1505199996,"I can relate. In 7th grade I had an SLP who insisted I take a deep every time I talk. At speech we did stuff that can be learned in the classroom, such as vocabulary words, black history. In 8th grade I had a different SLP and she didn't make me take a deep every time I talk but the work was easy. It was obvious I didn't need speech. In fact, English was one of my strongest subjects. So I don't understand why they didn't terminate speech.

I stopped going to counseling in 11th grade. 1. I was already receiving psychotherapy outside of school. 2. There was an IEP meeting at the end of my sophomore year and the guidance counselor said they will work on ""a better understanding of social cues"". They never asked if I wanted to work on that. Funny thing is in class I was socializing with my friends a lot and was highly extroverted. They wanted to pull me out of a class I was socializing in to learn social cues? 3. I didn't want to be pulled out to receive special help. Once in counseling we read an article about sex trafficking. I didn't want to miss class lessons to read an article about sex trafficking. 

I hated IEP meetings because you ultimately don't get a say in anything. IEP meetings are basically adults sitting around talking about you in a 3rd person pronoun and discussing your needs without consulting you. At the end of sophomore year I was called to the deans office to complete a questionnaire about what I wanted to be. I didn't know what I wanted to be and they expected an answer so I just wrote lawyer. They are required to gather my input for transition. Why not other aspects of my IEP? 80% of college students change their major, but at 16 I was expected to provide a career decision.

Not having a say in my IEP lead me to not using accommodations the school imposed on me. In 12th grade my statistics teacher told my para after a test ""I'm not sure if I'm allowed to fail her if I don't accommodate her"". I said he can fail me as I wasn't going to use the accommodation anyway. Also in 12th grade some students got to write a essay (part of the test) 3 days instead of 2. This was a co-teaching class (2 teachers) and on the 3rd day the teacher announced who will be going with him to finish the essay. I declined the accommodation and later complained how it was cheating that everyone had 2 days to write an essay but some students had 3 days. I didn't think this accommodation should exist and everyone should be given the same time to write an essay.

I had bad handwriting. My handwriting is fine now but in elementary school the teachers could hardly read what I wrote, and in middle and high school when I was writing fast. The school talked about a laptop device but never gave me one. I didn't want one anyway as I didn't want a device that wouldn't connect to the internet and didn't want this accommodation.

I also had the school deny my disability. In 11th grade when I asked my counselor why I had an IEP is it because I'm disabled? She replies ""you're not disabled"". Then why do I have an IEP and a para? No one ever spoke to me about being in special ed or my disability, except for middle school but that's only when ***I*** started the conversation. I don't believe in hiding this information from the student. Some parents and teachers go on to tell classmates about that a student has trouble doing XX because of XX diagnosis, but never talk to the student themselves about their disability. ",,,3,0,0,

My son is medically complex but has been stable for most of his life.   He got full clearance from his cardiologist, dentist and orthopedic surgeon to go through with the surgery.

I wouldn't give up my childhood for a chance to walk. I spent many years of my life in physiotherapy, in and out of hospital and the only result was that I had no friends, no hope for the future and didn't know how to communicate with people my age.

I am now 23 and i see myself as a wheelchair user but not disabled. I have never  walked without a walking harness, so i have nothing to miss. I am as i have been all my life and if your child has never lost movement in his body then he will most likely see himself as whole, rather than someone who lacks this and that.

I did have the chance to walk and my parents pushed it until i was 14. leg operations, physio and using a walking frame etc. I knew it was beneficial to me but i never saw it as a must. It was more of a hobby. once a week i could be tall for a while and then my legs ache and it wasnt as fun. Although i would like to mention at this point that the leg stretches did of course help my leg muscles from deteriorating. 

I also went through multiple surgeries such as a spinal fusion. My mother used to work with disabled children at a school and she made a good point to never put my body through lots of serious surgeries/recovery all at once as she had seen children go through a huge major operation and they werent the same when they came back. Too much stress on there body just changed them mentally and thats why my parents did my spinal fusion in two parts (this took us seeing 6 doctors and going to great olmond street hospital to find out that you could do it in 2 parts. research always pays off!!).

I do live in England and the access can be poor in parts but very good in others with good accessible places and transport to allow me to be independent. 

From my experience, push your child to never think about his disability and make sure he is pain free and with as much mobility as possible to let him pursue any career and life he wants to. teach him independence and to adapt around the world and he will learn how to adapt around his disability too. This not only making him different but creating unique ways of doing a job that no one else will figure out and hopefully doing the job better. ",,,6,0,0,

Also, I dictated this quickly because I have a busy day but really want to respond. I apologize for any automated errors made by my software.

I am approaching 20 years, post injury. It was an incomplete C5-C6 spinal cord injury. In layman's terms, I can move my arms, not my hands, but I do have a tiny but useless flicker of function in two fingers and I am able to make functional use of my triceps. About the time that I completed my rehabilitation 19.5 years ago there were just beginning to be some of the more extensive physiotherapy options that are bit more predominant today. Many of those involved extensive and intensive days of therapy, hanging from harnesses while machines or therapists move limbs, often with the assistance of some functional electrical stimulation.

I chose not to explore that and stand by my decision. Some acquaintances of mine were injured a few years later and pursued that route. What I see from them now is many, many years of their lives gone with nothing to show for, if not one of those useless flickers I talked about in my hands. All that money, all that time and opportunity to get back to life, get their education (most of them were either teenagers or young adults when they were injured) and not be living in limbo was gone. I respect their optimism and motivation but I think most of them look back and realize how much they lost and how little they came for all that time and wishful thinking. For the record, most of them were working with First Steps Wellness Centers or something with similar approaches to rehabilitation.

My biggest disappointment with my 20 years of wheelchair use has not been just getting around, but the paralysis that accompanied my injury resulting in the many hours per week I spent on personal care, particularly using the washroom. Everything you hear in the media is about people who will ""never being able to walk, ever again!"" Who cares! Give me back my plumbing, and maybe my hands, and I would be pretty happy.

So, that said, whether it was surgeries for your child or years of intensive rehabilitation, if the results are not going to be the type that the person who goes through all of it can have a quite normal function, climbing huge flight of stairs or run up a hill whenever they desire, how much different is it then using a wheelchair? Certainly there are little steps, and lips and places where a poor ability to walk would still be better than using wheelchair. I just feel that from my perspective, and what I've seen, that the other functioning is what I miss a lot more.

But, if surgeries mean your son can hop in and out of any vehicle, instead of adaptive vehicles or public transit, that sounds like a pretty big advantage. If all that work means that enough function returns to use your average public restroom, that sounds like a pretty big advantage to me as well. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples where some reasonable or moderate improvement could make a lot of things in life a lot easier.

Sorry to get long-winded. I think I may have even changed my mind or my opinion as I wrote this reply. I suppose it came down to the amount of hope and the amount expected to return or to be gained. It sounds like your son would gain a lot more than what my acquaintances went through and, regardless, would still not be inconvenienced by many of the tedious tasks that I and other paraplegics are on a regular basis.

I hope that my response is helped you to gain some insight and really hope that you keep us updated on here about your decision and how things are going. We like to know how the people we wish we could help are doing. :-)",,,3,0,0,

I feel like so many representations in popular culture/fiction, the disability of the character becomes their defining characteristic. Many of the representations seem shallow, that these aren't well rounded, multifaceted characters but props. As limiting as our conditions can be for some people (I know particularly for those with severe pain and/or neurological conditions) we are not the sum of our ability. We're not ""Wheelchair  Character"", we're ""Character who happens to be in a wheelchair"".

Personally, I'd like to see more people with non-visible conditions get representations. This is a problem because I've noticed the perception of disability in the popular consciousness seems tied to a people in a wheelchair or more visible disabilities. This makes life harder for people who don't have those visual cues and look healthy at first glance. This causes a lot of problems for me in being taken seriously by medical professionals, bureaucrats and services providers; I can't tell how many times I know I'm fighting against their perception that I'm making it all up. On bad days, where I can only get around if someone takes me in a wheelchair, I've noticed a completely different reception that if I'm trying to do whatever I need to do on my own. 

  I've been told many times, after meeting people and disclosing my injury and conditions that I ""dont look sick"". I appreciate the sentiment behind it, but the fact that I don't look it has nothing to do with the reality. On this though, I can only speak for my experience in the world between chronic illness, chronic pain and disability.",,,5,0,0,

Good representation of PWDs in popular culture gives real-life PWDs someone to relate to. For many, it may be the only person in their life who reminds them of themselves. When pop culture only gives us 2-D characters who are objects of pity or “inspiration,” it does a massive disservice to every person with a disability whose life is so much more than that. Such pathetic characters are often the only connection a PWD has to others like themselves. PWDs deserve to have their stories told in rich and complex ways that show them as real people with real lives. We’re more than objects of pity or inspiration. Hell, we need more disabled jerks on TV. Some PWDs are jerks because they’re jerks, not because they’re disabled. Just like everybody else.

Accurate representation of PWDs is actually good for able-bodied people too. If disabled characters are represented as *people* and not objects of pity or inspiration, the more comfortable able-bodied people will feel around people with disabilities. The current media does not encourage familiarity with people with disabilities, and people are naturally uncomfortable around people and ideas that they don’t understand. If there’s a script for a disabled person to live a complex and unmiserable life in the world, then more people will be open to accepting people with differences into their lives.

The main thing that comes up isn't whether ideas of limb reanimation or other treatments for particular impairments are considered Bad by disabled folks.  Certainly if a treatment were available for a particular condition, many people in their lives would take advantage of it.

For most folks with disabilities, a treatment or a cure is not a realistic, feasible, or existent option, and thus their goals primarily are to live life in the context of that disability.

With that as background, the concern that arises in literary contexts is that a characters with disabilities only ever get to be portrayed with their disability as the key plot focus, with disability as symbolic for some other stigma or evil, or with the curing of a disability representing some perfection of a person, more or less.  What *rarely* is portrayed is people with disabilities in stories in ways that reflect how most people with disabilities are - namely, just living their lives as people.

Again, this is not to say that a treatment for a particular impairment is inherently ableist - but the choice to write stories with disability as the relevant plot focus rather than to write disabled characters just being people and serving a more general story is too rare.  If the end goal of a disabled character is to be ""cured"", then that can suggest that the person (and by extension any person with a disability more generally) is incomplete in some way.  Again - not that real people wouldn't want to be treated, but given that that's unrealistic in many cases, recognizing that people can also live full and wonderful and fun and awesome and athletic and love-filled lives with disabilities and not presuming that they can't be a full person until they are ""cured"" is important.

(Imagine if every time a character under 5'2"" in a book was portrayed, it was all about the struggles they deal with not being able to reach high shelves, dating tall people, being treated as a competent person, etc.  Not that these aren't real struggles, but, like, you can write a story about a short character without it being about their shortness and the struggles therein.  Short people just live normal lives being short and they deal with stuff and they're probably not going to be the person who changes the light bulbs, but that's a side point in life and in any story.)

So a perspective - cures in general aren't inherently ableist, but sometimes the implications of them about what it means for the lives of real disabled folks and how full and legitimate they can be, combined with the problem of stories about disabled folks being so overwhelmingly about possibilities for cures, can start edging into that territory of presumption that disabled life is inherently lacking.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1505401998,"The only thing that is going to matter for SSDI is what your earned income is, and whether it is over SGA or not. You cannot be actively *working* over SGA and apply for SSDI. However, you can apply if you remain *employed* but aren't working - so situations like FMLA, STD/LTD, sick leave, unpaid leave, etc. Any income from those sources doesn't count. 

As for that interim time, you need to figure out a system of support for 2 years. Even if you feel that you have a 'slam dunk' case, there are lots of things that play into a determination and no guarantee that you'll be approved right away. From initial application through an ALJ decision takes roughly 2 years, depending on what state you're in. (and of course there is no guarantee at the ALJ level, where the approval rate is still only about 60% vs initial level of 35%)

A person can work while they are applying for SSDI, as long as that work remains under the SGA amount. Its important to remember that the SGA amount is looked at based on **gross** income, not net. 

Some will tell you that working while applying for SSDI means your case is going to be a denial. That is not entirely true, a lot of it depends on what your conditions are, and what kind of work it is. If you're saying you can't work because of a bad back, but you still do part-time construction work - that doesn't look good. But for your conditions I'm guessing its more of a problem with sustained effort over 40 hours, not an inability to do the work itself.

 Plus, we know that a lot of people will work *despite* being disabled because they have bills to pay. it really is a case-by-case analysis regarding their work activity. What is most important is that you keep a roof over your head, its terrible advice to tell someone to not work in hopes that it bolsters their disability claim, because there is no outcome guarantee.

I agree that you should try a different county. You should also definitely write your congressman about this. It's repugnant. 

I use Indeed.com to search for jobs. You seem like you've got it together intellectually so you can use Indeed's resume maker to create a comprehensive resume and then use it to apply for many jobs on Indeed with just a click. Depending on your disability you can probably rule out which jobs you just can't do on your own. For instance, I'm in a wheelchair so I can't stock tall shelves, move heavy objects, and stand ever. 

The great thing about VR/DOR is that they will help with costs related to work or school, help you narrow down what kind of career you'd be good at, and will provide direct support. They can also help you find employers who are looking to hire disabled people. CVS, for instance, is currently looking to fill their ""disabled employees"" quota so, while I don't WANT to work at CVS for very long if ever, I've applied. 

What your caseworker will tell you to do is to get a job that you CAN do and then work towards a job that you WANT to do. You can get ahead by getting a job on your own and having some recent work experience on your resume.

It sounds like a lift would be great but is perhaps infeasible for you at the moment. As a lifelong wheelchair user who can't walk at all, I've had to MacGyver a lot of transfer situations. I'm not sure what to call my strategy, but phrases that come to mind are the ""lego strategy,"" ""box strategy,"" ""staircase strategy."" Basically, any household or hardware store items in the shape of ""blocks"" can be pieced together in ways that enable transferring. Say, for instance, your bed is too low relative to your power chair. Would it work to put an intermediary platform in between you and the bed? Transfer to that slightly higher-than-bed platform, and then down to the bed? Ditto with the low down toilet? Transfer to a chair, for instance, and then from that down farther?

You mention being small, and having problems transferring because your feet don't reach to the ground. I have definitely had that problem! And for me at least, it's crucial when transferring to have a platform to push my feet against. I've found single step step stools very helpful when that occurs. Or, ya know, any block shaped item of the right height.

I've never had any success with transfer boards. They've never seemed like a stable option to me, and I can't fathom them working for something like the toilet. There's no way to balance them on the edge of the toilet with stability! To me, they've always come across as a tool pushed by able-bodied therapists who don't REALLY understand the mechanics of transferring. (Haha, I'm sure that's not the case though and people actually use them, I'm just being dramatic.) Stability in transferring is KEY. Never use a prop you think might slide out from under you!

Another thing that can come in handy is setting up something to push or pull against. For example, sometimes in addition to having a platform in front of me to push my feet against, it also helps to have something behind me (generally much higher up then the foot stool) to push against to lift myself. That way I'm not, for example, trying to lift myself up by pushing against the low down thing (like the toilet seat). It gives me a little boost to have something higher. The helper bars in this picture https://images.victorianplumbing.co.uk/images/docm940.jpg come to mind.

So yeah..in summary...you're not going to win any home design classes in aesthetics with such tools, but a huge variety of transfer aids can be cobbled together out of boxes, stools, platforms, chairs...any item that helps add height or bridge the height between two things.",,,2,0,0,

* [Benefits and Work](http://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/), access to their guides is less than £20 for a year and they are super super detailed (if that's something she can't afford I'll email them to you if you want, just send them a donation when she can as they do amazing work). I really believe those guides got me my benefits perfect the first time round. They're especially good with ME stuff and make you turn a quick answer into a super detailed paragraph. 
*  drown them in paperwork. Seriously, you cannot send enough medical evidence. Any relevant letter from a doctor needs to be photocopied for them.
*  if possible, send everything you send to them to be signed for. At least get a proof of postage but signed for really guarantees they get if. They once tried to stop my esa assessment rate by saying they hadn't received my latest sick note. I called up the tracking details and read out the name of the staff member who signed for it, date and time and within 5 minutes the letter had been mysteriously found. 
*  for any face to face meeting or assessment it's ideal to have a friend or family member there, makes it a bit harder for them to make up stuff in their reports as there's a witness. 
*  record her calls with them. There's apps for mobile phones that do this and again they provide good peace of mind. Set it to back up into the cloud and hopefully you'll never need them. I use ACR on android. (I know people who were told one time not to send something, and then had benefits stopped because they didn't send it. The dwp mysteriously lost their call logs for the time the person was originally called).
*  make sure her social media isn't public or at least fairly anonymous. Fightback (if you're in the areas they work in they're great) have seen people's really old Facebook photos taken pre disability used in appeals to prove a claimant is lying). So change Facebook to friends only etc etc. 
*  local councils have been shown to use private investigators to follow blue badge claimants so I suspect the dwp do as well. Just something to look out for as photos can be made to look misrepresentative.

If your sister-in-law isn't able to go on her own, have someone go with her. Citizens Advice have experience of our convoluted benefits system and may have experts available to give advice specific to your sisters-in-laws issues. They'll be able to give you advice about applying for ESA and also for PIP. They were a fantastic help with my claims and transformed my life.

However, expect to have to fight for any money, probably going to a tribunal after many, many months, and then there will be frequent reviews once there's an award of money. BUT, more people win tribunal appeals than fail.

In terms of both ESA and PIP, search online for the criteria they judge people on - a Google search will turn up lots of good sites. In particular, it'll allow you to match health issues to the questions they will ask about. One of the best pieces of advice I read was basically, answer all their questions as if you're having one of your worst days, not your best. So, how much can you lift on your WORST days, how far can you walk on your WORST days, can you make your own meals on your WORST days, can you feed yourself on your WORST days, and so on.

I never give a day estimate for my cases, because there are just too many factors out of my control. The claim could've been caught my quality assurance- this is to make sure analysts are doing their jobs. This can sometimes hold up a claim. Try calling the local field office- social security office- to see if they have any information.

Disability workers are called typically called disability examiners or disability analysts, not  case managers. 

To address this statement-
&gt;My case manager sent me for a disability evaluation at my primary care doctor who understood, knows my history and I got a copy of his statement.

Whenever possible, we are to try to send claimants to their doctors instead of ours. However, most doctors do not accept their small fee SSA will pay for exams, or they are not qualified to SSA standards. It sounds like DDS was able to use your physician instead of ours. I don't think someone doing the exam who is familiar with your case and disabilities could be bad. 

Did you return all forms you were sent? Function reports, work history forms, etc? Make sure these are turned in!

Keep in mind, disability analysts often have caseloads anywhere from 60 cases to 120. We have a lot of claimants. We try to get to cases quickly, but occasionally, it takes us a few days or a little while to get to a claim. Calling and checking on your status is never a bad thing; it reminds us that you're still waiting. I would, however, caution you not to call more than once every week or every other week. 

Examiners try to be sympathetic. We know that no one grows up saying, ""I'm going to be on disability when I grow up"". No one wants to be disabled. Your examiner might well have understood you and been on your side. However, your examiner is still bound by the rules and policies of social security. We don't have a lot of wiggle room in our decisions; we have to work within SSA's parameters.  

TL;DR- I'm not sure what's holding up your case, but in the state I work, 30 days is the faster end of the decision spectrum. If a consultative exam was scheduled, claimant's can be looking at 50, 60, 70+ days. If quality assurance is reviewing the claim, it could be ??? days. Call your analyst and ask where in the process your claim is. Keep calling for updates. 

Hope this helped!",,,2,0,0,
eb9839b9-eca4-466a-96d8-1115f140140b,1506223574,"/u/f7edd4c9-661c-4c95-8517-92e29138ab33 My case manager told me the same thing, about Social Security seeking what they can to deny my claim. He said it was because we are in the Seattle region which is known to be the strictest region when it comes to applying for SSI.     

I was told that if I own anything that would count against me as income. If anyone was helping me out that would count as income. Even though I am not ""earning"" money from a job, if I ate food that someone else provided, lived at another persons house, am using their cell phone, someone was paying my car insurance, all of that would count as income.     

As for the lawyer, he told me its best to wait until(if) I get denied before seeking a lawyer. It is not in a lawyers best interest to have your claim approved the first time. SSI lawyers only get paid if you win on an appeal, so they do what they can to make sure to send in enough stuff to get you denied the first time.    

He gave me some paperwork that needs to be filled out by a doctor. He said that I can have as many letters of references from counselors, jobs, therapists, physician assistants, vocational rehab etc but those won't count in the initial decision. Only someone with a Ph.D. has enough oomph to draft a letter that counts towards swaying an initial decision.   

So if your doctor is a physicians assistant then their supervising doctor has to be the one to write the letter on hospital letterhead. If its for mental health issues then it has to be a psychiatrist placing the recommendation.   They have to state plainly that you're disability limits you in (such and such ways) and they expect this to be going on for **at least 1 year**

He said it was harder to get a mental disability approval than a physical one.   

Before you apply you want to get all your ducks in a row. You want to talk to your doctor(s) and make sure they are on board with you applying for disability. They are going to have to take at least half an hour to write their letter and fill out paperwork for you so you have to make sure with them that they agree you need to apply.   

You need to go to past clinics and collect any paperwork that would show proof of your disability. If you were voluntarily hospitalized, if you ever tried to commit suicide, paperwork of when you were diagnosed. Also talk to previous employers and see if you can get letters from them on why you were fired (if you were).   

While the person from Social Security is reviewing your claim, keep in touch with them. If you go to the doctor again in regards to the claim send them a copy of that paperwork. Signing up for a job program and if the government official says they think you should be on disability that is another huge referral in your favor. But they have to be the one to say it and you have to get that in writing in official letterhead.   

all of this is to try to get approved the first time around. ",,,2,0,0,

They deny you over &amp; over &amp; you have to fill out a ton of forms each time--most of which can be completed online.  I'm on my 3rd denial (the one where you request to see a judge) and I first applied in March of this year.  

Having a lawyer to represent you gives you a FAR better chance of being approved.  Most lawyers require you to have a doctor in the state you're currently in before they'll take your case.  The more medical records you can access, the better.  SSA will send you to their own doctors/psychologists for evaluation.  Make sure to let your SSI doctors know your entire history: which meds you've tried, suicide attempts, hospitalizations, etc.  Even with an extensive history, you'll be denied over and over.  But don't take it personally--just keep appealing until you reach the end of the process.  Don't submit a new claim or you'll be at Step 1 again.  Appealing is key.

That's really all I know so far.  I have lived in another state for the last 10 years and just moved here, so no lawyers would take my case.  I *finally* found one who would yesterday.

I am in Massachusetts and applied at the beginning of August. I’m unable to work due to the following: major depression, severe anxiety and panic disorder, bipolar mixed, history of alcoholism (I used it as a coping mechanism), hypertension, social anxiety, agoraphobia and insomnia. I’ve spoken with my state’s disability determination services case manager (sorry if that’s not the correct title) multiple times. I’ve called him to update him on medication changes, etc my doctors have made. I’ve requested all medical records dating back to at least 2010. I am almost certain they have been received. My case manager sent me for a disability evaluation at my primary care doctor who understood, knows my history and I got a copy of his statement. My psychiatrist knows all of my history and I’ve been with him and another doctor who left at the same practice since I was first inpatient in 2009. I’ve provided tax history which shows that when I was working, (stopped January 2016) I had been on countless short term disability claims. I felt like my case manager at DDS was really understanding and compassionate and I told him this was a bitter pill for me to swallow in even applying for SSDI &amp; SSI. I told him honestly and upfront that I am not looking for a lifetime of disability benefits. I’m unable to work and I need to get myself straightened out and I estimate that could be two years or longer, hopefully not forever. That’s the truth. I’d love to be able to be working and a reliable, dependable, functioning worker. It’s now been almost two months and from what I’ve seen and read online, that’s fairly long for an initial claim in Massachusetts. Typically one would hear a response in about 30 days. I’m literally crippled most days and don’t go anywhere or do anything. I lash out, I can’t focus, I can’t calm down, I can’t sleep. I know I’m trying to read tea leaves here but I felt like my case manager was on my side when we spoke and understood me and wanted to help as best as they could. As is the same as my doctors. I gave them access to all doctors and hospitals I’ve been to since 2009. I found it a little odd they sent me to my primary care doctor for a disability examination because from my understanding, that’s usually done by an independent physician.

c29f2422-a9ca-48db-b496-6cd30e55176a,1506255300,"The number of times I see wrong information repeated on this subreddit saddens me. Disability and social security DOES NOT seek to deny you the first time around, point blank. We don't have a rule that claimants need to be denied on their first applications. I allow many claimants on their first applications. There are simply rules  and policies we have to work within. Many people apply when they are young, and Social Security rules do not favor younger claimants. They are then allowed after applying multiple times, because they're older, leading to the belief that SSA denies everyone the first time. THIS IS FALSE.

An attorney representative IS NOT necessary on an initial application. They can often hinder the process by not allowing the examiner to contact you directly. Attorney reps can delay returning forms or updating the analyst. I have had to deny claimants because attorney reps have not submitted required paperwork. You need a attorney representative at the ALJ level, not before. 

I do agree that appealing a decision is better than submitting a new application When you appeal an initial decision, your claim is reviewed by another analyst and different doctors. After the appeal on the initial claim, you can move to the hearing office and ALJ level. ALJs often overturn prior denials, which is why many claimants want to get to that level. 

Consultative examinations are with doctors of ""SS's choice"" because most doctors will not accept social security's fee. Social security pays much less than doctors are used to getting paid for a evaluations, so doctors who perform psychological or medical evaluations have to be willing to accept this fee. They also have to be willing and able to perform the exam according to social security's requirements and standards. The doctors who perform the exams are REAL, PRACTICING doctors. They are not out to allow or deny you. These doctors are performing an exam with no interest in allowing or denying. They are just providing social security with information.

I'm the US we also have a situation where insurance providers will flat out refuse to replace the foam seats/backs, foot rests, etc. and it can quickly become cheaper for someone on disability to request an entirely new powerchair, simply because all of the ""soft"" parts on their current chair need to be replaced.

The five-year option should be there, but I agree with you that having that be the normal replacement point is a bit extreme. I hear in the Netherlands it's more like 7 to 10 years, but I believe they tend to get higher quality chairs than the ""average"" chair here.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1505837825,"I hate myself for even considering using the word ""privilege"", but lets seriously back the hell up for a moment. 

What you've explained is that you own a $60k wheelchair and a $40-60k van, and then that you think it's all fine because legs are valuable. I should also mention that you bought this *for* a disabled person -- can you explain to me how your son will be able to afford to replace those things on his own at 25?

That van is worth almost 4 years of my disability benefits. I needed a chair before I was on disability, and had to beg and scrimp to come up with $500 to buy it used. These days, I have insurance again and they bought me a powerchair --- which sits in my house, almost unused, because there is no way on earth that I can afford a wheelchair van.

So let's take it from a perspective other than, ""Well, we have enough money, so..."" and consider that, while legs are irreplaceable and extremely valuable, mobility is also required to be functional to any significant extent.  Most disabled people make about $14,000 a year -- for everything: food, rent, clothing, medical supplies, entertainment, utilities, Internet, etc. -- which, the astute reader might notice, is nowhere enough to provide a wheelchair van, much less the required power wheelchair if your insurance isn't up for it. Or, if your insurance such has a high co-pay that you can't afford the wheelchair.

Let's also look at the fact that power wheelchair technology – at its core — has not improved any faster than TI-8X calculators have. It's functionally the same design that we've had for 40 years. They aren't putting money into research and development, they aren't releasing new designs (to the public at large anyway, but if you have $100,000 you can get a stander these days). They also sell used on eBay for maybe $3000. So explain to me why it's not problematic that my insurance spends $45,000 on the same wheelchair, which they have charged myself and other people for in premiums, which functionally sets the cash price near the same and sets it lightyears away from the disabled person with no/bad insurance.

Since it's outside the scope of this post, let's not even get into how a $20,000 Honda Odyssey suddenly becomes worth $60,000 when it's being sold to someone who doesn't have a choice, because I could go on about that for days.

tl;dr: It's great that you can buy these things for your kid, but it might be worth it to spend some time considering how he will be able to replace all of that equipment when you can't buy it for him any more. This is a serious problem for disabled people, and shrugging off the expense because you have enough money, good insurance, and think ""legs are valuable"" sort of contributes to the reason that disabled adults/people without families/without wealthy families can't afford these things.",,,1,1,0,

510090f0-437a-46a7-af1c-f306fc3ee2c6,1505931693,"&gt; When SSA requests med information, what do they usually get sent? A synopsis, highlights of the medical record, or like every piece of my file? (I have my med record from one of my main drs, and the thing is 3 inches thick!). 

Social Security typically obtains your entire medical record (i.e., all treatment notes, consultation, testing records, and any other medical or psychological work-ups you've identified).

&gt;Then what- let's say my examiner gets all of what they request. Do they go through like every page with highlighters or sticky notes, skim it, look for key words, look at certain types of data (visit summaries? MRI's? etc)? (If so, I feel bad for whoever has to read my enormous file). 

Most of the medical records are entered into a computer system for review, where pages can be book marked or highlighted or otherwise marked up.

At least at the hearing/ALJ level, you will have at least two sets of eyes looking over your file. The ALJ will do the first review, where they generally scan for highlights because they are under major time constraints. The ALJ will then hold a hearing and make an initial decision on your case. The ALJ will draft some instructions setting out his/her decision.

At that point, your case gets assigned to an attorney to write the official decision you will eventually receive. That attorney has more time with the file and typically conducts a more complete review than the ALJ had the opportunity to conduct. If anything shows up during that review, the attorney addresses it with the judge and they hash out how to proceed from there.

In terms of what is reviewed, it is basically everything.

&gt;I don't think I meet SSA's listing for MS, because it's heavily weighted for physical issues- so then they get to look at my mental malfunctions. Would they weight my psychologist/neuropsych more than my neurologist/PCP/whatever?  What do they even look for in those kind of files? 

If you have cognitive or mood limitations related to your MS, findings and reports from mental health practitioners are usually, but not always, more persuasive than those from other sources.

In terms of what is reviewed, it is usually any subjective reports (i.e., what did you tell the practitioner) about your symptoms and/or history of treatment, clinical observations, test results, and any opinions about your level of functioning and/or limitations.

&gt;So they look at all my files (somehow) and draw some sort of conclusion eventually. The examiner's conclusion is then reviewed by a doctor or something, is that correct? Assuming there's enough info in there and they don't need an independent consult or whatever. 

As far as I am aware, most states typically have a review by a doctor for physical conditions and a mental health practitioner for psychological conditions.

&gt;Last question: Last October I asked for ADA accomodations and my dumb job lied to me and then fired me, and I haven't been able to work since. Would that likely be determined to be my actual start date for disability?

When you say you started a month ago, is that when you applied? Once you apply it doesn't just get sent straight to the DDS. The field office has work to do on their end (earnings usually) and once it gets sent to the DDS it goes into a staging queue waiting to be assigned. It depends on the state how long this is - a few days to a few weeks depending on how backed up they are. Examiners can only get a certain number of cases per week. 

&gt; When SSA requests med information, what do they usually get sent? 

Depends on your doctor. We send a request to your sources asking for ""all records"" for a certain period of time (12 months prior to your alleged onset date). Its up to your provider to give us what we need - some will send absolutely everything, others will just send appointment notes, some will send nothing. 

My advice to you is follow up with your providers to make sure they respond to SSA's request. We give providers 30 days to respond before we make a decision without it. We can't legally compel them to comply.

&gt; let's say my examiner gets all of what they request. Do they go through like every page with highlighters or sticky notes, skim it, look for key words, look at certain types of data

Everything is electronic...but yes that is what we do. Our software has the ability to make sticky notes, book marks, highlight, underline, a red marker, etc.

We look at every piece of paper that comes in. Now, we are very good at knowing what is important and what isn't, and knowing how to go through records very quickly. Each examiner does things a bit different, depending on their strengths. When I go through medical records I can scan a page in about 3 seconds to know if it is something I need or not. I'm looking to see if its actual records (appointment notes, imaging studies, labs, etc) or just filler pages. From there I take another 10-15 seconds to see if its relevant to your allegations. If you have a doctors visit for a head cold, I know I don't need it. Once I see that its relevant - that is when I will take more time with it, jot down notes/highlight, and bookmark it so I can find it later. 

&gt; I don't think I meet SSA's listing for MS, because it's heavily weighted for physical issues

That isn't true. The MS listing (11.09) has an A criteria and a B criteria. The A is for physical, but the B is for mental. 

&gt;  The examiner's conclusion is then reviewed by a doctor or something, is that correct? Assuming there's enough info in there and they don't need an independent consult or whatever. 

Yes that is the general course of action. Technically speaking - the examiner can give a recommendation to the doctor, but the doctor has the final decision on your medical capabilities. Note that medical capabilities play into the final decision, but there are still vocational considerations. So the examiner is the final decisional authority.

Depending on if you're applying for SSI or SSDI, your records will be requested from every source you list for one year prior to filing date or one to three years prior to alleged onset date. 

&gt;Then what- let's say my examiner gets all of what they request. Do they go through like every page with highlighters or sticky notes, skim it, look for key words, look at certain types of data (visit summaries? MRI's? etc)?

This is exactly what happens, and as RambleRamble said, disability examiners are experts at knowing what to look for, especially related to speecific conditions. For MS, I would look for imaging (MRIs/CTs of brain and spine) and abnormal physical exams, plus medications. For anxiety/depression, I would look for psychiatric visits and mental status exams. We learn to skim and can read large files in minutes. 

&gt;I don't think I meet SSA's listing for MS, because it's heavily weighted for physical issues- so then they get to look at my mental malfunctions

Please see the listing RambleRamble referenced [here](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm#11_09). If you don't exactly meet part A or part B, but have significant aspects of both parts, examiners can do what's called ""equaling a listing"" meaning your condition is severe enough to equal the intent of the listing. If the examiner feels he/she needs more information on your psychological impairments, he/she will order a psychological consult to ensure enough information is obtained. 

&gt;Last question: Last October I asked for ADA accomodations and my dumb job lied to me and then fired me, and I haven't been able to work since. Would that likely be determined to be my actual start date for disability?

&gt;Sanchez's father, who was driving the hit-and-run vehicle, confirmed after the shooting that his son was deaf, Mathews said. He said Sanchez wasn't in the vehicle when his father struck something and drove off. It wasn't a person that he struck.

&gt;A man who saw Oklahoma City police officers open fire on Sanchez says his neighbor was developmentally disabled and also didn't speak.

&gt;Neighbor Julio Rayos told The Oklahoman on Wednesday that in addition to being deaf, Sanchez was developmentally disabled and didn't speak, communicating mainly through hand movements (&lt;-- wtf?). Rayos said he believes Sanchez became frustrated trying to tell the officers what was going on.

&gt;""The guy does movements,"" Rayos told the newspaper. ""He don't speak, he don't hear, mainly it is hand movements. That's how he communicates. I believe he was frustrated trying to tell them what was going on.""

&gt;Jolie Guebara, who lives two houses from the shooting scene, told The Associated Press that she heard five or six gunshots before she looked outside and saw the police.

Escalation of Force is taught, believe me.

The issue is bigger than SFAQL. One, Fear. These officers are showed video after video and told anecdotal stories during training of citizens killing cops and how everything can turn deadly in an instance. So, cops are in constant fear that every encounter even a traffic ticket could mean death. Therefore they are always on edge and high strung.

People are on edge too. So every encounter is already high emotion. Cops continue to escalate situations by being smug, condescending, rude, and not giving the citizen any respect. The citizens counter with the same attitude. Then the cops abuse their authority to retaliate. Causing the citizen to harbor even more ill feelings and resentment to the point of hate, as well as those who are witnessing the event. 

Another issue is, once a LEO commits what it obviously murder or manslaughter, they are never prosecuted, and only rarely. Even if they are sent to trial, somehow they are hardly ever convicted. The cop who shot a man in the back in South Caroline went to trial and was found not guilty by citizens. It's mind blowing.

There are certain personality traits that people who are cops posses, many with traits of narcissism. This is a job that gives you power over others, the perfect job for a narcissist.  

So officers get the mentality.. well... if i fuck up, worse case I resign.

I'd suggest that the rejection of s concept of normality has more to do with the inherently manipulable and flawed nature of the concept than any inability to grasp bigotry.

Example: you're suggesting that disability is abnormal.  Well...how are you defining what is normal?  On an individual level, my normal includes issues like sensory problems, so having autism is normal for me.  On a base level referencing how most people function?  Yeah, it's abnormal to have autism in that most people are allistic.  On a larger, species-wide or statistical level?  It's back to being normal since some amount of the population is going to be autistic and there's no logical reason why I should be immune from it. It would be abnormal if there were suddenly no autistic people.

Similarly,  this can be extended into plenty of other arenas.  Is it normal to drink wine and eat a cracker that you believe is human flesh and blood?  Well, not for me no, that sounds incredibly weird and abnormal.  For a devout Catholic that's just another Sunday.

There's also a lack of education that causes developing countries to have higher birth rates.

The Social Model of Disability argues that we are (usually) more disabled by society than our bodies, that society only caters to bodies that look or operate a certain way. The Social Model of Disability puts the burden of accessibility on social structure rather than individual people.

You can get technical about what it means to be ""normal"" or ""abnormal,"" but those words have routinely been used to oppress and ""otherize"" disabled people. Continuing to distinguish disabled people as ""abnormal"" is pretty much the opposite of disabled activists' goals. We're a minority, sure, but we don't have to elevate non-disabled people by calling them ""normal."" That's where the oppression started. The relatively small number of disabled people in the world doesn't mean we still can't ask people to change their perspective. There are still over 50 million disabled people in the United States alone, and most people develop a disability at some point in old age.

Promoting disability activism and disability culture has actually significantly improved the lives of the disabled community. Since the United States' disability rights movements in the 1970's, we've seen numerous anti-discrimination bills be made into legislation to dismantle the oppression of disabled people.

Teaching about disability culture actually does the opposite of what you suggest. It promotes equality and seeks to correct people's feelings of condescension or pity.",,,1,0,0,

It's never easy dealing with ableists, and you have to decide whether or not they deserve a response.

So yeah, in my understanding you HAVE to have the work to get SSDI. They care about two things

1) How long you've worked

2) How disabled you are since you STOPPED working

The second is really how they judge you. HOW disabled are you since you stopped working, completely, partially, etc. Anything BEFORE you stopped doesn't matter. Because I have 20 years of medical records before I stopped, but I had to stop working only 5 years ago only stuff SINCE then matters. 

They'll take into account how you managed to work though. *At best* I could make a full day, the overwhelming majority of days was between 0 (not showing up at all) and 4 hours (which was pretty much my standard for a decade). So if you've ALWAYS been struggling, they'll figure that in as well.

Annoyances: 

Deciding whether someone has a disability based on looks.  A person might look healthy but isn't.  You can't always see the issues.

Doubly so for fat people.  While extreme obesity can be a disability, it's not a given that obesity is someone's disability.  I hear ""You're not really disabled. You're just fat!"" from casual strangers who apparently have magical medical degrees.

Casually forgetting the basic things.  I often hear that a restaurant or business is handicapped accessible only to find a single step going in or out of the place. Or you can get inside but the only bathroom involves stairs.  Or the tables are packed too tightly for a chair to get through.  Or they have an ""accessible entrance"" but first they have to remove all the stuff they've stored in front of it.

It varies from disability to disability, but you'll find that most Deaf/HoH people and autistic people (adults and teens at least) prefer ID-first language, because it implies that their disability colors the way they perceive the world and that it cannot be separated from who they are as a person. I personally feel this way, as I was born with most of my disabilities and I would he a totally different person and experience the world totally differently if I never had them. 

As far as annoyances go, most of what I want to say has been covered, but there are a few more: 

*feeling like you have to ""prove"" your disability in order to get accommodations or to even be believed

*as a young woman, having most of my symptoms being ignored and written off as PMS when I go to New doctors 

*on that note, doctors not believing you to begin with, and then everyone shitting on people who research their less-than-common conditions and basically have to diagnose themselves (because doctor's don't believe rare conditions exist at all sometimes, or refuse to consider them)

*being a young person and old folks giving you dirty looks and making snide comments (because apparently you can only be disabled if you're old /s)

*PTSD and related trauma conditions being associated solely with soldiers and first responders, making everyone else who has experienced trauma feel like a faker and less likely to seek treatment 

*I've seen a few reddit threads lately which have brought up disability, and I am always disgusted at the amount of asinine comments about how we already get special treatment and we should all be killed and eugenics this, ableism that. 

*also, I'm a special education major as well as someone with either autism or complex PTSD (almost exact same symptoms, just different causes and we haven't pinpointed it yet), and I can't stand how many of my professors and peers are self-righteous assholes that won't listen to anything actual disabled people want to say; they just stick their heads in the sand and pretend they're doing the right thing, despite the mountains of evidence to the contrary. Like ABA therapy--so many people I work with and study with are huge proponents, and most of the schools use it. But literally almost the entire autism community is vehemently against the practice, as it has been proven to be traumatizing and unethical. I've brought this up before, along with the fact that Autism Speaks is a horrible company that the community hates, and all I get are glassy-eyed stares and defensive comments. 

*also also, fucking inspiration porn, which I see way too much of as a SPED major. Basically, if you don't know, that's when a disabled person's story is told in a super demeaning, pandering light, usually focusing on their family and how it effects them rather than the actual disabled person, and generally is used to make everything the person does seem brave and triumphant, but all it really does is make the rest of us look lazy and like we aren't trying, as well as giving the abled population a hugely skewed view of disability. 

I think that's all I've got for now, since my hands are cramping from typing and I really have to go to bed. Hope this is helpful, thanks for taking the time to do your research and ask the community for their opinions. Believe me, that's leaps and bounds more than most. ",,,16,0,0,

Pokemon Go! Had just been released in my country and my boyfriend and it had taken my transfer wheelchair to the town centre to see what the fuss was about. It was super convenient to play with our two phones on my lap, me watching the screens and my boyfriend navigating the real world for both of us. But not much exercise for me, and only do like the independence of my forearm crutches when my shoulders are stable enough. 

So I was telling my friend about how much fun the game was and how I'll be sad when my boyfriend goes back to uni and I won't be able to play by myself. My friend suggests we plan Pokemon walks together.

We went for about 8 Pokemon walks in total, and every single time I'd get off my tram and meet him at the park and I'd ask him to carry my phone as well as his phone and he'd laugh and say ""I'm not helping you catch Pokemon, it's a competition!"" I'd have to remind him the app doesn't work when your phone is in your pocket, and I can't hold my phone while walking with forearm crutches. So he'd have to hold my phone so my app would stay on, or at least tell me when we were standing on a hot spot so I could stop and get my phone out and turn the app back on. 

I felt bad because he was always so embarrassed that he'd forgotten that this was genuinely an accessibility issue for me, I felt bad that after a few weeks I still hadn't found a way to explain it without making him feel like he'd been ableist.

I still don't have a working system for shopping. Ride on carts aren't a thing in my country so it's basically bring a friend to be my designated basket holder, or stumble around with stuff in shopping bags hanging off the hand grip of my crutches bouncing around throwing me off balance, or use my backpack and constantly explaining to security guards ""yes I know I have to pay for it, but how do you suggest I carry it to the checkout without putting it in my backpack?""

Trying to get things out of my pockets in a hurry, trying to get my backpack off to load the groceries into it, it all takes so much extra time when you're hands aren't free, and in winter when I  have longer sleeves on the they always get caught on the forearm band and if I'm rushing out to end up tearing my sleeve or failing to grab my crutch and tripping. It's very embarrassing. 

Though I've started using a thigh bag and a fanny pack (fanny in the British sense in this case, because I wear it on my front) to make accessing stuff easier. 

Getting off a train is like a well timed dance. I can't stand up before the train stops because I'll fall. I can't put my backpack on before I'm ready to stand because I'm sitting in a seat with a backrest. So as soon as the train stops I have to go throw my bag on, get my crutches in position too help lift myself up, stand fully and get my hands in the right position for walking , then get to the train door fast enough before the doors shut again and the train takes off, or before people boarding the train start to rush on and push me back into the carriage because I wasn't eagerly waiting and stand at the door highlighting my disembarking status. 

Also, this is Social problem when shopping, not a physical/practical problem, but I've had people try to help by grabbing my bag or even grabbing my crutches as if they can hold them to free up my hands (um no, I'm using them to support my weight) it's rude, and often causes more problems because they end up yanking my already sore shoulders and I can dislocate and then I can't use my crutches at all for an hour so I just have to sit on the floor and wait, missing my bus or appointment or just being late home to my plans.

1) Insensitivity. I'm not always at the doctor's because of my primary condition (which is a severe but relatively infrequent neuromuscular disease). Sometimes I'm there for other reasons that are unrelated. I don't enjoy being asked questions about my prognosis or about my death. If it's relevant to the reason I'm there then explain that before you ask but damn do I hate being questioned about painful topics because some doctor is just a bit curious.

2) Second-guessing me. So yesterday I had a minor surgery and it's a perfect example. I had spoken to the surgeon and we had agreed that because its difficult for me to get out of my chair (I need specialized equipment), he would perform the surgery with me in my chair since it was just a local anaesthetic. I got to the ward and explained this to the nurse because she wanted me to get in a hospital bed and put on a gown. She immediately shut me down and said there was no way that had been agreed and then proceeded to loudly talk about it with the other nurses, in front of a bunch of other people. She also wanted me to pee in a pot for her to prove I'm not pregnant, something which I can only do at home where I have my equipment to allow me to get up. I said I was certain I was not pregnant and she didn't like that either. She phoned the doctor and he said that he and I had already spoken about all this and she could leave me alone. But the whole thing stressed me out, my blood pressure and heart rate went through the roof and I started questioning whether the doctor and I had agreed anything. If in doubt, she could have discreetly spoken to the doctor and confirmed without treating me like a lying troublemaker. Or he could have perhaps given her that info beforehand. It just sometimes feels like I have to explain things repeatedly, to often quite hostile people, and removing that would make the healthcare experience so much less exhausting and stressful.",,,7,0,0,

a6720ff5-a37a-45fb-a8ce-d031fa09b1c7,1506318819,"First off, thank you so much for asking and trying to understand.
For your first question: 1. When people stare at me unabashedly or won't even look at me at all. I'm a rational person and I realize most people are not used to people with disabilities, so some people may not know how to respond to me or others. However you think it would be common sense that 
staring with an unblinking gaze at my body until they ""figure out what's wrong with me"" would be kinda rude but I don't think it even crosses some people's minds. Usually I just laugh it off however it is pretty weird sometimes.

2. Strangers walking up to me and asking invasive questions/saying rude things. Some of my favorites are: (loudly in public) ""So whats wrong with you?"" ""So like, how do you shower/use the bathroom/have sex?"" I've even had at least 2 people (upon one of the countless times I've had to tell my medical history to a stranger) ""wow, you are SO BRAVE/INSPIRATIONAL/STRONG, if I were you I would have totally killed myself, I wouldn't have been able to live through what you have!"" etc, etc.

3. As another has said here, people tend to assume if you have a physical disability you also have a mental disability and will treat you as if you have a mental disability, which is not only condescending to me but I'm sure would also be very condescending to a person with a mental disability. Please don't talk down to me as if I'm an infant who can't comprehend you.

4. People tend to assume you can't do anything for yourself. Everyone has different abilities. Most people will ask for help when they want/need it. Even though I thoroughly love the fact that so many people in this world want to help others, if I followed you around the store constantly asking you if you needed help with things you can obviously do for yourself because I'm watching you do those things, you'd get frustrated too. (I try to to always give a polite no thanks, I've got it. Sometimes people don't take the hint.) 

5. Public places not being accessible. There really is no reason that newly built restaurant with a nice large expensive tile covered bathroom should not be completely accessible. Absolutely no excuse. There really isn't an excuse For any place to not be accessible, but it's even worse when it's some large company who can absolutely afford it ignoring the laws and their disabled customers. I have to pee when I'm out and about too, assholes. 

That would be my top five. Sorry for the ranting but I never really get to vent that often enough.


For your second question: I think it's honestly 
just subjective. I personally am not picky about the language a person uses, because I tend to use different types myself. I usually just say person who is disabled or person who has a disability. I'll often refer to myself or other wheelchair users as _ who also is in a wheelchair, etc. Honestly, (for me, again it is subjective) as long as you don't call me ""a cripple"" we're probably good.

f589729b-a56d-4072-aaef-829b216fc600,1506310397,"Yesterday was 20 years since my injury, so I figured I should chime in. There are so many good comments here so excuse me if I'm repeating others.

Personally, I prefer the person-first language. I would much rather be called a man with a disability, or a man who uses a wheelchair, than a disabled man. Jay would be fine, also. :-)

The only times that I have ever been wheelchair-bound was for a short time in rehab what I needed seatbelt and the occasional time I have depended upon an accessible transportation bus to get to my post secondary education institution for a few years. Other than that, I've never been confined, tied, bound or secured to my wheelchair.

For me, handicapped isn't a word I love to hear. It's not as bad as crippled, but, call it semantics, ""my crippling was 20 years ago yesterday"" doesn't bother me because crippling is an accurate verb. I'd still rather say that my injury was 20 years ago. This is just me being picky, and it applies to almost anybody, it may have been a motor vehicle accident that was the source of my injury, but I would prefer to have called it a collision. An accident often indicates it was preventable. I suppose I could've stayed home and studied that night instead of relieving some stress with friends by hanging out, sipping on a soft drink and breathing the crisp September air.

I seem to say this with all of my posts, as much as many of us who cannot walk would love to again, so much of the disability revolves around keeping our systems functioning. Namely, the time spent toileting. I had to respond to a news story the other day where the family was very hopeful that there son in a coma would walk again. I responded that I hope he did as well, but more importantly I hope that he is able to urinate, defecate and ejaculate without intervention when he wakes up.

The last one will leave you with is how much I dislike when people tell me either how brave I am, or how far I have come (often my dad is the worst for this but I'd rather not get into that debate with him so I just let it go). Thank goodness for the occasional anonymity online where I can let my work speak for myself rather than talking to someone or having them form their immediate and inevitable biases before I even greet them. However, you all know it's going to come, the question about what I do. I don't think we are going to change the way our society values people's work, careers or jobs so I usually deflect the question with a brief answer such as ""I am independently wealthy. Tell me, what is it you are passionate about?"" I try to be well rehearsed because those questions arise all the time, and in that rehearsal I do my best to provide the briefest of pauses so they don't have a chance to even process my semi-sarcastic response. When I'm not feeling sarcastic, I will often give them something truthful and complex such as, ""I am a creative and environmental portrait photographer, sometimes dabbling in food photography. What is it you are passionate about?""

Speaking of that, I've got photos to edit from last night since I chose to do something productive rather than overindulge in food or drink. I've got to say, OP, I really appreciate that you care about the language you use and the way you interact with people with a disability. Have a great week!",,,9,0,0,
7c974207-802b-4dd7-be3b-58b6149370a2,1506328584,"Ive got multiple invisible disabilities but to look at Its near impossible to tell. I can be active for maybe one or two hours a day before I get really tired and need to go home. Both these things confuse the living hell out of most people as It's very hard for them to comprehend that I appear normal and can be upbeat and reasonably active when I have the energy for a hour or two, But the result of that increased activity will exhaust me and leave me pretty much bed bound for a day after, where i will struggle with simple things such as feeding myself. 

If I really over do it I can miss entire weeks due to exhaustion and pain. This is really confusing for people because they see me active for short amounts of time then I wont be around for ages because I am ill. This leads to people assuming that I am lazy and not ill as they cannot see me visibly being in pain which is incredibly frustrating as my illnesses affects every aspect of my life and limits me massively, but I actively do my best to not appear ill around others and be up-beat, but this ends up almost working against me as it means other's don't see past the social facade and therefore find it very difficult to believe me when I tell them I am ill and in pain.

Being a young man seems to work against me as well as people are less likely to trust me which has led to me being discriminated against, for example by a train guard who through me off a train when I asked him to help find me  a seat, I told him I was disabled and he told me I wasnt and called me a chancer and through me off of the train. I was left crying on the platform. Or by my university when my tutor says things like ""Other people are ill and manage okay"" or ""your not putting enough effort in to your work"" - These kind of statements really offend me and frankly make me depressed as I constantly feel like Im exhausting myself and putting my health at risk just to get things done, and to have that viewed as me being lazy or not motivated enough is maddening and makes me question and second guess myself!

It's then up to the individual to decide what they want to do with that information.

""lead causes learning disabilities"" isn't any more insulting than ""smoking causes cancer"" it's just letting us know what can happen if we engage with a certain substance.

What *would* be insulting is if it said ""lead causes all learning disabilities, so if you have a learning disability it's your own fault"" because a) it's untrue, not all learning disabilities are due to lead and b) not everyone can control their exposure to the lead.


I think the issue is two fold.

Some disabilities are unavoidable and naturally occurring, and for people with these disabilities, a strong community and identity can be formed from the disability itself. ASD and deafness for example. To ""cure"" these disabilities is to strip someone of part of what makes them who they are.

But some disabilities are more avoidable. Such as birth defects caused by medications (like thalidomide) or injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents for which we have road laws and innovative car designs that aim to reduce the number of MVAs.

To the people who unfortunately still have disabilities despite knowing the causes and other people being able to avoid those causes, it's important that these people are free to develop an identity that embraces their condition if thats what they want, and it's important our laws support them and don't blame them for not being able to avoid disability, and supports them in how they identify with their disability.

But similarly it's important that as a society we support people who choose to use the information we have available to us,about the dangers of lead or riding without a helmet, to try and avoid disability.

People who don't want their identity to involve disability attacks all are just as valid as those who do embrace disability.

Choosing to avoid potential disability is not to say disability is inherently bad. It is simply says that this individual has already established their identity without disability and they want to maintain their current identity.

As a society we have a duty to ensure people have a choice in how they govern their bodies, and making sure own know how substances may be effect their body is part of that.

I notice you touch on the fact that your disabilities are situational, that it's the school system that limits your ability, not the condition itself, and that is a valid point and the reason that it's important that we continue to fight for viability and a voice, so changes can be made to the system to reduce the gap in our abilities.

There are different degrees of disability however and I think that's where the language of ""lead causes learning disabilities"" struggles to explain the big picture.

I'm going to use physical disability as a an example because it's easier to visualise.

My hips dislocate and I suddenly fall down and can't get back up until I relocate them. That is my illness. Because I fall down and can't get back up, it's hard to walk around, that is my disability. I can never walk on a dislocated hip no matter how many accommodations you put in place. If my goal is to walk, then the only solution is to not dislocate my hip in the first place, otherwise I'm disabled. 

However, if I shift my goal from being able to walk, to being able too mobilise, and I get myself a powered wheelchair, well now I no longer have a mobility disability, I have a mobility *difference*, I can can mobilise, but I now do so differently (wheels vs walking). However If there's no ramp, I can't go upstairs, so now it's a disability because of the system, not because of me.

""Learning disability"" and learning ""difference"" actually relate to different things entirely, and it's often up to the individual to decide where the line is drawn.

It's not up to you to decide if a disability is ok to have. You embrace your identity and that's awesome *your* learning difference is ok for *you*, but you can't force that on someone else. They have to be free to decide what their goals are, if they have a disability or a difference, and if they want to accommodate or cure.

So no, I don't find the blanket statement ""lead causes learning disabilities"" insulting because it's up for the individual to decide what that means.

If you are offended by that statement, that's valid. But feeling offended doesn't automatically make the statement offensive. ",,,1,0,0,

That whether they believe something is wrong or not irrelevant, something is wrong.  It is objective fact, the human body and mind evolved to function in specific ways.  Society in general developed to accommodate that normal function.  Overcoming a disability, accepting it, being happy with it, etc., are all fine... That is the disabled person's prerogative.  But you are literally encouraging the intentional allowance of that disability on others for the purely selfish reason that your disability (and that of others like you) doesn't bother you.

It is only recently in human history that society has begun to accommodate disability and it has come at great expense.  And that is not a problem, disabled people have every bit as much right to life as anyone, but it is not permanently sustainable nor should it be desirable.  What should be desirable is the eradication of the ailments that befall us in all their forms.

Just as I mentioned above with those who are deaf having the right to choose whether or not to be cured, if someone with a learning disability/autism/etc., has the mental capacity to deny treatment they are free to do so, no one is going to force a treatment upon them (short of them being violent and/or institutionalized).

97c43ab3-4f02-4947-b96f-aa58bff15209,1506403155,"My problem was not a lack of special treatment, but too much of it. I was in a self contained classroom full time from kindergarten until 10th grade. For many years NYC didn't have part time special education classrooms where you spent part of the day in a in a general ed classroom and part of the day in a special ed classroom. You were either in a special ed classroom full time or not at all. Do you know what it feels like to be segregated from the rest of the school, into a ""special"" classroom for kids who don't perform as well, for 10 years mind you?

Many autistic people do not want to be cured. It's not just because of the community surrounding their identity. It's because autism offers both advantages and disadvantages. So do learning differences. I am not asking for tailored and individual education. In elementary and middle school all the special education classrooms didn't have the same quality instruction like general education classrooms (although general ed classes in those schools sucked too). I remember one instance where I saw my sister's homework. My sister was 2 grades below me and was learning the same stuff I was. Another time in 8th grade I read my IEP and I was held to ""modified promotion criteria"". The IEP said ""Anna is expected to meet 30% of the New York State ELA standards"". Everyone told me I'm smart but at the same time held me to lower standards. A year and a half later I got a 75 on the English regents (65 is passing, 75 is enough to get out of remedial courses in CUNY). This was due to proper instruction, and I was in general ed in 10th grade. There is even a debate on whether [special education students should take the same standardized tests as their non-disabled peers](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/the-common-core-is-tough-on-kids-with-special-needs/283973/).

To clarify: First, any tips/experience with getting an online job such i.e. transcription, customer service


Secondly, any feedback whatsoever on my dreams/aspirations- I feel like I know a lot about myself but at the same time, I know I don't know a lot- I'm just shooting in the dark trying to see if anyone thinks I can make any use out of these seemingly random and useless skills (i.e. I play a game for a long time and foresee a marketing tactic ahead of time, or I play several games and become slightly addicted realizing which factors make it so addicting)


My goal...? I never really had a purpose beyond wanting to have sex or be in a relationship, albeit I knew that desperation kills attraction so I was never desperate, but I did put attractive people on a diamond pedestal. That... and I wanted to keep my friends. All I cared about was flourishing socially, and ironically, it made me realize that I was/am a very shallow person with not much substance.


So it forced me to reflect on a lot of things... all the time... and I came up with what little interests/hobbies that I remember enjoying, although at the time, I never wanted to pursue a hobby as a job. Being forced to improve and expand always scared me, and I'm a pretty risk-averse person, but now I don't have much to lose if I can decide what I want to commit to.


I don't know what my goal is. I would not mind earning large amounts of money and I am not smart or yet dedicated enough to come up with a way on how to make that much money without working to live (and I wouldn't mind that, if I had a clue what I wanted to go into and what is available/in demand). I recall the thoughts I always had going to work... ""is this all there is to life?"" 
I guess I am searching for things to do in my life that I enjoy but I have troubles deciding what they truly are. The goals that I do have are so enormous, it's scary to think about.


I had the feeling that was the case. Starving artist and all that. I'm worried about being unable to improve... and my mind can't help but imagine the work required to hone several skills into developing a craft. My motivation to pick up a hobby and improve stemmed mainly from wanting to show other people. It was a lot easier to self-teach myself with motivation. It'd be more fun and motivational to learn and improve with someone else... but then that's being dependent.


I like the idea of making or designing things but am daunted by the experience and self-discipline required to feel proud of what I've achieved. If there is an easier way to get started, or actually, if there are any ways to improve energy naturally, that would be super helpful.


I end up procrastinating because my eyes feel heavy &amp; my body fatigued even with a proper amount of sleep. This has long been an issue since before I was even born (2 weeks late, still sleeping in the belly). Before in highschool, I'd wake up, take a shower, doze off in the shower &amp; then fall asleep half the time on the bathroom floor. I still have troubles staying awake for more than 8 hours, which is quite problematic.


There I go again... well, I apologize and thank you if you read all that. ",,,1,0,0,
4322c709-4e06-42c0-87ab-787176cd27f4,1506733294,"Okay, that makes sense then! It's so important to find things to give your life meaning and purpose when you're disabled. And it's totally valid even if those things happen to be non-paying.

So I'm actually going to break this up into online jobs vs fulfilling-but-maybe-not-paying activities. This is going to be really long, so I apologize in advance! I could honestly go into even more depth on a lot of these things so feel free to ask questions.

First, online jobs. I've been working freelance since the beginning of this year. I (very briefly) worked for gotranscript.com, which pays *terrible* but you learn how to do transcription and get feedback on your work. People charge a few hundred dollars for a class that does the same thing, so I looked at it as free training. From there, I went on to Upwork. After getting a little experience under my belt, I landed a virtual assistant/writing job that I really enjoy.

Most people on r/freelance hate Upwork, and it's understandable why. You are competing against people from countries like India and the Phillippines who can work for cheap. However, there are clients who are hiring on Upwork who pay more reasonably for a competent worker with good English. It does take longer to find them. And even those guys don't pay great, but it's a nice first step into the world of freelance, because you don't have to create your own website and market yourself and all that.

You don't necessarily have to go the freelance route; sites like flexjobs.com and others tend to have customer service jobs. I've applied to a handful of jobs that I found from blogs like [The Penny Hoarder](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/), and reading on those sites can give you an idea of what's out there. 

There are a lot of people applying, on those sites as well as Upwork, so you have to put out a lot of applications, while still doing them thoughtfully and trying to sell yourself. On Upwork, it helps to start out with small jobs to get good ratings. It's like Amazon - not a lot of people want to try you when there are no reviews for you yet. So you want to get a few really great reviews, so more people will be willing to give you a shot. Similarly, when applying to actual jobs, it's your resume that convinces people you're worth talking to.

So. One of your passions can potentially cross that line between passion project into paying job, and that is UI/UX design (user interface/user experience). It sounds similar to what you're describing with the video games. I don't know a ton about this area, but I do know there are more jobs outside of video games. *So* many people want to work in video games. But websites and apps need this kind of work, too. I'd recommend doing your own research on these two fields. My impression is that some jobs require light coding (HTML &amp; CSS) and some just require graphic design skills. You would definitely have to learn some skills for either. You can check out some online courses for these here: 
https://www.justinmind.com/blog/online-ux-ui-courses-to-take-now-10-best-free-and-paid/
They range from free to cheap to very expensive. Some of the free-or-cheap ones might be good to see if you want to explore it.

I think your other two passions are definitely starving artist situations. It's not impossible to make a living off those things but it is rare. However, the point isn't necessarily to make a living, since you mentioned you're on disability. You could even run into trouble if you make too much money, so be sure to check into that before you start working! I'm not on any kind of disability so my knowledge is limited in this area. You may even want to check with a disability lawyer.

So about your passions, I do think that learning and improving with other people is more motivating than doing it all by yourself, and I don't think that makes you dependent. There's a reason that art schools exist, right? There are plenty of ways to find other people to connect with, from local classes to meetup groups to reddit. But you do have to have your own internal motivation; even moreso if you're limited to things you can do from home, in my experience.

It does sound a little bit like you struggle with ""what if I try but then it's crap?"" or ""what if I try and it's too hard?"" To that I would say, what else are you doing with your time? It's better to try than to do nothing. Creating something out of nothing is a great thing, and even if it's not perfect the first time, you can keep working on it to get better.

I would love ways to improve energy naturally, my main issue is fatigue so I struggle with that daily. Some people will make a plan for what they want to do, and commit to spend an hour every day working on whatever it is. Or two hours, or half an hour, whatever works. Things like r/GetMotivatedBuddies can help you find an accountability buddy to hold you to your goals (and you hold them to theirs). 

About the falling asleep, you sound like my narcoleptic ex-girlfriend! So I have an idea of how hard that can be. Do you have narcolepsy? If you've never been diagnosed then definitely look into that.

Still, I never ever work 8 hours. I work 4-5 hours most days, and I set my own schedule for the most part. For me, it's vastly better than not working at all. I'm a much happier person when I have a purpose.",,,2,0,0,

I'm actually very surprised that you took all the time to read and respond so there is definitely no need to apologize when you are helping out of your own volition. I should be apologizing, lol. I'll be asking a lot of questions (confirmation) about where I stand in terms of skill-level/experience and a few other things...


I think I am leaning more towards freelance work. I have worked customer service for a few years and I didn't really enjoy dealing with people most of the time- I also really hate the sound of my voice but learning how to speak clearly over the phone could be a useful skill to develop anyways.


I took one of those typing WPM tests recently and I think I'm above-average typing speed/accuracy? (results here: https://ibb.co/hKaiDw) (Backspaces weren't allowed and every time I made a mistake an obnoxiously loud disrupting sound would occur that ended up interrupting my muscle memory; I made more mistakes cause some robotic voice kept screaming whenever I made a typing error)
I don't know what qualifies as ""good English"" but it is the primary language that I speak. I also have an old resume that I can use, but I'm unsure whether or not I should disclose information regarding my disability since I'll probably have to explain why I haven't been working for 3-4 years.


How do I sell myself while not lying if I don't have a proper sleeping schedule? That and I don't even trust myself at the moment because I haven't committed to anything for such a long time. I haven't been fired before though, so that's a bonus I guess.


Yeah... I was reading an article/blog that someone wrote called, ""Video game publishers don't want your ideas"" and I figured that was the case. I might have a brilliant idea but it won't be worth anything if I don't work my way up, and I'm not sure that's something I want to commit my life to. 


That kinda sucks. But I might just do it anyways... I've always been pretty shy and introverted but when I dance or watch people dance it brings out another side to me. Yeah, I'm really leaning towards dancing/video editing.


I suppose that is true. I am more worried about being bored/tired and unmotivated. Without motivation, there is only discipline (which I have very little of...). In the past though, I've never shown up late for a job either once I do commit.


I'll check it out, but I don't think the internet buddy thing is up my alley. Might change my mind upon reading some of the posts though.


Funny thing. I ended up waiting about a year to get into a sleep clinic but they only did a verbal diagnosis and didn't end up doing a physical test.


That's pretty awesome. My family is quite traditional (though my mother is more understanding) and they really emphasize working hard and working as much as possible. I guess I'm the odd one out since I never cared as much for material possessions. Don't get me wrong, I love a nice car, house &amp; everything but I always chased after maintaining or seeking out social relationships.


I fight between multiple philosophies and purposes. I wanted to experience the ""night life"" even if I knew/know it isn't all that it is chalked up to be, but since I can't have that, I don't know what I want to settle for. Do I want to pursue money, potentially at the cost of working to live? Do I want to pursue the hobbies/interests I used to enjoy? Do I want to become some sort of part-time activist? I want to see a change in the world ""for the better"" where we are more united, but am I willing to commit to that? Is there a way of accomplishing something like writing a script/idea for a film without spending most of my time dedicated to that specific goal? 
I've considered going into a specific branch of psychology too, since I mainly struggle(d) with some very abnormal body image issues, but I would need to set an example before I give anybody advice (and I've had psychologists/therapists/etc who weren't an ideal role model by any means).",,,1,0,0,

I'm housebound because of my disability (severe hyperacusis), but at that time I could handle an hour long excursion at most. I was told it was no problem for my case, and that all I had to do was to drive to an office about five minutes away and could video conference from there, which I could handle.

My lawyer pulled out right before my hearing. My sister called the hearing office to ask about delaying the hearing. The person said they still had to talk to me in person to do so. My sister inquired about the video conferencing. They had no idea what she was talking about, they had never agreed to it.

I was forced to waste ear endurance trying to salvage the situation. I told the receptionist it would make my condition much worse to have to travel there, that it would take at least a month, but likely much more to recover from if I had to show up in person. She didn't give a shit. I use that phrasing intentionally. Zero compassion, and when I started to get upset and pleaded with her for some kind of help, she started treating me like a child and asked if there was someone else she could speak to who could 'make me understand that I had to come in.' I asked if I could be held in contempt of court if I didn't show up. She said she couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't. I didn't even know what that could entail, and there wasn't time to research it.

I was forced to spend over three hours that day exposed to telephone calls, travel time and the 'hearing' itself (they basically had the hearing even though I was only there to try to delay the hearing), where the judge admonished me, saying I should really treat the staff better in reference to my phone call. I spoke no insults to her. I did not berate her in the slightest. All I did was cry while pleading for her for help and to listen to me, and apparently she found my distress offensive.

My recovery from that day didn't take months. It took years. When I wrote a 'proper' written request to appear at my hearing via phone (as the first time I was forced to come in it wasn't even my hearing -- it was just about my request to delay my hearing), a service they claimed they had, even after reading how devastating the effect of coming in had been he denied my request and said I had to do it again.

Then I found out that I had the option to waive my right to appear there all along. The first woman just didn't feel like telling me.

Years of effort down the drain as I was forced to have no one show up to my hearing because I still hadn't recovered enough to find a second lawyer.

There are many people in the disability system who I worked with who were very helpful and kind. But the kindest thing I could say about the judge and receptionist at my hearing office is that it was like trying to talk to machines, but I've literally recieved more compassion from machines, even if it was though programming and not true empathy. There are some utterly heartless people there who have not even the slightest hint of remorse about increasing our suffering dramatically for no reason that I can even come up with other than perhaps a power trip. Or maybe it was just an easy way to get another reason to deny me. It was clear from their reasoning that they didn't believe my hyperacusis was real at all, even though I choked up, cried and had difficulty speaking about it when I was there in person.

Again, not all people in the system are like that, but my point is to beware the ones that are. Check all the details with the hearing office specially, submit a written request also with the hearing office, get a response in writing, and there is an out if need be, but waiving the right to appear at your hearing has to be in writing too so don't leave it to the last minute.",,,1,0,0,

I'd still say get in touch with them, because it's a resource, and you can't have too many of those -- but (FROM MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY) you can totally pounce on that job offer. Take it. Take it now.

They won't suspend your benefits until you've been earning above the limit for 9 months out of a 15-month period. There's an additional 3-month extension that can happen depending on circumstances/arbitrary, idunno; then after that, you stay on the books for a few years, not receiving payments unless your income drops below the threshold (so if your condition were to flare up again, you just go back on the benefits without starting a whole new application).

I have heard that rigid chairs were heavier, but I didn't know that they also have a shorter life span. :/

It's tricky because I'm so use to being ambulatory, and I'm just really fucking sick and tired of losing motor control somewhere public and literally being stuck. Sometimes on the floor. No, please don't call EMS, ERs are expensive and there's nothing they can do.Then, when I do try to move there's the falling and the pain and the weird as fuck gait. I also think if I used a chair even when I wasn't literally falling over, I would have less frequent episodes.

Hmm. Thoughts thoughts thoughts.

I'm a little worried about people seeing me switching from rolling to walking and being jackasses to me or other chair users. I'm also thinking about the benefits of having handles on the back. I ended up using my special rolling desk chair as a rollator for several hours today. I would have rather had a chair today just because of the pain and fatigue, although at least I didn't end up falling more. If I had handles I could do that, but also, some rando could decide they really want to help me and push me someplace and be a creep.

I suggested this to a woman I worked with prior to getting my license when the estate attorney for her deceased aunt was being rude, condescending, and unhelpful when my coworker had questions or concerns. My coworker called the city bar association and told them about the treatment she had received. All the sudden that attorney was much nicer and more willing to explain the process. An attorney (or their staff) often has to give people bad news but it should always be done respectfully. 

Your state court website or the bar association should also have a list of every disciplinary hearing they've had for attorney misconduct. Check it to make sure the attorney you like isn't on there! It will say if they're suspended or disbarred as well.

You can also look to see if your state has a Disability Rights Center. They may be able to help, or they may be really overwhelmed with other, higher priority cases (such as physical abuse cases). They're often understaffed.

If there are any law schools in your state, contact them and see if they have a law clinic that takes these cases. Most law schools have clinics where students who have taken enough courses litigate cases under the supervision of a licensed attorney. Generally they do a good job because all of them are really scared of messing up. Each law clinic is different. Some focus on criminal appeals, others do domestic work, it just depends. The school may also have alumni or faculty who work in the field that they can give you info on. Many law schools have libraries that are open to the public certain hours and may have good resources.
