I'd recommend spending some time in-person with disabled folks and listening closely to their experiences.  I'd also take a look at a lot of the criticism around depictions of disabled characters in films recently to avoid those pitfalls.

0aa5ab2d-2123-45d0-94c9-1e2f2eed6f8a,1502515681,"Hi! I have FSHD, a type of slowly progressing muscular dystrophy. I have a weirdly specific situation that might be interesting. 

One of my best friends recently had a baby, and I'd love to hold him but I'm TERRIFIED of dropping him or not being able to support his neck. FSHD causes the muscles that hold your scapula (shoulder blades) to deteriorate, and mine are pretty much shot, so holding something in my arms the way you'd hold a baby is super fatiguing in like 5 seconds. Also, Because of the shoulder thing it's hard to keep my elbows bent at the angle needed to support a babies neck. 

I've tried using a pillow to prop my arms up for support but it still feels really tenuous, especially if the baby gets fussy and squirmy. I've also tried just letting the baby rest on my thighs, but those muscles are also affected and it takes some effort to keep my thighs together (they sort of splay out when I'm seated). 

SO. I'm imagining some sort of sling I could wear over one shoulder, like a messenger bag, with a firm curved bottom for the baby to rest in, maybe with a slight rise to the end where the baby's head would rest. The sides would preferably be thinner, soft, and flexible (to enjoy the feeling and warmth of holding the baby), but with some sort of internal boning or structure to keep the sides from folding in on each other.

From what you wrote you might want to research pseudo addiction. VERY different from addiction. You are definitely not an addict and neither am I. But I did (kind of still do) have pseudo addiction, which usually comes from not having reliable pain control. 
Getting reliable pain control can be a challenge. I ended up off my meds for about 10 months because I couldn't find anyone to prescribe them. My pain did NOT get better, it only got worse. I lost all my muscle and was bed ridden. It's been hell to recover from that, which is why I advocate so hard for adequate pain control. Pain can ruin you. 
Thankfully, my pain is pretty well controlled now and I'm working on trying to rebuild muscle (really hard with EDS). I highly recommend at least consulting with a pain management doctor.

As bad as the racism is [and it is fucking vile], I find it more soul destroying that the carer has such an advantage over us because we *literally* rely on them. It becomes difficult to call somebody out when you then have to ask them to do something very personal in the next breath... So, if you don't mind me saying, it is a perfectly good excuse for your staying silent.

It is a *completely* different scenario, but my carer it is very religious and I am an atheist, which has led to some very frothy conversations... I don't want to piss her off and I'm sure she doesn't want to piss off her 'boss', so we have agreed to leave it well alone. By this i mean it is out in the open, we both know where we stand, but we don't talk about it any more as we know it just causes unnecessary friction. It seems to work out well so far.

Between the toilet and my legs there is no wiggle room so I have to suck in and move my legs like I'm doing a funny dance. Same with my mother.

But truth be told, I'm deathly afraid of Out of Order signs. It's an irrational fear, but I always think if I flush in the non-broken stall something will happen to the other stalls toilet. 

I went with my guy friend to this little playarea for disabled kids. He had to pee. The men's room was used for cleaning but he shrugged and went into the girls room no problem.

A few moments later I said ""ah fuck it I have to pee too"". And when I walked inside *HE WAS USING THE HANDICAPPED STALL. With the Out of Order sign.*

And what was worse? *He had the stall flung wide open.*

There was a case worker in the other stall, peeing. I'm diabetic, and I have to pee a lot because of how much water I drink. Now I'm thinking ""oh shit what do I say"".

He comes out and says ""Oh hey there."" Right about then the toilet water starts to rise. I peer in and see it, and fucking RUN.

I sprint like a bat out of hell to get the moderator of the playarea, who runs back. She was able to fix the toilet by plunging. Didn't question my guy friend who was mortified.

Supposedly the case worker didn't hear anything or never minded. Flushed, left it clean as a whistle, thank God, washed her hands and left. I later found out she was deaf and visually impaired. No wonder.

So I peed, washed up, and we rushed out. 

And that is why I refuse to go in that bathroom no matter how clean it is. ",,,3,0,0,

Generally I think disabled people are hardest to relate to for people. It's much easier to imagine how someone with dark skin could be treated than someone with complex medical needs.

c29f2422-a9ca-48db-b496-6cd30e55176a,1501718317,"Likely, you are applying for SSI (income based social security) as I'm guessing you don't have an extensive work history. In these cases, the examiner will only request records one year back. Sources farther back than that do not show your current functioning, they do not show how you are doing NOW, so they are unfortunately not relevant to your claim. Your mom might have listed one doctor because it was the only one within the year time frame. If there were other doctors, call the local social security office and add these doctors.

Do not supply your medical records- you will get charged to get your records while social security can get them. Social security is required to get any and all sources from the period year before you applied for SSI. 

The process is not ""difficult on purpose"" as peewinkle claims. The process is the way it is in order to be FAIR.  There are many more intricate details the examiner has to be aware of and deal with that are very complicated- again, this is to keep the process FAIR. The initial process is entirely possible to complete without a lawyer, and I typically do not advise getting a lawyer on initial claims; I have had to deny claims because of uncooperative lawyers. However, if you find the process complicated, then it may be better for you to get an attorney representative. The lawyer will not take any money until after you have been awarded benefits; then they will take a percentage of your awarded benefits.

The vets, admin staff, and other pet owners were sweet to him but just let him do his thing, which was so nice to see.

1. Minimizing urinary tract infections. Finding the source was my biggest issue. From there, it was an easy improvement. Long term, low dose, antibiotics were not a solution for me. Chance of developing resistance, and the numerous allergies I have to antibiotics, made it an unacceptable choice to me. that said, my closest friend, does use them.

2. Watching fluid intake after about 4PM for nighttime control, or until I'm home from an important morning meeting, appointment, photo shoot, etc. Darn, I hate allowing myself to dehydrate because of all the other consequences, but sometimes you've got to restrict when something important and meaningful is coming your way.

3. Sodium. Yep, my most guilt-filled solution when I see my kidneys waking up at an inopportune time. A quick salty snack slows them down until I can rehyrdrate and flush out.

4. Pee early &amp; often. Set an alarm at night.

5. Medication. Years ago the only best option was medication by the name of Dirtropan. The problem is that the side effects for me were worse than simply not taking it. Thankfully in the last 12 years, or so, I've been taking Detrol, long acting. After a few months the side effects became very manageable, especially if I took it before bed so that the dry mouth had mostly worn off by morning. Perhaps you be looking for the more effectiveness during the day by taking it in the morning. Talk to your doctor. One last thought, I seem to be prone to almost all side effects from medications but mine were mostly minimal and, as a young person, don't be afraid to try even when that intimidating potential side effect of reduced sexual function or desire stares back at you. It didn't affect me, even though some of the other stated side effects were definitely effecting me.

I hope that helps. The only other thing about odor or cleaning up that I can suggest is disposable wipes. They do a pretty good job minimizing smell until the opportunity presents itself to properly get cleaned up. Of course, sitting in a chair, I have a lot more room and bulk to wear pads or briefs when necessary so I can't advise you very well about hiding or minimizing the appearance of those.

That's just a dumb requirement. I hate social events too. ",,,2,0,0,

We need more women in STEM majors, so that's incredibly awesome that you're pursuing a degree in one! And what does she or anyone else know. You know what you can do, and more importantly, you know what you *want* to do. That's the important part. You're right, you don't want to get stuck in a major/career that you hate just because some idiots thought they knew better than you did for your life. Fuck that. 

Trust me, do whatever you want to do and don't listen to anyone else. Don't end up with a teaching degree like I did even though I never wanted to teach and I absolutely hated student teaching during my senior year of college (and I *hated* the kids too). I wish to god I'd stood up for myself more and gotten the degree I wanted. (Long-term it won't matter as with my disability I can't work anyway, but I still regret so much not getting the college degree I wanted.) So you do you, and fuck the rest of 'em.

And hahahaha your parents would've freaked me the hell out too! �� I can't even imagine. I had a parakeet when I was a kid and he used to say the weirdest shit. I never did figure out where he learned it. 

Oh man, I know exactly what you mean about being depressed in HS. I got depressed pretty badly, but I didn't dare tell my parents cause they're pretty strict fundamentalist baptists (my mom more so than my dad but he went along with it), and they didn't believe in depression. being ""depressed"" in their religion just meant you weren't praying or reading your Bible enough, and they would've taken me to their pastor for counseling. Hellllll no. So yeah, it built and built until it finally got to the point where when I was in my primary care doc's office for a checkup once I believe around age 18-19 (thankfully without my parents), I completely broke down sobbing to him and told him I was depressed. Thank god he understood and put me on Prozac which helped loads. 

I'm so sorry about your heart Fontaine. Honestly, I have no idea what that is and I couldn't find it on Google (unless you meant you had a heart Fontan procedure as a kid? But that's the closest I could find). But either way, it sounds horrible and I'm so sorry you've had to not only go through the pain, complications, disabilities, and limitations from it; but I'm so sorry that you've had to rearrange your life dreams because of it as well. :(

BUT....I am proud of and happy for you for finding something else, something close to what you want to do, to keep your dream ""sorta"" alive! :) That's such an awesome move, and it really sounds exciting and intriguing your plans to work in and help the animals at your dream zoo. I really hope you end up with a job there at that zoo! 

And girl, you and I are on the same page. I honestly didn't want kids either, and getting my disease was like a relief because I cannot have kids anymore! Hahaha. So I completely get you! Most people don't understand and think it's odd for a young woman to not want kids, but nooooo thank you. That is just not for me. So between my disease and having gone through 2 straight years of 2 different kinds of chemo, I was pretty done on the children front a few years ago. (Well, not to mention the fact that I'm currently in hospice care, so I'm **definitely** not having any kids now. �� And that's quite alright with me. [I have a dark sense of humor and joke about my dying, but I've accepted it and am at peace with it, so it really doesn't bother me. :) ]).",,,1,0,0,

Good. We are all different. 

I am 20, a woman in college who must use a wheelchair due to leg injuries from an auto accident. I cannot walk at all, but some in a wheelchair can walk a short distance.

&gt;I'm interested in professional and love life.

I can help you there. I am very sexually and socially active. My story can be found at:

http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5idxxq/update_20f_in_wheelchair_wants_sex_on_dates_not/

I have a loss of leg function; everything above my legs works OK. I can't stand or walk, but I can lie in bed with no trouble. On my back with my knees up and legs spread, I am like any other girl.

The biggest negative effect is that I cannot while sitting in my wheelchair, reach upper shelves and cabinets. So everything in my kitchen has to be on or below the counter. I recently changed apartments. I not only need large doors for my wheelchair, but plenty of room on kitchen counters (to keep stuff) and in the bathroom and other rooms to turn my chair around. I need a garage to keep my ""indoor"" chair (I have two - a smaller ""transport chair"" for use in my home and a regular wheelchair with the big wheels for use on campus and other away from home places.

&gt;How do people treat you? Is there a difference between strangers / people you already know?

Very well. People are quick to open doors, move objects in the way, and be helpful to me.

An allowance or a denial is not a determination of whether you are ""sick enough"" - it is based on an evaluation of your medical evidence and whether it is consistent, severe, and suggests marked limitations in the various domains that SSA determines (Understanding and memory; concentration, persistence, and pace; interacting with others; ability to take care of yourself). 

Your ""tags"" do not mean much - someone can have chronic anxiety/depression/ptsd/agoraphobia that are well-managed by medication. The fact that your psychiatrist and therapist used ""tags"" seems to say that they do not understand the SSA disability process. What documentation did they submit? What did they put down for your mental status exams? Did they write comprehensive notes?

The SSA does not doubt you - they doubt the evidence you submitted. Try again and build the strongest case you possibly can. Review all the evidence, fill out the function report comprehensively, get someone to fill out the 3rd-party function report, ask for letters from your providers documenting your limitations, request for consultative exams if you feel that documentation from your providers is not up to snuff.",,,2,0,0,

Super super true.


I'm sorry. All of my romantic partners have had them so I should know better. 

Perhaps I should also clarify that a situation id say to do that is mainly situations when for an example a whole group of friends talking and drinking are occupying all the disability seats, or when a parent puts each of their kids in all four of the seats instead of letting one stay in the stroller or having them since they're small maybe share a seat.

Especially since these at least where I live often will put their stroller so it's very difficult to walk past, and I've heard many say to the kids when the kids ask ""mom doesn't anyone else wanna sit"" they say ""no these seats are especially for kids"", and the time I've interfered to say that ""excuse me sorry hi actually they're for anyone with trouble standing, do you think there's anyway my partner could sit down?"" And only ever gotten rude replies about my partner being young and an adult, or something about how I don't think her kids deserve to be treated like everyone else.
(Not to fall on the kids but on the mom) 
Or on someone who has spread their bags all over the seats around them. -- even if you are disabled and need to get the bags easier (like not putting it on the shelf overhead or under the seat/on the floor because lifting difficulties) I believe that there's a difference between spreading them over several seats, and putting them on one seat next to you. Or if you need to have them spread, letting the person know that ""sorry I have difficulties lifting and I won't be able to pick them up if I put them on the ground"" which gives you the chance to say ""oh I understand. Could I perhaps keep them in my lap?/oh I understand, could my partner help lift them for you when you get off so I can sit?"" 

But you're definitely right. Thanks for pointing out that I was being erasing of invisible disabilities; that's not at all the kind of person I want to be. 

What if you tell the person you need to sit and they say ""why do you need to? You're young and healthy"" rather than ""I'm sorry I need to sit"" 

This isn't required but most times when my partner has asked to sit and the person has said they needed to sit, they've gently poked the person next to them to say ""sorry, I really need this seat, but this person needs to sit too, could you get up?"" And if that person isn't getting up, most of the time someone will overhear and get up. ",,,1,0,0,

However, after talking about it, we both feel 10xs better. This is a cycle for us. We lived together when I was 18, had just started college, and he was 20 and working in a restaurant. We live in NY, so it was a lot of pressure on him to make his half of the rent. My parents paid mine, since I was never healthy enough to work and also go to class. I was hanging on by a thread physically the 2 semesters I was in college. After the first semester, we had to move out bc I just couldn't take care of myself and my health had spiraled so quickly. By the end of the second semester, I was actually dying of malnutrition due to my gastroparesis and intestinal dysmotility, so I was hospitalized for 1 month the week after class ended. By the middle of the summer, I couldn't walk anymore. Walking is something I struggled with a lot anyway. Turns out I have hip dysplasia. 

Using a wheelchair is a pain. Almost none of my drs have automatic doors. I live in my parents' two story house, which means I have to scoot down the stairs if I have to leave the house, in order to get to the second wheelchair. It's ridiculous, but no way am I about to let my parents pay for a stair lift. My parents also have trouble pushing me because they have the same syndrome I have, EDS. They are only mildly effected, luckily. It still hurts them to lift the chair into the trunk, though. We've been trying for a custom chair I can use on my own for many months, but my orthopedist turned out to be useless. He had no idea what he was doing when it came to writing letters to insurance about the chair. So, now I am using a different dr. Once the letters are sent to my insurance, it's just more waiting. 

Recently, we asked the town, after asking several times over the years, to fix the driveway skirt because it is cracked all over and this makes it really hard to push me over it. It took so many calls. One person even insinuated that I am not actually disabled and my parents just want their skirt fixed, since my parents had called 2xs before about fixing the skirt prior to me being disabled. 

When I'm out, mostly old people stare at me. It's a look of confusion, usually. If a kid stares at me, or asks their parent why I'm in a chair, the parent will usually tell them not to look at me and then pull the kid away. Most people do not move if they're in my way. Many times they just stare at me when I ask them to move. I've also had people rest their bags on my chair. Strangers. 

On the upside, I once had a man who worked at a store pull my chair over 30 ft of gravel(really hard to do) just so I could get inside. Occasionally, people hold the door open, but I'd say 90% of the time no one helps. 

I can't work, so I don't have any advice there. Hopefully one day, though. Right now, I can't do much of anything. I'm in my bed unless I have an appointment, although now that I have pain mgmt I am able to go out for a little bit once a week.

I get this sometimes when people know I'm Hard of Hearing and catch me not wearing my hearing aids, or catch me listening to music with earbuds. So many times I've explained that I don't always use hearing-aid-compatible headphones and if there's little background noise, I can turn my music all the way up to hear it. Or I've explained that I can understand people with lipreading and context clues (which inevitably turns into the person mouthing words at me to see if I can ""actually lipread"").

48d828bb-80c0-4b44-9794-01188f5b7623,1503039406,"I think most people dealing with disabilities have those thoughts. I know I have ok days and horribly crappy days. I feel horrible about my crappy days, because in the grand scheme of disabilities, mine is not that bad. My disability isn't going to kill me. I am still mobile. I can still do things for myself, for the most part. I just can't do what I used to do. I can't be the person I used to be. I can't achieve the dreams I had. My dream job is out of the question for me. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's not the end. I went into a different field of study than I wanted to, because it's something I can do. I chose it because of earning potential. If I can't do what I want, I might as well do something that will make me enough money to play with, right? So far, I have enjoyed all of the classes I have taken in that field. I really didn't think I would like it, but it's kind of fun. I originally wanted to be a veterinarian. I worked in the veterinary field for eight years, before my disability showed up. I loved my job. Now, I am a computer science major. Once I get to a place, financially, where I can afford it, I will be getting into rescue work again. My dream job will become my hobby, in a way. There are ways you can do things you want to do. Sometimes, you have to be creative or compromise a bit, but you can get close. 
That being said, if you are seriously thinking about ending it, you should talk to someone. I know you said it will only cause more problems, but dealing with a little drama from family and friends is small when compared to not seeing what tomorrow has to offer. If you are so unhappy with your life that you are seriously considering ending it, you need to identify what it is that is making you miserable. I have had to cut a lot of people out of my life over the years. I have had to stand up and take control of my life and myself, which is a scary thing to do, but I am happier for doing it. I cut the only family I have off, because they fed my negativity. If you are in college, they should have mental health services. Those services are confidential, meaning they cannot tell your family if you tell them not to. I'm not sure how it works with crisis situations, but I think, legally, they can only notify people if you give permission.  Life does get better. There are things worth experiencing, even with a disability. Going for a stroll outside always reminds me of that. Just sitting outside, listening to the wind, birds, bugs; watching the animals around; putting my feet in the grass all remind me that most things in the world are good. It reminds me that it's the humans in my life, or myself, that complicates things. I like peaceful moments, so I try to savor them when I find them. I also go out of my way to find them. 
I wish you luck and I hope you find someone you can really talk to. Just try to keep your mind open to different options. Life rarely ends up exactly how you envision it, even if you don't have a disability. ",,,7,0,0,

My best suggestion is to see if you can get some sort of soundboard that you can use to prerecord someone else's voice saying different very general things about yourself. Have the games microphone handy so that you can play these messages from the sound board into the mic. You should be able to find a sound board app for your iPad. If you get some sort of stand and rig a microphone up near the speaker you should be able to hit a few messages to ""chat"" with other players.


I would recommend recording stuff ranging from basic commands to mildly personal information.


Basic stuff might be ""good game,"" ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""okay"" ""hi guys!"" Etc. Or even add statements of exaggeration ""fuck, shit GODDAMMIT!"" (That might be a real winner lol)


More personal stuff might be ""I'm mute, I cannot talk, don't be mean, we're all gamers and I'm here to have fun"" or ""I can only respond to yes/no questions because I can't talk."" You can even lie if you want and have a button for ""I don't speak English I can only answer basic yes no questions."" or even stuff like ""my favorite map/character is X, what's yours?""


You should be able to load up a soundboard with whatever you want. Be creative, make occasional changes, customize recordings for different games, etc.


That's how I might handle this situation. I'd not perfect, but it might make gameplay more interesting. With any luck your guild members might have some good humor in dealing with you in that way, especially if you periodically change up your recordings.


Good luck!",,,3,0,0,

5008bf69-d54d-47db-a04f-b9d3afd59117,1503543878,"I know someone in a wheelchair, but not a working woman. They became disabled at working age. Here are some things I recall.

A few kids can be really interested in the wheelchair especially really young boys. They seem to think it is a super cool go cart and want to mess with it or ask questions about it. 

People seem to like to share information about supplements and nutrition drinks, etc. that they feel the wheelchair bound person should be taking. Sometimes the person sells these themselves and sometimes it is something they just buy and take themselves or someone they know does. Some of these sharers are barely acquaintances if that to the wheelchair bound person.

People who want to share their religion with others seem to like to approach those in wheelchairs. I think they think a wheelchair bound person would be more interested, or not run away, or not beat them up so they are considered less threatening. The person I know belongs to a religion and doesnt really get offended easily but they get approached a fair amount when out in public.

Even with fairly new construction those bars in bathrooms such as at a gym, attraction, historical site, etc. are sometimes installed in a less helpful or completely unhelpful manner. Maybe no vertical bar in the handicapped gym shower or a horizontal bar right over and behind the toilet. Also some places have grandfathered in old construction so that the handicapped stall is an old regular size with bars that just is not big enough to use.

Some people like to tell their health problems to disabled people in a wheelchair. Maybe they think disabled people like talking about health. Sometimes I think overly talkative people like to monopolize the time of those in a wheelchair because it is harder for them to make a quick getaway.

A nice thing to do besides helping with doors is to ask the wheelchair bound person if they would like a cup of coffee or water if at a place that offers them. It is hard to wheel with a coffee cup in one hand.

Disabled people with placards for a car can give the card to a person to use in picking them up and dropping them off. Thus an able bodied person can park in a handicapped spot and put the placard on the mirror or dash and  go in a building to wheel out their friend to the car. Sometimes debbie dogooder will run over after the ablebodied person gets out to walk in the building to check that it is there and glare at the abled body person who debbie dogooder is certain is not handicapped. 

People love to watch how disabled people get from a wheelchair into a car. If they are sitting on a bench near a business this is considered great entertainment apparently and the watchers apparently think the disabled person or their friend have no peripheral vision.

Sometimes people who the disabled person has helped before becoming disabled when the other person was in a fix, offer no help in return when the disabled person could use help.

There are some nice people who offer anonymous gifts especially around Christmas.

I'm so sorry that you have so many external factors to consider when deciding whether to use your scooter or not (such as your future employment). I've never been in that situation specifically, but I can understand some of your fears, me being a disabled person who had my own struggles with being disabled and still trying to have a career at one point. It can be downright terrifying wondering if you can still provide for yourself and how your future will look if your disability affects your employment, and I'm sure that fear goes double with trying to preserve your ability to work your dream job. :(

Also, I love zoos! I especially love the zoos that rescue wounded or needy animals, and give them a better home and a good life. (And as an aside, you and I definitely share the trait of not doing well in heat. Lol. Of course, it doesn't help that I live in the desert. Ugh. Well, that just means that I get to stay at home with the AC cranked for 3-4 months during the summer time. ��)

You say that using your scooter too much triggers your mental rhetoric. What mental rhetoric is that? Just seeing yourself as a fully disabled person? Fearing you'll begin needing your scooter more in life? Fearing what others will say? Or what do you mean, I'd you don't mind my asking?

And as far as spiralling into those certain thoughts, I've been there 100% (and still find myself there at times), so I know how you feel. It's something I think we disabled people fight more often than able-bodied people realize, even those we love and who are close to us. I mean, I love my family dearly, and there's a *lot* I share with them regarding my disability/illness, but my mental struggles with thinking about ""not being here anymore"" is one thing I've never shared with them. How often I get ""down"" or get sick of the state of my life. How many times I wonder if things would be easier not just on myself but also on others close to me if I were just gone. 

So yeah, I completely understand you and what you mean. And if you ever want or need to chat when you're in a bad head space; or hell, even if you're not and you just want to talk about disability or zoos or really *anything*, please feel free to PM me.

I had to sell my condo because it wasn't safe for me to get in and out of anymore (architectural barriers). I had to stop working in March due to my mobility issues. I briefly lived with a boyfriend but we parted ways last month and now I'm living with my parents. 

I don't really feel safe going out alone anymore, and my fatigue often prevents me from doing things. Super depressing. So I'm trying to figure out how to feel less isolated as well. So far, what has helped is:

1. resisting the urge to hide or isolate because I'm sad or feel like I'm boring or a burden or whatever 

2. staying in touch with a few close friends (even though some are in different parts of the country, keeping in touch via text/FaceTime/Facebook etc.), 

3. trying to make plans that involve local friends or family coming to me. 

4. Identify other safe spaces that meet your needs and be open to going to them when you can. (For example, one friend and her husband built a ramp to make their house accessible to me when I explained I wanted to come over but couldn't get up the stairs at the entry. My brother &amp; his wife put up a ramp and railing in the garage so I could come hang out). 

5. Encourage your husband to bring round his friends/colleagues/family and be open to meeting new people when the opportunity arises.

6. Forgive yourself when your stamina breaks and you can't attend something or have to cancel plans. Make sure the other person knows that it's because of your condition, it's not them, and make plans to try again another day

7. (Not here yet personally but trying to psych myself up to do it) Join a group (it could be a support group, a book club, a class, whatever). Pick something you feel like is a feasible time commitment, is interesting or helpful, and that is safe or convenient for you to participate in. That might mean you're G-chatting with a book club once a month instead of going to a physical place. That's okay, too.

8. Pay attention when you feel resistant to going to something or seeing someone. Coping with chronic illness is hard. Sometimes I feel like as much as I want to do something, if I'm not feeling safe or confident I might not be ready to engage with that person or situation. Be gentle and kind to yourself. Give yourself the time you need, but if there are other things going on (like if you made plans with a friend who somehow always makes you feel shitty about yourself, or maybe it's time to re-evaluate your mobility aids because they're not meeting your needs anymore but that's upsetting and stressful because it might mean things are getting worse). You have to hash that shit out and figure out what's what. If you avoid it (a personal favorite strategy of mine, lol), you are going to stay stuck and feel frustrated and angry about it. 

9. Searching for a community online and reaching out to people (like you just did! Woot!)

10. Making sure your husband has adequate support in his caregiver role. Consider options like a personal assistant (if you have $) or a personal care aid (might be covered depending on what state you're in) - even if that person is just around to accompany you on errands, it might help you feel less stranded when your hubby isn't around.

Only have had 1 girlfriend so far for a few months in 2014. Childhood friend and able-bodied. I was forced to use a Walker at school for six and half years starting at age 12 until the end of high school. Really screwed me up body image wise but I've started to heal with of all things my local BDSM scene. Single right now but not opposed to looking in a little while. (I write mainly in /r/BDSMCommunity about this stuff, search that sub for Walker Freak if you want, not the point of your post but if you want to know more go ahead and read a bit). There are some with physical disabilities in my local scene. Not specifically looking for a disabled partner as having us both be disabled would create certain roadblocks; and I'd fear bureaucracy might start interfering if we wanted to have kids, but not totally opposed to it if I met someone I connected with. 

I'm going back to school in September. Personality wise I get along with most people for small talk and volunteer somewhere that inspired me to go to school for the new field. I hate job interviews though. 

Small, if theirs no railing I need a ramp or elevator which usualy means I'm going up alone while the group all goes up the stairs unless it's my family. 

Big: Stares of strangers. Still struggle with the first thing people notice about me is what's wrong with my body. 

Strangers mostly tend to be overly nice or unintentionally insulting. A woman was surprised I was using the bathroom alone...at age 15. If I'm waiting for someone just standing somewhere people assume ""Buddy"" needs some help. 

People that know me get used to it most of the time. 

I have personal stories over in the BDSM text based areas here. Again, not expecting you to write based off them but if you want insight into my worldview which is fairly unique go ahead and read.

In a facility I once worked in, we had a corrections officer who became blind due a to a congenital issue.  The governing agency wanted to retire him, but we repurposed his job into listening to inmate calls for intelligence purposes.  His prior training was not wasted, and he's been instrumental in solving several homicides due to his skills.  

Could another, non-disabled officer, done the same?  Perhaps, but using the skills he had already developed through experience and training made him perfect for this task. The problem was the agency was ready to throw away this talent solely due to his ""disability.""  

I say Forget All That.  Use the talents people possess, or have earned, to continue to be productive members of society.  It's better for them, it's better for you, it's good for us all.  Get over the stigma of so-called disability.  We all have differences.  Use them for the good.  ",,,2,0,0,

It's hard to give specific strategies without knowing your daughter's current level of function, strengths vs weaknesses, bathroom set up at home, etc, so I unfortunately can't give you any detailed information on how to help her. What I can tell you is that you don't need to be buying adaptive equipment of Craigslist, insurance pays for that stuff! There's lots of different adaptive equipment available, and her OT should be able to help you choose the ones that are most appropriate and least invasive and write letters of medical necessity to get insurance to cover it. They can teach transfer techniques, too, with proper body mechanics to minimize the risk of injury to both you and her.

 As far as handicap vehicles go, most/all states have medical waiver programs through Medicaid that can fund the cost of a handicap vehicle or the cost of adapting your personal vehicle to be handicap accessible. Unfortunately, wait lists for the waiver can be crazy long (I've heard 15 years in Louisiana!), but better to get on the list now rather than later. You could also check with your state's assistive technology organizations for grant opportunities, or they should at least be able to help you get in contact with the right people who would know where to look for grants. Mobility companies sometimes offer grants and loans, too, so check with them as well as national spina bifida organizations. Hope this helps!",,,3,0,0,

For the record, my first year in college was pretty awful. The campus was huge and inaccessible in some parts, and because I was a freshman with a crappy schedule, I spent so much of my time going around campus drenched in sweat from trying to make it to all my classes. By the time I got there I would usually be too tired to even really pay attention or take notes. That, coupled with the independence of having to live by myself almost did me in.

What helped was contacting the Disability Services Office to make getting around campus easier (I got priority registration to plan my classes so they were closer together, and was allowed to leave class early and arrive late), getting to know a small group of friends who could help me out, and learning how to meal plan and use my energy wisely.

My advice would be:
* Contact the disability services office to see what accommodations they can offer. Some of them are not very helpful, but you might have access to tutoring services, priority registration, note taking assistance, or other help.
* Identify what exactly about the physical and mental strain is causing you issues: Is it hard to comprehend the material? To take good notes? To get around campus? Then zero in and try to come up with a solution.
* Realize that everyone feels stressed out and unable to cope when they first start college, it's just compounded for those of us with disabilities. You were smart enough to get in, so you deserve to be there.
* Try to make at least a few friends if you can. Everyone is looking for friends at the beginning of the semester, and having people to talk to can really lift some of the strain off of you.

College is not for everyone, and if you ultimately decide it's not for you, that's okay. But just realize that it takes a lot of people a while to adjust (seriously, it took me about a year), and I think you'll want to give it your best shot before giving up and deciding to do something else.

Very much like dry, old paper.  Just one more thing that shows me how ill he really is, despite his cheeriness.

Also, I'm not a believer in the ""disabled body worse than abled body"" idea. For example, I'm blind. My blindness does not make my body ""worse."" I just live differently than sighted people. My vision will not limit my lifespan or cause me additional health problems. It's essentially a lifestyle difference. Obviously, not every person with a disability is in that position. Some people with disabilities may consider their condition objectively worse, but it's probably not a good idea to think that all disabled bodies are categorically worse than abled bodies in all situations.

MPS is sort of in a grey area of neuromusculoskeletal pain disorders with conditions like fibromyalgia. The pathophysiology of MPS is poorly understood, and the disease process itself has not been very well characterized in the medical literature. This is unfortunate because many physicians believe that MPS is a functional pain disorder (a nice way of saying that the pain is psychogenic, or originating from your mind.)


This is unfortunate for you, because as far as you know, the pain is real wether it originates from your muscles/fascia, your spinal cord, your brain or the chip that aliens implanted there (joke).

Sex Ed started in 6th grade, they split the boys and girls to teach us basic body part names and what happens in puberty. 

Grades 7 &amp; 8 we were together, basic forms of birth control, the first time I saw a condom it was put on a souvenir lighthouse with the word ""Woody"" on it. Periods, circumcision. Heavy focus on STDs, think they were trying to gross us away from it, we each had to do a presentation on one. 

High school 9th grade was the last time PE is mandatory where I am, boys and girls separate again. I was taken out of gym in 7th grade as I couldn't keep up and the high school just didn't enroll me for the 2 weeks of health classes; I didn't ask so I just missed that. 

It was accessible in the sense I did the exact same study as everyone else and got the grades. But I was also forced to use a walker at school from 7th grade through high school. It killed my self-worth and I spent those classes privately thinking they were useless as nobody would ever want me. I don't necessarily blame Sex Ed for this as educators probably don't even know about it and my needs are totally different from even someone else with Cerebral Palsy in their arms or requiring a wheelchair; let alone someone blind or something else.

There are a lot of films that depict wheelchair users in a superficial way so I'd be more than happy to dispel some of the myths around it. I've also studied neuroscience and medical biology in my bachelors so I know a lot about disability in general.  

To quickly answer some of your questions:

* I've never dated any other people with a disability and don't really have any inclination to. I don't really socialize with other people with disabilities. This is because of various personal reasons, but mostly because my disability is not a big part of my identity. When I first got my disability I was quite selfconcious and worried about my love life, but I've only had good experiences. I won't really have one night stands, because that just doesn't really work, but LTR is not a problem. 

* Most annoyances involve how other people treat me as you kind of allude to. I am lucky that I am able to walk short distances, meaning I can walk up and down stairs. I am also very capable with my chair meaning I can take escalators, get into busses, do anything someone without a disability can do. 

* You get looks from strangers and people try to help you, which usually is easily ignored. If I'm in a bad mood though or if they do something that actually worsens the situation I can get quite annoyed. Just an example is that I am much faster in my chair than someone who walks so if they try to get out of my way they usually step into the way. 

* I've never been professionally affected in a direct way by my disability. I mean I have not been rejected from a job because of my disability. However, there are just some jobs that I will not apply for because I can't do them. The same thing in my school, there are some roles I won't be able to take on a shoot, but that is just life. I won't be able to do these professionally, so why bother learning them in school. I mostly focus on editing, directing and AD'ing. 

* This is a huge topic, but one 'positive' experience that I can talk about is that I really don't look at my accident as being something terrible that happened to me. I can honestly say that I don't regret it happening. It changed my life completely, and besides the physical aspect, it made my life much more meaningful. I found my passion and I found a kind of happiness and peace that I never thought I could have. Rehabilitation, going from not being able to do shit, to being able to take care of yourself, is a struggle, but its a struggle with a lot of victories and proud moments along the way. 

I hope this helps. You can probably see that I don't mind talking about this. I have a lot of stories so let me know if you want to talk. If you wouldn't mind, can you tell me a bit more about what you plan to do with this script?

Last thing, someone already mentioned this, but you should check your language. Wheelchair bound, sufferer, able-bodied, living with disability are words and sentences you should avoid. The appropriate way to talk about this is with people first language. This means *person* with a disability and *lead character* with a disability. Wheelchair user is the term I prefer when I'm being formal (my friends can call me whatever they want). I use a wheelchair and I have a disability, but I am also a lot of others things. These things don't define me. That is the idea behind it. By the way, its not a problem that you didn't know this! So don't feel bad about it or anything.

Now, idk how their policies function for the circumstance you identify. But I suspect that it shouldn't be an issue outside of the time you two were actually together. Of course evidence to support your living situation and the timeline is helpful.

Beyond that, no, SSA employees do not have a mandate to try and get people taken off benefits. But if they hear/suspect something, they need to make note of it and take some action. It's all in the policies. If you're on SSI they need to know if you get married, just like if your living situation changes, you start working, you come into a large sum of money, etc...

My first advice is to go buy a big, heavy duty rain poncho that is big enough to cover you and almost all of your chair. Put this on while getting a haircut and also ask the barber to put their own apron over that. Also, depending on your chair, and if it's easy to do, flip your headrest out of the way so the barber has better access to the back of your head. When finished just have the barber blow off any hair that may be on your poncho or your wheelchair and when you get home just have someone check to make sure it's totally clean. Most barbers have chairs to sit in. If you can easily transfer that's fine to use if you want. In my experience they're always happy to move it out of the way when I roll up and I just pull in the empty spot. Honestly I've never had to ask. ",,,2,0,0,

Urine has components that break down skin over time, so it's extremely important to clean it off of the skin as soon as possible, not to mention that leaving your skin in a moist environment will cause breakdown on its own as well. Being in a an environment like that can cause wounds, skin infections, fungal/yeast infections, rashes, urinary tract infections, and can affect her self-image and confidence because she's *mentally* aware of her needs and is not actually incontinent. Additionally, the weight of a person and their positioning (angled up in bed or sitting in a chair) can put pressure on the skin in those places as well, which babies might not experience as much. That weight can cause sores and skin ulcers too, especially if she has reduced mobility, and can press the urine into her skin even more.

I'm surprised that she's not receiving additional assistance if she has multiple amputations--like it literally does not sound like the expected accommodations. She needs to have her mother request additional services and maybe call for a reevaluation of her medical needs, both from a medical assistance aid standpoint and actual additional care--*especially* at school.

So I'm in my 6th form and I hadn't eaten much and was quite a bit more dizzy than normal. After my lesson I got pulled in the hall before it was quiet enough for me to get out safely. It was an old building (about 1850-1900) and the corridor is less than half the size of the newer buildings. So I'm get shuffled around and my nausea levels sky rocket. I got to the bathroom just before it started to get busy. I basically throw myself in to the handicap stall. 

When I look down it was covered in shit. It's on everywhere, the bowl, the seat, the back. I hadn't noticed the smell until I was in there. It was, in a word, ungodly. The toilet paper is spilling out. It was actually still attached to the holder. So I end up throwing up. Meaning, now it's covered vomit too. I still had to sit on the floor and wait until the nausea to subside. With the smell.

It was at that point more people coming in and I could hear them gaging. I have to try flush but the world is still spinning. I got the flush on my fourth attempt. It barely made a dent. So I try again but my hand slipped and I put my hand is a skid mark. Yep it was as gross as you'd expect.

10 minutes later I'm well enough to stand-up but I'm still swaying. Thank God I'm the only one in there now. I get the door open and then spend another 5 minutes scrubbing my hands because gross. Thank fuck it's class time now so the hall is empty. All would be well except I didn't notice I had a bit of used bog roll attached to my shin. 

So when I walk into the office to say I'm going home early all they see is a white faced skinny teenager that is stumbling around with shit covered loo roll on her leg. Unsurprisingly the teacher that was in the office asked if I was drunk or high. That was a fun conversation.

be509193-0650-4c34-aaed-6447654cf546,1502823627,"It is surprising how dumb and insensitive doctors can be sometimes.  My partner was 30 and got advice by a physio to be tested for rheumatoid arthritis. Her GP said ok but you are to young for rheumatoid arthritis. Ironic as most common age to get it is 30-50, although can get at any age. He was still going on about her being to young when the blood work came in. He then looked at it went very muted and said I'm sending you to a rheumatologist while looking rather sheepish. She was diagnosed and thanks to modern drugs she is in remission, hopefully it will stay that way. Another interesting thing the same doctor said was ""you can have this done when you are better"" can not remember what this was but poor choice of words when referring to a chronic currently incurable condition. 

I have a slipped disc that has been getting progressive worse over the last year and a bit. I am having a slightly better time last month due to a more successful steroid injection and have been able to resume physio and walking short distances 5 to 10 min much better than the 1 min I was at. Before it if I tried physio or moved to much it just flared up my sciatica nerve more but was still told to do everything that made it worse as if I was being lazy, I was just taking more and more pain meds.  

Also can relate to the wheelchair thing a bit. I have been using wheelchair when going out as otherwise I would be house bound. The physio said I needed to stop using it. When I asked why she said I need to stand and walk more. I said I want too and that I walk behind the wheelchair when I can but without it I would just not go out as my pain can go from 1 to 10 in seconds, I have nearly passed out before and have ended up lying on the floor when out. She seemed to think I was using it to avoid walking. If anything I'm using it so I can have more options to walk and stand. My motivation to walk and stand at home is low but at least if I'm out I am happier and able to deal with my pain better, depression definitely makes my pain worse.  I am more likely to try short periods of standing and walking if have wheelchair as backup. Also another interesting bit of advice was stand and walk as much as possible but listen to your body and stop if pain is getting worse. I was thinking that is why I use the wheelchair but apparently I have to stop using it.  I should add I like my physio and I'm sure she deals with lazy people, she does not know me so I do understand her bias. She never says it in a mocking way, more try and do this I think it would be best. So I think sometimes doctors just have a bias especially if not specialised as see all sorts. However they should at least listen and do the relevant referral to an appropriate specialist without being directly rude and mocking.

Also another story I went to a follow-up to my injection have had 3 in total now. When getting the last one my consultant admitted to me that he thought I needed surgery when I first saw him (wish he had told me at the time) and that is the best option if this one does not work. Anyway he was to busy when I came for follow-up and so saw someone else in his team. I told him despite feeling a little better I can feel the injection wearing off. I had lots of questions about surgery outcomes and options. He could not answer any of them. I kept saying the pain despite being better is still really bad. Anyway he said come back in a month.  I was not happy and complained at reception that I wanted to see my consultant, they agreed and put me in a room next to his.  We heard the doctor I had just seen talking to him, apparently I was happy and ""pain free"". My consultant sounded a bit confused and said last time I saw me he said I needed surgery.  I was so annoyed that he had not even listened to me and would say I was pain free.  

TL;DR
So yeah some doctors are great, some medical people are good but bias and some doctors are just arse holes who do not listen. I hope you get a better consultant soon or he will come around, all doctors have bad days but his remarks were not acceptable in this instance. ",,,6,0,0,

Hell, you could use it just to go 10 feet and it should not be a problem, because it's 100% your decision when to use it based solely upon how you feel in that moment. 

And BTW - yes, using your scooter when you're unfamiliar with a route and unaware how far the distance may be is not only a perfectly fine situation in which to use it, it's also a **very smart** decision for you to make. Other people don't know the consequences you would face should you get stuck on a long walk without your scooter, and I doubt they would come help you if you found yourself in trouble as a result. So they have zero say about your using your scooter in such a situation.

But I do realize that my reaction to your post may be tainted by my own personal experiences in similar situations. I don't have a scooter, but I have a wheelchair which I didn't always use back when I still had some abilities in my legs and could walk short distances. 

I had run-ins with people I didn't know who said I didn't need a wheelchair, their opinions based solely upon the fact I was a 28-year-old person, therefore I couldn't have needed a wheelchair! Ugh. (I'm currently 30, so this was quite recently.) And that's not even including the people who would berate me for using handicapped parking despite my handicapped placard solely because, again, there were some days when I didn't need to use my wheelchair.

But while inwardly I like to rant and rave against such people with silent middle fingers and inaudible swearing, I've always found that outwardly killing them with kindness is the best way to make them feel embarrassed for what they've done or make them reassess their assumptions/judgments or even just to shut them up. (Granted, some people are just horrible people and won't feel badly for their words/actions no matter what, but most people realized their insensitivity, I found.)

All that to say, I feel for you, OP. I'm sorry there are people who feel it's their place to judge your physical abilities without any foreknowledge; but please keep your head up, and feel free to use your scooter as often or as sparsely as you deem necessary.

I was just surprised, but I think your observations are probably correct.  I figured everybody here would have developed a certain level of compassion after their experiences but there was some blowback.

Frankly, the reason that most of my problems are niche, even for medical professionals, is the reason I don't think I would ever be awarded benefits.  

So much of it is just luck too.  I have worked in a disability law firm for sometime.  You can tell by reading the files and knowing the judges preferences and thought patterns how likely you are to be ""disabled"".

And honestly I don't know if that term even fits me long term.  But I know my problems get in the way of my production constantly.  So much so that I feel like I need a safety net or I would be in serious trouble.  Today, I am certainly disabled, but I pray I can figure out a way to cope with these issues or some of them clear up.

As far as depression goes and attitude, etc.  To me, that seems really unanswerable.  I know it gets in the way often, but beyond that I really can't say.  It's just all these problems coming together that I find that most of the time I can't seem to manage.

In a street chair your seat is parallel to the ground or slightly tilted, in a rugby chair it's a bucket seat right into the chair, you're buckled in and you tend to put your arms out when you fall.

This isn't an option for quads or anyone else with low trunk or arm function, but assuming your wife has a solid upper half she can learn to navigate cracks, drain covers and so on in a rolling wheelie - where you tip the front castors up off the ground and keep moving forward on your back wheels.  

The Freewheel /u/ad247314-ba2a-4a9e-a21e-b2a1cc8a8de3 listed is a way of causing this rolling wheelie without having to hold yourself up. It's a great bit of kit but it does have some drawbacks - it makes your turning circle absolutely massive, it's more weight on the chair and it lowers your general manoeuvrability. When I go hiking I use the Freewheel with two mountain bike tyres on the back wheels and it does a great job over long-term rough terrain. Woodland, bark, gravel, mud, wet sand, general rough stony ground. For urban areas though I will always use my street wheels and bump over cracks on the back wheels rather than using the Freewheel.

What kind of chair does she have at the moment? That also makes a difference on how easy she will find it to bump over bumps and cracks. To answer your question, there is only one chair I know of with a back castor and it's the [Mountain Trike](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluebadgestyle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F06%2Fpost-7229-070073300-1283257040.jpg&amp;f=1), for true off road terrain.

Crutches are hell on the arms over long periods but like wheelchair use it's something you can build up to, particularly if it's just for travelling rather than long term. It's difficult to get good exercise with a disability and I find it helpful to get it through mobility aid use if possible! There are various grips and attachements that can make crutch use more comfortable, when I used them I had moulded hand grips and different tips which both make a huge difference in terms of stability and arm strain.

These are very much an individual thing and I'd strongly advise she try them out in a showroom first. 

You say she has very little upper body strength. Is that something she's interested in changing? If she's happy with you pushing her on trips she won't ever really need it, but if she likes to use crutches or would ever like to push her own chair it makes a huge difference. Personally I fucking love speeding along in my wheelchair, and I love the muscle on my arms and core. My shitty body has often made me feel weak and feeble, and it's an incredible feeling to zoom along the pavement or bump along a rough track. Plus biceps for days!

You say she has a traditional chair that's crazy heavy, so I'm assuming it's one of [these](http://www.dreams.metroeve.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Wheelchair.jpg) big bastards. They're cheap and okay as transport chairs, but heavy, clunky and don't turn well. Have you ever looked at an [active user chair](http://www.azarim.org.il/SiteCollectionImages/products/manual_wheelchairs/active_user_wheelchairs/126734lp.jpg)? This is what every full time wheelchair user should have and for good reason. The wheels sit further forward on the chair which affects your centre of gravity and causes you to 'tip' easier. Some models can be adjusted to try different levels of tippiness and see what works. This is really designed so a self-propell user can get themselves up and down from a wheelie, but it also works from an attendant propelled perspective.

Personally I like a very tippy chair, as it's easier to push and makes tipping into a wheelie much easier - good for going over cracks and getting up and down kerbs without a kerb cut. As a user tippy is more dangerous as it means you're more likely to fall over backwards, there are anti-tip devices available but I always found them to be so restrictive for getting up kerbs they were useless. However with an attendant this wouldn't be a problem, you could tip as far as you like, have the large back wheels to miss obstacles, and still have her completely supported.

Now active user chairs are really fucking expensive. My current chair was around 2.5k (GBP, not USD). That said, there is a huge market in used active user chairs and they generally go for a few hundred around me. Occasionally you will see one free. Active users are custom made to fit and don't keep value but as your wife would not be using it full time it wouldn't need to be an exact fit. Additionally if you are using it as a transport chair that gives you a lot of leeway in terms of size. Most of the concern for fit is around the ergonomics of someone pushing all day, every day and the strain that puts on their shoulders and back, which is not an issue for someone in a transport chair.

The one issue you might have is that backs on active user chairs are very low to allow for free arm movement, which is a problem for someone tall pushing. However there are extenders available, or it would be easy to make your own assuming you have access to a metalshop.

I would say that in general going for a larger wheel rather than changing the position of the castors is the way I would go, but I'm no engineer! From a pushing perspective I'd want the front castors lifted for manouverability and use of the rear wheels with perhaps one large back castor rather than back castors. Actually just how the Mountain Trike has it now I think on it. From an attendant perspective I'd look at using the big back wheels to my advantage, as they're the ones great at going over cracks and also the ones that act as shock absorbers and make the ride more pleasant. 

When you do have a tip and she falls out of the chair, why is that? Does the whole chair fall over, or does she just pitch out with the jolt while you keep hold of the chair? If the latter, have you considered a seatbelt? I use one on my chair when going on really bumpy ground and it gives me the chance to right myself without flying right out.",,,3,0,0,
e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1503748524,"Aw thank you. I found when I started using a chair there was a lot to learn and no-one to ask, my doctor just kind of gave me the chair and sent me off. It was really hard to begin with so if I can help someone else skip that bit I will!

Honestly, she needs to get some upper body strength now. When her leg is bad enough that she has to use a chair full time, she'll find it hard because she'll have to learn to use the chair with no breaks. If you can do it in staged learning it's much better as you're not tiring yourself out all the time. It is also going to wreck **your** shoulders and back to push someone consistently even over short breaks.

It's not about working out necessarily, even just doing a daily walk/roll to the shop on crutches/in a wheelchair would help her build some muscle. Exercise in general is just so important for those with disabilities, we as a group get less in general and good cardiovascular health can help with compensating for broken bits. Is there any sport she would be interested in, even for the social aspect? I have am acquaintance with a high level amputation and he does adapted rock climbing, great for your arms and climbing is an incredibly social sport. 

What a lot of ladies worry about is becoming overly muscular, but that's definitely not going to happen unless you're gymming it up. I swim or gym a couple of days a week and have a pullup bar at home as well as regularly doing half-marathon distances in my chair. I am not bulky at all, I have defined muscle when I tense my arms and back but no-one would ever mistake me for a bodybuilder lol.

Anyway I won't go on about it. Exercise is important, if you can get her building some muscle it would help her, but I completely appreciate that some people just aren't interested and nothing will budge em.

Re rough ground and bleeding, which cushion does she have at the moment? The comfort in a chair can be drastically improved by a decent cushion, especially for prosthetics patients who like you say, can be very rough and sore by the time they are sitting down. Although a cushion adds bulk, it is very light (depending on material) and can be fitted with velcro to stick onto the chair/frame so that it can be easily carried on the folded frame. 

Yes this is the problem with active user chairs, the frame is generally a fixed frame and doesn't fold. The more foldable joints you have in a chair the less energy efficient it is as the energy is lost through the joints with movement. This makes it harder to push for the attendant and much more uncomfortable for the rider. The trade off is that an active user chair is bulky, so even though they are light (my chair is under 10kg including wheel, lighter wheels make make it around 7.5) the shape of them makes them difficult to carry. Not a problem for most people who, when they use it, are sat in it the full time. 

Re the telescoping frame - neat idea, but remember your wife's legs will go over that bend. If you extend the frame out too much she's going to end up with her knee bent up higher which I personally find very uncomfortable over bumps. YMMV. Putting the wheels further back on the frame will make it less tippy (so harder for you) and further forward will make it more tippy.


You may also want to look at the bucket of the seat, sometimes called the dump. Basically what angle your seat is tilted from front to back. My bucket is minimal, as I have good trunk support and push hard. Your wife may be more comfortable with more of an angle to her seat as she is a rider and it may help with the jolts she's getting out of the chair. Your backrest angle and height is important too - if you make your backrest lean further back (more open) the chair will be more tippy. As a user a high bucket angle will also affect your tippiness but I don't think that matters so much with an attendant propelled.

It seems you're looking at something similar to the Mountain Trike, I believe they use disk brakes on their wheels. Just out of curiosity, do you need to use brakes much? I don't think I understand what you mean about axle contact points...active user chairs and many standard chairs operate with quick-release wheels, where they clip right into the end of the axle. You then just push a button and yank it off again. Very quick, very good for getting in and out of cars and taxis. 

I have been to Rome and lived in Edinburgh, both cobble central. The best way to deal with them is (sorry) to tip as a practised user and watch where you're going. When you know your chair and how it handles you can adjust your positioning, lean into one side, take the weight off when you go over a crack with one wheel etc. That's something no attendant can ever imitate I'm afraid. The Freewheel works on cobbles but with it on you can't jump up high kerbs without taking it off, something also common in old cities. It clips on and off easily but I find it a pain in the ass personally. 

How about a pretty seatbelt cover? Again I completely understand this, I might like hiking and getting muddy but I also like to go out on a date in a dress and makeup and have often felt less feminine in my chair. Nowadays I sparkle that shit up, it gets decorated for holidays and I have covers for the frame to match outfits. The blue sections can become red or silvery or whatever I fancy that day.

I took some pics of my chair so you can get the idea of it folded and with the Freewheel, if you're like any close-up pics let me know. My hands shake so they're not the clearest but I hope you get the idea. Fluffs for scale, they wouldn't get out of frame so I gave up.

Doctors are concerned that people give up walking when it is hard. This is a fine line for doctors and patients. For some people the doctor has to push them to walk and the patient has to push themselves. For others they will do even more than they can and they need to be reminded to not walk. My wife pushes, she will push herself to the breaking point. So my job *in this situation* is to remind her that she can take the chair, that she can take a day of bed rest, that it is OK to accept the disability for the momen.

Thanks so much for sharing your story. Really interesting to hear about the BDSM scene and how it has helped you. I'd be interested in my character exploring such options herself. Whether it's for her or not etc.

Little things like the railing thing, and other every day occurrences people might not be aware of are really helpful to know. I want to depict those annoyances realistically.

Stares of strangers I can almost relate to, as I did have to use a wheelchair for an extended period of time as a child. It doesn't count, as I knew it was a temporary thing, but I still remember the stares. 

I can imagine having people noticing your disability first is incredibly annoying. I'll be including this sort of ignorance in my script, and it will be a regular point of frustration for my lead character, who just wants to get on with her life, and hates to be defined by her disability.

I can imagine that people being unintentionally insulting is a regular thing.

My wife was approved for SSI as a teenager (in 1994) after her first bipolar mania episode, but she was hospitalized for quite a while and was very close to being referred to a long-term psychiatric facility.  You can do a Google search for the SSA Bluebook and look at the listings for his particular disorders to see how his documented symptoms compare to the SSA requirements.  If you think that they meet or exceed the listing, ask your attorney if he or she thinks an on the record decision, where the judge reviews the file prior to the hearing, would be appropriate.

An attorney is essential for the hearing, but try to stay informed about his case.  I think that most attorneys want to get you approved, but always remember that they work for you and you are likely one of many cases they are handling.  I was initially denied, but I realized that all of my records weren't used in the decision.  I called my attorney for advice and was told to ""file a request for reconsideration.""  Instead, I called the Disability Determination Services office myself and brought the mistake to their attention.  Two weeks later, I was approved.

f9f54438-f5c9-44db-bfb1-2937dd5d89a7,1503929228,"It can get complicated working while on SSI.  SSI is reduced by earnings, and once earnings reach a certain level, the benefit ceases.  As an incentive to work, a certain amount of income is excluded from the calaculation.  For example, if she made $500 a month from her job,  the first $65 would be exempt (general and earned income exemption), bringing her earned income down to $435.  Next, she would divide her earned income in half (435/2=217.5), but we'll round up to $218.  You would subtract this $218 from the amount of her SSI benefit, which is $735 plus any applicable state supplements.  So her benefit would be at least $517.  Added together with her wages, she would have $1017 of income vs. $735, so while her benefit would be reduced, her overall income would increase.

That's on paper, but it's very complicated.  You can hear a gamut of opinions on working while receiving SSI ranging from from it's perfectly ok to work and earn up to a certain amount to horror stories where folks needed to repay several months of benefits.  I know from personal experience because my wife received SSI for bipolar disorder back when we were in college.  I got a part-time paid internship right before I graduated, so I reported my change of income to the SSA.  Seven months later we received a letter saying her benefits had ceased and we needed to repay 6 months of benefits.  Luckily, I had a gut feeling that would happen so we hadn't cashed any of the checks from the previous months.  I feel my wife may have been cheated out those benefits because I didn't know enough about the regulations, and between work and finishing my degree, didn't invest the effort to educate myself. 

My suggestion would be to contact the local SSA office and ask a caseworker.  Take meticulous notes.  Ask to be referred to a specialist who deals in helping recipients return to work.  Compare what they tell you to what the case worker said.  There are several sites like NOLO that have extensive articles on issues like working while disabled.

If that's not an option, you might be able to find free treatment through the local health department.  At a last resort, many hospitals have charity programs, but that would require going to the ER first and getting referred to their network of providers.  

SSA likes medical records within the past 90-120 days because they reflect your current condition.  You are trying to prove that despite treatment, you are still unable to work due to your conditions.  It's daunting, especially for someone with mental illness (my wife has bipolar I), but it's the process that you need to go through to seek benefits.

You will also receive backpay back to your onset date (or up to 12 retroactivelymonths should the medical evidence prove you were disabled prior to applying) should your SSDI case take longer than 5 months to determine (or appeal).

The only way you could receive more backpay would be to appeal your SSDI decision and argue that our onset date is earlier than your application date (or alleged onset date).

	SEPTEMBER 11, 2015 by: Markus Häusling as told to David Vajda
I had already been working as a prison guard for five years at a high-security prison in Kassel, Germany, when I was confined to a wheelchair for life because of a rare autoimmune disease. When I called the prison director just before the end of my physical rehabilitation therapy, I expected to hear two words: early retirement. They were never said, and I was back at work a month later.

I started with administrative tasks and then slowly moved back to working with the prisoners. The prison couldn’t hire anyone else to compensate for my limited working hours, so my colleagues put in extra shifts to make sure I could keep my job.

As Kassel prisoners mostly serve long terms for offences such as rape, murder and terrorism, most of the inmates already knew me from before. Contrary to my worries, they reacted to my disability with reservation and even fear. The closest I got to a confrontation with a prisoner was when I was rolling through the deserted old wing by myself one day, and an inmate appeared out of nowhere and blocked the way. “What would you do if I took you hostage right now?” he asked. Adrenaline shot through my body, as my mouth spurted out words. “I doubt I’d be a good hostage,” I replied. “Firstly, I wouldn’t shield your chest, so you’d be an easy target for the snipers on the towers. Secondly, you’d have to push the wheelchair with one hand and hold your weapon with the other — we’d go around in circles like a spinning top. And, thirdly, if I toppled over, you definitely wouldn’t be able to carry me.” He went pretty quiet after that.


Markus Häusling is in training for next year’s Paralympics
For technical reasons, I don’t do some day-to-day ward services, such as checking on inmates in their cells, because some of the corridors are too narrow for my wheelchair. But I supervise when the prisoners work at our in-prison factory facilities and in the bakery, which is right next to my office. If they get permission, prisoners can come straight in and ask me about work-related issues. My role includes setting wages and deciding on disciplinary action if prisoners don’t stick to the rules.

My paralysis started in 2004, when I was in goal at an amateur football club. I suddenly stopped feeling my legs for a moment and stumbled over. I didn’t make much of it and put the incident down to lack of sleep — the night shifts got to me sometimes. But it happened again at work a month later and then my symptoms got worse and worse. In 2005, the doctors diagnosed me with a rare disease of the central nervous system. Even today, no one knows with certainty what caused the nerve infection but it was most likely a contaminated needle used when I was vaccinated.

At that moment, it all seemed very evident to me: I would lose my job; I wouldn’t be able to pay back my debts; my wife would leave me; my family would fall apart. On November 21 2005, I slowly rolled my wheelchair on to the balcony of my hospital room, hauled myself over the railing with my arms, and let go. However, the hospital psychiatrists had noticed my suicidal tendencies weeks before and had moved me to a room with a safety net beneath the balcony. It was my family’s unconditional support that helped me pull myself out of this hopeless phase in my life.

The prisoners respect me even more because of my sporting success. I took up cycling with a hand-powered bike to be able to go cycling with my sons and, in 2008, I started training professionally. About three years later, I moved on to paratriathlon and have won the German championships nine times over different distances. I’ve come second in the European championships and I’m training for next year’s Paralympics in Rio.

One of the prisoners once said: “We’re both on national television, mate — you’re in the sports news, and I’m on Crimewatch.”

They cannot turn you away and, no matter how long the wait is for others, I've always gotten in through the ER in about 10 to 20 minutes. Suicidal persons are treated as high-risk patients and are seen in short order. ",,,3,0,0,

Because you're being so blase about death, I feel like you should seek emergency help. There are many free services that can help you with suicidal ideations even if you do not have insurance. The National Suicide Helpline (US) can be reached by calling this number: 1-800-273-8255 

I used to be suicidal and have spent a few months (collectively) in the mental hospital over the past several years. While it didn't *fix* my problems, it gave me time to reflect on the direction of my life and what had ultimately lead me to feel suicidal. For me, it was always about a loss of control. I would toy with the idea of death when I was in severe physical or emotional pain that had no end in sight, when everything seemed hopeless, when no light at the end of the proverbial tunnel could be seen. When I was forced to take stock of my life I found that I had actually had it pretty good despite some very horrible things that have happened to me (rape, abuse, chronic illness, etcetera). 

It's also worth noting, out of practicality, that your suicide attempt may fail. A good friend of mine botched her attempt and ended up in a coma. When she woke up she had some pretty severe brain damage. Others have jumped from high places and survived only to become paralysed or mutilated. If you have the stomach for it, /r/watchpeopledie is actually a pretty damned good deterrent for those contemplating ending their lives. I sometimes still get suicidal thoughts and WPD absolutely slaps me the fuck out of that. The community is also pretty supportive and awesome which surprised me.  

As for hating yourself for your disability, I know what you mean. I feel so limited sometimes that I just don't know what the hell to do with myself. I can go some time feeling ""normal"" and then suddenly one of my casters gets caught in a doorway that I was, until that moment, navigating through quite independently. It's humiliating to get stuck on a fucking door jamb that I would've stepped over if I'd been walking like a ""normal"" person. Then people try to help and just make it worse. 

Disability doesn't have an age restriction or a certain visual criteria. If you use a mobility device, are younger than 70, and aren't missing parts of your body you are probably going to get rude people saying strange shit about you. It's just how it is and it totally sucks. I had to come to accept that I need my wheelchair and everyone else can go suck an egg with their stupid opinions. That helped me a lot. The art of not giving a fuck is really hard to master but, once you do, you can put snarky jerks in their place (or just ignore them-- that works too). I'm still very worried about what people think of me but, in reality, most people just assume that I'm paralysed and leave off. I load and unload my manual wheelchair from my car myself so I'm sure that there are plenty of people in the parking lot watching me do this who either want to congratulate me for being ""inspiring"" or ""amazing"" or who want to yell at me for being a ""pretender"" or whatever. They can think what they want. I've got 99 problems and their opinion ain't one. 



Please please *please* go call that number (here it is again: 1-800-273-8255) and get some help with this downward spiral you're on. I would hate for you to give up hope especially since there are some really great psychiatric drugs and techniques to help with suicidality. Be good to yourself and take care of *you.*",,,10,0,0,

Also, in the US, most companies can't really refuse to hire you because of your mobility status. I mean, *obviously* if you apply to be a construction worker the company is not going to be able to hire you. But if you apply at Home Depot they can definitely find something for you like working at the information desk or in the Tool Corral.

It should say Social Security on it. I believe all my mail came from there. 

I understand. I live with emotional/verbal abuse. I got denied initially, got approved 2 years later. Now I'm on the wait list for public housing so I can finally get out of this toxic environment. 

My parents are the same. My mom says she wishes she didn't have to work. My parents expect me to do all their stuff. They act as if I'm perfectly fine, just that I dont work so I should be doing all their stuff for them. It's hard when your own family doesn't believe how much you're struggling. 

Honestly, I don't think it's something you can keep from them. Unless you drive yourself to appointments and get the mail before them all the time.

2ac304c7-2647-401b-882a-1b648b9c18f9,1502064597,"So, I went on a trip last week to Europe. Took 3 flights to get there, and 3 flights back. The trip went well, and I had very few accessibility issues around Europe (on crutches though -- different story if I were in a chair). 

On the return leg, I had two layovers -- one in a major European hub, and another in a major American hub (keeping some details out, as this may become a legal thing and I want to keep it anonymous).

When checking in at my initial airport, the lady at the ticketing counter said she did not see wheelchair / assistance on my record, even though, during booking, I made it very clear I needed assistance at each stop. I also made it very clear during booking, that I needed an aisle seat, with my left leg towards the aisle. I paid extra for the middle-class seats with extra legroom, so I could (1) have the extra legroom, and (2) select a specific seat so I knew I would have extra legroom, with my leg in the aisle. The lady at the desk said it shouldn't be a problem, easy to add the note, and even double checked all of my seat assignments all the way through to my destination.

So, I get to the European hub. As we are descending, the flight attendant tells me to wait until everyone is off the plane before getting off. Our plane was parked far from the terminal. There was a stair car to get off the plane, and a bus to get to the terminal. It was raining slightly, and the metal staircase was slick. I waited as instructed, and some airport attendants came down the aisle with a specialized wheelchair, that not only squeezed down the aisle, but also rolled down the steps off the plane. The bus had already left, and in its place was a van marked ""Assistance"". Two employees made sure I got off the plane with all of my stuff, and got to the terminal. Once there, I was loaded onto a golf cart, and we hauled ass across the airport. We went through a side hallway, through a separate customs checkpoint just for us, and all the way to my gate. They made sure I had food and had used the bathroom, and got me from the seat on the old plane, all the way to the seat on the new plane. 10/10, would recommend going through them again. 

Then came the flight into the US. I verified with the gate agents, and again with the flight attendants after boarding, that I would have assistance waiting for me when I arrived. I had a decently long layover, and figured I would be good to go. 

The plane lands, and everyone gets off... And I wait. And wait. Finally, the flight attendant who's clearing the cabin asks why I'm waiting. Mind you, this is the same attendant I spoke to before we departed, who assured me assistance would be waiting. It wasn't. She denied having ever spoken with me. I collect my carry on backpack and my crutches, and hop up the ramp to the gate agent. The gate agent says it doesn't call for assistance anywhere on my record (I show her my boarding pass, which clearly indicates it). She reluctantly calls for a wheelchair, which I have to wait for. 

The wheelchair comes, and I'm told we have to go to customs. Cool, no problem. They wheel me to the Customs agent, who essentially interrogates me about my travels for a good 10 mins (look, buddy, I'm traveling on military orders, and was visiting a fellow NATO country, and I'm in a God damn wheelchair. I don't exactly scream ""terrorist""). After customs, I have to go through TSA screening. I have TSA pre-check, and doctors orders telling me not to bear weight on my left leg. The TSA agent immediately tells me to take off my shoe and cast, get out of the chair, and walk through the scanner. I legitimately ask him to repeat himself, thinking it's some kind of joke. But no, he wants me to *remove my God damned cast* (which is a removable, hard plastic air cast, but I'm not supposed to walk without it), and walk through the scanner. I explain again that I cannot physically do this. The airline representative pushing the wheelchair asks if I'm able to walk through with the crutches. The TSA agent says that, since my crutches and boot have already been cleared, they can't come back through the scanner, because of ""the rules"". Painfully, I get myself out of the chair, and hop on one leg through the scanner. After this, I'm told I've been ""randomly selected"" for additional screening. I hop my way to the side, and stand on one leg while a TSA agent pats me down. When he gets to my injured leg, he very roughly grabs it with both hands, and squeezes and twists around, causing me extreme pain. 

Once that nightmare was over, I had to collect my bags and get them checked back in. The airline representative is useless, and I have to haul my bag from the floor into my lap. I get wheeled to the baggage / check-in, and drop my stuff off. I'm informed of a seat change, but I'm assured it's identical to my old seat. The airline agent wheels me to my gate, and drops be off. Before leaving, I'm told the gate agents will assist me further if I need to get food, use the restroom, etc. I transfer out of the wheelchair and into the waiting area chairs. Eventually, I have to use the restroom and eat. So I hop (on crutches) to the gate agent to ask about assistance. She tells me that they're only required to escort me from gate to gate, and that there's nothing she can do for me. Tired and defeated, I return to my waiting room seat hungry. Luckily the restroom is around the corner, so that need is fulfilled. 

After a few more hungry hours waiting, it's finally time to start pre-boarding. I collect my things and head down the bridge. Once on the plane, it's fairly obvious that my new seat assignment is not in the middle-class seating, but regular coach. While my left leg will still be towards the aisle, there's not nearly enough legroom to fit the cast behind the seat in front of me. 

I make my way back to the front, and let the flight attendant know about the issue. She says I have to go all the way back to the gate agent. I plead, and she calls the gate agent instead (I did not want to have to hop all the way back up the ramp). The gate agent informs us that the flight is completely booked, and there's nothing they can do to help me. She tells me I can call customer service when I arrive home. 

Reluctantly, I go sit back down, with my foot awkwardly lying in the aisle. At this time, general boarding has begun. As the masses start to hoard, literally everyone sitting in the rows behind me either (1) kicks my leg, (2) trips over it, (3) slams their suitcase into it, or (4) some combination of the above. By now, I'm in a lot of pain. I wait until everyone has surely seated, before attempting to reach my carry on to get pain meds. But, I'm immediately told that the cabin door has been closed, and I need to remain seated. I ask the attendant if he can retrieve my meds for me, but I'm told airline policy prohibits him from going into passenger's luggage. Finally, we reach cruising altitude, but we're expecting turbulence, so I'm told again, I cannot access my medications. At this point, I'm in tears, in extreme pain, with nothing I can do about it. I'm sitting there, foot out, face buried in my hands, when suddenly I feel an impact, followed by a lot of pain, followed by another impact, then another. I look up, to see the flight attendant, absent-mindedly ramming the beverage cart into my leg, thinking it must be stuck on something. I yell in pain. The attendant tells me that's what I get for having my foot in the aisle, and that I should pay more attention to where my limbs are. This happens for the two other beverage carts coming down the aisle, as well as the garbage cart... And again when the four carts return to the front. 

When I arrive at my destination, there's no wheelchair assistance waiting for me at the gate. I hop my way all the way to baggage claim, and thankfully find a complete stranger to help me collect my bag. I get the stranger to help me outside to a bench, and call for a ride home. 

On Tuesday, I contacted customer service. They told me there was absolutely nothing they could or would do, since I booked the flights through a partner. When I contacted the partner I hooked through, they said there's nothing they can do, since the flight wasn't one of their flights, but actually one of the main partner's flights.

When she lost her leg she was pretty determined to make prosthetics work, so while many inclines, mildly rough ground, etc are just impossible (she has no muscles able to help left in the bit of leg she has, so she's mainly swinging her waist to throw the leg forward, lean on, repeat), she prefers wrist crutches over the chair when she can't use that, and really has very little upper body strength, as I haven't seen her use a self propelled chair the last 2 years or more. So to handle distance we usually use one of these https://media.medmartonline.com/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/o/rollz-rollator-medmartonline-side-view-of-wheelchair.jpg and she also has a crazy heavy traditional chair that's just too big to take on a flight or bring around, but that thing (triumph mobility rollz transport chair) is super light and folds so tiny, we did 7 countries in europe last year on it being tucked into tiny places, it was great except the wheels catching. So we'll be a bit stuck with me pushing for the forseeable future. I tried to use her heavier traditional chair, but with its 3inch caster wheels it was so much worse and caught every little thing on rougher roads.

My hope with back castors mainly was if they drag sideways it's not going to tuck under on her and kick her over the front. At the front if they grab all the momentum will tip her, at the back if they catch the momentum will cause a hop but I don't think that's gunna knock her out as most of her weight will already be past the obstacle, as opposed to all her weight tripping on it. I was also thinking I could put a small guide rail ahead of the rear castor that anything big like a tree root or rock could slide against first before making wheel contact, so if a surface makes contact it won't be with the middle of the flat face of the wheel, but lower on the tire itself, thinking easier to deflect. If I'm pushing I was hoping for a wheelbarrow like effect, big fixed wheel takes the bumps and stays the course, I push and pivot on them. Since posting I found some walkers with rear castors, wondering if the dynamics of that will carry to this. Thanks for posting that, minus a way to push and thinking about how my walking feet will clear the back castor that looks pretty amazing.

We don't have medicaid in Canada, but as my wife can do some distance on a prosthetic she opted for that instead of govt wheelchair funding as they covered more of the former. Been trying to look but some of the ones that sorta look like they'd work cost thousands, and the Canadian dollar doesn't buy much in USD, figured I'd try my hand at building my own, been learning CAD the last 2 months, actual progress amazingly, hopefully ordering carbon fibre tubes in a few weeks, the bare materials aren't really so expensive, but I know being non-adjustable this whole frame will very much be a ""hope it fits right"" scenario.

With crutches (the forearm kind) she's decent for the short bits too rough for the chair sometimes, she's done big (like basketball big) stone fields on her crutches while i am following carrying the chair (light chairs help a lot, I can fold the one we have and i made backpack type straps i can lug it around a few kms easy and hands free), but it's more of a half km-ish limit with her. She sadly has almost no interest in the upper body strength part, she's been tiny and skinny her whole life, working out she seems to dislike, some things are hard to change, probably until she can't use the leg most of the time anymore she won't bother. That lighter chair i linked is actually a 2-in-1 rollator and transport chair, she won't use it for the former, very much ripping at the skin issue overall, as she has a really short residual limb the prosthetic socket is right up so high to get a grip that the entire top edge except the front pretty much grinds against her skin. On flat repetitive ground and slow speed it's ok 1-2 kms a day of gentle indoor walking, but the jolting and uneven movements of rough ground, since she has no muscles able to do any fine tuning movement, will make her bleed after 2+kms of walking on cobblestone streets or dirt, etc etc. I want to take her out, must be a chair, I must be pushing. Tis life.

Yup you got it, one of those big crappy chairs. I looked at the active chairs, look good, but ya expensive, will look online used again. Size is often a problem, saw a few that don't fold down well, she's from overseas and we take a lot of flights, hoping for something folding, after another used posted the ""compass"" reverse castor chair I found some bad reviews of the design, so thinking maybe work on adjustable front castor forks, so on rougher trips I can extend them out to get the effect of the clip on wheel jjay posted. Looking at a chair like this http://imagelibrary.sunrisemedical.com/asset-bank/images/assets/3201-3300/3266/22_5R_BackrestFoldedDown_O_01.jpg right now, found some detailed CAD files someone already made, so looking at how to make a latching pivot at the main bend for the castors/footrest, and make it telescoping so on rough ground i can have the longer wheel base to stop tipping. And yes as you said, add decent push bars for me, and since I have a bit of background in bike parts I'm looking at hubs that accept bike disc brakes, as I'll be the one needing brake control from behind. Looking at building axle contact points into the back and bottom of the seat so i can unsnap those big wheels and tip them inline with the folded frame, this should be fun.

The problem mainly stems of me pushing and not always seeing the small cracks and things, when we did europe the rough streets (think rome... damn you rome...) the front castors would catch, turn sideways, and just bite right in with the side of the wheel facing forward into some obstacle, tipping the chair forward. Tons of times I saw the holes and cracks and tipped onto the back wheels, but when everywhere is rough roads it was just too common. Maybe I'll experiment with more extreme castor rake angles to see if they have a harder time catching sideways? I need to make wood models for trials... SO many things to build now...

I don't know, I just have noticed that people have a real difficulty reconciling disability and sexuality.

I don't mind curiosity, and I don't mind my friends asking, it is the fact it is within such a short time of meeting me that freaks me out. 

I decided if I was going to have sticks, they would be awesome and co-ordinated like an accessory. It has helped people out as they don't automatically assume because of my age I had a brief accident as opposed to a life long disease. People get that it is a long term thing because I invested in the aids. No boring black or hospital crutches. I have a couple of floral ones in various bright colours, an Irish shalelie stock carved from wood, a silver one I used at a wedding, and a white one with a blue design. I have my eye on a red one with small white polka dots. Most of my sticks fold, but I don't need that function anymore as I use them all the time.

Then there were those who you could tell were asking questions because they saw I use the stick on the other side yesterday or didn't use it last week and are trying to 'catch me out' and admit I wasn't actually disabled. I now use the stick non stop so this doesn't happen as much, but I have an otherwise invisible illness so it happens. 

It helps as well that my friends get annoyed on my behalf. We were viewing student houses one year and the estate agent was lovely in the shop, and then we stood up to get into the car and go view some properties and he saw the stick- from that point he stopped talking to me, and referred all questions about me to my friends (can she handle those stairs, is she going to be alright with an upstairs bathroom) as if my brain suddenly stopped working when he realised my legs don't and my friends immediately became my carers. Some people are weird, and it was kinda nice to see my friends lose their temper and refuse to get any house through that agency while I sort of shrugged it off.

Honestly to be disabled I feel like you need to build good wit for responses to dumbass questions, and if you approach everything with a good sense of humour you will be fine.

 Most people have cell phones and I have one through ATT go phone with unlimited talk and text all over the USA. Having cheap phone plans help save some of your money for other expenses.
Everyone needs something for entertainment: So I have Netflix and Hulu. Both are cheaper than cable or Dish or Direct tv. You can see all you need to see or want to see through streaming.
If you have it in your budget see about getting a computer it could be desk top of lap top. Having a computer gives you some other choices for entertainment like watching Youtube or looking at all that Reddit has to offer. When its close to the end of the month see how much you have left after paying ALL your bills. Whatever is left over don't touch it and hold it til the next month. You will have a small cushion to fall on in case something like car repairs and so on happen. 
This is all I can think of based on what I do to live in my apartment. I haven't ever been late on rent or my electric bills. I hope this gives you some ideas to see what direction you can go in.
Good Luck!",,,2,0,0,

The OAB means I have frequent urges to go and half of the time they pass without any issues and other times it really means I need to go so it is difficult for me to know. Unless it was absolutely necessary I would much rather wear incontinence protection then self-cath. I've tried laying off caffiene and watching what I ate and drank but didn't notice any change. I've read that emptying your bladder frequently when it isn't full can cause to even more issues with leaking as it can cause the bladder to get weaker and not as used to holding as much urine and cause more leaking, not sure how true that is but also do to my schedule and other issues it also difficult for me to stay on top of a schedule for it.

Typically I get enough warning before an accident that I can use a toilet so I use pull on protection and for that I don't need a handicapped toilet but when I am going to be in a situation where I won't be able to use a restroom for a while, most notably when I fly places but also in other situations I wear a heavy plastic backed diaper in case I have accidents. Both putting on and taking off a diaper is basically impossible in a normal sized stall so I use a handicapped stall in that situation or preferably a private or family bathroom because being a otherwise healthy college male I hate the idea of others hearing me changing such as the plastic crinkling as I unfold it and the sound of me tearing tapes and also I don't want to have to walk to the trash by everyone carrying a soaked diaper. Back to my point though, I always feel nervous that someone else who needs the handicap restroom will walk in needing to use the stall or family restroom while I am changing. I also always feel like people are judging me when I walk into a family restroom at an airport especially since I think by all appearances I am a perfectly healthy 20 year old male. Luckily I have never had any real issues with this the only slight one was once after I had finished changing in the family restroom I went to walk out and a mother with her infant was waiting to use it and she stared me down didn't say anything.

I think I caught and had just about everything by the time I was 8 so my immune system works well or at least that is my theory. Sorry if I get a little off topic my mind tends to wander and jump the fun of ADHD. I don't drink a lot of fluids anyways thanks to my ADHD meds I am barely ever hungry or thirsty during the day and at least for me it seems like sometimes I'll drink basically nothing and I'll be having to use the restroom every half an hour and then others days I'll drink a lot and will only have to use the restroom two or three times it is the inconsistency that has made it so difficult to manage. Some days I'll be perfectly fine with no issues but others I will be leaking a lot and barely get any warning before my bladder starts to empty also it can make choosing how best to protect my self difficult if it was just maybe the occasional leak everyday I would definately be fine with pull ons I use for protection but the fact that some days my issues are a good bit worse makes me wonder whether I should transition to my plastic backed premium briefs that I currently use at night in the daytime. Sodium I think is definately good advice I know I laid off of it in high school since it helps retain water when I was wrestling to stay at the right weight (luckily my bladder issues hadn't started yet). I find keeping to a timed voiding schedule nearly impossible for me since I have a highly vayiable daily schedule. As for medication I don't remember the name of the medication I was on but it made me stop sweating which nearly led to me having heat stroke several times. I am wary of taking new medications.

Absolutely! it cant be mentioned in a context outside of my being on disability around my folks without getting a flippant comment about anger issues like a disproportionate amount of those on disability are basically millenials that refuse to grow up.

They were outraged that it took ""so long"" for my disability to be approved (iirc 4 months which afaik is fast).

They were likewise outraged at the means testing when we asked about help with medical expenses. ( I had fantastic insurance but COBRA was expensive)

When it comes to me(or them) from their perspective of course I(they) should get all the help in the world. Everyone else though? More means testing, more red tape etc.

When that doesn't get the point across they  pivot to how illegals would get treatment for free. This happened often when I got meds at no cost on my states medicare expansion. They had to find a way to be mad about that without directing it at me.

Understanding means either empathy of admitting you are a heartless asshole. I'm happy to say before my stroke I made ""ok"" money and I'm on record as having said 2 things
1. I'm happy to have my tax money spent on the social safety net
2. Fighting fraud is a good idea but lets make sure that every dollar spent fighting fraud we get a dollar back.

So I don't feel like a giant hypocritical asshole.

I'm sympathetic to the thought that many people are trying to game the system, but unfortunately our current political climate means that propaganda is favored over truth and knowledge.

This same propaganda is what gets you downvotes, even here? you might ask? They generally feel people are parasitic frauds sucking on the teat of the government but not them, *they are different* a great example of [Actor-Observer Bias](https://www.verywell.com/what-is-the-actor-observer-bias-2794813) ""I'm really disabled that person is just a lazy scammer""

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1502073897,"As someone with IBD *and* mobility aids, I started thinking about my own bathroom needs during your comic con story. I will often use the accessible stall because manoeuvring with crutches in a standard stall is very difficult and I really benefit from the leverage/handrails in the handicap stalls in order to get up and down from the throne, I *can* technically use a standard stall, my needs for the wide stall are certainly not as great as a wheelchair users needs. But I'm sure we can all appreciate that having hand rails and not having to do yoga just to fit in a standard stall with crutches can reduce pain and potential flare ups and crashes later in the day.

Especially when combined with IBD, Sometimes I'm in a rush and I don't have time to manoeuvre carefully in a standard stall, I need to just run in and plant my bum down asap. I have had situations where I have tried to use a standard stall, lost my balance, and landed on the floor, not had time to get up before my bowels open, and had a bigger mess to deal with than if i'd just accepted that I need the wide stall and handrails.

I digress.

I've definitely been that asshole, sitting on the handicapped toilet for 40-50 minutes, A human fire hydrant of faeces, praying to god that no one else with mobility needs enters the bathroom. From the crack in the stall door, I'm just some bitch on my phone, trying to distract myself from the pain and cramps with facebook, My crutches resting against the wall out of site.

But at least unlike OP's Comic Con woman, I'm vocal when someone asks what my deal is. I'm apologetic and self aware enough to say ""I'm sorry, at the time I had great need for this stall, but I understand at this point, your need is greater""

I can usually hear a mobility aid on the tiled floor and I will be quick to say ""I'm so sorry if you need this stall, I have IBD, I don't know how long I will be, maybe you should ask staff if there's another accessible bathroom?""

It's only happened once, But there was a definite scramble to just hold in what was left inside me, wipe myself up, wipe up my surroundings, double check the stall was presentable, grab my crutches and then get out to let the other person in. I don't compromise on making sure the stall was clean, But it was embarrassing and I felt guilty knowing every extra second I took some poor person was having to hold themselves longer, I know that pain all to well.

Since it was no longer an ""urgent"" situation to get to the toilet, after departing the handicapped stall, I was able to take my time with my crutches to manoeuvre in a standard stall to finish my business.

I've been lucky that the only time that happened, there was no queue for standard stalls.

I can only imagine the discussion I would need to have, Flushing and exiting the handicap stall with my crutches, then making eye contact with the ambulant women in the front of the queue and saying ""can I jump the queue, I need to get back into any stall ASAP... I have IBD and I wasn't finished, but they needed that stall more than me""

It really is a difficult balance bathroom etiquette with addressing our personal needs. We all need to use the bathroom, it's human. But the ""handicap stall"" caters to such a wide range of different needs. People with Ostomy bags and catheters need the stall because the sink is inside the stall allowing for better hygiene when draining bags. People with impaired mobility and balance need the stall for the handrails and people with mobility aids or larger bodies need the stall for is ample size to turn and manoeuvre. The handicap stall is also large enough that people with severe mobility needs or intellectual/functional disabilities can have a carer or assistant with them to help them with hygiene or dressing. So many people need this stall for so many different reasons, We're a small percentage of the population so It's understandable that there is only ever 1 handicapp stall, But it's so hard to know what to do when there are multiple people who need it.

Comic Con and similar conventions are the worst too, Because people with large, obstructive props/costumes tend to require these stalls too because their costume wont fit in a standard stall.",,,6,0,0,

This is probbaly why the downvotes are happening.

Personally It never made sense to me, The pain of having less function is the consequence they must accept for their actions, There is nothing they can do to change what has been done, Denying someone assistance because there was an element of self-infliction does not cure them of their disability. It simply puts them deeper into dysfunction.

My issues are not inherently self-inflicted, My GP said It was fibromyalgia and to go to yoga, I was really good at yoga so I got into gymnastics and contortionism then after getting worse  they realised I had Ehlers Danlos, Not fibro, and I'd made everything worse by doing the wrong kind of PT and not doing anything to prevent or protect my joints from my EDS (and getting older in general). I was kind of able to work part time before I started yoga, But now I struggle to even type posts like this because of the constant dislocations in my fingers.

I've been told by countless doctors that they can't help because I should have been more pro-active earlier.

I have been denied Disability 4 times because I'm not doing anything to help myself now.

I was finally given a temporary payment and with that money I was able to travel to seek out a PT who specialises in Hypermobility, and now I am getting better, More doctors are accepting me as a patient because I am proving that I am willing to help myself, and It's likely i will be approved for disability within my next 2 appeals because I now have a good medical team behind me.

I've always wanted to be able to help myself, but when I had zero income, I didn't know where to begin to help myself.

It didn't matter if my issues were self inflicted or a random coincidence, what mattered is that I wanted to get better and I needed tools to do so. Denying me the tools as some kind of punishment for my past actions is cruel and inhumane in my opinion. The pain of my illness is my punishment, The denial of housing, food, water and heating is not punishment, it's torture.

in saying that, my condition is not self inflicted, It was always present and it was made worse by poorly informed choices. I have received sympathy from communities like this.

SSI - basically for kids and adults who haven't paid FICA. Maxes at $735/month, but drops from there depending on your living situation, outside help, income (they take $1 for every $2 you make over $65), plus income of a spouse. With it you get Medicaid, they are both welfare benefits so additionally your assets can't exceed $2,000. 

SSDI - for those who have paid FICA. Benefit amount based on your prior earnings. Basically nothing counts against it unless you earn too much in 9 months out of 60. You get Medicare after 2 years. If your SSDI is under $735, you could get the balance from SSI but all in the paragraph about SSI would apply. 

DAC - this is a benefit you can collect if you are unmarried, found disabled young enough, and have a parent who paid in but is now retired, on SSDI themselves, or deceased.

I tried all non-opiates first. NSAIDs, all the gaba drugs, epidural injections, PT, acupuncture, chiropractor, and I have a SCS. 

What you should focus on is quality of life. I hate taking opiates, I hate how they make me feel (I never understood the ""high"" factor). But they allow me to lead a relatively normal life. If you're worried about other people - just don't tell them. Its none of their business anyway. Personally, I'm upfront with people (if it comes up in conversation) because I think that it provides an alternative to the epidemic-narrative. They need to see people who use the drugs as intended. 

There are a lot of things to consider with the drugs though. Dependence (different than abuse!) will happen with regular use. So even if I'm going through a really good spurt where I don't need the opiates [rare] I will start to go through withdrawal after about 24-36 hours. Unless you are a heavy user, the withdrawals aren't immediate. I might get a bit of a runny nose or watery eyes after about 12 hours, but the significant symptoms come much later. 

With dependence comes habituation and increased tolerance; a lot of this will depend on your genetics. I've been lucky that the same dose has worked for the last 2 years, but I know that it still doesn't work quite as good as when I started on it. But, for my own reasons, I'm not going up any higher.

Its one of those ""risk vs reward"" scenarios. If you work under the table for cash, there is a very small chance that you'd get in trouble with the IRS/SSA. Its one of those thing that they wouldn't necessarily know unless you or someone else told them. But its easy to mess up and say something, or you piss the wrong person off and they will report you to OIG. 

But the risk comes in getting caught. I can't speak to the IRS side (back taxes I suppose) but on the SSA side it will be unpleasant. They have an entire division with SSA/OIG devoted to fraud, and this is one area they specialize in. People regularly get civil monetary penalties (fines) and have to pay back everything that SSA gave them. Some get jail but that is rare. And then your file gets a big ol' FRAUD flag on it.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1503942238,"The first big questions - is she on SSI-only or is she on SSDI based on a parents SSN?

If SSI only, the work rules are much stricter. She can work and still be eligible for benefits, *but* as she earns income (even under the SGA limit) it will lessen her monthly benefits. Generally speaking, its about a 2:1 ration (for every $2 earned, her SSI goes down $1). 

Are either of her parents retired, disabled or deceased? When any of those things happen she will be eligible for CDB benefits (childhood disability benefits) as long as she was found disabled between the ages of 18-22. She would get to draw on their SSN's earnings (up to about 75% of their check) and the work rules become much more lax. 

Is her mother her representative payee? and is she reporting all of her earnings to SSA? She is required to report all earnings to SSA; if not it could result in an overpayment and she will then owe SSA money. 

As for her future goals - she needs to consider HUD housing. These are apartments (sometimes townhomes) where their rent is capped at 30% of their income. Plus moving out would make her eligible for a host of other state benefits like food stamps. Its difficult, but I know people who live independently on SSI this way. 

If you don't think she is capable of living by herself - she needs to get hooked up with a community residential habilitation agency. She can live in a HUD apartment and Medicaid would pay the agency to ""staff"" her. (assuming the medical need is present). This can range from a few hours per week to 24 hour care. Most agencies do require anyone in 24 care to live with a roommate; the reimbursement rates are abysmal and they can't afford to staff someone 24/7 along.

Especially the kinds where there is some interaction between mental and physical causes of your symptoms. So the physical doctor is only looking at your GI issues, and the mental doctor is just looking at the psych. Its hard to get them to meet in the middle and see the interaction sometimes (that falls more on the adjudicator themselves)

What does your current treatment consist of? Do you see a GI doctor and are you on meds? You mention psych providers, but how often do you see them? What kind of response do you get from the medication and treatment?

You say you went from 40hrs/week to 12 hrs/week, how long ago was the switch? A person's disability has to prevent working for an entire year (or be expected to last). So even if you've had the issues when you were working 40hrs, that 12 month clock really starts when you start earning under SGA. So if you are early in that timeframe, they might project that, with treatment, you'll be able to work again. (not saying that is the right thing in your situation, just a possibility). Or if your symptoms have been consistent from when you were working 40 hrs a week, the argument might be that there is nothing new (medical wise) to suggest that you can't work a full-time job. 

Its important to remember that the disability decision isn't just about what your *perceived* limitations are, it is about the limitations that the *medical evidence* can support. So when people say ""why would SSA deny me clearly I have these issues!"" the first thing I say is to see what is in your medical records. You'd be surprised at how inaccurate they can be, or how much stuff you tell you doctor that won't make it into the records.

Someone will not get automatically denied for working under SGA, but it could hurt their chances. Or it may not matter at all. 

A lot of it will depend on the type of work, how similar it is to other work you've done, and your conditions.  In your particular situation - I believe that it *could* hurt your chances, if you don't present it the right way. You're going to be asked about it, so the best thing to do is be honest with why you are working part-time.

The central issue of any disability determination is the question of whether this person can earn SGA and sustain full-time employment. Sustainability is a big part of the decision, and that is where your limitations come in. If you make the argument that you can only work 2 days per week because that is all your mental health will allow, they are more willing to overlook it. 

Is there any other options besides teaching? Depending on the adjudicator/judge, sometimes it will be held against you if you're arguing that you can't do a specific job, but then you do that specific job part-time. 

Some people are going to tell you to just work and not tell SSA - don't do that. Its technically **fraud**, and something that SSA is very focused on at the moment.

A person's backpay is based on someone's established onset date. Typically this is going to be the date someone stopped working (SSDI) or the filing date (SSI). Sometimes, a person's onset date is set for a different date. Typically this is where someone stopped working, but the medical doesn't show that they met the criteria for disability until later. 

If you were given a ""fully favorable"" onset date (date last worked/SSI filing date) then there is nothing to appeal. Back pay is not determined by need, but by time. 

If you were given an adverse onset date, you can appeal the decision (within 60 days of date of your letter), but /u/e320a3d8-dd3c-4d3d-84b7-4ba103162d60 is correct that you basically agree to have your entire file re-reviewed.

Plus, as more and more parts of the process are electronic, claims move much more quickly than they used to. 

You're timeline so far is on the faster end of average. The long wait time at the beginning is usually if there is a backlog of claims at the DDS waiting to be assigned (they can only hand out so many at once). And then from there it depends on how quickly the paperwork gets completed and how quickly medical records are received. 

It is entirely possible that your medical records have been received already. With so many vendors using electronic records, its as simple as a push of a button. Hell, there are some large corporations that have the technology where as soon as you finish your application, it automatically goes out and pulls the records into your file before it even reaches the DDS.

How quickly things go from here will depend on a few things. Assuming that they don't need any additional medical (via consultative exam) as soon as they receive your paperwork (it can take 7-10 days from mailing to hit the file)then can send it to a doctor for review. Sometimes that only takes a few days, sometimes it can take a week or two. It all depends on how big the wait list is. Once its back from the doctor the rest of it only takes maybe an hour to finish. But after that it might get caught by the federal QA system which can take up to 30 days (if they don't find an error) to clear or, if they do find the DDS made an error, that can cause another 30-60 delay.

""You don’t know anyone at the party, so you don’t want to go. You don’t like cottage cheese, so you haven’t eaten it in years. This is your choice, of course, but don’t kid yourself: it’s also the flinch. Your personality is not set in stone. You may think a morning coffee is the most enjoyable thing in the world, but it’s really just a habit. Thirty days without it, and you would be fine. You think you have a soul mate, but in fact you could have had any number of spouses. You would have evolved differently, but been just as happy.

You can change what you want about yourself at any time. (Your personality not your disability) You see yourself as someone who can’t write or play an instrument, who gives in to temptation or makes bad decisions, but that’s really not you. It’s not ingrained. It’s not your personality. Your personality is something else, something deeper than just preferences, and these details on the surface, you can change anytime you like.

If it is useful to do so, you must abandon your identity and start again. Sometimes, it’s the only way.""

This is a sadly common thing. I see this on any given day that I leave the house. At this point most of the anger has subsided in lieu of simply accepting that the world is covered with assholes, and all over them think they're entitled to handicapped parking spots.

On the other hand, if you have iOS there is an app called Parking Mobility which, if your local police department participates, allows you to take photos of the vehicle and report it to the police who then issue a ticket. Some by mail, some send an officer out. Petty revenge is the best revenge.

At one point I had a lady do something similar to your situation -- she took up the only handicapped spot on street-side parking. I was gonna let it slide, until she hit my car when she was reversing. I called the cops, and to their credit he was *far* more interested in her use of the handicapped spot that her scraping my bumper. Her defense was that her son was handicapped.

Anyway, what was recommended to me was either to do everything in my wife's name (you would obv. have the accounts, etc. set up in your mother's name) or, if there would be ongoing earnings, to set up an LLC -- that way I could *earn* as much money at once as I wanted, but I would only be *paid* an amount from the LLC monthly that didn't jeopardize my disability (downside is extra taxation if I remember correctly).

It can get expensive, but Razer is phenomenal for this sort of stuff because they have a baked-in program that allows you to greater macro bindings, and alter key functions automatically based on what program you have open.

I have a Black Widow Chroma keyboard (birthday splurge!) that I love, but most important to me is my old Razer Nostromo, because it has ~15 programmable keys, and 8 optional layers (8x15=120+ different ""keys"" or macros available). It is meant for one-handed use, all the keys are laid out in vertical rows, and there is a ""mouse"" nub under your thumb. It is left-hand only, but there are similar devices that cater to right-hand users. 

Again,Razer is nice because the program that allows you to do this is well designed and fully integrated with all their devices. *However*, if you have some basic programming knowledge (or are willing to learn -- very very basic stuff) you can accomplish most of the same stuff by using the free, Windows Only program AutoHotKey. I used it when I used to work and it was a lifesaver because it allowed me to combine cut and paste each onto their own single key (along with a bunch more common functions).

Using AHK you could create something close to my Nostromo by using a USB 10-key ($10-$15), but it won't be as comfortable, will lack the layers, and won't have the mouse, but you can create very basic macros for your most frequently used actions.",,,1,0,0,

Sometimes they're a little more tactful and don't ask, but sometimes their quest for knowledge begs them to.  It's no big deal.  You'll get it through out your entire life.  Don't let it ruin your day, brush it off the best you can and move forward.  I had my leg crossed over the other when I went out to smoke at the bar last night.  Some young girl asked me if I broke my leg.  I said no and told her I am paralyzed.  She said she felt bad for asking, but of course, that didn't stop her from proceeding.  She asked how long it's been.  She asked how old I was.  She asked if my dick still worked.  Some of the usual questions.  She then commented that I probably have a big dick (I don't) and that while she doesn't necessarily enjoy anal sex, it makes her cum really hard.  And THAT was way more awkward than any question she asked me about my disability.

I absolutely dreaded the experience.  I wasn't comfortable in classroom settings and that would give me anxiety. I went for several semesters and it just got to be too difficult for me to get from class to class in a timely fashion, while carrying all my books and whatnot.  So I told my parents that college was not meant for me, and I quit.  I believe my anxiety in college stemmed from my high school experience, where I was tormented frequently by a small group of delinquents.  That shit still bothers me..

 I have had a fairly decent life to this point following my school years and not having a college degree.   I worked 10+ years in television broadcasting, on the production end of things and I am now an emergency dispatcher going on 15 years.  I send police, fire and EMS to people in need.

I hate children so much like they're loud and unpredictable and I just kinda go ""never again"" whenever I babysit.(4 more days and my niece will be old enough for school and someone else can watch her in the summer.)

Yeah I feel the need to prove you wrong. 

I've considered a minor in education that way I have a back up plan and could teach high school science. Idk what kind of science I'm a biology major so I guess biology. My university is begging students to take a educational pathway if there a math or science major because we apparently need more math/science teachers. 
My favorite zoo in the whole world is constnwrnly hiring because it's in a touristy town. Me: *im never leaving* we all know that once I'm an adult and on my own I'll have several pets. I already have 5 birds and a dog. 


That is a typo. I meant  Fontane. My bad. It just gets annoying when I go on vacation and the destination is12 hour drive which no problem jjst catch a cheap flight from the airport. But air pressure is a problem so I can't do that. Also a problem is metal detectors I can't go through them because of the metal could in my heart and my pacemaker. Can't be around electromagnets because of that. And I didn't know the different between a CAT scan(safe) and a MRI(unsafe) so when the ER told me I needed a cat scan I *panicked* and my blood pressure skyrocketed. Like yeah...that was an interesting evening 
My mother is Mormon/LDS. That shit is a *cult* that's what that is. 

Yeah it's a marine rehab which I want to work with the parrots or reptiles there but I'll be satisfied with any part of the zoo. I can talk about animals for hours. Which is essentially a large part of what zookeepers do people ask questions and they answer then. Source: I talked to the primate keeper at the local
Zoo for like 20 minutes about the sos manages because I missed her talk since I couldn't find it and she goes ""I'll give you the talk rift here and now then.""

Okay let me explain how. I'm not great at judging the width of the door so I decided instead of riding my scooter off the elevator I put it in neutral and went to push it out as I've done nefore and it's never been a problem.

(Granted, some people are just horrible people and won't feel badly for their words/actions no matter what, but most people realized their insensitivity, I found.)

I strongly support this. People don't know any better unless they are taught. It's like that horrible George Takai post. It's not worth getting angry at ignorant people. ",,,3,0,0,

This is nothing more than tripe. The low test scores in this state really have nothing to do with our special needs kids. 

So in addition to this woman's lack of understanding if the standards and such, she doesn't even know the real reason for the low scores. 

So here's a thought. Why don't you pay our teachers more? Supply their classrooms with the materials they need, instead if forcing the underpaid teachers to buy what hey need out of their pocket? 

Furthermore, you should probably focus on improving education in the first place.

It's about the wider context of medical professionals who lack insight into disabled people's lives and make, often unwanted, major assumptions about ""quality of life"". A doctor may have more experience than the average person of what a disability entails (although if I'm perfectly honest, my own experience with countless specialists would suggest they do not) but they are not disabled. They are qualified to treat an individual and they are qualified to withdraw care if the state allows but they are not qualified to dictate to people what they think good quality of life looks like. In the vast, overwhelming majority of cases, only the individual with the condition is qualified to make such a statement.

few examples. People who are disabled don't need examples, I'm pretty sure I can think of situations that directly relate to what she has written even if I don't completely see it the way she does. But if you want able-bodied people to come to an understanding of your experience and think about how to approach you differently then you need to give specific instances of the kind of thing you're talking about.

I also honestly, didn't appreciate the line about being a ""queer disabled korean transracial and transnational adoptee woman survivor"".

I strongly believe in intersectionality and obviously people can choose how they want to fight their fight and what language they want to use to define themselves, that's fine.

Thanks for getting it (I mean, of course you get it!), it's always a relief to hear that someone does. It's difficult to talk about this kind of thing with friends often because they'll say something like ""well just tell her to shut up"". People don't really get that it's very difficult to be in a position of vulnerability and have to put up with quite a lot in our own space just to ensure stability and continuity. 

On an aside, I've been thinking and I just don't really understand why anyone would bring such personal and sensitive issues to a workplace environment? I don't blow through my office with all my opinions and expect everyone else to put up with them. I think I need to be far better at setting boundaries.

Totally agree on the issue of disability being very hard to relate to. I think most times I've talked with people about my experiences they've been surprised. And I have a physical disability so I can't imagine how little they know about invisible or other kinds of disabilities, must be even harder for those with invisible disabilities to get their experiences across.
