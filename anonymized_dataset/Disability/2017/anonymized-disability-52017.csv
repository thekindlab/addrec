Basically, the right medications will help you have less suffering so you can be the best you that you really are, and have always been.

 Maybe this isn't the best example - it's late - , but say you have been wearing a big puffy jacket with 20 pound weights in the pockets. I offer to take the jacket off you. Would that change who you are? Would you tell me, no thanks, I like to struggle; it's who I am? Full of new energy and a clear mind that can help you achieve your goals and apply your natural talents, would you beg for the jacket back because you like yourself too much?

The medication road does need patience, mindfulness, time, and bravery, but it is worth it. Started this road about 7 years ago myself, didn't find my perfect combo until a few years ago, and am still adjusting now and them. Worth it.

This one quote is particularly odd.
""In a world where disability is not only almost universally considered bad and which contains options to opt out of having disabled children, will support for accessibility legislation like the ADA or AODA continue?""
For one the author already points out that not all disabilities can be selected against so some children will still be born disabled. And the author also points out that many people become disabled later in life so obviously groups that help the disabled will still exist. Legislation protecting disabled people isn't suddenly going to go away just because the rates of disabled babies would decrease. 

Also I don't think it's offensive to say that if given the choice most people would choose to not be disabled. I wouldn't wish my health problems on anyone.

The only real issue I have with this type of medical science is that it will not be available for all people, only wealthy people. Children of wealthy people already have an advantage in the sense that their parents can send them to private schools, pay for tutors and extracurricular activities, etc. We have a continually expanding wage gap in the US and since raising disabled children is typically more costly than raising an able bodied child it's unfair to not provide this type of medical service to all people.

I think this is oft-forgotten by potential immigrants (and I say this as an expat then immigrant myself). While less true in the US from my experience (where it's acceptable to be a proud 'different culture, ethnicity or nationality-American'), the same is not true in all countries, or even all 'Western' countries. As an immigrant you may essentially need to abandon or at least downplay a part of your identity when the differences to your host country almost inherently highlight them (even when you don't always realize it, I find nationality can still very much shape how you think about and interact with the world). 

Some cultures put a lot of emphasis on the need for immigrants to conform and to not criticize their new host country. My own country among them, where criticism by immigrants is a fine line to walk, cross it and be met with 'Go back to where you came from!'. It creates a set of almost 'societal obligations' in a way where US citizens may think alternatively of their rights.

Not complying with treatment does make it more likely that you will be denied.  If you are approved for disability and do not comply with recommended treatment, you could lose your disability during a continuing disability review due to noncompliance.  

Now, if you speak with your treating physician and explain that you are unable to take certain medications due to side effects, that should affect what you are prescribed and how you are treated.  Not being prescribed certain medications is not the same as not complying with recommended treatment, and would not hurt your credibility.  Generally speaking, stating that are not willing to engage in pharmacological treatment due to anxiety over taking medications will not be considered a legitimate reason for medical noncompliance.

Furthermore, if you say that you are unable to tolerate any treatment for your medical conditions due to anxiety, that could come across as a lack of desire to manage your symptoms, and could be considered a negative credibility factor.

TL;DR: If you are prescribed medications and do not take them, it will probably hurt your chances to be approved for disability.

The medium heightguy has a tiny bit of difficulty without the milk crate, but can still peek over the fence and see everything fairly well. then there is someone just short enough that bhe can't see over the fence even with the one milk crate. Wouldn't it be nicer if the tallest person gave his crate, who he doesn't need, to allow the smaller person to see over the fence."" 

I like this concept since it helped me visualize the issue. The other person said 'No, because it wouldn't be fair. Then one of them has two milk crates and the other has none.""

All I wanted to do was hop out of bed, get in the shower, throw on some clothes and go off to something resembling a normal life. Instead, I spent my 45 min. stretching, getting as many cracks out of as many joints as I could and, once the back pain had eased enough for me to feel like I could function, crawled into my wheelchair.

I ended up having a good day, but those people going out of their way, or jumping out of my way as if I was going to mow them down, was a bit of an insult. Of course, this was at a very masculine hardware and mechanical store where the greatest act of courage would be for a customer to ask for help. Thankfully I didn't encounter any of those glaring seniors.

I see changes in myself since I was disabled, almost 20 years ago. I care less about what people think, say no when I need to say no more often than I used to. And, if somebody ever tried to guilt trip me into doing something, now I'm less likely to just ignore them for the rest of time but to actually put them in their place (in private or by private message) always ending with some phrase that will indicate their self-centeredness will come back to bite them in the ass.

Rant away. Reading your distress helps each of us remember that there are a great number of other people who feel the same way that we do.

This sounds extremely close to what was sent to the mandatory reconsideration, and we knew that it was probably the kind of thing expected for the more contextual tribunal, and that DWP had been, as you put it, 'a box-ticking exercise'. We did get the DWP letters explaining their reasoning, and it's pretty disgusting. Even our big reconsideration letter which introduced far more context to the matter (every category, one by one) and why I am in trouble 100% of the time, it was still done entirely by numbers. I shouldn't be left alone to cook myself a meal, but because I'm physically able, it was a zero. Even when I explained why I *shouldn't*, they still dismissed it. In spite of being under constant threat wherever I am, I didn't have enough seizures that week, so that was a no. 

I was just desperate to figure out whether anything was missing, or this injustice by DWP was simply down to their currently dysfunctional system. I wanted to make sure that sending identical details (I don't feel there is anything more to add besides identical doctors letters with a more recent date in the corner!), was just us waiting for the answer to magically change.

I hadn't thought to consider the qualifications of the assessor, so thanks for suggesting it. I can't remember what her occupation was (but do have it written on a form. I think she was listed as 'nurse'. Just 'nurse'.), so don't know how much help it might be for me. Fingers crossed.

a557c44d-8fef-4e7a-8814-9032710db7d4,1493927524,"Hi! I saw your comment on the survey and am glad you posted it here because I think it's very valid. I agree with your feedback, especially in that I feel this survey ideally needs to be about ten pages longer than it is but I was worried about losing people's interest. This is my first time doing anything like this and I think the questions I chose did end up making it feel quite vague and incomplete, but I struggled to come up with more specific questions while keeping the focus relatively broad and covering enough material in such a short survey. So there is definitely room for improvement – consider it a first attempt by a rookie. 

I would also like to clarify my aims in conducting this survey and give more insight into why the questions are what they are. This project is for a gender studies class, so it does have a gender focus. I feel that people with disabilities have a unique lived experience in society which may lead to important insights on gender that able-bodied people do not have. I want to investigate the ways in which disability and gender intersect in the societal construct of ""normal"". So to answer your question, this survey is about disability AND gender – but for people of colour it may be impossible to interpret their lived experience without reference to race, and many people have referred to other pieces of their identity (such as age and sexual orientation) when talking about their experiences as well. I think that all of these factors can play a role in how disabled people experience the world, so I wanted to be as inclusive as possible in my questions. 

The survey has so far yielded some interesting results in the data alone – for example, people who identify as women feel generally positive or neutral about aids they use such as wheelchairs, whereas men feel overwhelmingly negative, which may perhaps be due to the greater emphasis society places on masculine independence. Additionally people who did not identify as male or female do not seem certain that disability changes their relationship with their body (whereas cisgender people answered 90% yes to that question). But the really amazing thing has been the comments people have left at the bottom of the survey. People have talked about their difficulties presenting as feminine while being physically unable to put on makeup or wear heels, their struggles to embody masculinity in the absence of physical strength, the feelings they have of being considered genderless when using their wheelchair in public, and so many other fascinating insights into how gender and disability come together in people's lives. Some people also commented that they do not feel their disability and their gender intersect at all, which is an equally interesting result. But if this survey has caused people to stop and think about disability in the context of gender, or gender in the context of disability, then I'm very happy with that outcome. Gender is just one of many factors that can potentially bar disabled people from full participation in society, but I think it's worth trying to understand how multiple systems of oppression can work together to exclude people, with the end goal being a more accepting and integrated society. 

EDIT: sorry for the very long comment, wanted to be sure I addressed your concerns fully!

Social Security Disability Insurance is for workers in the United States who pay into the fund over several years.  In order to be eligible to claim money from this fund, you must work a certain number of quarters and paid a certain amount of money. 

If you haven't worked the quarters, you can't claim any money from the fund. So you will keep getting denied.  No one there cares about you or your disability. They only care if you are eligible. If you aren't, you are literally wasting their time because you are applying to a system where you don't meant the qualifications.

I wrote that not to make the conversation about me, but to show you that I understand your entirely justified fury. It's despicable how some doctors refuse to believe their patients. I don't know if it's their egos or what, but it is messed up.

I know it's difficult and exhausting to go through the whole process again, but I recommend trying to find another doctor anyway. The one you have is clearly the wrong person for the job. Some doctors are terrible, but there are truly great ones out there too. I've had a few of them, though I know they can be hard to find.

A tip that might be able to help you -- in the past I've been able to make same-day appointments with some doctors by calling them right when they open -- maybe even a few minutes before -- and asking if they have any cancellations. Perhaps bring that up when trying to find a new doctor, see if they do that and tell them you're only asking because you can't think of any other way to present the problem to them.

A lot of public pools have lifts. Go try them out before making a purchase. See what works for you.

Injury is always a risk, but don't let risk prevent from living an active life style. The problem with paralysis is the ease of getting fat. Weight will add to complications. There are many sports opportunities and I highly recommend them for emotional support.

While less true in the US from my experience (where it's acceptable to be a proud 'different culture, ethnicity or nationality-American'), the same is not true in all countries, or even all 'Western' countries.

It's often a source of conflict within Canada as the RoC works under the model of anglo-saxon liberalism which it takes for granted and usually doesn't consider that other ways of thinking are even possible.

Their model is based on individual rights, their model of integration is multiculturalism (no need for integration we need to include you), and their model of identity is based on blood (if you are of X ancestry, you are an X) and land (if you live in Canada, you are Canadian).

Quebec works under a republican model where there's a bigger focus on collective rights, the integration model is interculturalism (you can bring variety as long as you join the common core), and the model of identity is cultural.

And that's why we're the only province that requires you go through a different immigration process.

I like our model and think that immigrants that are unhappy with it should pick a different country (or province) to immigrate to. It's not as if there wasn't a ton to choose from.

&gt; cross it and be met with 'Go back to where you came from!'

In my experience of immigrating to the UK and worrying if my disability would impact my ability to immigrate, nothing on the forms I've filled out have identified me as a disabled person. Even if I were to have needed assistance in, for example, completing the citizenship tests or something like that, you just end up with a certificate that says you passed which goes in with your application so I don't think they'd necessarily know.

Even just marrying a person isn't a guarantee and it still takes time and financial resources. 

The first recourse I'd say is for your friends to see if their grandparents are citizens of other countries. Quite often people can get citizenship of a country if their grandparent was a citizen, but that's usually when it cuts off. I have a few friends who got in that way.

The second way, I'd say is for your friends to study in another country. US student loans do cover programs abroad. And even just going for an MA will give them some time to be in the country (and if their program is longer than 6 months, they should be covered on the health insurance in the country) and see if they actually like it.

Then they can decide if they can find a job which will sponsor them which is a possible thing or if they want to pursue the marriage route.

Either way, it often requires going back and forth between the US and the other country, even if you do find a path. I'd honestly be more worried about the financial difficulties of immigrating before I'd be worried about being denied due to disability.",,,7,0,0,

I am young so anticipated that it would be at this interval initially even though the judge's decision indicated at three years but I moved to a smaller county so I think that the Social Security office is a little bored or something so got this underway just a bit earlier-no problem guys, I'll keep you busy.
Anyway, these reviews are routine meaning they are very common and actually should be expected although all of us probably have different ""schedules but that doesn't change anything in regard to how they rule. Remember, this time around the ""burden of proof"" if you will lies within the SSA's scope, not yours so they must prove that you have shown medical improvement and that it relates to your work and that there is substantial gainful activity (full-time work) that you can do. Even if you have experienced some improvement which can happen since disability grants us more access to medical care potentially, it still doesn't mean that you can work again so I would not worry too much about this as long as you submit the forms or any additional information on time and do maintain a relationship with a healthcare provider regularly. These really are such easy things to do that result in keeping the SSA happy.
Respect their deadlines and believe me from personal experience, if something is slowing you down in regard to getting stuff in, just call and let them know. They may say you need to return everything within ten days on the mailed notice but really the law is not as such; I do believe you have 30 days from the notice and really, do not stress on this one...approval in somewhere in the 90-95% range and even if they rule differently, just like the initial process, the decision can be appealed. If that does happen and you end up hiring legal counsel at this point, as much as it sucks, I would have them stop paying you so that when you get re-approved, the legal fees will come out of the back pay and are usually a lot less than if you just pay for a lawyer.

c29f2422-a9ca-48db-b496-6cd30e55176a,1494293868,"I don't know which state spicyshazam is in, but disability examiners are like every other job- there are good ones and bad ones. Unfortunately, our job performance is judged on how many cases we can get out- or close. This leads some examiners to try to get cases out without doing quality work, and the claimant's suffer. I am not that kind of examiner, and it seems spicyshazam is not either. That is why there are fail-safes like reconsiderations- so that if something is missed the first time, it can be caught the second.

Some examiners are more allowance oriented, and some are more denial slanted. This is just human nature. I am more allowance oriented, but many of my co-workers, who put JUST as much work into reading and adjudicating claims, are denial oriented. Either way, if a claim is an allowance, they will allow, and if a claim is a denial, I will deny. It depends on the facts of a case. I have never, and will never, rubber stamp a case as a denial or an allowance without considering all the evidence. 

I have allowed people on the basis of a single consultative examination when they had NO medical records. Medical source statements from doctors saying a claimant is disabled is considered just as any other medical evidence. If the doctor is a long term treating source, it is given more consideration than a disability lawyer getting a doctor who saw the claimant once or twice to sign something stating the claimant cannot work. While medical source statements are considered, they never make or break a case. 

As PinkFizzyLemonade said- ""Most people don't realize that have applied so many times that they finally go into a different age bracket which changes the Voc rules for them, or they get it if they go in front of a judge who doesn't have to follow any of the rules that you as an examiner have to live by. It is their whim if they allow or deny."" ....Yes. Lord Yes. If people realized this, my job would be 100 times easier. 

The only people who really know how claims are adjudicated are disability examiners, because we do it every. single. day. Disability lawyers approach it from a completely different standpoint, and ALJs have totally different rules. This *is* a thankless job, and it's easy to get caught up in making those production numbers. However, for the vast majority of us who remember claimants are people, it's hurtful to know the public thinks we're heartless grinches.  ",,,1,0,0,

I also dabble in writing, and I think it's awesome that you put in the work to get your facts straight.

Lots of interesting, often somewhat serious and grave info in here, let me give you some of the more weird/funny stuff:

People in public are usually very friendly to me. It can be a bit too much, honestly. They will often offer me their seat in the subway, but I can stand just fine and it's actually quite good for me, so I always decline. There's a tiny part of pride in that: I was brought up in the spirit of ""you're not disabled, just different"", I was myself taught to stand up for elderly people, and I will soooo not let someone who is a lot older than myself, give up their seat for me! I've almost had fights over that. ;-)

When I fall, which happens maybe twice per year, 2-3 people will instantly try to help me up. It's really nice, but completely uneffective. I have my very own, very odd-looking way of getting up, and I can do it way better on my own than with their help. But I'm also out of breath then, so I can't really communicate. So it always creates that slightly awkward situation where I try to somehow tell them politely to, well, fuck off, while I struggle to get up.

I'm in my fourties now, and people respect me more. Up to my thirties, teens would make fun of my walk, and it did get to me a lot. Then I learned to ignore it, and it got way better.

A word about ""disabled persons"": I don't give a damn about PCness. Call me a spastic all you like. It's what I am, after all. But I'm sure there are many who don't dig words like that. At all. My only beef is with the word ""disabled"" itself, because it's simply not true. I'm not disabled. I have a good, well paying job, have been living on my own since I was 18, and I have a steady relationship. My life is pretty good, actually, now that I think about it. :-)

Oh, and here's one aspect I would not be able to resist, if I were to write about it: Glorifying the condition. ""It made you slow down and enjoy the little things more."" - ""God gave you a blessing in disguise."" - ""You're soooo deep because of it."" - ""The way you handle your **painful, unbearable, unfair, etc** suffering is such an inspiration!"" ...

But your best chance is to keep a log of what happens and when you feel it and also to not be deterred by doctors. Use specific examples of how your symptoms affect your life. Take photos if you're swollen, etc. for proof. Always make sure you are communicating to the best of you ability. Find another advocate, like a friend or family member that knows you who can say that you act differently now/are in pain. Continue to do research. Sometimes you'll find things the doctors missed. That's how I got diagnosed with Celiac Disease. 

I also got diagnosed incorrectly twice (with my other two diseases) and it almost killed me. What I had was incredibly rare, which is why it wasn't caught. It took three years to find it. You never know.

The joystick on my electric wheelchair stopped working two before a conference I was organizing and three days before a final exam. I was living in an apartment two hours away from home and the only person who could fix my chair was my dad. I was lucky my chair stopped working in my apartment and not some random place on the side of the road, but I was stuck in my apartment for a whole day while I waited for my dad to finish work and drive up to me. When he finally came, he realized that this was an electrical issue he wouldn't be able to fix so we had to drop it off at a shop. The shop would take a few days to fix it but there's no way I could have literally sat in my apartment and did nothing. We spent the next two whole days driving up and down the state (New Jersey) to find a place that we could rent a wheelchair from. It was so exhausting and took so much time just to get mobile again.

Foreign traditional gender roles as it is not one of our customs. And foreigners are expected to try to integrate themselves within the society they move into (that is a difference with the Rest of Canada).

That law is very controversial in the RoC even though they are not affected by it in any way. For instance papers outside of Quebec won't call Sophie Grégoire (Justin's wife) by her actual name or their readers get angry (seriously...).

&gt;And thankfully, I'm not religious in the least. I don't want to baptize my future child, and given my family and SO's family being religious, the whole Quebec thing actually gives me a great excuse not to!

Old people can be the most judgemental demographic, but from my experience, they can also be incredibly understanding.

It doesn't make sense to me, especially with autism. Parents of autistic children understand the disorder in and out, they spend every day navigating it. Many of them spend a lot of time educating themselves about it. Severely autistic individuals aren't able to advocate for themselves, and they need others to do it for them. Many of the people who do a lot of good in the autistic community aren't autistic themselves, but they have a loved one who is. I'm not deep in that community at all but I've seen a bit of it because a former partner's child is on the spectrum.

That being said, sometimes people who don't really have the life experience still have an opinion. If I, as a person tangentially related to the autistic community, were to start expressing strong opinions on things I really don't know enough about, it would be inappropriate. Someone like me should be there to listen and learn, not get on a soapbox.

So - here's the paradox - I'm not a part of that community. So maybe there are reasons why someone with autism would feel strongly that only autistic individuals should be central to advocacy. I suspect that it would be a topic of contention within that community because I've seen how much work some parents put into it, but I don't know. So really, I should be following my own advice, and listening more than I talk. I would've been curious to see how that full conversation went.

First, I totally understand not wanting to lose people's interest. It would've been a very difficult thing to split the difference between being thorough and not getting interest. A good friend of mine, also a quadriplegic, knows what it's like to have disinterest in research, even in the situation with monetary compensation. People care, but they don't care enough to contribute to making a change. Not always, I'm unfairly generalizing.

I would hope that by clarifying the survey's purpose that it doesn't cause an unwanted effect on the results. However, I do appreciate knowing where it's source lies.

I can understand that the basis for gender, race or whatever it is that defines where you come from, can affect the way you feel about many things and I imagine this topic just as much. I feel no shame in saying that I am a 36-year-old white male who comes from a very supportive middle class family. Disability, or not, I had a lot of support in overcoming what I did and moving into a place of a productive and contributing life that is somewhat satisfying. I have to say somewhat because I know what my capacity was and would be, and when the disability interferes with what I could be doing and contributing it is a drain. I also have never had any exposure to personal uncertainty about who I am as a man. That doesn't mean I don't have acquaintances who are gender fluid or even transitioning from one physical state to another. I say that without any intent of malice, I just am probably not properly versed the correct terminology. I still cringe when people choose to use the words handicap, or heaven forbid, crippled.

I may have a quite conservative worldview but that does not mean I am unkind, that I will not listen or will judge people. I refuse to belittle anyone for who they are or what they believe but I also will never accept anyone trying to do the same to me. Few things make me smirk is much as having a reasonable debate with somebody and they begin to attack me and my stance until they learn I have a disability. Hypocrisy at the highest, equity and equality at the lowest.

Regarding how I feel about my wheelchair, and your observations, without a proper wheelchair I would not be as able as I am. The times that I do need to use a backup chair or am simply not in a properly fit and set up support system I do feel useless. I'm not saying that many of those people who look down upon their mobility aids are not set up properly, but a review never hurts. I know that when I have gone too long without properly evaluating my seating often my wellness declines until that posture and function is repaired.

It's unfortunate that such a proportion of the men responded to that survey look down upon their assistive devices. I have seldom believed much of what society tells us is masculine or feminine. If masculinity as defined by pop culture (for arguments sake) is being the risk-taking tough guy, I want nothing to do with it. If it means determination and follow through, being responsible and reliable to the people you care about and the people with whom you interact and work with, that to me is a part of being masculine. I think that should be part of being a human being, but it often isn't. All of these tough guys, leaving their girlfriend to raise a child by themselves are not men, nor are they masculine. I'm not saying men need to make all the sacrifices, travel the path by themselves (where would I be without the support of my family?) or forever be the ones doing all the physical work. But, staring at the football game with the dull expression on their face or looking like bumbling idiots, as we would be led to believe, is not helping people to live lives happily as a family. It gives men an excuse to be lazy and it gives women a burden as I can only wonder in what other ways they can't count on their man. Even in that sentence, I have probably offended by identifying a relationship as between a man and woman. There's so much grey area with everything I said and so many of the expectations I have are not masculine or feminine, but what I want to do and before my wife and who I want her to be for me, and they are far more similar than they are different. 

Be it my formal education in business administration and accounting, or my informal education and talent for the very artistic side of photography, planning for the long-term, whether it is a family's budget for the next year or next decade, or getting all of the elements in line for more than an average photo shoot that's what it means to be who I am. I refuse to add a gender in that last sentence. I know men and women who are incredible thinkers for the long-term and I know men and women who spend frivolously to the point of bankruptcy because they can't control their impulses or think about how their choices impact those closest to them and many other facets of their life. Then, there are those who leave me hanging after months of planning and much money put into a huge photography related collaboration.

After all that rambling response, I wish you the best in your research and hope that some of those people who think they need to be defined by one gender or the other, or, worst of all, traits as defined by shallow parts of society, are able to find out who they are and not worry about those who think they should be one way or the other. Of course, that is until discrimination sets in but I know all about that as a man with a disability in a quite inaccessible city. Take care.",,,1,0,0,
ea669bfa-6a5a-41bb-a5f9-fd9f6f84ad7f,1493971609,"(Disclaimer: Not disabled myself, but doing my best to reflect what I have learned from disabled folks.  Comments from folks with disabilities who disagree with me should be prioritized over my comments!)

The short answer is: **neither one is wrong and both can be viewed as being respectful**.  Different communities (not to mention individuals) have histories of strongly preferring one over the other, so you should follow their lead if you know it.  For instance, folks with intellectual disabilities have a decades-long history of preferring **person-first language**, while the Deaf and Autistic communities have long histories of preferring **identity-first language**.

Part of the reason people disagree is a function of what they feel is implied by the terminology.  Identity-first proponents often feel that identity-first language more accurately reflects the **social model** of disability - that is, that disability is a function of society rather than the physical impairment.  They are disabled by society, not because their legs don't work - after all, if the restaurant has a ramp, one who uses a wheelchair can function in that restaurant just as well as someone who walks.  They can feel that person-first language can sort of connote that disability is something negative that you should be trying to minimize and maybe not talk about much.  [This article](https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/i-am-disabled-on-identity-first-versus-people-first-language/), with a slightly pro-identity-first lean, discusses these ideas decently well.

Given that both have long histories of being preferred by various groups, either one when used with respectful intent is respectful in the absence of context, neither is ""the bad version"" per se, and with more information, use whatever people or communities tell you they prefer!",,,1,0,0,

I do get weird/mean looks sometimes.  Sometimes I will walk very quickly from my car to the entrance of the store because I see someone smoking nearby or get out and there is something triggering in the air (construction, wood burning fireplaces, auto exhaust, etc...) - if I walk quickly I can generally get into the store while holding my breath and stave off disaster.

The issue with autistic people (and I am autistic) is that parents are prioritised over actually autistic people in communications. And some parents are good, but many go on and on about the tragedy of having an autistic child in a way that endorses cures and eugenics. So that's why there's a lot of feelings about it.

Here's the thing though. Whenever there's this debate about social identities and who has the right to speak, everyone wants to argue about why it is that people who don't have an identity shouldn't speak.

If we were talking about ice fishing and there were two people: one who'd read all the books about ice fishing and another who had been ice fishing their entire life, we wouldn't consider it ridiculous to go, ""Oh, so you've actually BEEN ice fishing your entire life"" and consider that person more of an authority than someone who's just read the books.

If you were to get advice about travelling somewhere, you'd probably want the word of someone who'd actually been there over someone who just read books about it.

So why is it that when it comes to an experience of a social identity, some are unwilling to see that *being* someone of that identity might give you more of an insight into that identity than someone who *doesn't*.

There's always more to think about, especially because intersections of identities will change the nature of those identities. I'm autistic but I'm also white. A POC autistic person will likely have a different experience of being an autistic than me. A bunch of different intersections will change experiences, but fundamentally, valuing the contributions of those who *have* that identity is not inherently some attack on the ability for people who don't have that identity to know or empathise.

Especially when it comes to autism where so many parents and families have dominated the conversation and actually autistic people have been shunted to the sidelines and ignored.

It's not about opinions being invalid. Someone who's read a book on Rome might know something about Rome than someone who lives there. But it's just about centreing and prioritising the experiences of people who actually have that identity over people who don't -- especially when historically the reverse has been true.  ",,,9,0,0,

One thing (potientially helpful, I hope) I've noticed about my friends who have had accidents or conditions strike them in young adult/adult life versus me and friends who have grown wheelchair-bound is that there's usually a big gap in expectations. People who are *struck* with this, having had little to no previous overlap with disability, often think the worst. Life is over, little will work, no job, etc. And (granted, this is specific to the United States), as someone who grew up both adjusting to disability and witnessing the effective transformation after the ADA act, the one thing I wish my friends adjusting would realize faster is that...so much still works out.

I am young so anticipated that it would be at this interval initially even though the judge's decision indicated at three years but I moved to a smaller county so I think that the Social Security office is a little bored or something so got this underway just a bit earlier-no problem guys, I'll keep you busy. 

Anyway, these reviews are routine meaning they are very common and actually should be expected although all of us probably have different ""schedules but that doesn't change anything in regard to how they rule. Remember, this time around the ""burden of proof"" if you will lies within the SSA's scope, not yours so they must prove that you have shown medical improvement and that it relates to your work and that there is substantial gainful activity (full-time work) that you can do. Even if you have experienced some improvement which can happen since disability grants us more access to medical care potentially, it still doesn't mean that you can work again so I would not worry too much about this as long as you submit the forms or any additional information on time and do maintain a relationship with a healthcare provider regularly. These really are such easy things to do that result in keeping the SSA happy. 

Respect their deadlines and believe me from personal experience, if something is slowing you down in regard to getting stuff in, just call and let them know. They may say you need to return everything within ten days on the mailed notice but really the law is not as such; I do believe you have 30 days from the notice and really, do not stress on this one...approval in somewhere in the 90-95% range and even if they rule differently, just like the initial process, the decision can be appealed. If that does happen and you end up hiring legal counsel at this point, as much as it sucks, I would have them stop paying you so that when you get re-approved, the legal fees will come out of the back pay and are usually a lot less than if you just pay for a lawyer.

What they are truly trying to ascertain from this ""exam"" is whether or not someone is malingering and whether they can manage their payments on their own. When I say they're determining if malingering is present, it means they're looking out for someone presenting exaggerated/non-existent symptoms, etc. I am sure there are also situations where mental health is more of the focus and I do know that your doctors' records are viewed ""above"" the medical evidence from one 30 minute appointment where the examiner can barely locate your file and call you by the correct name. 

Also, it stated on the notice and one other place that I could request to see the records from this exam and I finally gave up; it turned out to not be worth the hassle. It was a fight in that exam office to even get the person's name that conducted said exam. I live in San Diego, CA so probably they just shuffle us through like cattle.

If we acted out, the head nun would beat us.... -__- So, I can definitely understand the (affected) Quebecois d/Deaf people's anger and mistrust.

We used to be a de facto theocracy. The same institutions are in the control of the Church as in a de jure theocracy except that it isn't constitutionally mandated. Still, the Church controlled our schools, hospitals, told people who to vote for. This abruptly changed in 1960 when we took back control. It's not that far back so most of us have our grand-parents telling us horror stories about those days (some which contain crimes against humanity...).

While education reverted back to the government in most cases it wasn't so for the Deaf. The Church continued to be responsible for that until at least the 80s. So the history of abuse is much more recent.

And having a religious education often makes you very religious or very anti-theist. Hence why the Deaf are more divided on that than the Hearing.

Often religious indoctrination is hard to shake out. My grand-mother was pestered every week by the local priest who came to her house to tell her to have another kid even though the doctors told her it would kill her. She died still feeling guilty about not doing it.

&gt; Anyway, yeah. I read the section on the Quebec site for immigration about a month ago, about them wanting only immigrants who share their values, heh. I can see why -- much of the rest of Canadians, for starters, are just loud, nationalistic Americans who live north of the border! ��

Pretty much.

&gt; So I'd be a Republican in Canada because I'm essentially a more liberal, left wing Democrat in the US?

You'd be at least a progressive, that concept is the same.

Republicanism refers to two things. A political system under elected individuals rather than a constitutional monarchy (as Canada currently is). And also a system of values which is usually contrasted with the model of anglo-saxon liberalism (the system the RoC and the US is under). It's an emphasis on the collective identity over the individual identity (there is a global culture you are expected to be a part of). Of collective rights over individual rights. Of being a citizen over being a tax payer.

And liberal is mostly associated with the Liberal Party of Quebec which is our right-most non-fringe party.",,,2,0,0,

I was on Newstart with a Job capacity assessment from Centerlink advising &lt;15hrs per week of modified low-impact work. I was with a Disability Provider (Matchworks) and they reported my job seeking activities to centerlink - so I *assumed* they were working with centerlink to find me a job, keeping my disability in mind. They never organised any interviews, they were unable to help with finding jobs that I thought were appropriate (they would suggest red rooster constantly - I can't stand for long hours, I can't sweep floors, I'm heat intolerant, I didn't understand how that would be suitable work)

I'm also trying to get on DSP (Side note: Centerlink sent me a pension card last week saying DSP, but I'm still getting NS payments, The phone line has been busy every day, i'm really confused, going to head in when i'm physically able to ask what's happening) In March I had an appointment with a medical assessor and a social worker who reviewed all my medical evidence I brought in and agreed that it looked like I would be eligible and they got the process started but it will take a few years because I have a rare condition and the specialist can't see me till 2018.

The social worker said the first step is to actually get me into the ""disability stream"" with matchworks so they can find me work I can actually do, because at the moment they don't have official funding to manage my case as a disabled person.

Yeah, turns out matchworks had me in what centerlink calls ""Stream A"" which basically means ""vocational obstacles"" (ie: I can't find work because I have a lack of experience and qualifications"" which is why they kept pushing me to get my RSA -I'm allergic to alcohol, I can't work with alcohol, why would I get an RSA?) The Social worker explained I need to be in stream C or D, for someone with a moderate to severely limiting disability but *some* work capacity. (Stream B is for someone with a mildly limiting disability/some accommodations required: eg: sensory issues)

**In your case**: It sounds like your Job provider isn't syncing with centerlink properly, from the services they are providing, they are treating you as someone with no medical considerations. 

In addition to that, Your individual case manager is breaching privacy and is acting out of line by belittling yur condition and making jokes about other mental health conditions (eg: ""they might think your a psychopath."") Tell your Job Service Provider that you want a new case manager, and if you feel comfortable, report him for what he has said to you about other clients and your PTSD


Call/go into centerlink, ask for a list of services your job service provider should be offering given what centerlink understands of your disability/ condition - Chances are Centerlink thinks your JSP is giving you more help than your JSP has officially received funding to do.

Ask your JSP to honour the service letter from centerlink, If they don't, Go back to centerlink and request to be transferred to a JSP who can provide the appropriate services. 

If your doctor/PT/OT has prescribed workplace accommodations, in Aus, you are legally required to disclose this in the interview, your JSP case manager is jeopardising your ability to have your accommodation honoured by a future employer by advising you not to disclose your condition - You don not need to name your condition, But you do need to at least say ""Due to a medical condition, my doctor has prescribed some accommodations that allow me to successfully and efficiently perform my work duties. I have a disability job provider who can oversee and fund the introduction of these accommodations so it wont effect the company""

But like I said, If you are in Stream A, your JSP can't help with accommodations, You should be in stream B at least, But you'd be suprised how often JSP's do dodgey things with funding and their assesment paperwork.

Heck, I dislocated my knee falling out of my chair on the stairs in my JSP office (yes, the disability job provider has no ramp access - 'Stralya!) and I filled out an incident form - 2 weeks later when I asked for a copy of the incident form because my OT wanted it to be able to understand how i'd fallen and if it was something I could avoid, do you think they could locate the form? ""what form? When did you fall? are you sure that was here?""

I've lived and worked or studied in 6 cities across 4 different developed countries - one in Europe, one in Asia, Australia, and the US (where I currently live). I've been incredibly fortunate. But I also won't pretend to say that my capacity to move so freely has been facilitated by my field of employment is high-skill, high-education and high-pay. Simply put, if you're an in demand specialty occupation who can make a case that you're better at your job than any other available local applicant - that opens a lot of doors. Companies usually don't inherently *want* to hire a foreigner as visas are an absolute pain the butt but you can make it worth the effort. Of course I haven't gotten to this point in a vacuum. Supportive parents, early diagnosis, a good secondary education, access to healthcare - all are things that put me ahead in the giant lottery that is life. It has given me the resources to be in the position I am now, which is one that opens up a lot of possibilities that I know fully are not available to all. I've also spent a lot of time researching work visas (no point me moving to Canada, for example, because there's not a readily available visa program to facilitate me working there, regardless of the whole disability thing).

Which kind of brings me to a second point. Immigration rules have been tightening and doors have been closing for some time now. Countries don't want you - unless you can make a really compelling case to the contrary. Otherwise put, it's not about what 'you (or I) as the immigrant' wants. It's about what the faceless bureaucratic government at the other end wants. Moreover, immigration is inherently difficult. Starting from scratch in a new country, a new culture, sometimes a new language, not knowing anybody, everything works differently, finding new doctors, going through a fresh set of bureaucracy, having an emergency fund to get yourself 'home', keeping on the right side of everything ... I'm sure you know a decent amount of this from moving yourself. I've upped and moved a lot. Sometimes it has worked, and sometimes I've absolutely hated it. Two of the countries that I *thought* would be great, weren't a good fit for me at all!

I haven't made use of airport disability services other than skipping queues myself, but I know they're available. Contact the airport/airline ahead of time to ask what opportunities you have.

Some airlines have extendable hallways that lead straight to the plane's entrance, but that's not always the case, especially with smaller planes. When I fly, I have to take stairs or a lift down to the ground and then stairs back into the plane. 

If you can take the stairs up to the plane yourself, you'll likely be let on first so people won't be crowding around you. Alternatively, they can arrange for a mobile lift from the ground to the plane, but then they have to know ahead of time so they can be ready for you and avoid delays. Where I live that's the airport's responsibility rather than the airline's.

You'll also need to ask the airline where you can put your wheelchair/walker on the plane. Which are you planning on using in the airport? One of them may need to be checked in before boarding so it can be placed in the luggage hull. One or both may be stored in the cabin if it's collapsible/if there's room. You may also be seated in the front of the plane where the seats are easier to get in and out of.

Other than that, be prepared that most airports are huge, you'll need to walk pretty far if you're walking. I have to walk about a kilometer in Stansted airport London to get from the bus stops to the plane. Make sure to check the size requirements for what luggage you can take as carry-on and what you have to check in. If you need to check in any luggage or mobility aids, you should calculate extra time for that in case of queues. I have yet to encounter a disability priority queue for luggage check in, but I travel with my able-bodied girlfriend so I never asked.",,,5,0,0,

As far as I understand our process, it doesn't matter to the government if you are actually married or even a couple. There will be no inspector coming to check that (does that really happen in the US or is that a crazy thing I picked from Switched at Birth?). The thing the government does care about is that the sponser is financially on the hook for 3 years. If you get on unemployment or social security in the next three years, it is entirely out of your sponsor's pocket.

Once you are allowed in, you can get full healthcare coverage if you demonstrate to the government that you intend to stay in the province you are in (because healthcare is provincial).

Canada in general is harder to get into than the US (despite the media congratulating Justin Trudeau for tweeting otherwise) so good luck in your process.

If you want to get married in Quebec you'll need to be aware of the main differences with the rest of North America:

- Most marriages in Quebec are not religious ceremonies. You may go the religious route if you wish but piety is seen in a negative light. Similarly, a majority of newborns are not baptised. It used to be different as the older generation is religious but as they are passing out and thus not requiring that of their grand-kids, both traditions are going away.
- Absolutely any resident of the province can perform the ceremony so you can pick someone close that will add extra meaning to the ceremony to do it. You must inform the government 3 months in advance of who will do it. Priests, mayors and all are pre-approved.
- The tradition of adopting the husband name is considered sexist, thus against Quebec's charter of human rights and thus illegal. If you get married elsewhere and change your name, the government of Quebec will not acknowledge your new name.",,,4,0,0,

Everyone experiences anxiety and ""depression"" at times.  They work through it.  They will themselves through whatever emotional issues they experience.  And then when they see you not doing the same thing, to them it means you're lazy because they can't understand why you can't do it when they can.  I have the issues and I often can't understand why I can't do it.  So it's easy to understand why they couldn't understand.  But it's not up to them to decide if you're disabled or not.  That's what the professionals are for.  You didn't decide you are disabled.  You didn't decide that you qualify for financial assistance.  You applied for it and the professionals that are supposed to regulate it all agreed that you are one that needs help.  We shouldn't be ashamed.

What kind of person would sacrifice a life, a real life...family, career, etc. just so they could live off $800 a month?  What kind of sick person would do that?  That alone should be proof enough that there is something wrong when 95% of the population wouldn't do that.

As we get better at diagnosing not only mental health, but also disorders of the nervous system, like chronic pain, more and more people are realizing that, no matter their age, they too have an invisible disability.

His suggestions about speaking to employers are a bit controversial, but not entirely out of line. I often advise consumers who I work with that they do not need to reveal more than is needed to answer questions. That employers, landlords, etc... do not have a right to know your disabilities.   
If you ask for a reasonable accommodation, they do have the right to verify that need by getting a letter from one of your physicians in the relevant field, but even in that letter the disability need not be mentioned. Instead, the doctor simply states that, in their medical opinion, the accommodations requested are reasonable.

e8e9a173-ec1e-4835-9e3b-db832a168a37,1494584794,"Actually, I think the article was pretty fair on that front:

&gt; I support legal abortion and am not criticizing women who have made the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy because of a disabled fetus. There are situations in which the life of the child would be so painful and short that abortion would be the most compassionate option.

The fact that the author was trying to draw out is...

&gt; I do believe, however, that aborting a fetus with a disability should not be a given. In his book “Far From the Tree,” Andrew Solomon theorizes that families might abort fetuses if their sexual orientation could be determined. What he is touching upon is that there is sometimes a social and prejudicial component in the decision making. (We already know this danger is real; gender-selective abortions still take place in the hundreds of thousands in India and China each year, and in lesser numbers in dozens of countries across the globe.) Genetic testing should be given for the purpose of preparation and decision-making, not as a tool for predicting the quality of a child’s life.

And that's perfectly valid. I can't speak for you or your condition. Life is hell for most people with disabilities, but, depending on the disability, it's a very special kind of hell. However, the disability movement has been pushing a ""right to life"" stance of late, and there are some good reasons for it.  

First and foremost, the world is becoming more and more tolerant to disability. Don't get me wrong, it has a long way to go, but modern technology is helping people with disabilities do more with their lives, rather than feel as though they're useless deadweight. Something to be fawned over at home, forever treated like a child.  

But it's more than that. A lot of the convenient inventions that able-bodied people have grown to love have come from, you guessed it, people with disabilities, who invented those things in order to overcome challenges they face using everyday objects. We have people with disabilities, severe severe disabilities who are leading scientists, doctors, teachers, etc... they've all contributed as much as, if not more, than most able-bodied people, and they've done it from the unique perspective of someone who has had to fight the world just to exist.

This helps you document your disability is ongoing and not improving.

I can understand how you feel regarding the perception of your disability.  I sometimes joke that my dad is rolling over in his grave because I've applied for disability.  My dad only missed 6 days of work due to illness in 32 years he worked at his last job.  However, later in life, all of that stress and strain from working sick and never resting took a toll on him.  And to your specific problem, my wife has bipolar I and it has been a tough ride.  Mental illness is definitely a disabling condition.  My wife still has issues like waking up in the middle of the night frightened or having delusional thoughts.  She does best when she takes her medicine as the psychiatrist prescribes (lithium and Latuda).  If you don't feel stable, talk with your psychiatrist as soon as possible and discuss other options for your treatment.

I know it must hurt to have your friends and family be negative toward your condition.  As bad as I hate to say it, if your friends are treating you that way, are they really your friends?  It's easy for a complete stranger on reddit to say that, but it's a question you should consider.  Take advantage of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) in your area.  They often host workshops where you can learn more about mental illness and meet other folks who will be more supportive.  And if you are on SSDI, you can work as long as your earnings don't exceed around $1100 a month.  This might help you stabilize your living situation and allow you to meet new people.

There were three older people in the waiting room, and when I heard one of them talking about the disability pension process,  I asked her to share her experience. She looked at me and asked, ""Are you retiring?""  I replied ""My body retired me.""  She wasn't being rude, but it still bothered me.  I'm legally blind, but have enough sight to get around (most places, but wet floor signs try to kill me quite often) with out a white cane, so my disability is invisible most of the time.

You must feel out of place during therapy, just remember that illness affects people of all ages, not just the elderly.   You are making yourself stronger.  Getting stronger while taking care of your joints will improve the quality of your life.  So hold your head up high and do what you gotta do.  Like I tell my wife and mother-in-law, who are both self-conscious, if you knew how little attention most strangers actually pay to you, you'd probably feel more bummed out than before.  They probably think you're there doing rehab for an injury or post-surgery therapy.  

Regarding the bachelorette party, I think that was an incredibly insensitive thing the maid of honor said, especially if you are friends with her.  I can understand her talking about the cost if you RSVPed and backed out, but you shouldn't have to worry about financing anyone's night out.   I'd just tell her that some of your medications react to alcohol and that you have issues with your joints that prevent you from biking.  No need to go into much detail, but it should at least communicate that you're not just blowing off the party.   Quite frankly, I don't think you should pay anything toward the party if you do not attend unless that is your wedding gift.  But that's just me. I'm kind of old school. 

Keep doing what it takes to make your body healthier and improve your quality of life.  And if you are struggling with depression, seek counseling.  I've been trying to reframe my way of thinking about my disability.  Instead of dwelling on what I've lost, I try to focus on what I'm able to still do.  Some days I do better than others.  And some of these things require double the effort to do with my visual impairment.  But I could be stuck at home doing nothing, so it motivates me and it adds back a little normalcy to my life.

Her work credits make her unqualified for SSDI regardless on whether her physical illness disables her. 

However, she is possibly qualified for SSI. That is the other social security program and it is designed for people like your wife (and me) who do not have an adequate number of work credits to receive social security. The amount she would receive every month is less than what many people on SSDI receive, but people on SSDI receive money based on their work history and amount paid into social security, which she doesn't have enough of. 

There are people that lurk on this sub from SSA that often have very good answers, so take their advice over mine, but if none of them answer, re-apply but apply for SSI. 

There are no rules about work credits for SSI, only that you be disabled. There may be some issue with you being married and eligibility, I'm not entirely sure on that aspect, but I expect there are some answers on the SSA site when you start looking specifically at SSI.

On her loans. You can set those up on an ""income based"" or ""income contingent"" repayment plan. Now, if you have a high income, that will not help a ton, but it should affect her payments some if you are currently making standard loan payments. Call whoever holds her loans (consolidate if they are not already) and then talk to them about whether income based or income contingent is best for you. 

Once she is approved for disability, you can then do some other things with her loans. When she is approved, either within the 3-4 month initial period, or after a 3 year appeals process, you will be told how often her reviews will be. It's usually every 3, 5, or 7 years depending on what they decide. If they determine that she needs to be reviewed every 5 or 7 years, you can apply to have her student loans discharged based on permanent and total disability. If she gets a 3 year review, it's a bit more complicated.

With a three year review, she is not considered ""permanently and totally disabled"" by way of the department of ed and automatically eligible to discharge her loans. However, once she has medical records documenting her disability has lasted for 5 years and has a doctor willing to sign a relatively simple form that says she is expected to be disabled for the next five years, she can then file for a total and permanent student loan discharge. 

There are some tax complications with that. There is a three year monitoring period once the discharge is approved and then in the third year, the discharge is final (you don't make any payments in those three years). When it becomes final, the discharge amount is reported to the IRS as taxable income so you need to prepare for that and work with an accountant to offset that. There are ways to deal with it.

The point is, the loans do not have to hang around her neck forever. I just literally got approved for a $138k loan discharge last week. 

This process can be confusing and daunting and frustrating. Also intimidating and scary. There are good people in this sub and other places who are willing to help. If you apply for SSI and get denied, find a lawyer to help navigate the appeal. Very often, they can help speed things up a little bit.

So, if you are disabled to the point where you cannot work, or have a disability that is ""expensive"" letting you in under the health system is an immediate cost. Its ridiculous, but I suspect that many countries view it that way. 

For example, even the Western European countries that are openly accepting refugees are likely doing so with the (sometimes) grudging support of the population because people can see the humanitarian need involved. For someone to emigrate from the United States, while the healthcare situation might be sketchy, it is not Syria. Justifying taking on the healthcare burden of a bunch of Americans vs Syrians is kind of different in the eyes of the taxpayers I would guess. 

Again though, as the other person said, if you have a skill or a large savings I don't think those economic things necessarily apply because you can prove that you can support yourself and contribute to the economy.

There is also the lawyer option. It never hurts to contact an attorney. They will usually talk to you over the phone for a consult for free to see if they want your case. You may not get the best response there but I would certainly try with a few offices and see if anyone is willing to help. 

Hopefully someone else here has a clearer answer. ",,,1,0,0,

They want you to apply and then will be happy to take your case when/if you are denied. The reason for that is you start accruing payments from the date of application. So, when you are finally approved at a hearing (usually 20-36 months later), a lawyer gets a percentage (something like 25%) of that. 

It's economics. 

The application is available online though and as long as you have a decent sense of dates (or ranges of dates) when you have seen providers and been employed, you can fill out the application yourself. You don't need a lawyer for that. The sooner you fill out the application, the sooner your ""date"" is. 

Now, if you are still uncomfortable filling out the application alone, there are usually disability advocates who will help you at disability centers, community centers, mental health agencies, etc who are not lawyers but are familiar with the process. They help many people with the application.

The burden of the ADA is two sided:  The employee must request an accommodation (in your case, being allowed to use specific medications that show up on a drug screen).  The employer is required to grant that request unless they can prove that it would cause an undue hardship on the employer or company.

The employer is not allowed to ask things like ""What is/are his diagnoses?"" and ""Why is he taking these meds?""  No reputable medical person would answer those anyway, without your express permission, due to HIPAA.

IIRC, they cannot put the burden of hardship back on to you (or your medical team).   They must be able to show that your medication(s) would cause a problem for the job.

  If he tries to grab on to aspects of his old life that he can no longer do, try and help him find a new path.  Depression lay where the old ways died.  Life is not over, but it is damned different.  It took me around a year of depression to finally come to terms with my new body and then I took off like a rocket.  

  I wish it didn't take so long, because I found a lot of good once I got going.  Help him find a new way that invigorates him.  Any sense of purpose will help push away the feelings of uselessness.  Groups, activities, hobbies, whatever, just something.  For me it was educational volunteering.

  Know that he will probably have dark days.  Becoming disabled is a shock.  Hating the world here and there is actually healthy as long as he doesn't become consumed by it.  Anger and grief are part of it.  Sometimes, it's best to commiserate than to offer positivity.  You know him best, so you'll have to feel your way around that.

  Train whatever ability he has left.  If he pushes hard, he might be surprised at the things he learns to do on his own.  All of those things matter a LOT!  Any independence makes a person feel less of a burden, and a waste.  As an example, my lower body is useless, I trained my upper body to gorilla levels and regained quite a lot of independence.  It's become a point of pride.  His disability is different, so what he can do is based on that, but train whatever it is.

  And finally, for you.  It's hard to watch someone suffer.  He knows that too most likely.  He might feel ashamed of putting you through that.  Try and be patient, but also get some you time here and there.  It's hard, you'll need a break sometimes or you'll go mad.  

  Other than that, just try to be the couple you always have been.  The physicicality has changed, but the hearts don't have to.

  I'm missing my entire left leg and my right has been rendered useless, binding me to this chair.  From the very first day out from the hospital, I learned one thing.  Absolutely everyone stares.  Everywhere I go, everything I do out of the house, stares.  I've had a couple kids recoil from me even because I guess they didn't know how to act at the sight of someone like me.

  At first, I just stayed home and got depressed.  I became the very cripple everyone thought they saw.  It took me a year to pull out of the funk and start saying ""fuck it"".  I'm very glad I did.  Here's my tips.

  Repeat after me.  ""Fuck em!""  

  Others will never fully understand what you're going through, and if you're a good person, you don't want them to anyway, because that means they have to suffer as you have.  Come to accept this, and repeat ""fuck em"" in your head as many times as necessary.

  You still have a rich and full life ahead of you.  Do not let the thoughts of others deter you from the path you have chosen.  Chose self pride!  There will always be assholes who don't believe in your illness or what you suffer.  Even my one legged ass runs into them.  Do you anyway, despite judgement or dismissive attitudes.  Be proud in how you are trying to rise above.

  Doing the above may cause shuffling in your circle of friends.  You may lose some shitty ones you didn't see as shitty at first, but you'll gain more genuine ones who see the you behind the disability.  Believe me, you're better off.

  If at all possible, find a place or a group that has other disabled folks in it.  As corny as it sounds, it helps you feel like a part of something bigger, and that you're not alone in the world.  If it wasn't for my prosthetics place being so open, I never would have met other amps, let alone a fellow hip disarticulate.  It helped me more than I care to admit honestly.

  Biggest tip?  Keep giving a fuck.  Not about how you're seen, but about the world around you.  Keep caring about a better tomorrow, and never give up in pursuit of that.  

  One fighter to another, I wish you the best, and I hope something I said was helpful in any way.

  Take time to think about the weight that a baby has and movements you might need to do with that weight safely.  Train those movements and learn the best way to handle them.  Going by how you push yourself, I don't think you're a stranger to learning to overcome obstacles.

  Being in a chair makes you great for holding a swaddled baby.  Lots of closeness and touching helps bonding anyway, and you'll be happy to know that your chair might become your child's favorite place.  My daughter absolutely adores sitting in my chair with me.

  I'm sure you know about the every two hour feeding needs.  That's absolutely true all through the day and night.  Dividing the responsibility is harder as a disabled individual, but still crucial.  Find whatever ways suit you best in how you can handle 3 am feeding.  Sharing the load with your SO helps keep the madness at bay.

I'm much sicker now than I was during those 12 years, but it was *so* much worse to be less sick and have nobody believe me. Being treated like it's all in your head is maddening. 

Have you looked into Fibromyalgia? I know a lot of people still see it as a garbage bin diagnosis, but research is showing it is very real, and can be debilitating. You should also keep in mind that autoimmune disease is a sneaky bastard, and symptoms can manifest for a long time before  showing up on tests. I started having pain at age 14, and *knew* in my heart my problems were autoimmune, but didn't start testing positive until I was 26, and didn't get my diagnosis of autoimmune connective tissue disease until I was 29. 

My advice is keep a symptom log. Record your symptoms and activities, even your diet. Look for patterns that lead to symptom flares. Record video of your symptoms, your difficulties walking. Pain is one of the hardest symptoms for doctors to work with because it's something they can't see. So, give yourself as much ammunition as possible by having as much hard evidence as you can. A log is also theraputic; journaling is an outlet for the emotional slog created by chronic pain.

If there are seizures, then my advice is to start keeping a diary, if you don't already. If you can show the tribunal a long history of seizures with random intervals between then that is powerful testimony that will help no end.

Just because you were fine today, doesn't mean that tomorrow you won't be bedridden.

**Chairs:** It might be an idea to borrow, rent or purchase a cheap lightweight chair to start with. It can be very difficult to know exactly which choices to make when specifying a chair. You don't want to spend a lot of time, effort and money on getting a chair that isn't the best possible fit, but I found that until I'd used a chair for a few months, I didn't know exactly what I wanted or needed. You can get some good, cheap lightweight chairs these days.

When you know what you want/need, expect to pay a lot of money for a best-fit chair. In one way, the price of a chair is a lot for what you get, just a bunch of tubes with some wheels stuck on, but the chair will be his new legs and a very personal machine. Within a few weeks the chair will be seen as the best investment ever made.

Most chairs these days come apart easily and should fit into most vehicles. Look on YouTube at the many videos showing how people get about in the chair. It'll show you ways to do things that you wouldn't think of.

**Rims:** I found the standard rims too slippery and my fingers kept getting caught in the wheels. I now use Surge LT rims and they are so much better. Try out as many different systems as possible before putting good money into something.

**Gloves:** Some people use them, myself included, and others don't. It'll depend on where you live and how you use the chair. I'd get a pair of gloves to start with. I'd recommend fingerless gloves but with a full thumb. These give you some dexterity, allow you to operate touch screens, and keep dirt off the thumb.

**Bag:** You'll want a bag that fits over the back of the chair. Ideally it'll be a bag that he can reach into, by twisting around, or by reaching behind him. It needs to be a bag that can be put on and taken off with ease, and it needs to sit in the right position for him to reach. Luckily there are lots of quite cheap bags to try out. Expect the bag to be full of stuff before you leave the house. Don't be tempted to get bigger and bigger bags, one day he'll tip over backwards due to the heavy weight behind him.

**Indoors:** You'll need to make adjustments at home. Rather than widen doors, consider taking them off their hinges, it might be a lot cheaper and easier. Most things will be too high. Think about having a new sink put in at a lower level, and move things to lower level cupboards so he can get things himself. If you haven't got one, could you fit in a wetroom or walk-in shower. It would give an extra level of independence.",,,7,0,0,

I NEVER touch the wheels if I can avoid it; there's too much broken glass, poo, vomit, spilled food and other alien substances scattered in my path for me to ever want to come in contact with the tires. So I'm already at one remove from the tires on my current chair. If the rims were a much more elaborate system, where I could select a gear, perhaps on a central hub system, and the rims pushed the wheels via that central gearing system, I'd get the mechanical advantage that I long for.

I accept that the the wheel system would have to be completely different to the current system, but when a spare set of wheels costs over £500/$750 dollars for my current ""standard"" chair, then having to pay a lot for alternative wheels doesn't seem that big a deal to me. (I have actually got an alternate set of wheels for my current chair. They have off-road bike tires fitted on them.)

Perhaps a button on the central hub to disengage the gears like a clutch, then select a suitable gear and re-engage the gearing could be a simple solution. You'd still need the wheels to be engaged to the rim-gearing system at all times when you're propelling whether you were going forwards or backwards, so copying a normal bike's gearing system wouldn't work.

And you'd probably want something that made it easy to check that both wheels were in the same gear, although I can see some advantages to having the wheels in different gears, for example when you're traversing a slope and the downhill arm is doing all the work.",,,1,0,0,
00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1495700268,"Some more thoughts:

Take things slowly. Don't try and do too much. It's easy to overdo things and strain or sprain a muscle and be out of action for a few days. Everything is new, so give yourself lots of time to achieve something. Just because you've been to the grocery store before, it's a new way of doing things, so pretend you've never done it before and take it slowly.

Try to develop a questioning and open mind. Get out of the old way of thinking. For example, if you go to the cinema, try out all the cinema's you can reach. In my city there are 5, one is totally unsuitable for wheelchairs, one has the seats right at the front at the edges, one is too faraway from me, one has seat at the back at the edge and the fifth has seats right at the front in the middle. I go to the one with the seats at the front in the middle as this is the position that best suits me. It's not the nearest, or easiest to get to, but it gives the best overall experience.

Another example is going into the city centre. I live on the east side and used to walk then uphill into the centre. Now I take the bus to the west side of the city, where I'm at the top of the hill and can wheel down, visiting stores as I go, before catching a bus halfway down the hill that takes me home.

It takes effort to break down the old ways of thinking. Don't beat yourself up if you're having a bad day. We all have those. Try and treat every hardship as a learning exercise and try to think of different ways of doing things.

Be kind to yourself, and each other. It's going to be a difficult few years, but there's a good life waiting to be discovered, although there will be times when it doesn't seem like it. Slow down, be patient, vent your frustrations as needed, talk to each other a lot with honesty, and take on the world together.",,,8,0,0,

Going to the course is what convinced me that I needed a wheelchair. I'd been having problems with my feet, chronic pain, and the course was at a hospital 2 bus rides away, and the building the course was held in was at the furthest corner of the site, at least 1000 yards/metres away from the entrance. It took me a day to prepare to attend and then 2 days afterward to recover. That was 4 days out of the week, just to go to the course. Didn't seem worth it. BUT. It was being able to talk to the other people that made it worth it. There were about 20 of us and it was so good to be in a group that understood, that didn't judge, that shared experiences. (And I finally realised that I would never be able to walk any great distance ever again and it was time for a wheelchair.)

And, yes, there was a book, and I knew most of what it contained before I went and learned almost nothing from the book. But, if the book had even hinted that ""we cause our medical problems"" there would have been blood on the floor. That level of ignorance is astounding in this day and age.

What the course really lacked was any psychological support - different department - and those giving the course knew this was a weakness, but they thought something is better than nothing. However, the support from fellow sufferers helped a lot.

The second best bit of the course were the physical exercises, based on tai chi and qigong. They showed me that I could still move the majority of my body without inducing pain and helped ""focus"" the pain back into my feet, when it had been taking over all of my body before the course.

**Reddit**

Well, the internet in general. I'm so thankful that I live in the Internet age. When I was house-bound I could order everything online and have it delivered. But, more importantly, I could research my conditions and find out the latest treatments and options. But, top of my list, is finding out I'm not alone, that there others out there who face the same problems. The silent sufferers who had a place to talk about their lives.

On Reddit I only follow ""wheelchairs"" and ""disability"", but I'll trawl through the top 300 or so popular items every few days, reading threads that interest me. What I find of value is that nobody on Reddit can keep to the subject of the thread. So, in the middle of a thread about a film you'll suddenly come across people talking about their disability problems, or how American banks work, or who the greatest murderer was. I like the random nature of Reddit. Over time, I've picked up bits and pieces that question the accepted reality, that the social norms are not so norm as the majority think.

The best ""advice"" I could give would be to read widely, have an open mind, and try to question your reality. For example, think of a time that you felt really embarrassed about something. Now think of a time when a relative stranger was really embarrassed about something. I'll bet a lot of money that you could think of a dozen times your were really embarrassed, but you'd be struggling to remember any time you saw a stranger embarrassed. I came across this in a random Reddit thread and the message I took from it was that most strangers don't really care about me, and any interaction is brief, transitory and soon forgotten by them, so I might as well forget about it too. One less fax given.

Also, with Reddit, you see the same messages again and again. Often that's really boring, but I find it good to be frequently reminded that many disabilities are invisible and that NOBODY has a right to judge you without walking a mile in your shoes first. One less fax given.",,,1,0,0,

At the moment, I find that the surface material and makeup have the greatest bearing on the effort I expend. Rarely do I find a continuous smooth surface to roll over when I'm outside. Often, if it's a ""smooth"" surface it's a form of Tarmac and it's quite rough and has a high resistance to rolling. I really notice when I transition to the occasional stretch of smooth surface. More often, I'm rolling over paving slabs, usually unevenly laid, or bricks or even cobbles. If it's Tarmac, it's probably been dug up a few times so that the surface has patches. And then there are gratings and metal covers and other covers for holes in the grounds. Overall it's usually quite an uneven surface I'm going over. At anything above a slow walking speed, I find that the vibration can get really jarring, so I'd welcome some suspension.

I was thinking about this based on bicycle technology. When I was young there was no such thing as suspension, not even springs on the seats. But now I often see bikes with front fork suspension and sprung seats. If it was possible to find a sweet spot between adding rolling resistance and damping down the worst of the bumps in the road, I'd be happy to be the guinea pig that trialled the solutions, and I'd be willing to pay for a smoother ride.",,,1,0,0,
00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1496220385,"First of all, know your rights. Find out what the law says about you. This will take a while as you search out all the various laws that apply to people with disabilities. Also, find out what the university policies are regarding disabilities. If the university has a department aimed at helping people with disabilities, go talk to them. Also, approach your department directly so that you can explain your disabilities to them and ask for reasonable accommodations, such as lecturers not pointing you out for a speech impediment, or arriving late to class due to mobility issues. (I took one of my lecturers to task with his department for singling me out when I had to leave a class to go to the toilet due to a gut issue. He should have known better and was told that he was clearly in the wrong and not to do it again. He never said anything about me leaving his classes again.)

So, once you know your rights, both due to the law and the university's policies and any agreements you've set up, it's time to get salty and belligerent. Nobody but you knows what it's like to have the health issues you do. Nobody has the right to judge you. Nobody. If you have genuine issues, you need genuine adjustments to accommodate your needs.

You're going to have to change how you react to the world around you. You're going to be less polite to some people. If someone is nice to you, then you be nice to them. If someone is a jerk, then you be a jerk back. If someone is bringing you down, drop them. You don't need that weight on your shoulders.

So, you have classmates that are judging you. Well they can fuck right off. You don't need them. You're there to study. (Hopefully it's only a few ignorant fucks, and they'll still be ignorant fucks when they die many years from now. You should feel sorry for them for how badly they've already failed at life.)

If it's the lecturer who's giving you a hard time, well report him to his department, or the school the department belongs to, or to the HR department of the university, or the student union, or the accessibility department. (Sorry, this bit's vague as I don't know how your university is set up.) This is where your rights in law and agreements with the university come into play. Take no shit from some sad-ass lecturer who thinks they're better than you. Usually the merest hint of a disability law suit will bring a positive change in the situation.

You already know that using crutches, or in my case using a wheelchair, is not the ""easy"" option. You'd rather walk unaided. You'd rather be normal and fit in. But that isn't going to happen. Some people will be very helpful, others will help a little, and others will be sad bastards with no empathy. Life is going to be difficult enough getting through a world designed for the young, fit and healthy, so all those sad bastards can just fuck right off, you don't need them in your life and they're just dead weight to you. The only opinion that matters is yours.

If anyone thinks that you're faking it, drop them. You'll find others who are much nicer people. Many people you'll only meet once, in a store or on a bus, and you can ignore them. Others you might know for a year or two, and you can ignore them most of the time. Those that you'll know for many years to come have to be worth your time and if they're not nice, then fuck them.

Not giving a fuck means putting yourself first. It means being selfish. It means being brutal sometimes. It means being abnormal in how you treat relationships of all types. You're going to have to drop some friends and acquaintances, and you're going to have to keep shedding acquaintances for the rest of your life. But all these people aren't worth your time. 

Not giving a fuck does not mean being mean to everyone, not being a giving, loving, caring person. Put yourself first. Take care of your own mental health. Then put time and effort into those friends who accept you for who you are, friends who remember to take into account that you can't go on a wilderness hike, or a 20 mile bicycle ride, or any of the other stuff you're not able to do.

Not giving a fuck means you don't have to be polite to everyone all the time. If someone is a jerk then treat them like that. If someone is kind then respond the same way. I find most people are nice, some are just having a bad day themselves, but others are jerks.

The hardest lesson is learning to,

&gt;Let it go, let it go

&gt;Turn away and slam the door

&gt;I don't care

&gt;what they're going to say

&gt;Let the storm rage on.

&gt;The cold never bothered me anyway

&gt;It's funny how some distance

&gt;Makes everything seem small

&gt;And the fears that once controlled me

&gt;Can't get to me at all

You have to learn to stop thinking about all the small troubles in your life. If the guy at the coffee shop was a pain in the ass, Let It Go. If someone doesn't give you a seat on a bus, Let It Go. If a lecturer gives you grief for being late to his class then nail his ass to the wall. It's not easy, but learning to focus on the big issues in your life can help make the small stuff unimportant.

It takes time to learn to not give a fuck, but I find it gets easier the more you practice. It felt really awkward and disrespectful and antisocial when I started, but now I've got people around me I like, there's nobody close to me who's a jerk and the jerks I do meet on a daily basis are like water off a ducks back to me, they're just a fleeting event in an otherwise OK life.",,,4,0,0,

Firstly, his previous life is over, finished. Don't try and live in the past. It's a new world now, and things work differently. It sounds a bit harsh, but the sooner you and he give up your past life, the quicker you'll adapt to your new life.

And here's the good news, your new life can be just as good, if not better, than your old life. Yes, things work differently, but they work. You might have to walk to the end of the street to be able to cross over, or go around to the other side of a building to get in, but that's OK. You'll learn how to get about, in different ways, enjoy old activities, in different ways, enjoy new activities and find yourself in a parallel world you never knew existed.

It will be hard to start with, physically, and mentally will be a challenge for many years. It might not seem it, right at the start, but using a chair becomes much easier with time.

I was so used to not going out that I'd not thought much about how weather and a wheelchair would mix.

But that still leaves the problem of getting wet, and sitting in a puddle all day. The answer for me was to buy waterproof clothes, trousers and jackets.

Something like 67% of tribunals rule in favour of the claimant, so your chances are good. I know how scary and stressful the process is, but hang in there. The odds are in your favour.

Now, **go to Citizens Advice,** if you haven't already. They helped me enormously. They have specialists who can tell you what to include, what not to include and what the best wording is. Sometimes they will attend the hearing with you, but usually not.

What to include? Initially I'd say everything. You'll have filled in pages of forms already and that will all be passed on to the tribunal, so you don't need to repeat any of that. One of the important things in the process is that the DWP **must** write to you, possibly via the tribunal, and explain exactly why they turned down your application. Once you know why they turned you down, you can write a rebuttal that addresses their points. This is an absolute must. However, you will be given a chance in the hearing to explain what your life is like.

In the rebuttal that you'll write, just explain clearly how your life is affected by your conditions. Can you go anywhere at any time and do anything? No, probably not. So explain what limits your freedom. Don't assume that the reader will understand the medical implications of anything. Imagine you have a condition shared with only a dozen people in the world. Would you expect a magistrate to know anything about living with such a rare condition? No. Well, that's what it's like for almost every condition that you have. So explain how each condition limits your choices, and then you'll have a chance to answer questions in the hearing that will focus on these limitations.

Now, you will want to find out what the qualifications of the ""medical professional"" who conducted your assessment are. The DWP supposedly base a lot of its decision on that person's opinion. In my case, my assessment was done by a physiotherapist. This person knew nothing about mental health conditions, almost missed my heart problems, and clearly knew nothing about my gastric issues. So don't feel bad that someone says you're OK when you're not. They might just be an ignorant money-grabber who's doing these assessments to make some easy money.

Include any new information you may have, such as new appointments with specialists, but don't feel bad if there's nothing new to add. In my case I felt that the three people at the hearing had at least read the paperwork and that it wasn't just a box-ticking exercise.

This has turned into a long ramble, but I am speaking from experience. My hearing was in the middle of 2016, and my award lasts until 2019, so I do know of what I'm rambling about. If you want to, please feel free to DM me and we can chat in private. It's a tough process. The government want it that way. But hang in there.

My first advice would be, document everything you can remember; what happened, when, where, who was there, what was said, what was done. Write down as much detail as possible.

And, yes, you might lose your education over this. In the short term. But if you're right, then 10 years down the line you'll have your education and nobody will care - except for the (hopefully) out of work lecturer.",,,5,0,0,

There are many times, I've realised, when I really, really don't want to listen to other people, hence the headphones. Are you ever tempted to just switch off the implant and let the world slide past you? 

Where I live - Yorkshire, UK - there isn't any effort put in to psychological support for chronic conditions. Instead, I've had to find my own ways of giving up my effs. It would have helped me a lot if there had been someone to help me short-circuit the process and go from being very self-conscious straight to sod the lot of you in just a few days or weeks.

**Clothing** Get rid of anything with baggy sleeves. At best the sleeves will drag on the wheels, get very grimy and very scuffed. At worst the sleeves will catch in the wheels and possible wrench a shoulder.

Also, if he wears anything that closes at the front, like a zip-up hoodie, or a jacket, then he'll want to keep that closed in case the flaps catch in the wheels when it's undone. I've caught a few of my hoodies in the wheels before now.

While he still has legs (which is not something I feel comfortable writing, but I'm trying to be honest here) consider buying pants with longer legs. When you sit down pants legs ride up the calf, showing everyone a slice of bare leg, the top of a sock and the whole shoe. I feel it's more dignified to have a longer pant leg that reaches the shoe.

Pockets are now mostly useless. Look to buy a cross-body shoulder strap bag. It just needs to be a small bag, big enough for keys, wallet, phone and the like. With a cross-body strap the bag is hard to steal and important items are close to hand.",,,6,0,0,

What you describe is textbook for so many things and the last thing you want to do is waste a few years thinking it's bipolar only to have that change to something else and so on. You mentioned that there are still several things that don't add up so my advice is to be prudent, use your own intuition to substantiate any diagnosis, and to get second and third opinions now rather than waiting for a few years while spinning wbeels on something that someone likey could have diagnosed simply from reading what you wrote here today. Don't let the relief in having an answer ruin your life when it's not the correct one to begin with. Take charge, research the hell out of your symptoms, and don't just accept the answers given. Interrogate your doctor as to exactly why they diagnose a certain thing and if there are holes in it then do not accept the diagnosis unless those holes can be filled or an explanation as to why it is ok for them to remain. You should have a complete understanding and have complete confidence..  anything less would tell me that you will likely see that diagnosis change several times and the next thing you know it has been ten years and you'll find you are here with the same type questions..  and you think you are frustrated now...",,,1,0,0,

If you can, seek out regular counseling with an applicable to your condition community support group (there are many.) You also want to reply to any requests made by your insurer as avoiding or forgetting is their easy way to stop payment. Essentially you need to hope for the best but plan for the worst. Build an army that will have your back as big as you can and remember that, if you are truly ill, that things should go smoothly. The fear you have is there by design as it deters those who are not truthfully ill from abusing disability insurance. Insurance companies will not make it seem like a walk in the park for this reason even if making it more frustrating for those who truly are. It may be a few years before you begin to stop feeling that anxiety over this should you remain ill, but there will come a day where your insurer suddenly starts sounding more reasonable and supportive and you will start to feel secure again",,,3,0,0,

Look at it this way; when someone gets cancer (we'll call her ""cancer Carol"") nobody would begin to think that cancer Carol has the ability to control her cancer. Instead, she needs a team of doctors and support along with heaps of chemotherapy and other medical intervention. If cancer Carol get's better, it's because that intervention was a success. If cancer Carol dies, then it's because of the cancer, not a result of Carol. When it comes to ""depression Donna,"" well the majority would probably think she has the power to control her illness herself alone, unlike cancer Carol. If depression Donna gets better, she too would not get credit as it would go to the intervention as was the case with cancer Carol, yet if depression Donna dies, unlike cancer Carol, most would simply place that blame directly onto Donna herself while forgetting about the monster/illness all-together. You must allow yourself to believe that what you have is a disease. It is a foreign enemy that has gained control of you and that you deserve the same as cancer Carol with terms to beating it as well as the understanding from others to know that your actions are sometimes not a result of you, but rather your illness. The guilt you feel after missing an appointment doesnt sound like it should be your burden to bare. These things, the way you sometimes behave or feel, are the results of that in which is trying to control you. The sadness, anger, grief, tiredness that you often feel isn't you. No, you know you would not feel this if you got to choose. This is because these are not your feelings. You feel these things because you are sick with a very serious and real illness. You are not messed up or faulty in your head and once you beat this terrible thing, you will be able to see that a lot of what you personalize as being you today, was never you to begin with. When you make mistakes, act in a way that isnt you, feel things you know are not your choice, try to have it in your the fight left to blame the illness, like Carol get's to blame the cancer when she is less than herself. Make no apologies for the things you know are not a result of who you truly are and if others can't see that, then who cares; it's about you right now. I often compare cancer to mental illness with the way people are expected to act and what society expects from those suffering from each. People often say that it is wrong to compare the two... I can see this. I know the devastating effects of cancer, but I also know that 5 members of my immediate family would perhaps still be with us today if it was cancer they had suffered with.

Not only is mental illness not fully understood by even those who practice to treat it, but stigma and the common attitude amongst most folk will leave most of those suffering from it in a battle fought alone. There won't be the team of doctors and nurses cheering you on, nor will there be the facebook pages created by family and friends to offer support towards the fight. You won't be showered with flowers and kind notes of encouragement and you'll find that friends and loved ones aren't putting much thought into your situation enough to fill your email with things they may have read regarding your condition or new forms of treatment online. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Imagine what you would say if you could go back and visit yourself as a child. Would that child be confused over  how things are turning out? Would they accept it so easily as those therapists had suggested you do... ""sorry, kid, forget those hopes and dreams for yourself because it ain't for you... You have to accept it."" That child would probably say that you were not them, no way. Would be a smart child if they did because nobody would choose this. It's one thing to feel sadness over the loss of a family member; that's normal and we do choose that feeling in order to deal with the grief whether we are aware of that choice or not. With depression, it's there regardless and that is what sets the two apart. You can't talk yourself out of it just like you can't talk yourself out of any other illness or disease. You have to kill it, not yourself, but first you have to believe yourself that there is something there to kill in the first place... and then you can focus on doing just that. ",,,2,0,0,

False. I have allowed people on less than that, and even if they're denied at initial, at recon I have reversed the decision if I think a person's work history and exam reports are consistent. 

""statements from your doctor that state you're not able to function in a work environment.""

These are worthless to an examiner, unless the doctor gives an extensive explanation why, and backs it up with their findings of fact, which they NEVER do. A simple statement, or the forms reps send in just make us roll our eyes.

""Even then, expect you'll get denied multiple times. That's how the system works for everyone, unfortunately.""

False. I have roughly a 50% allowance rate, and my state has one of the highest allowance rates in the US. In my state, if you get denied multiple times, you aren't disabled. We also have a much higher OQR review rate because we're such a small state, population-wise. Because we are so heavily scrutinized, we work very hard. It is not this way in every state.

Having an attorney at the Initial and Reconsideration levels gives you no advantage, and they probably won't do much work on your case (not enough for how much they would get paid).

If you are worried about the deadlines and getting the paperwork in, I would enlist the help of a family member or close friend who can assist you with keeping track of everything. If you ask them to be put in your file as a third party contact (there was a question on the application for it) they can speak directly to SSA if they need to. 

People will tell you that you need a lawyer to get approved, or they only got approved after they got a lawyer, but those are correlation anecdotes. The attorney wasn't' the reason they were approved, but because both happened simultaneously they assume that it is. 

The ALJ is not the highest level of appeals. After the ALJ you can appeal to the Appeals Council (similar to the reconsideration level but for judges) and then to Federal Court. You'd need an attorney to go to the Federal Court level. 

Or you can chose to re-file again (rather than appeal) at any stage, but that means you have to give up your appeal rights on the first claim.

If you mention during the interview it can be a sticky situation because they may decide not to hire you. While it is illegal to discriminate because of the disability, you'd have a hard time proving it. 

I will say this though, as something to think about, do you think the job is a good fit with regards to your accommodations? Think of it from your employers perspective, what are they going to have to do to accommodate you. If you seek out a job in which you won't be able to perform most of the work because of your disability, then your employer will be none too happy about it and will likely try to find other ways to get rid of you. But if its really not a big thing, then speaking up earlier is better. 

An example of what I'm talking about - lets say that you can't lift over 20lbs. If the bulk of your job is lifting 30+ pounds, then that is a situation where I might reconsider the job because your employer is likely going to have to either hire someone else to help or make someone do the extra work. But if you got a job in say, a convenience store, that might only require a second person in the store to lift a few of the heavier boxes a few times per day.

The employee is not the one that determines the ""reasonable""-ness of the accommodation. If your accommodation puts undue burden on your employer, they do not have to grant it. They are also allowed to provide smaller accommodations to start with. If you say you need to work from home, they can ask that you start with a flexible schedule first to see if that solves the problems.

To your marriage question - if she is on SSDI your income/assets won't affect her check. How much she would get depends on a lot of factors, but if she makes a mysocialsecurity account online it will tell her. 

I just want to address your vision for a second, because you brought it up. Being legally blind in one eye is not considered disabling for SSA standards. You are working full time successfully right now. While not being able to drive may be an obstacle for employment, the SSA rules do not take the ability to get to work into consideration. SSA standards for vision are based on the *better* eye. Generally speaking your best corrected visual acuity would need to be worse than 20/200 or your visual fields would have to be significantly reduced.

You could not be more wrong about what's happening here. 

Your SSA Disability Examiner is the one who gets to determine whether or not your illness impacts your ability to be gainfully employed, _not your doctor_. Your doctor decides how severe your condition is, and can *acknowledge* it's impact on your life and employment. The SSA does not simply accept your physician's word that you can't be gainfully employed, they just view that as one piece of data. That is why multiple sources of documentation are so goddamn important. Provide them with so many professional opinions and notes that they can't help but be convinced.

This is about bureaucracy and knowing how to manage it properly -- nothing else. You do what SSA tells you to do so that you aren't trampled by the bureaucracy and you get to keep your SSDI. Riding a high horse is meaningless if the result of doing so means you can't afford to feed him anymore. 

&gt; Wouldn't someone that can go out to doctor appointments be in better mental health than one that cancels due to anxiety issues?

You're confusing what something is with what something looks like. We are talking about what you need to do to provide *proof*, not debating the merits of treatment options. 

You only appear to be in worse health than someone attending their appointments if you're having in-home or therapy over the phone. If you aren't, then he looks worse off because he actually *is* going to therapy and you simply aren't. If you aren't doing phone appointments, then who is going to tell them that you can't leave the house to get to therapy? You? Your word doesn't count with the SSA. Your psychiatrist? Maybe, except his word won't count much on this subject since you *are* leaving the house to see him. 

From the outside, you just look like you've improved enough that you don't need therapy any more.


&gt; And if they approved me without an appeal, doesn't that say something about the severity of my condition?

You are missing the fact that you have to be *reapproved* every 1,2,3,5, or 7 years depending on your case. 

If you were approved without appeal, that's great. But your recert is dependent on you providing them with enough proof that they believe your condition has not improved. If you were seeing a number of doctors, had tests done, treatments, meds,  and hospitalizations for the years leading up to when you were approved, it shouldn't appear to have decreased substantially once you got approved for SSDI. If you suddenly drop down to one doctor's appointment every 2 months, it will *appear to an outsider* that your condition has improved *dramatically*. That's all I'm saying. 

The SSA is absolutely not going to just take your word when you say you're too anxious to handle going to your doctors' appointments, because their response will be exactly what mine was -- you get out to see your psychiatrist. It will _appear to them_ that are doing much better.  Further, two doctors saying your are disabled is much more persuasive than one is. Their line of thinking will be that it's easy to find one doctor who will stretch the truth, but it's highly unlikely you'd find two from the same town who will. Your current situation (seeing one doctor infrequently) makes it quite possible that you'll be referred to the SSA doctor, which isn't great even if you have chronic disease.

&gt; I cancel an appointment and then try to reschedule and his next availability is 3 weeks out.  So, there is time inbetween visits that I don't always have control over.

If you start seeing a shrink and tell them that you are committed to treatment, they *will* work you into their schedule. When I started with my last shrink the situation was exactly the same as yours for rescheduling -- booked 3-4 weeks in advance. so they scheduled me 10 appointments in advance and put me in the cancellation list. I never had a week without an appointment because someone always cancelled, and then we got to the ones I'd scheduled far enough out that my same time was available every week. You may have burned this one so badly that you need to find a new one, though. 

Regardless, you're in a bad position because mental illnesses are stigmatized and hard to prove. You need piles of documentation to prove what I can prove with a letter and my wheelchair, and 6 psychiatrist appointments a year may very well not be enough for you to do that. (I'm assuming they're hour long -- if they are just 15min med-checks they are *completely* worthless.) As I said, I would never rely on just that if it were my life on the line.

&gt; They'd still find reasons to screw people over, wouldn't they?

The SSA isn't deliberately trying to fuck anyone. It's a flawed system without doubt, but there is no malice involved, and certainly not from the individual examiners themselves. You just need to *prove* that you're not better off now than when you were approved. But anyone can see how going from 3 appointments a month to one appointment every two months *looks* like a big improvement. 

There are shrinks who take in-home appointments. There are shrinks who will do appointments over the phone. You can almost certainly find a doctor who will use Skype for your appointments. You could schedule your appointments around other times when you have to leave the house.

I can't force you to try anything. I can just tell you that you will likely need substantially more documentation than you already have. I can tel you that moving forward with only what you have at the moment is gambling with your livelihood. I can point out that this is essentially the same thing that pretty much everyone else here has said to you. 

I can also point out that basically every comment you've made here has been about throwing up barriers to the advice you've been given. Yes, there is a small chance that what you have could be good enough, but why risk it? Especially when you can essentially guarantee reapproval by working out a way to talk to a doctor.

I'm not trying to be an asshole, though it may very well come off that way and I know that some other folks here will dislike my approach. But I want to make sure that you understand the potential ramifications of proceeding as you are, because if you are denied SSDI during your recert it will be entirely on your shoulders and not due to some malice of the SAA. 

Just find a shrink who will do phone appointments. Fuck.

Generally I'd say an MSW/LPC would be just as good, but you need documentation more than anything, and documentation from a psychologist is going to carry more weight. Proof that you are in and need ongoing counseling to keep a handle on your problems will be very helpful.

On the treatment side, maybe look up someone who is trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). It has been very helpful for a lot of people dealing with depression, anxiety, and bipolar-type conditions.",,,1,0,0,
e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1496002375,"I get that. Psychiatrists are not for therapy though. They deal with meds, which is why you don't see them more frequently. It's the psychologist you need to get in to see weekly so you can begin building your medical records.

Here's my point: you manage to get out to your psychiatrist, but you say you're too anxious to see a psychologist. What do you have to prove to me that your disorder is *still* so severe that you can't work? Almost nothing. You have occasional documentation from your psychiatrist, which is useful, but I'd say it maybe meets the bare minimum if they're being rather loose with the criteria -- assuming this is the same psychiatrist that did your original application and *still* believes you need to be on disability. If they aren't super supportive of you being on disability you have a real problem.

Mental illness is extremely hard to prove, thus the necessity for continued documentation. If you can't provide the documentation the SSA believes you should have for your disorders, then one of two things happens: 1) they kick you off unceremoniously, or 2) they're going to send you to a doctor of their choosing and ask him to decide, based on one visit, how severe and life-impairing your problems are. It's very unlikely that would go in your favor for a mental illness.

Like I said, the sparse psychiatrist notes could maybe possibly potentially maybe be enough for you, but I certainly wouldn't be comfortable relying on them if it were me.

If you can get out to see your psychiatrist, you can get out to see a psychologist. You can. And, again, phone appointments. Your means of living may very well depend on finding a way to make it happen.",,,2,0,0,
e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1495995691,"Yeah. And I understand that to some extent. I tend to do that with anything that involves leaving the house.

However, this is one of those blocks you have to push against until it breaks. Seeing a psychiatrist every two months makes it look like your problems *are being well controlled*. Shoot, the soccer-mom down the street with SAD sees her psychiatrist that often, as does the CEO who needs xanax to sleep. Even with diagnoses, it's not really much to rely on.

So, if you don't really need disability payments you can keep things the way they are. You may not be pushed off, but if they start pushing people off I'd say your assumption that you could be in the first few rounds is plausible. Figure out how to get to your shrink every week or so, and suddenly you have a large amount of documentation and a doctor who knows you well to back it up, and the chance you're pushed off goes way down.

Remember that you'll have your CDR at some point, and that is based on evidence that your disability hasn't improved/is continuing. It relies on the same documentation. You'll have to have it eventually.

There are other ways, I'm sure, but it seems like it would be beneficial for you to see a psychologist weekly-ish. Perhaps your doctor -- or another one locally -- would allow you to have appointments by phone? I don't know what the best solution is, but I do know that it's grounded in stacks of continuing documentation, and that you need to start thinking about how to develop that.

&gt; an employer cannot reject you because of information about your disability revealed by the medical examination, unless the reasons for rejection are job-related and necessary for the conduct of the employer's business. The employer cannot refuse to hire you because of your disability if you can perform the essential functions of the job with an accommodation.

and

&gt; The ADA permits an employer to refuse to hire an individual if she poses a direct threat to the health or safety of herself or others. A direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm. The determination that there is a direct threat must be based on objective, factual evidence regarding an individual's present ability to perform essential functions of a job. An employer cannot refuse to hire you because of a slightly increased risk or because of fears that there might be a significant risk sometime in the future. The employer must also consider whether a risk can be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level with a reasonable accommodation.

The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal nondiscrimination law and yes, according to them, it is illegal for a company to refuse to hire someone because of their disability unless the disability keeps them from doing the job.

&gt; The determination that a particular applicant or employee with a disability poses a direct threat must be based on an individualized assessment of the individual’s present ability to perform the essential functions of the job safely.

and 

&gt; A fact-specific inquiry into the nature of the workplace setting and the requirements of a position, as well as the best available objective evidence about a particular individual’s disability and its effect on health and safety, will be important in assessing whether a “direct threat” exists. The determination that an individual with a disability poses a direct threat to safety must be based on an individualized assessment of the employee's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. The decision must be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge rather than on speculation about what people with a particular impairment generally can do.

I am not arguing that a company has to hire a dangerous employee. I am arguing that they can't just refuse to hire someone based on a hunch or because an applicant's doctor won't state that they will take liability. If the applicant does not objectively present a direct threat and the employer refuses to hire them, they have committed illegal discrimination.",,,1,0,0,

Are you going to ask for proof? Because that would offend people. But if you don't ask for proof, everyone may just claim ADHD. I think that it is horrible that people abuse goodwill, but they do. Offering discounts to disabled groups who arrange beforehand would probably work, but that's not what you are asking. 
    
Also, think of what is the point of offering the discount? Child discounts are to encourage people to educate their kids. Senior/student discounts are based on the presumption (often faulty in the case of old people) that old people and students do not have as much discretionary income. So why give discounts to disabled people? Would it also be b/c they are presumed to have less discretionary income? That may be the case for many disabled people, but not necessarily for a family with a kid with ADHD or an adult with motor difficulties. 
    
So, personally, I don't think that it would be a good business decision, although it is a very nice thought. ",,,2,0,0,

Where I live, there are a LOT of old people with handicap passes. When the old person dies, their children and grandchildren take the passes and use them. This is VERY common here. So it has resulted in people who realize how important handicap spaces are for those who actually need them to call out or harass people who are parked in a handicap spot but are not obviously disabled. Great intentions, but this obviously isn't nice for people with invisible disabilities. 
    
I do not use a handicap pass. However, my recommendation to you is to use them. That's why they are there. You need it? Use it. If someone glares at you, smile and wave. If someone accosts you, tell them that you appreciate their wanting to make sure that the spaces are properly utilized and that the pass is yours. Maybe throw in there that your doctor only allows you to take X steps per day (even better if you have a fitbit to show them!), which is why you need the pass. If they want to know what's wrong with you, you can tell them (imagine their reactions when you say that you were born with only half of a heart!) or say that it's none of their business.
    
You are not alone in this. I also have an invisible disability that makes me worry about other's perceptions if I need accommodations for it. I'm not sure if you are aware of the George Takai ableist incident, but [here](https://girlwiththecane.com/george-takei-apologizes-for-posting-ableist-meme-c7969fc1337e) is a post about it if you are curious.

As far as faxing them - if their office is anything like mine, they're using terribly outdated equipment in ill-repair; if all of the pages *do* manage to print out, they will hate you a little  bit. 
You could also call the Virginia office handling the case and explain the situation - ask them if there is any way you can fax them directly into your electronic folder. It's not something generally done for claimants directly, but I don't know if it's against the rules (different type of office.) If they agreed, they would send you a cover sheet with a big bar code on it, and you would fax the records in under that cover sheet to a specific number they give you. ",,,2,0,0,

c994b5c6-8bbc-4f0c-8a88-385ea8922f08,1494641021,"&gt;but I was just wondering what average is for people and if they live off it. 

If it's SSDI it's directly related to the number of years you worked and the amount of earnings you had before you became disabled; it could be as little as $40/mo or over $2,000/mo. If it's SSI, it starts at $735 and is reduced for every bit of income you receive - including the rent-free housing you've discussed below. 

&gt;Second question I live with a friend who allowed me to stay with her. I was homeless before I met her. She says I can stay if I babysit her child and do dishes and stuff until I can pay. How does this work as living arrangements and income? Will they count my living arrangement as a free ride or homeless with a couch..? 

If she is not giving you actual money as payment, it would only be reduced by a maximum of I think $265/mo. (Sorry I'm not positive about that - I specialize in the other program.) The reason for this is that SSI is intended to help pay for only your most basic needs - if someone is already providing your shelter, you don't have to pay for that, and your payment is therefore reduced.
