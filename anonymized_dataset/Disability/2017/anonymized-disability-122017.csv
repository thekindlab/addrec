The important thing is that you are yourself and that your everyday experience is your normal. Others may not view it as their normal and you may sometimes feel the affects of that, but the important thing is you are a much stronger person then them for the experiences you have gone through and more importantly you are aware of the ableism and discrimination which somehow still permeates our 'modern' society and is deemed as somehow permissible.

This is super empowering as, at least for me, it allows me to not just be angry at a set of conditions I have (which is pointless) but instead be angry at a system which constantly creates limitations for me.

13fb1840-a41d-40be-9a17-5da6159bba33,1513973656,"You have a very difficult situation, one of which I've experienced before. However, in my times at community college and most recently, my state uni, they always put the onus on *me* to inform the instructor or the TAs (in the case of the state uni) that I have accommodations. 

In other words, you seem to have a unique situation in which your disability office is supposed to do the legwork for you -- which they failed to do. This is a 50-50 situation. When I know I need an accommodation for sure, I always verify that the relevant person got it and that they're going to comply. In your situation, you seem to have *assumed* (which you should never do in college) that things were going according to plan. And the other 50% of the blame lies squarely on the disability services for them not forwarding your accommodation to the professor. This is your strongest argument that you will want to exploit, if you decide to pursue this case. 

Here's my suggestion. Talk to your advisor, and director at disability services. Tell them what you told us. And ask for them to advocate on your behalf with the instructor because they made a boo boo by not forwarding your accommodation letter. If you've already done this, or you know they won't back you, then you can go at it alone. Speak to the dean of student services (theortically the boss of your disability director) and inform him/her that they dropped the ball, and that you have this situation, and you want some mediation. Make note that I never mentioned going to the dean of your English department. Why not? Because they always back the instructors. But feel free to talk to that person as well. 

And as brazen as it sounds, it would be a good idea, probably after knowing where your disability people stand (with you or not), that you inform the teacher that you will contest the grade to the highiest levels possible (like the example of talking to a dean of the college). You need to have what they call chutzpah. Most instructors prey on the power imbalance, and run their classes like dictators, but they're always accountable to someone. And like most humans, at the end of the day, they don't want a headache/issue to take away days or weeks of their life. You might make this obstinate instructor cave just by showing her that you won't go down without a fight.

334191eb-4e83-4c09-adbd-ec6f151e62f7,1514147452,"Not knowing exactly why you need a tricycle instead of a bicycle, it is hard to recommend a certain type of tricycle over another one.

* **Bicycle with training wheels** are probably the worst with regard to lateral stability. And if you travel on uneven grounds, you are likely to stand on the training wheels and have your drive wheel spin in the air. Any kind of tricycle is better than that. Even adult training wheels are less interesting than other options below.

*  **A tricycle with 2 rear wheels** like the one you pictured is probably your cheapest option. There are two drawbacks to these:

– Worksman tricycles are generally strong but heavy. You won't ruin it unless you try really hard, but you won't ride at record speeds anyways.

– If you have coordination issues and can't spin your pedals very well, you might find the low gear isn't low enough. If that's the case, you might ask the bike shop to replace the cog (the toothed sprocket on the rear wheel) by a larger cog. A larger cog makes the low gear lower and easier to use, but it also makes your top speed a bit slower.

– Stability has its limits. While the Worksman tricycle is very stable, you can't turn corners at full speed. I know there aren't too many hills in Florida, but slow down if you want to turn a corner.

* **A tricycle with 2 front wheels** is often called a ""tadpole tricycle"". It is by far the most stable, the fastest... and the most expensive. I would suggest it might be your second tricycle if you find you enjoy it a lot and want to ride really fast. A tadpole tricycle is often faster than a regular road bike. But don't go there first as it is useless to spend a few thousand dollars unless you really enjoy cycling. If you want to investigate more in that field, check for ""recumbrent tricycles"" (or recumbrent bicycles in general); one good brand (also $$$) is Greenspeed.

dc790e88-034f-43d3-9c7e-5ead2efdff19,1513134473,"It's been a while since I've had to run the numbers on Social Security Disability so these are ballpark numbers and my advice so here goes:

You can still get your disability checks AND make as much money during your trial work period for around 6 months I believe.

You can still get your benefits AND work if you earn less than their max income amount. I believe it was around 14 dollars an hour at 20 hours a week.

I'm sure these numbers have changed. I would suggest to go down to your nearest Social Security office when you get your first pay stub so they have your work information.

A couple things that can get tricky.

1. If you live off of disability income this is not taxed. When you start working and still receiving disability income for your trial period, your disability income is now taxable so you will have to pay taxes on your 6 months worth of disability payments so save up for this.

2. If you decide that you can not continue working I would provide doctors notes to your local social security office stating why you can not continue work. Otherwise, it's up to someone deep within the bowels of the Social Security department to come up an arbitrary call that might go against you. It's happened to me. They determined that I should have been able to work when I could not and that I should not have received disability payments so I owed them.

It's been a while but I believe that your disability work trial period resets every 2 years but need clarification on this.

If you are permanently disabled you can still work, have employer insurance and still receive medicaid/care but then you have additional premiums which may or may not help. 

Like I said, I would highly suggest going to your local office and ask questions or visit their website.

Good luck. Hope things work out for you.",,,2,0,0,

I was thinking about going back to school for another degree, but a quick assessment squashed that idea.  The overwhelming majority of my disabled friends are either self-employed or unemployed.  The ones who DO have jobs had them before the onset of whatever has left them disabled (and it wouldn't be good PR for the company to dump them after.)

Anyway, a friend of mine (who also has a spinal injury) has a business degree and recently applied for 30 jobs.  He didn't get one call back.  Of course, he made the fatal mistake of mentioning in his resume that he recently sustained a spinal injury.  The kiss of social death!

I did the online dating charade for about a year.

They put my sister &amp; my niece in a cabin that was close to the main area (after ok that she was ok w/extra people noise). They had a bunch of her medical supplies in a secure storage room close by so when they needed them they just had to ask. They went out of their way to help as much as they could. When my sister had take take my niece back to the room before dinner had even been ordered one night the waiter put together a bunch of things for my sister to eat that he noticed she liked (she loves fresh carrots, but they come w/other veggies so he only got the carrots and lots of them, plus 2 of their hot fudge volcano cakes w/Ice cream on the side). 

I know my sister had to do a lot of calling ahead of time to make sure it was all ok and ready. Bonus: we were allowed on as soon as we checked in and could get off whenever we were ready at the end of the trip. 

ETA: Id definitely have him try a shorter cruise like the Catalina one first. I don’t know if they provide someone to help the whole time, but if they did it’d probably be very expensive. Any medical type stuff on cruises is pricey. Might be worth getting a trusted friend to go with. ",,,5,0,0,

I’d say that you want a center wheel drive. The front wheel drives are not as nice for everyday use in my opinion. 

You’re also basically looking at a Permobile or a Quantum for your chair manufacturer — they’re the best. Permobile has always been really nice, and their equipment is very modular in case you need to make adjustments later. 

However, Quantum redesigned their flagship chair a couple years ago. It’s now the Quantum Q6 Edge 2.0. They kept all of the great features and solidness of the Q6 Edge, but they gave it a sleeker and more modern look. They also copied most of the important parts of Permobile’s modularity by incorporating more, longer, and better accessory rails, and by installing multiple user-adjustable settings especially in the seat and back areas. It’s the best of both worlds in my opinion, and I really love mine.

*That being said*, if you are someone who needs to put a lot of weight on the armrests, the Edge 2.0 may not be best. The armrests are supported along the back of the chair, rather than from underneath, so they just aren’t as strong, you shouldn’t really need to put a ton of weight on them, though, because the modular transfer handles can be placed virtually anywhere on the chair, and are super sturdy.

I love my Edge 2.0. I enjoyed the Permobile that I had for a while, but I’m very glad that I got the one I did.

$25 a month for housing?!  Didn't even know that was an option!  30% of your income is not bad either!!!  I believe SSI in this state is like $740/month.

I am in the U.K. I am currently not using a wheelchair. I would definitely need an electric one because my cells are damaged. I wasn’t wheelchair bound before coming to school but may be when I leave due to the toll pushing beyond my limits is taking on my body.

There is delivery but to get it I have to pick it up at the front gate of my college. In order to do that I need to walk .3 miles (father than to get to the dining hall). Obviously if I could get meals delivered when I am sick it would change everything.

I admire your energy and spirit for life. I used to be like that (and still am but I’m a different way). The biggest challenge is that any ATP sink affects me in a similar way (walking, wheeling a wheelchair, learning how to use an electric chair, waiting in the cold for the elevator operator, constantly explaining why I am in a wheelchair or can’t do x,y,z). Most of the people with this disease my mentor has said spend the majority of their time in their room. What I haven’t figured out yet is how those other students got food.

If I did get a wheelchair wouldn’t it be weird if I used it sometimes to get to/from the dining hall but then not other times? Wouldn’t people notice and then start to ask questions or judge me for “faking” the rest of the time?

Really the only thing I can say is to keep trying to get adequate healthcare.   It sucks that those of us who need healthcare most are sometimes least able to advocate for themselves.  I would imagine that the right doctor could figure out your facial pain and spasms, the right psychiatrist could get you on meds that are right for your brain chemistry,  the right physiotherapist could reduce your pain.... My dad always told me when I was fed up with searching for a diagnosis,  ""the doctor who will diagnose you and help you get better is out there.  You just have to keep trying to find them. ""  And he was right.   Sticking with the search was the hardest,  most frustrating thing I've done,  but it was worth it.   So that's the best advice I have.  
    
One other thing that stood out to me was that you were unhappy with the services you had received because they were repetitive and unhelpful.   Definitely speak up about that and any other concerns you have about treatment.

Aside from a small amount I get from patreon (every dollar of which I'm incredibly grateful for) I'm not able to pay my own expenses.

2f0ff134-7985-4cea-8ed1-58372988155d,1512119626,"Another hyperacusis sufferer here with a severe case. My hyperacusis sounds about as bad as yours (I can only talk for about an hour a day and have been basically housebound for years) but yikes at barely being able to use sound protection. I couldn't cope without mine.

My right hand and left wrist are messed up, so I understand how hard it can be not having ways to express yourself, or things like gaming for escapism.

As for your question, I don't know if this would work for you, but I write using a combination of a smartNav AT head tracker (the version with the dwell clicking software: https://www.naturalpoint.com/smartnav/) and a free program called dasher (http://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/). The head tracker isn't cheap (though maybe a used one could be purchased cheaper, there are also eye trackers but I'm not sure how well they'd work with dasher, better or worse), but it's hands-free. It does take a little getting used to and isn't as quick as typing, but it's not all that slow either after getting used to it. I've been writing a novel with it which has helped me quite a lot mentally and emotionally while also having a chance at earning income. It gives me something to strive for, and a way to express myself with a world to escape to and play in.

I want to repeat that it does take some getting used to the head tracker, and learning to write prose as well, but I can definitely get the words flowing using this method.

There's also apparently a lot of work out there on the internet for freelance writers. I haven't gotten into it because the pressure of work is just too much when I'm stuggling to handle my situation mentally and emotionally as it is, and working on a novel doubles to help make me feel better at the same time.

That's another reason writing stories might work for you as well because of the other problems you mentioned -- with self-publishing, you can work at your own pace. It's not quick money, though, as writing novels takes a while, and it's not guaranteed money, either, but I think it's worth trying if you can. If you can handle the freelance writing though, the money would be a lot faster and more reliable. I've read that it can be pretty decent money too if you can put in the hours.

Mood-wise, I recently regained the ability to do a little art, but it's with my non-dominant hand so it's clumsy and at most I can only manage about an hour a day, but between that and the writing, it's improved my mood so, *so* much. It's made the difference between uncontrollable suicidal thoughts multiple times daily and having them occasionally and with far less intensity, so maybe writing could help your mood too.

It's also possible to play some types of games with the head tracker too, but honestly it is really limited to which games you can play. It might be worth looking into the ablegamers charity or the disabled gamers subreddit, they might be able to help more with ways to play games without using your hands. Custom controllers might be possible too, but I don't know much about them or how much they cost though doubt there are many, if any, cheap options.

I understand the fear of being unable to support yourself and how hard it is that society requires sound. What you're going through is clearly brutal, but I've found that though it's crazy hard and takes effort, finding some happiness amidst the misery can be possible, and I enjoy the happiness as much as I can.

I don't know if you know about this forum or not, but if you don't, the hyperacusis forums might be able to help you further: https://www.chat-hyperacusis.net/",,,2,0,0,

You want to know something? I was tucked up on the sofa when I read your post on my phone. I got up, took my wrist splints off, transferred to my wheelchair, pushed to my office chair, transferred again, booted up my TTS, and 'wrote' out the above reply to you. It took several tries, because guess what? I also have hyperacusis and couldn't find my earplugs, which sit in-ear so I don't feel like ripping my face off when my cluster headaches and/or TMJ decide to be a pain in the ass. 

Like many people with a disability I struggle with focus, another giant pain in the ass, especially at night when I'm really tired. It took me a long time. When I was finished, I had to go replace my cath, because I'd pulled it out moving to talk to you. I took an extra painkiller because I'd stayed up a bit too late, I put my splints for my fucked up hands back on, and I went to sleep. 

I can't drive. I have to get my shopping delivered. I need home care. I didn't shower for three days last week because I physically couldn't transfer myself. I spent a long time unable to cook for myself, I ate bread and crisps because I didn't have parents to help me out and couldn't afford to hire someone. With a couple of aids in the kitchen, I can do that now. It's incredible. I'm the first to want to share the ways I've found around obstacles because I'm so grateful to have found a way. 

I have never, ever been angry at a post like this before. There's being miserable and despressed at your situation and then there's this. I read it the same way as /u/4cd7225b-bd62-435b-9cfe-9746dcfaf319, it seems like you just want to moan. There is no 'thank you for your help, but this is why that option doesn't work for me' like every other poster who replies here. You just shoot it all down. I have seen people angry and miserable and desperate and lonely but they still remember we're in a disability sub and that we all have struggles. 

People here are generally nice, and you haven't made the effort to be nice back. You're just responded with snide comments and assumptions about my disability. The fucking irony of you telling my I'm judging you and your capabilities when you have no idea I have literally the same conditions, minus the guess at autism. Which, if you genuinely think you have, you should get tested for.

And THAT is why I didn't immediately jump to reply to you. I wanted to be the bigger person and ignore this post but I just can't. I hurt myself making the effort to reply to you for not a word of thanks. Other. People. Suffer. Too.

I urge you to locate free legal aid in your area. Feel free to note / print out this statute that i am citing here, and bring it to legal aid as a reference, and/or cite it in a written ""request for accommodation"", that you can submit as an addendum to your application.

[24 CFR 945.303 - Requirements governing occupancy in designated housing.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/945.303)

*my* interpretation of that law is that when the Housing Authority makes you a unit offer *if* the unit they are offering is *not* in the building that you prefer (preference due to necessity stemming from need  to be near certain amenities due to transportation issues due to disability), then this law allows you to refuse the offer and keep your place on the wait list. 

It would behoove you to include a letter from your doctor, with your request, stating that you are not able to drive. No need for the doctor to go into detail about your disability, only that you are disabled, and you cannot drive.

I think that including the line ""also it's closer to family"" will *not* help you in this request.

If you can ensure that your request comes across as a request for an accommodation in the wording and less as a preference, that would be better. A H.A. must prove that your request would not create unreasonable cost, paperwork, etc, and that it is not changing the program. Which in my opinion this request doesn't seem to. 

If they deny you this request you have the right to appeal.

Second, the attorney is likely going to tell you you’re screwed. The business was within their rights to fire you, which is unrelated to whether or not it was the “right” thing to do. 

The law is that if an employee is (or becomes) disabled to the point where there is no *reasonable* accommodation that would allow them to safely perform the tasks involved with their job, the business is allowed to fire them. 

You *might* have an argument that an accommodation could have been made — specifically that a leave of absence while you heal and return to full strength would have been a reasonable accommodation which was not attempted. Talk to a lawyer. 

The demand that you come back on a specific date is a separate issue, but you hurt your case by asking your doctor to release you to work. You should still absolutely talk to a disability attorney.

While you find an attorney, you should call the EEOC. Their phone number is 800.669.4000. They will be able to give you an idea of what violations occurred, what standing you have, etc. and whether it’s worth pursuing.

If you can, find a physical therapist familiar with eds.

They were like $50-70 for some basic ones.  Depending on insurance and what you can take your doctor into, should be even cheaper, but you'll have less control of the specifics. If you just do a search for forearm crutches on Amazon you'll see see some of the variety out there. Some people swear by a specific fancy type call Smart Crutches. Don't have any experience myself. 

Virtually all of them have some basic height adjustment in the base. I quickly added some socks for padding and found a padded pair of biking gloves to help give my hands some padding. 

Nowadays (may 2-3 years using them) I've gotten some pads designed specifically for forearm crutch cuffs. They can in a selection of colors, not sure where there where ordered from but if you're interested I can dig it up. My hands toughened up that about the time that I wore out the bike gloves (maybe 6 months), I didn't need them any more.

Reduce the amount of political media you consume even further, and you’ll feel better still. I’m not saying ignore it entirely, but a quick check-in is enough to stay abreast of what’s happening,

There is no point in worrying about what could be or might be or may be until it is what will be. So much of our pain and anguish (as people in general, not disabled people specifically) comes from a fixation on the future and the past, along with  a desire to control it. It’s impossible. There is nothing to do about it right now. When it is a guarantee, you should plan for it. When there is an action that can be taken, take that action. When all there is to do is stress, remember that this moment is the only one you have. Relax and embrace what is actually happening.

Eventually Trump will be gone and we’ll begin repairing the shit he broke. It may take a while, but until that happens we have to adjust. Short of leaving the country, there’s nothing else to be done. No amount of stress and anxiety will fix that, so why ruin your life with unproductive worry?

I feel for you, my wife has multiple issues and we've struggled for years. I'd like to say it's all gonna be good and get better, but if I'm going to be serious, I can't truthfully say that here. 

Instead, I'm going to give some suggestions here and let you see if any helps you, or others that see this. 

Therapy. Doesn't have to be professional. Support Groups are great places to go and realize you're not alone. Work on your Google fu and see what's around you and what forums you can find. 

Arts and crafts. Seriously people. I built cat condos and natural cat trees designed for people's houses and desires. Started as making something because we couldn't afford the expensive ones. Winter hit and had time to try again. Wife sold the first one to a friend after they offered cash. Realized how much those trees cost as opposed to what they sell for. Most of that money is wrapped up in my time. I have sleep issues, so it works out well and has grown without trying. 

Same thing for the wife, she sees up cat sleeping bags and little pop up tent napping beds. She also makes cat hammocks using 1/2 inch conduit as support. 

Cash can be hidden and locked in a safe at home. Nice to finally have something to lean on when something breaks. 

Also nice to be able to give to the local food bank during the holidays. We used them in the past and now that we are more stable, we give some back when we have enough orders to make that reserve a little bigger. 

Also, use the food banks, check online with medical companies and pharmaceutical companies. Most have some kind of outreach and coupon program. Local shelters, food banks, and soup kitchens have a list of places for uninsured and poor people to check with to receive reduced cost services. 

It's embarrassing, it sucks, it causes anxiety, and tests your humility. But dammit people, they're there to help. Give back by donating time if you feel you need to, but don't pass up on it if you need help. 

We all need help once in a while. Don't say there's nothing you can do. Figure out what you can do make it fit in this fucked up place we live in. 

I carry socks and a tire repair kit in my vehicle. I will always stop and help fix a tire of it looks like they need help. And those socks might be the shitty dollar store ones, but I can attest that having clean socks on your feet, even once in a while, when you're homeless  and cold is something most people will never fully grasp the understanding of. Those signs that say *Anything helps* really means ANYTHING to someone whose really homeless and panhandling. 

I'm on mobile so I'm stopping here for now. I'm sure the formatting is butchered and there are enough typos. Feel free to PM me (any of you seeing this) if you want to. I'll help where I can. There's too much apathy in the world right now for me to stand by and not help. I'm not made that way.

1) Give them a set amount in cash every week. This should be an amount that you know (from past experience) will cover all your food and laundry requirements almost exactly (i.e it will either be *just* enough or you will be left with a small amount of change). It should be made clear to them that you know the amount you've given should cover all items so if money goes missing that means something has gone wrong on their end somewhere. This is what I do. It makes them shop smart and keeps them on edge just a little bit. In about 7 years, a carer has only ever once or twice told me there hasn't been enough money and asked me if I can give them a few extra pounds to buy one or two necessary items. 

2) Better than the above is to get a pre-paid card and transfer money to it weekly from your bank account in exact amounts using the logic above (i.e. the same each week that you know will cover expenses. No large amounts). Again this lets them know there is a hard limit and also lets them know that you know that if something goes wrong then something must have happened on their end to mess it up.

You have the rest of the same calendar month you received the money to spend down. So if you get the money on December 11th, you only have 20 days to get yourself back down below the asset limit. 

Depending on your state, there are more than just spending money on stuff and special needs trusts: 

- One car, of any value doesn't count (or trading in car for nicer model). I know this is just spending money but I find a lot of people don't think about replacing their old car. OR getting a [wheelchair accessible van](https://www.mobilityworks.com/wheelchair-vans-for-sale/) or retrofitting current vehicle. 

- Paying off mortgage or other debts is always good. 

- A [Personal Services Contract](https://www.elderneedslaw.com/blog/what-is-a-personal-services-contract) can help you transfer money as well (depending on your state). 

- prepaid burial expenses (not such a fun item to spend money on, but one of those ""responsible"" expenses). 

To answer your travel-related question: Generally, temporary shelter expenses (i.e. Hotels for you only) are ok. 

A good [article explaining spenddown strategies](https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/the-voice/utilizing-the-spend-down-option-to-maintain-ssi-andor-medicaid-eligibility-2/) is here. 

However, each state's Medicaid agency scrutinizes spenddowns differently and it may be worth a consultation with a local elder law / medicaid attorney to discuss a spenddown plan.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1512564008,"In Australia, legally they have to phrase the question like ""do you you have a disability that could effect your work?"" as more of a round about way of asking ""what are the odds we will need to provide accommodations for you?"" and personally I like that phrasing because it makes the question a little easier to answer for some people.

Do you have a disability? Well technically yes.

Is your disability likely to impact your ability to work more than the average worker might also need a day off here or there for a stomach bug? By the sounds of it, with all your therapies, your disability won't impact your work, so you would tick ""no""

During the interview stage if they ask again if you have a disability, I tend to rearrange the sentence in my answer ""I'm not disabled, I do have a medical condition, but it will not impact my ability to function or work, I have a good medical team, I can provide any clearance and restriction documentation you need""

(this is irrelevant for me, I am disabled and a lot of types of work are inaccessible, so I'm very open in telling employers ""I am disabled"" because there's no point wasting anyone's time just to find out I can't actually do the job) 

The problem with the question ""do you have a disability?"" is binary, and doesn't actually give the employer the information they really need.

Like ""Yes, I have a disability, I'm missing my right foot"" isn't relevant if you're applying for a seasonal job just answering outbound customer service calls from your own home office. 

Basically, with the current system ""do you have a disability?"" first you have to figure out what is the company is actually asking, then answer that, it's not a straightforward question so it's impossible to give a straightforward answer.

If the person without a foot said ""no, I don't have a disability"" and got the job to answer phone calls from home, that's no problem, until they tell you that company induction is on site, and it's going to be 3x8 hour shifts on your feet while you stand around listening to company guidelines and values, well now this guy has to say ""can I get a chair? I'm missing a foot"" and the employer will probably wonder why he didn't tick ""yes, I have a disability"" even though what they really meant was ""do you have a condition that could effect your work?"" and you could have said ""no"" and later added ""this condition doesn't effect my work, but it does effect this induction, which is drastically different from my expected work duties"" and everyone could have been clear and honest from the get go that way.

A lot of employers just stick that question on there because it feels standard, but they don't actually stop to think about how much social stress it actually carries. None of us can ever truly be sure that ticking ""yes"" was secretly the reason we never got through to the interview stage. So we have to unpack and repack a lot of baggage whenever that question comes up, and I don't think many interviewers actually appreciate that when quickly asking that question.

Yes, employers need to know if they will need to make accommodations, you will need to know if there are any unexpected work duties or accessibility issues with the workplace, but the question isn't ""do you have a disability?"" isn't asking ""what do you need from us? What do we need to help you"" it's actually asking ""Are you part of a minority that has been systematically and socially held back? will answering this question raise fears that doors will close in your face without taking into account your ability, while not answering this question will remove the ramps you need to get into the open doors, so either answer you give you feel you got fucked?""

Tick ""No"" if you truly believe your condition will not impact your work even remotely. 

Tick ""Yes"" to weed out employers that likely won't provide medically nessesary accommodations you do need.",,,3,0,0,

Even things like welfare are paid with his tax money. And if it helps, tell him either he takes it, or some refugee will! jk

The first thing he needs to do is go to the doctor to find out exactly what is going on with him. Make sure the doctor would be willing to write a letter on his behalf for disability. 

Once he has confirmation there is a serious problem, get an attorney. Personally, I would avoid the large, commercial firms. Select a lesser known, local attorney who can give him the attention he will need in this case. He will need one not only to help fill out the application, but for all the BS SSA will throw at him. 

Then, wait... and wait.... and wait some more. I do not say this to discourage you (or him) But it is a waiting game and whomever holds out the longest will win.

And he needs to tell the doctor absolutely everything that is wrong with him. 

It is not ""sketchy"" people on it for the most part. I'm sure there are some. But SSA and the judges are pretty good at weeding out those cases. It's NOT a corrupt system.

The easiest and most helpful thing that you can do right away is present as much information as possible to prospective attendees.

How would it be for someone in a wheelchair, or with crutches, or a walker? How would it be for someone with a vision or hearing impairment? Create an accessibility webpage for your event (be sure to make the webpage itself accessible) that includes as much detail as possible. Provide an email address or phone number to contact if the person has any concerns or questions. Be sure the person that responds to those questions knows what they are talking about.

When I consider going to a new venue or attending an event, I always check the accessibility. If there is little or no information readily available I often times give up on it.

I call it how it is :) Most widely accepted terminology is ""people with disabilities"" but that's a different matter.

One of the most important things to realize is that this is an ENORMOUS community with a myriad of differences. You could be talking about people with intellectual disabilities that range from autism to down syndrome to people with physical disabilities like walking impairments such as a light limp (for older generations) to people with massive power chairs with breathing equipment hung all around it. While accommodating everybody is a wonderful goal (and definitely a step in the right direction!!!) it might not be possible to implement immediately.

I have no idea where you are based or the disability guidelines that are in place. Those are important to know for projects like this. I was a national disability representative in the USA, but have traveled all over the globe and will try to make my suggestions as applicable as possible, wherever you may be. Feel free to reach out to me if you have specific questions.

1. I travel with a custom manual wheelchair that is skinnier than many people
2. Tours could ABSOLUTELY be more accessible
3. Ensuring the touring area is possible to complete in a stroller typically means a somebody using wheelchair or walker could also complete it, but not always. If alternative pathways are necessary, know where they are and direct people to them. Wait to continue the tour until they get there. Try doing the tour yourself using a wheelchair. You'll get a whole new vantage point and possibly see problems you otherwise would have missed. Likewise, try doing the tour blind. See if you have reliable access to accessible bathrooms. Does the elevator regularly break? Are there some areas/exhibits that cannot be seen or visited because of physical limitations? How easily can somebody's service dog get around? Etc.
4. The absolute best thing (and one of the cheapest!!) you can do to help people with disabilities enjoy your tour is to have an easy to find web page that details the accessibility aspects of the tour, whether that is mentioning noise, steps, lack of restrooms, big hills, cobblestone/rough terrain, length of tour, whether there will be a chance to catch your breath etc. This allows people to know if they can manage your tour or not. This would be a *massive* help! 
5. Find people with all sorts of disabilities and have them demo your tour and provide specific feedback along with suggestions on how to fix things. You'll be surprised--little, easy fixes can go a long way!!

Hope your project is successful!!

Offering sensory friendly/“mellow” yours is a great idea. It doesn’t nexessarily have to targetted at autistic folks, but you should clarify what specific things are done on the tour regardless.

Ideas for this:

Going through the quieter/back roads of a city, preferably a part with non-bumpy roads if possible. 

Asking people to not wear perfume or bring scented things.

Providing some method for people with auditory processing difficulties (and d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing people) to access what the tour guide is saying. Perhaps a script, or headphones that connect to the audio of a mic, etc. Also perhaps providing cheapo sunglasses for people to borrow (although most people may be able to bring these themselves, so it’s less of a concern).

Explicitly stating what food will be offered (if any). Offering alternatives (“Here are some local restaraunts! These are their price ranges. This is the kind of food they serve”.)

Many autistic people have epilepsy (and it’s a good thing to worry about anyway) so being conscious of flashing or strobing lights, and knowing what to do in case of a seizure.

Optional “agendas” for tours - a lot of us have a lot of anxiety if there’s no predictability and we don’t know what’s going to be happening when - so even just a list of the stops, possible time for food or breaks, etc - would be helpful.

Of course, all of these combined would be great, but even one would make the tours vastly more accessible.

Depending on your budget/disability support, of course. I'm not sure how often you anticipate needing these services while you work on finding a replacement.

If this is an occasional thing you might consider hiring a sitter. If they needed specialized knowledge, I wouldn't recommend this, but since you're otherwise able to do this with just your guide dog it might be okay for last minute situations like this one. I know we usually think of sitters as something parents hire when they need someone to watch their kids, but people with elderly parents or who are recovering from surgery and wouldn't otherwise have the support they need often do the same.

What I have found is that those who stare or make mean comments are people who just don't understand. 

The best way to counter the negativity is to educate people. Once they know about her condition, they'll be less fearful. 

Your sister has really got to show people that even with her disability she is still capable of being a friend, having a personality, and being productive in society. 

People look for these qualities regardless of whether a disability exist because it's about showing yourself as a person, and being more than just disabled. 

It sucks having to build and develop confidence but rejection is just part of that process. People will reject you for the most trivial of reasons that may or may not relate to a disability. 

The important thing with rejection is to keep going and move on. Eventually, she will find someone that accepts her. 

I liken rejection to the job process that lots of people go through. If you get rejected from a job interview, do you just stop searching for a job? 

The answer is no you don't because to survive and pay your bills you have to keep searching. There's going to be a lot of rejection in the job search but eventually people do eventually get a job. 

Ask your sister if she listened to every no that she was told if she would be where she is today. 


Your sister seems to have successfully graduated high school and is now in college. That's huge. Not to mention the fact that she's attending an out of state school, which many people disabled or not may not get the opportunity to do. 


I grew up as the only physically disabled kid with a visible disability in all of my classes up until law school. I was told that I wasn't good enough for AP/honors classes yet I still graduated in the 1st quarter of my high school class. My high school didn't feel that I would succeed beyond community college, but I excelled at that and went to graduate with honors from a 4 year university. 

Following this logic, if I listened to my high school I clearly would of never made it to law school. But here I am. I use a wheelchair and a walker, but I'm still doing things that other people are doing but I just do it differently. ",,,3,0,0,

In the end of course it has to be up to her. You can give her all the tools we suggest and she still may not take action. I get that it's going to be hard if she doesn't, it's going to be hard to sit around and watch her give in and give up and hope that eventually it gets exhausting enough that she finally takes action for herself...

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is in the same family of connective tissue disorders, rarely diagnosed and very poorly understood. I almost did not seek diagnosis because as far as I could tell it seemed to only be white people. It's been a struggle for many of us of color to find each other, we do exist. I have to constantly remind myself and others that we do exist but because there's a bit more of a disparity in access for whites and people of color...It's hard to find a good size group of people of color. I did go to our national conference for the first time a few years ago, again not much representation (it's very expensive, I was lucky to get a scholarship to cover the conference fee but everything else was on me. The last two years I could not afford it so that's one last WOC face in the  crowd.) That said though, it was immensely helpful to be among hundreds of people going through the similar health struggles as me regardless of color. If it's the OI national conference, I would not hesitate to reach out and ask about young adult groups offered at the conference. The EDS national conference is I'm sure far smaller but we do have a young adult group (my issue was that I didn't think I fell in that age group because no where was it specified but come to find out....) Myself and one other person that I know of, regularly bring the lack of representation up to the EDS Society. Sometimes you gotta be that person and push for what you want to see. 

I would also reach out to Vilissa Thomson, she also has OI and the bulk of her work as a social worker is basically disability and race (specifically WOC). [Ramp Your Voice]( http://rampyourvoice.com/welcome-to-ramp-your-voice/)  Her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VilissaThompson?s=09)  

I'd also encourage her to check out the ""Cripple Punk"" movement on Tumblr. Unfortunately the founder just passed but their friends are keeping it alive. It was immensely helpful to me in learning not to give a shit about going out with my braces and crutches, feeling like I look like a pitiful disaster.

I definitely have my moments of grieving and processing what's happening to me. Sometimes it's a fleeting moment and sometimes it hangs a lot longer. I've lost school, I've lost work, I've lost hobbies, I've lost friends...It's a lot. Sometimes it feels like too much and like no one can really help... Some days it's hard to want the help. I get that. I get that it's hard for my family to watch and be rather helpless... I know the only way I get through is to push to make those connections, whether it's Facebook groups, Tumblr's chronically ill and disabled community, in person groups... I have 3 regular friends from my local EDS meeting that are my life line - I don't care for that meeting any more but those 3 people...! It's not easy and I've had to hit bottom a lot of times to get the motivation and courage to do those things for myself. 

And if she wants to talk to me, you know to a degree I get OI but I don't live it specifically so I don't know if she'd feel comfortable, but if she does I'm more than happy to chat. ",,,2,0,0,

Mad respect to you for getting to law school and excelling in school in general. Congrats! I'm happy for you, law school is hard as hell! I hope my sister can develop the same drive and determination as you have.

If you don't mind me asking, how were you able to overcome others' opinions and condescension? I notice that my sister developed a lot of resentment towards able-bodied people (rightfully so, at times) yet denies her disability to the point of not using her walker/wheelchair to try to fit in (which is fucking dangerous, people could knock her over or she could trip and she wouldn't have support to prevent falling/breaking bones). How did you cope with prejudice? Did you have to ""come to terms"" with accepting your disability?

Side note: You're absolutely right in pointing out that she has a level of privilege though, our family is upper-middle class and was able to afford her medical expenses and college tuition without loans-- she has a lot of opportunities people with type III OI typically don't have.",,,2,0,0,
ee4c2470-84e0-4af3-9537-2280f990b64b,1514027245,"Honestly, I don't know if you can ever overcome an opinion. Everyone is going to have an opinion and you're not always going to like it nor be able to change it. 

Trying to change opinions and attitudes is hard. It's not something that can be done overnight and takes a tremendous amount of time. 

I don't have the option of not using my walker or wheelchair. There's no way for me not to use it. 

I know people that do try to hide their disability like the ways you mentioned such as avoiding using their cane. However, it is extremely dangerous. As you get older you can't risk falls and injuries the way you could when you were a kid. It's not worth it ending up in the emergency room and racking up the insurance bills. 

Plus, when you spend as much time in the disability community as I have, you get to have a pretty good eye for spotting the people trying to pass. While I could never diagnosis somebody, I can usually tell when somebody has Autism or Asperger Syndrome. 

Honestly, the more open and honest you are about it the more people will leave you alone about it. If you're closed off about it, people will sense that's an issue and it's something that bullies will pick up on. 

That said, having a disability, unfortunately sucks and as hard as it is you truly just have to have thick skin. I've gotten flack for saying that, but it's true. Everything that makes someone different in this world is going to have to be a struggle because that's just the world we live in. Prejudice is everywhere and in every human being. All we can do is try to be live our own lives while being aware of our own biases.  There is no way to overcome you just have to keep moving on. Yeah, things hurt but that doesn't mean there isn't always a new tomorrow.  

I guess I have gotten cynical enough to where I ether don't care or have heard all the negative before. I don't have a lot of friends. My circle is small but good people, I think, are few and far in between.   


That doesn't mean that I'm saying that  able-bodied people have it easier or worse necessarily. It just means they may not be struggling with a visibly apparent disability, have not yet acquired a disability, etc. 

There are plenty of people with a indivisible disability such as Autism and such who live in fear of being ""discovered."" I've met many and they have struggles just like a person with a visible disability, they just go to great lengths to hide it. 

Usually, when I've asked the person privately, the first thing they say is ""yes, but please don't tell anybody."" Some of these people have been more understanding then folks in the the second category.  

People who have not yet acquired a disability are those that have not yet gotten old. 

They can also be people victims of ordinary activities such as when playing football and suffering a paralyzing injury or driving a car and getting hurt. Or suffering a crime and getting hurt.

I was in a mental hospital, seeing psychiatrists, therapists and went to adolescent transitions twice. I had to switch from public school to cyber school due to my Extreme anxiety and panic attacks. When I was 18 I started looking for jobs. Applied everywhere. Then I broke down one night because I actually thought about what itd be like working those jobs. Previously for graduation I helped out at my local library. I had to run outside the one time because of my anxiety. Every day helping out there was hell. And it was only for 3 hours every other day. 

Then I got a job I thought I could do.. it was a work from home Apple tech support job. I was good with technology and thought working from home would be my best bet. I never even worried about the talking on the phone aspect. Even though my mom always called for my appointments because talking on the phone was a trigger for me.. I didn't care or think it'd be a problem at the time. Unfortunately it ended horribly. First phone call nothing happened but I broke down completely and had the longest worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was dying. 

After that. I tried going back but the same thing happened. I cried so hard. I thought what am I going to do if I can't work. Suicide was in mind. Then I found out about SSI, it was my only chance at living for me. If I hadn't gotten approved, I don't know if I'd still be here.

Next, go onto the [disability website (Social Security)](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/dapply.html) and start filling out the application. If you are really struggling to fill it out, you can get an advocate to help you. You can hire a lawyer, but you probably won’t need one unless you’re denied first application cycle around.

Be very honest on your app. Write about your suicide attempt (I was very honest about mine, and I think it helps to show the claims specialists the scope and severity of the issues). Contact all your doctors that you’ve worked with—Social Security will be getting a hold of them to have them complete paperwork and/or send in your file. I didn’t actually have to give any of my doctors any forms to fill out, SS did that for me. 

Once you’ve submitted your app, likely it’ll take around 90 days for you to receive a decision back. If you are denied (which happens a lot the first time around, but didn’t happen to me, just so you know it’s not a given) then reapply as soon as humanly possible, as there’s a window of time where you can do this as just an appeal vs a whole new application.

For example, I can absolutely tell the-company-formerly-known-as Ti-Lite my exact chairs specs. They have a welding/frame customization capability that matches up comparably to a sports bike company. And their manufacturer retail price is also comparable...except it's a wheelchair, so you can't order directly from the manufacturer. You're forced to order through distributors that adds (I literally just did this and this was the amount) a 15K fee onto a 3-4K chair. A consumer who, perhaps, doesn't dig through the paperwork to discern the MSRP from the added on fees might think the sports chair is a 15-20K chair. It's not. The price comes from the system that charges outrageously because it can.

At least manual wheelchairs have a *quality* that is comparable to sports bikes, if not a price. Generic power chairs--not even touching on the ones that need personalized customization--are insanely overpriced. We're talking 14K (before all those fees) for a device with a quality, endurance, battery life, speed, and maneuverability that would barely pass muster for a $500 leisure/sports device.

Another example: manual wheelchair repairs. Recently, for shits and giggles and research, I decided to use my job's ""great"" insurance to get some basic maintenence on my chair. Fresh tires, new castor bearings, that's all.  For years, I've been doing this through internet + bike shops, but I was like...hey...curious again. 

Pfft. Castor bearings=skateboard bearings (a factoid no mobility ""expert"" will ever, ever mention) and high quality ones can be ordered quickly online or obtained at any skate shop. Wheelchair tires are similarly available, at least online, and can even be found at some bike shops. The whole thing is a less than week long process, which can be finished off with less than an hour of bike shop labor. Go through the mobility market??!

You may consider contacting an employment attorney and see if they can guide you. My manager required that I obtain FMLA even though I just needed two days of not even skipping work, just coming in at my regularly scheduled time of 9:30 (she wanted me to come in at 6am) so I could go to the hospital for a quick 7:00am appointment for a CT scan and then back the next day at 8:00am for a follow up to discuss the results. I contacted an attorney and HR and my boss was promptly demoted/fired after a bunch of other colleagues came forward to say that they were also forced onto FMLA for small things. I'd reach out to HR on your own and find someone you trust (you might ask around with others to see if there is one person specifically that others felt comfortable with) and go to them and ask them whether these things are legal. Treating you differently because you have a disability is absolutely illegal. Requiring you to get a medical bracelet is overreach in my opinion and well beyond the boundaries an employer is allowed to demand... and to keep following up with you about it. You don't need a medical bracelet, those don't save your life. If there are medications you can't have or conditions you want to warn others about, tape a sticky note to your desk and/or put something with your work badge and let others know where the list is... a bracelet is silly. It's a personal choice and poses no liability to the university if something were to happen to you. I think it's okay to tell your manager or whoever it is that your current desk actually works best for you and you'd prefer to stay there. I'd say say that you'd prefer to be treated like everyone else, but that you were also assured that telecommuting x number of days was a possibility when you accepted the position. 
I'd have these conversations with HR only and not your manager. When your permanent person gets settled in, sit down with them and talk about it... chances are good they'll work with you. ",,,3,0,0,

You might be eligible through the state for a program that helps pay your premium costs (I don't know what your parent's income situation is).",,,3,0,0,
4c19ad97-3ecf-487f-b111-99fdc3fb5da0,1513389608,"So - I am having trouble finding the policy on the Indiana government website - but most likely if you are eligible for Medicare you must use that as your primary insurance over Medicaid (and therefore cannot refuse it). It is unfortunate that you weren't aware of this, but you can probably resolve this issue. 

Now, as someone pointed out - the state has programs that may be able to pay the Medicare premiums for you- but that is going to depend on if you are income and resource eligible for those programs.

I'd advise you to contact both Medicare and the Medicaid offices. Which order you choose is up to you. You also might contact the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) at 1-800-452-4800. They will be people familiar with both programs and can guide you which order to go about this. 

You may have a penalty for refusing your part B when first eligible. But again, the state (Medicaid) might be able to pay that premium regardless if you are eligible. 

I definitely wouldn't try and purchase a random insurance policy. You are still eligible for Medicare at the very least, just with a possible penalty. Call them up, and contact the Medicaid office and see if you are eligible to have your premiums paid (and contact that SHIP program they will probably be able to help much more than you can do this on your own). You can't just go back on Medicaid. Once you are Medicare eligible you must have Medicare. You could potentially be eligible for both, or be eligible for Medicaid to at the very least pay the premiums for you and then explore supplementary plans.

Because its generally true. Most tenants healthy or otherwise are an endless headache.  He could have been polite with a nice tone, absolutely. He could have said ""Do you need any sort of accommodations I can help you with?"" or something.  I agree.

When dealing with a potential landlord, kill them with kindness, bite your tongue, and don't take much they say personally. They arent your friend, they are the landlord. Once you sign a lease (and ALWAYS sign a lease) you are in a position of power.... with rights. If he treats you like shit, wont fix things or plays fast and loose with the terms of the lease, beat him over the head (legally) with the lease. 

He knows what kind of power a smart tenant has... so most of them come off as bullies. Don't take it personally.  Pay the rent ahead of time, keep a meticulous paper trail, take 1001 dated photos the day you move in and the day you leave and of every problem in between.

And like everyone else in life, he can treat you like shit pretty much consequence free.

Unless he violates some line in the ADA. Then use it.

Then again, be aware that the kind of landlord you meet will be the kind of person youll have to deal with for the term.... so pick your poison.

No matter what kind of asshole he acts like, if you pay on time/ahead of time and don't mess up the rental.... you wont have any problems.  Make sure you are good with the lease before you sign it.  If its a good place and you can pay, I'd learn to ignore the landlord's attitude.

But I do have some advice since I am also disabled,  although it's only been a year and a half for myself.  Try to develop a thick skin and not care what others think it will help you in the long run.  90% or more of the general population can't even fathom or imagine how it is to be disabled so most of the time it's due to low empathy and ignorance.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that it takes me a disproportionate amount of time to figure out what's even being asked of me, before I can even begin the assignment. This professor also tends to use questions that, to me, all seem to be asking the same thing. I tried to just say that a few times, but she got pissed so I started asking my socially-literate boyfriend to decode the questions for me. He's not in education, though, so he doesn't really have the context and just has to kinda guess based on his social knowledge. 

Yes, I am able to use reddit pretty well, but only for short bits of text. Huge walls of paragraphs, I just skip. If it's too long, I know I won't be able to focus and understand it. But I also have the advantage of text magnification here, where I don't always get that with the material given to me in the classes. Sometimes it's a blurry photocopy in a pdf that I can't use a screen reader on or really read the words well. Or the photocopy is tilted so all the words slant. 

And i will also admit that I have organization issues, and I tried my hardest to write down every assignment in multiple places and to manage my time so I got it all done, and I still failed. Sometimes an assignment would slip through the cracks. Sometimes I would think I've finished it when I haven't turned it in. Sometimes I'd forget to do replies on a discussion board. So part of the problem is executive function, as well as my eyes and my processing ability. 

I mean, for comparison: I got all A's and one B in all the rest of my classes this semester. Almost all of my education classes have been A's, with only a handful of B's. My online classes? D and F.

Currently, there is no priority seating system on aircraft to situate wheelchair users near emergency exits so in order to get on/off the plane, a member of cabin crew had to get a narrow wheelchair out of a storage compartment, take it down the aisle, help the disabled person out of their seat and into the chair, strap them in, then go to an exit. Most wheelchair users that cannot transfer independently have someone with them to assist or the cabin crew will help them do I don't see why they would need to hire someone to do something they have to do already. Allowing someone to have their own wheelchair on board would reduce a lot of the current issues surrounding evacuation of disabled passengers. IMO it is easier to remove clamps from a wheelchair and let them get themselves to a door rather than having to go through the current process.

I already addressed your other points in response to the comment directly below my main post. To summarize:

Potentially old work credits and special circumstance are worth looking into. It’s a phone call, why not? Something might apply and help.

The dad owns his own business, which has either inventory or equipment that almost certainly goes over the family limit. So she’s probably only eligible via divorce. Doesn’t change the property limits you stated, except to say her now-ex-husband doesn’t have to worry about them. He can save as much money as he wants to help with her care, and not interfere with her SSI.

This is not necessarily true - if it is equipment and inventory that is necessary to operate the business, [it would not necessarily be counted as a resource](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501130500) if the business is currently operating. 

What would definitely count though, is the earnings from the business. They can have zero resources, but if they are over the income limits still won't qualify. 

There are all kinds of exclusions depending on various situations - when in doubt, apply and let someone who specializes in it determine eligibility. 

Also, if she can't communicate it *does* make it a bit more difficult , but not impossible. She can't communicate, but does she still understand?  If so, dad can help her apply and she would need to sign the application with a mark and have 2 witnesses.

Work credits expire after 5 years. But more importantly, she did not work outside the home. Giving her daughter false hope that her mother's situation maybe some kind of 'special circumstances' is cruel.  There is no special or minimum payment that you get if you don't qualify, like you infer in the 'Disability' paragraph.

For most people the ownership interest is either the deed or by marriage.

Where OP could hit a snag here is that if Mom never worked, she might not be on the loan/deed. That’s fine under normal circumstances since they’re married, but, if they can’t qualify for SSI normally and decide to get divorced to qualify, it becomes an issue again as mom is now living in a home for free, without ownership interest, with someone who does own it. Now it becomes payment in kind and negatively affects her SSI payments.

It could actually be *great* for her if she is on the deed. In fact, I would suggest OP talk to a lawyer about making that happen before taking any steps toward the Divorce/SSI combo.

*e: I realized now that I used “friend” in my original response which may have caused the confusion. I chose “friend” because theoretically they’re divorced in this scenario, but you can still owe “rent” via payment in kind deductions to anyone you live with — even a former spouse, in the home where you used to live as a married couple — if the situation is right.*

Also, since she is under the age of 65 and at this point, not disabled, she needs to apply for whatever your State medical coverage is. I live in California and it is called ""Medi-Cal"" which is not Medicare because it is not for 65+ or disabled. So yea, I guess that is Medicaid (wasn't sure if that applied outside of Medicare though since our state also calls individuals dual Medi-Cal and Medicare eligibles and I was just trying to give an example of my state where it could perhaps have a slight variation to the name. This program should cover all of her medical expenses (assuming that the financial requirements are indeed at eligible levels as financially unstable may still be too high to meet the income thresholds). Sometimes one can get partial assistance with these programs too if the income is too high but I would check more at the state level at this juncture in time since she, from what you're telling us, is not eligible for ""full on disability"" and clearly needs medical coverage between now and when she turns 65. I have to say that Medicare is actually incredibly wonderful coverage, at least where I live. I do receive SSDI and am well under the age of 65 so I have a Medicare Advantage plan that I have noticed has options for qualifying low income individuals and in reading about it, that is where I came across the additional Medi-Cal information. Also, sadly SSI payments are even less than SSDI. 

Another possible way to get medical coverage quickly may be through applying for food stamps. Once again, this probably varies greatly from state to state but maybe is another avenue to look into. Just make sure she applies as her own household stating that she does not share food with anyone else. Once again though, perhaps this varies state to state, program to program. We have CalFresh in California. Utilize any additional support that you can find. Meet in person, have them come to you, arrange phone interviews. It is going to be battle after battle, I cannot say that this is easy and I do hope that your family gets the assistance they deserve and am so sorry to read about everything that you have all been through.

Depending on how poorly off they are financially now, she might be able to apply for Medicaid. That’s the low/no income version of Medicare.

**Disability:**
The disability application takes a very long time. Be prepared for that. The condition that she has might fall under the “immediate accept” criteria, but even that will likely take six months. If she doesn’t qualify for immediate acceptance, then you’re looking at a 2.5 to 3 year wait time.

When applying for disability, make an appointment at the SSA, and have your mother go in to explain everything to the counselor there. You or your father can go with her to assist if need be, but do not fill the application out online. I’ve been repeatedly told that shows evidence of a work schedule, and can be a factor against you in the early stages of the application.

I also urge you to get an attorney when you begin the process. This is somewhat controversial, but I believe that it helps to have one the entire time. I know that my attorney’s connections help to get me over the hurdle to an early approval. I wound up getting disability 2.5 years before I expected to — 2.5 years faster than anyone I actually know in a similar situation. 

If she is approved for disability, then two years from the date that she became disabled she will be eligible for Medicare. This can be a bit tricky because you might say that she became disabled when she had the aneurysm, but the government might say that something happened between the aneurysm and now that reset her disable dates. Generally speaking, you become disabled on the last day that you worked. You can see how this might be a problem for someone who hasn’t worked, and has a major health issue like this. I’m not sure when they will set her disabled date, so be prepared to wait a year or more for Medicare to kick in. 

When she is approved, she will get back payments from the date she became disabled — the date they decide she became disabled — up to the day of approval. From that point on, she will also have a monthly payment come in.

All of this assumes that she would be approved. If she honestly has no work credits, I don’t remember all the rules for it — there are some exceptions in different cases — but she might not be approved at all. Even if she was, because she’s had no recent work she would receive only the minimum payment. That’s about $750 a month, give or take. Obviously that’s not enough to live on, but it includes Medicare, and paired with your father hopefully that’s enough to get by.

**SSI:**
I have much less familiarity  with SSI, but I can tell you that it is not going to be super conducive to their situation. If she does not have the work credits for disability, but is disabled, generally speaking she would qualify for SSI. However, because she is married, both her and her husband‘s assets — everything, car, house, savings accounts, stocks, etc. — have to be worth less than $3000 total. I have a feeling that with retirement accounts and everything else they probably only more than $3000. That’s why this is a bitch.

SSI comes with Medicaid, though, so it’s insurance if she needs it. Here is the point where I have to suggest the most horrible thing that has ever been suggested to me: if there is no other way to get insurance, and to have enough money to live on and take care of her health, they can always consider divorce. If they become divorced, she is judged solely on her income, and her assets without consideration for how much money your father has in the bank to help her out with so she would be eligible for the SSI income, again, about $750, as well as Medicaid. For their daily life, nothing would change, except that they would’ve had to go through the process to get a divorce.

In addition to SSI payments and Medicaid, Her new, incredibly low income, will also make her eligible for state programs. Most states will help you buy a wheelchair van if you can’t afford it. Hardware for in the house to help take care of her etc. is all excruciatingly expensive, but there are subsidies for people with little to no income. She *likely* won’t be eligible for any of that while they remain married.

I couldn’t do that. My wife and I stayed married and I have substantially less income that I would have if we’d separated. It just wasn’t for us, though. 

I found that, generally speaking, if that situation is applicable to your case, a worker will tell you about it at some point. Obviously, they should make sure to discuss it with an SSA employee, as well as with divorce attorney, before deciding to go through with it.

**Otherwise:**

The other solution is for your dad to get a job that has health insurance. That’s the only other way I can think of to do this, because the only two large programs offered at the time or Medicaid and Medicare: either disability or no income. If your father can’t work anymore, even part time at a job that would give benefits, then I’m not sure. If she is incapable of caring for herself,  Maybe it’s possible that you can claim her as a dependent on your insurance? I don’t know that I’ve ever seen that happen before. Talk to your HR rep.

*Edit: Just saw your dad owns his own business. Divorce + Sell the Business for retirement funds + part time work that provides healthcare until 65. His business will almost certainly put them over the saved-funds threshold, if not the income threshold. I don’t know that there is going to be another way, sadly. I doesn’t sound like his business is doing well, and even with good insurance the care she needs is going to to be cripplingly expensive.*

It is a mess, but this is America: if you can’t work, fuck you.

You somehow managed to miss the point even *after* selectively editing it out.

I don’t understand how telling them it’s worth making a phone call is false hope, for anything longer than like 30 seconds anyway. The fact that I didn’t tell her to just give up and forget it seems to have really bothered you, though.

Also, you are [absolutely wrong](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-living-ussi.htm) about a divorce not being beneficial. [Here is another source] (https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/will-continuing-live-with-my-ex-husband-affect-my-ssi.htm). Living in the same house will reduce SSI payments through “rent” payments , but not necessarily eliminate them (especially since it seems the business isn’t doing well). Being able to get onto SSI will allow her access to healthcare as well, which she won’t qualify for if they remain married, and the entire point of this is to get her health insurance, isn’t it?

Divorce also allows access to state programs she wouldn’t get otherwise, like wheelchair programs that are income based because they only count your personal income. It requires a legal divorce, though, and you have to be [committed to it](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500501150).

In fact, [SSA indicates](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/divspouse.html) her benefits may very well go up after age 62 if she *does* get divorced.

There will be those with a fetish for people with a disability/people who wear braces/Wheelchair users/etc and they have a very good balance between engaging in their fetish but also remaining completely respectful of your autonomy as the person with the disability. They fetishise the disability but they respect and connect with the person behind the disability too.

Then you have the devotees who forget the ""person"" in ""*person*s with a disability"" and they get so focused on the impairment they have make no effort to connect with the other aspects of the individual's identity. It can result in a relationship that feels very hollow and false, and can result in unfair expectations on the person with the disability, and be very objectifying for them.

For some people, the later is not a problem, everyone will have their own comfort level with when a disability fetish becomes a blindfold to the person with a disability. 

The same issues arises with fetishes for certain races/skin tones, the individual person gets ignored, and something physical about them is so focused on, the person becomes objectified. 

Now like I said I have never had face to face experience. I have received countless personal messages on various social media, and many messages on dating sites from devotees who very clearly fell into the later camp.

Don't get me wrong, if you're into being objectified I'm not here to kink shame. I myself love a bit of humiliation and being used as furniture. But it's vital to me that my personhood comes first and my ability to fulfil a fetish is a bonus and that boundaries are discussed up front. ",,,9,0,0,

If you receive SSDI, living with your parents has absolutely nothing to do with how much you are receiving. SSI does consider your living situation, and if you are not paying your ""fair share"" or market value of the housing you are receiving, your payments are reduced. This is because SSI is meant to be an absolute bare minimum payment to help meet the most basic needs of food and shelter. If those are being paid for in whole or in part by someone else, the law assumes you don't need all of it because your expenses are reduced. 

&gt;If I moved into a new living situation, would the amount of disability benefits increase based on my new cost of living?

If you are in fact receiving SSI, there is a chance that your benefits could increase based on being responsible for your housing on your own - but this is *not* an adjustment due to cost of living - the *absolute maximum* SSI payment you can receive in 2018 is $750/mo.

Please don't let this prevent you from trying - but if you do work *at all*, you need to report it promptly every single month.

The problem is that my mom is one of those types that refuses to see a therapist or psychiatrist on an on-going basis. If you ask her if she's fine, then she says fine, even when she's really not. One week she's good, the next she doesn't get out of bed. She also doesn't believe in taking medication.

She had traumatic experiences (from speaking with relatives) early in her life. She married young to some psycho boyfriend who raped her and threatened to kill her if she left him. She fled the state and started over and had me ten years later with some guy that wasn't psycho, but still a loser (what an improvement). 

Well, the relatives say that she's never been 'right' since that first husband saga. And the problem is that all of these people don't really 'believe' in sitting down and talking about your problems. So they never advised her to seek help. 

And so it's now 30 years later, and my mom has 30 year old psychological wounds that never healed. She can't take care of herself, and ironically is too closed off to open about that stuff and try to get an SSI case going. I'm surprised she opened one for me. 

Sorry, this is getting very /r/advice in here. What to do about my mom is my secondary concern at this point. I just care about lifting my *own* living standards. I'd like to Uber for a couple hundred a month to get breathing room, but by all indications, SSA is cut throat.

On the issue with my mom. I can't file for her. She's an adult - 55. She doesn't want to file under mental problems because she doesn't believe that she's actually bipolar... or has serious problems (despite docs strongly suggesting she is). I've seen a few of her after-visit summaries. She's in a bizarre state of denial despite clearing showing symptoms of bipolar, depression, and OCD. I may not have an M.D. or Ph.D., but I live with her. I just don't get it. And I don't know how I can help her. 

With regards to the Uber idea. I actually used the lump sum (took a while to get me approved) to buy a newer model Ford Escape. My insurance is basic though, and my MPG isn't great. But I'm so desperate for a few extra hundred a month. SSI says on paper that you can work up to 1100 without losing benefits. And of course, you can never keep more than 2000 in a bank (I guess I have to stuff money under the mattress). What stupid rules. 

My reservation about actually going through working is that they would look at it and use it as evidence to deny me at my first continuation review - next year.

You really need to set this all in front of an SSA worker at the local office and plead full ignorance and ask for help. If all those kinds of funds are in your SSI direct deposit account, it really needs sorted out by someone who can document it in the system.

I'm sure it will work out ok.  The SSA makes mistakes but as far as I've seen they do try to fairly help you when you screw up.  Just be painfully honest with them. If you think they did you wrong after, you can always file for an appeal.

I'm assuming you meant 'every month past'. 

&gt;Once you report that now, you'll have to go back every month from that point and figure out how much you were over that 2000 limit, document it and SSI will do their magic and deduct it all for overpayment. 

The overpayment will equal however much you were paid for each month that you had excess resources. Whether you had $80,000 in the bank, or $5000, the amount you owe back would be the same. 

&gt;If I have read the regs right, I'm sorry to tell you that you are probably going to lose most of that 3k in benefit cuts. 

They cannot withhold more than 10% of the maximum monthly payment to recoup the overpaid funds - in 2018 that means a $75 per month reduction in benefits. Unless, of course, you are still over resource, in which case you are due nothing until you fall below the resource limits again. 

&gt;I'm not sure but they may let you spend 3k and avoid some of the headache, maybe go buy a car or something.

Spend the excess on something sensible that you need. I mean, you *can* blow it on booze and hookers, but you sound like you're trying to make smart decisions. Pre-pay some bills or rent, buy clothes or household items you need. If you don't have a vehicle already, you can use it toward that as well - as long as you don't have more than one vehicle, the value isn't considered a resource.

&gt; The bill prohibits civil actions based on the failure to remove an architectural barrier to access into an existing public accommodation unless: (1) the aggrieved person has provided to the owners or operators a written notice specific enough to identify the barrier, and (2) the owners or operators fail to provide the person with a written description outlining improvements that will be made to improve the barrier or they fail to remove the barrier or make substantial progress after providing such a description. The aggrieved person's notice must specify: (1) the address of the property, (2) the specific ADA sections alleged to have been violated, (3) whether a request for assistance in removing an architectural barrier was made, and (4) whether the barrier was permanent or temporary.


So, instead of outright expecting businesses to be ADA complaint,  individuals with disabilities must deal with a series of escalating claims in order to convince the business to become accessible. So, this bill disincentives businesses to become ADA compliant and puts the burden on the disabled individuals instead, correct?


&gt; [***Withdrawal of the Statement of the Department of Justice on Application of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. to State and Local Governments' Employment Service Systems for Individuals with Disabilities***](https://www.ada.gov/withdrawn_olmstead.html)


&gt;This action was taken to afford further discussion with relevant stakeholders, including public entities and the disability community, as to how best to provide technical assistance in this area. Withdrawal of this guidance document does not change the legal responsibilities of State and local governments under title II of the ADA, as reflected in the ADA, its implementing regulations, and other binding legal requirements and judicial precedent, including the U.S. Supreme Court’s Olmstead decision. This withdrawal should not be understood as expressing any view on the legal merits of the principles set forth in this Statement, or on the merit of any specific procedures currently in place in any State or local jurisdictions. The Department will continue to fully and fairly enforce all laws within its jurisdiction, including the ADA.


How the hell does this *afford* businesses to become more ADA complaint?

Can someone tell me what other specific aspects of the ADA this will change?

I applied for and was approved for SSDI pretty quickly.  It will take you time to adjust to your vision loss and learn new ways to do things.  SSDI will give you financial assistance during this process, and through the Ticket to Work program, you might get help with the cost of retraining to a new field and assistive technology to help you stay employed.  

Another factor is transportation.  If you live in an urban area, you’ll have a lot easier time due to more public transportation options/Uber/Lyft, etc.  I plan to go back to work somewhere at least part time (you can earn $1170 or a little over $1900 a month if you are legally blind while on SSDI). However, I live in a rural area with no public transportation, so Ill have to sell my house and uproot my family.  It takes time to do this and SSDI is a big help.

Best of luck to you.  It’s a tough thing to go through.  It’s a lot like grieving after losing a loved one, so be sure to take care of your mental health as well.

1. In Jr High School there was a couple of kids that bullied everyone.  I stood up to one after taking so much and he backed down and never bothered me again.

2. Over-emotional.  I was quiet in school.  Had troubles making friends.  Nervous about talking to people.  Never satisfied with myself.  Never felt like I measured up.  Had nightmares about it.

3. I tried working before and could never hold a job for long or get into a higher paying position due to being afraid of the responsibilities.  I'm not currently working.

4. I live in my parents basement.  Hopefully in this next year I'll be living with my brother in his new home.

5. Single, never married.

6. Never had anything remotely serious.  ""Dated"" 3 girls in the past.

7. Relationships, just talking to girls is one of the hardest things for me.  Yes.

8. I never travel anywhere.

10.  How would your disability affect your work?  My answer would be,""I won't be able to accept this job because this interview is freaking killing me right now!!!""

11.  I haven't had an interview since getting disability.  I've had to cancel a couple of them due to anxiety.

12. I look after me.

13. I pay rent to my parents.  I'd assume it's enough to cover my expenses.  Disability is BARELY enough to keep me surviving.  If I didn't have family to live with, I would have to beg for food or go naked or something.  I couldn't afford anything more than shelter and food.

14. Invisible disability.

15. Can't work, can't go to school, can't date, struggle to even spend time with friends and family.  I haven't overcome them.  It's beating me.

17.  Beggars can't be choosers.  I'm thankful there is a system to help me.  Without it I'd probably kill myself because it's either homelessness or mooching off family.  Either is too much.  But Disability isn't quite enough.  I think SGA should be the minimum amount someone on disability should recieve.

18. Any assistance is welcome.  I think there needs to be better insurance coverage.  Medicare and Medicaid are limited.  I'm not able to see competent doctors, so treatment is ineffective.

19. I expect people to understand that they don't understand and don't judge some of us with these invisible disabilities.  They are just as debilitating as having no legs if not worse.  I would be more successful if I want emotionally normal but had no legs.  I expect them to not judge....actually I don't because people are jerks.  But I wish they wouldn't.

20.  Dreadful doesn't even describe it.  It's torture, like living in a dungeon.  I'm so depressed, so anxious about going even if I don't have to work for a week.  I'm sick all the time because I'm nervous.  It takes so much energy for me to just go that I deplete rapidly and end up quitting.  Then it takes me about a year to recover in order to try again.

**PART 1**

&gt;1.Were you ever bullied in school? 

Nope, I went to a very small rural school for most of my schooling, My teachers were not experianced with students with disabilities, but they listened to my feedback, I only had very minor issues with facilities being sub-par due to poor funding.

Some kids from a neighbouring Private school who I never met used to yell out the windows of their bus ""Run Forrest Run"" and ""Can I get a lift!?"" when they saw me walking home with my leg braces or wheeling home in my chair. 

But my actual co-students were understanding and asked questions when they weren't sure if they were behaving kindly. 

&gt; 2.What kind of difficulties you had in past? 

What time frame? I wasn't diagnosed until I was 23 despite my illness being genetic and congenital. That caused some difficulties with accessing the right kind of care, For example we couldn't get a disability permit for mums car, so unloading my chair was always difficult. Most of my difficulties are occurring now, as a young adult with no real income and learning about all the ways my lack of treatment as a kid has accelerated the deterioration of my condition.

&gt;3.Do you work? If yes then how do your co workers treat u?
 
I used to work, I studied Nursing, I was hoping to be a clinic nurse, but you have to do 2 years Ward rotation in my country to graduate, I worked as a sex surrogate to save to pay for my rotations. I was unable to complete my second year due to my condition deteriorating faster than we all expected.

I then worked in a call centre for a while. Lots of other people had disabilities, and other than days I need my chair mine is quite invisible. It wasn't exactly a social environment, I couldn't even name the person in the cubicle opposite me. My condition eventually got bad enough that I could not commute to that office 5x a week as expected.

I now volunteer at a museum for 6 hours once a week, taking sales in the gift shop. I only started last month so I haven't really had a chance to meet all the other volunteers or for them to know I have a disability.

&gt;4.Who do you live with? 

I used to live in share-housing up until last year. I'd find ads in the local classifieds and rent a room for a few months if the house was accesible. I'm only on a temporary disability payment while I wait for my case to be reviewed (every 3 months my doctor has to send off a letter saying ""Yup, she still has her genetic and incurable illness"". It's been like this the last 5 years), so it was hard to get an official lease because I had no true income. But now I live with my partner (lease is in his name) in a small flat.

&gt;5.Are you single, in a relationship or married? 

De-facto with my partner of &gt;2 years. We can't get married because we couldn't afford my medication, treatment and home help on his single income, I need to stay legally single because I need to be able to access disability services like pharmaceutical benefits. We'd like to get married one day.

&gt;6.How many relationships u had? 

This is my second serious relationship.

&gt;7.Is it true that relationships r challenging? How? 

I think finding out I used to be a sex worker turns people off more than being disabled does.

My first partner struggled with my disability. He felt useless and helpless watching me in pain, knowing there was nothing either of us could do. 

It's also a lot of pressure on partners to take over from home-help. When I lived in share housing I had a professional carer come around once a week to help me around the house, My Aunt has a carer come around every day. Because I had Housemates I wasn't entitled to daily visits. Which meant I would have to call my boyfriend to come over to my house to help me shower, because I wasn't going to ask a housemate to help!

It really blurs the lines between lover and carer, and my current partner is only 22 (I'm 26) I don't want him to have to help me use the toilet. But what else can we do when I'm not eligible for a home nurse because I live with a partner? We can't afford a private nurse.

My symptoms limit the kinds of dates we can go on, the kind of quality time we can spend. Sometimes I am unable to provide touch or be touched because my skin is crawling or my nerve endings are on fire. My hips dislocate and my skin tears easily so sex is not always on the table. I can not have children.

These are all things that could easily and understandably be deal-breakers for a potential partner.

I'm also unable to contribute to household income, so we'll never own a home in the suburbs. I'll be renting and living in public disability housing most of my life in between respite centres.

&gt;8.How often do you travel. 

How far? My partner and I sometimes drive 80km to the Great Ocean Road (In Victoria Australia) for a day trip every 3 months.

My Mother lives 120km away and thrice a year (her birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas) she'll drive up, pick me up, then drive home and i'll stay with her for a few days.

Every 5 years I take the train 300km to see my Uncle and visit my hometown.

I've never left Victoria (unless Moama counts) let alone Australia.

Car rides are very painful for me, and I haven't yet been cleared to fly after my last stroke.

&gt;9.What are some of the challenges you have to face when u travel? 

Bumpy roads and tight turns will dislocate my hip, vertebrae and neck, so I have to take anti-inflammatory medication before the trip and my partner will have to pull over often, and reset my joint on the roadside so I don't get nerve damage. I always have to have a full med kit with me in case my symptoms flare up and I go into hypertensive shock or have a stroke. But otherwise, we can load up the car abs go just about anywhere. 

I've been in Physical Therapy for a few years now and I have a lot more good days when I don't need my wheelchair, so we avoid travelling to new places on bad days when I need my chair.

a2fff976-dec8-42ac-aff5-304a03707fe5,1514356777,"1. I was bullied all throughout school until I reached college. There was always like-think where kids would try to, ""out run"" me since I was in a wheelchair and they could. In the 2nd grade this girl had me bleeding so I broke her nose. In the 4th grade, these kids were mad I was the teacher's pet so they threw rocks at me every time I went to recess so I had to stop going. In middle school, they were more personal insults like how, ""hideous"" I was and I'd never be attractive to a guy (mainly girls said this to me).
2. My whole childhood was spent in the hospital. Constantly it was doctors telling my mom that I would probably die prematurely because they didn't know how to treat me. I had 3 major operations. I was also helpless so I was molested by my father since I couldn't do anything.
3. I don't work because I can't drive and I don't near anywhere I could get to every day.
4. I live with my parents, they have to take care of me, however I'm currently in the works to live independently.
5. I'm in a long distance relationship. It's probably the best experience of my life!
6. I've been in 3 relationships so far, and I'm hoping this is the last.
7. I've only been in long distance relationships and so far, the guys I've dated have been REALLY accepting of my disability because it's not as bad as it was when I was younger, I've improved a lot so it doesn't necessarily get in the way anymore. I'm EXTREMELY lucky, honestly. But before that, not a single time up until I was 20 did a guy even compliment me (that's when I was improving, physically). So yes.
8. I've traveled plenty of times in my life ! It used to be a huge risk when I was younger, but these days, now that I'm not as limited, I can travel with ease.
9. Getting my ass through the airport because I can't manually push myself like most. With my disorder, my muscles give out easily so I can't rush through a huge ass airport. Luckily, they offer assistance if you tell them ahead of time and push me themselves.
10. I don't know. Not a single person has ever got back to me about interviews back when I was in college, ahaha!
11. N/A
12. My parents.
13. My SSI supports me as well as my parents. I can't get a job atm
14. AHAHAHA!! They stare ! My whole life, wherever I go, people like to stare, especially kids. They're so fascinated or horrified (depending on the age). I'll get dirty looks from teenagers, and parents hate me since their kids start asking so many questions and it embarrass them. Everyone likes to talk reeeeeally slow and like I'm a fuckin 4 year old. People like to automatically assume that since I'm in a wheelchair I must be mentally slow too.
15. Acceptance. It takes a long time for people to let go of the stigma they have in their head and see me as a person, not as a cripple in a chair. I hated myself for being crippled. I thought I'd never fall in love, no one would ever love me, and I'd die in a bed not able to move. I was soooo close to that, but luckily there was a breakthrough in my meds that turned that shit around. Still, I was seeing myself as the chair. Self fulfilling prophecy. I was always called the, ""anorexic gringo crippled bitch,"" and I believed it.
I overcame them when I was able to move for the first time in my life with those meds changing. I turned those insults into jokes, just owned up to them. Sure, I'm the skinny crippled bitch ; )
16. I plan to because I can't see myself doing too well if I didn't.
17. I'm FUCKING THANKFUL!! I see people without my benefits and it scares the shit out of me. Like...fuck me, I'm glad my mom was smart enough to get me all this shit...I'd be dead, literally.
18. I don't know. Pay for cannabis cards, that shit can help. I know they wouldn't because of pharmaceutical companies wanting the monopoly, but that'd be nice. I don't have that shit but I know of people that it's saved.
19. Treat me the way you want. I know who I am and I don't give a shit anymore.
20. Don't have any. Unless you count a teaching internship. Apparently I was the favorite in that school and they wanted me to be an art teacher. That school was really small, though, so it was hard to fit my chair in the small classrooms. But that's just how elementary schools are.   ",,,1,0,0,

&gt;10.When u go to job interviews what do u expect the questions that would b asked to u as u r disabled? 

Legally the only question an employer can ask in Australia is ""Do you have a disability that could effect your work?"" But as I am not able to work right now I'm not sure how I would answer that in the future.

My job at the call centre was found by my disability employment provider, so my employer already had documentation and paperwork about my condition and no questions were asked.

&gt;11.do u get hired after the interview? 

Yes, I  worked at the call centre for 9 months.

I haven't interviewed anywhere else since my condition deteriorated in early 2016.

&gt;12.Who looks after u? 

Just a note, This question would be more polite if you said ""Do you need assistance with self care of activities of daily living?""  Because ""who looks after you"" immediately assumes someone is looking after us, and that is a form of assumed incompetence and some people might feel like it's a type of ableism/Limiting the disabled.

Who takes care of me? Physically, I do.


On good days I can do almost everything I need to regarding self care by myself. I'm pretty low maintenance. I can't style my hair, so I just keep it cut short. I can't hang laundry on a tall line, so I just use a short clothes horse. I can't lift heavy pots or pans, or full jugs of water, But I don't need to I can make salad.

I'd like to have long hair, and eat elaborate cassaroles. But to do that I would need help. And I enjoy independence. 

I have bad days where I would need help showering, teeth brushing, food prepping etc, But I leave wet wipes and nutritional formula in my bedside table so If It's a really bad day, I can just wait it out, and then catch up on self care on a good day.

My partner helps me a lot when I'm having a string of bad days, he'll help me shower and prepare food and he'll take on the mental labour of taking my vitals and adjusting my medication. 

Taking care of myself is a full time job. It requires all of my energy, pain tolerance, cognitive power, and focus right now. If I had home help I could probably save energy and work outside the home, But using home help too much would make me feel less independent. I like being able to truthfully say that I take care of myself.

&gt;13.Does anyone financially support u? 

Taxpayers. I'm on Temporary Disability until I see a specialist who works strictly with my condition. I was only diagnosed in 2015, up until then I was ineligible for a permanent pension because you need a diagnosis. Now i'm ineligible because I haven't seen a specialist who treats my diagnosis. The waiting list is 36 months long.

My partner and I split all household cost 50-50, If I wasn't able to co-house with him, I'd still be renting bedrooms month by month with strangers. But I have always gotten by independently on my temporary pension ($250 per week, plus ~$30-50 for medication, travel and rent benefits)

&gt;14.How do people treat you when you r visiting some new place? 

I've never had any major issues. Other than finding out the hard way that a building has an unexpected staircase, or the seats are dead uncomfortable. I prefer to sit on the floor sometimes because of my bad hips, so I often have people asking if I'm ok, if I fell, etc. They are very caring and compassionate in my corner of Australia.

I did have an awkward conversation at the cinema the other day when I asked a cleaner where the lift was and they pointed me to the escalator and I said ""Oh, it's not running, so it's stairs, where's the lift?"" and she said ""You can just walk down the escalator?"" and I wasn't quite sure if she herself had a disability, because I was clearly in a wheelchair and I had to bite my tongue to make sure my tone was polite and respectful when I replied ""Yes, I know it's safe to walk down, But I can't walk down stairs, I'm in a wheelchair, We came up via the casino, but it's locked now. where is the lift for the cinema?"" But we had a laugh about it when she apologised and took me to a service elevator to use.

Some people think i'm lazy when I use disabled parking spots, priority seats on buses etc, because when i'm not in my chair or using my crutches or walker my illness is invisible. But nobody says anything.

A few months ago, when I met new people they'd ask what I do for a living and I would say ""I'm a full time homemaker"" or ""Oh, I have a complex illness, right now i'm focusing on my health"" and they were always polite, we'd talk about them, or they'd respectfully ask questions about my health. But for some people having to admit to having a health problem is embarassing.

I like talking to people about it. My illness is kinda rare, so there's lots to educate people about. Staring Next year I will be doing Disability Advocacy talks in schools via skype through my old Disability employment provider.

&gt;15.What kind of difficulties u had? How did u overcome them? 

This is similar to question number 2. My difficulties have been with struggling to get an official diagnosis and yet having a barrage of objective, disabling symptoms. I have never had the capacity to earn a liveable wage, so I am at the whim of the public healthcare system. Before I had a diagnosis a lot of doors were closed even though my doctor knew I had to get through that door in order to cope better with my health. Now that I have a diagnosis, There is still lots of waiting around for approval processes and waiting lists. The longer I wait the more my health fades and the more disabled I get. It's emotionally frustrating. Now there is so much paperwork involved in getting treatment, pensions, permits, etc and i'm not always cognitively functional enough to do it. My Mother is helping me with some of the treatment plan paperwork, and my partner is helping with my pension paperwork. I have a therapist to help me cope with the frustration of losing my functionality.

&gt;16.As u r working. Do u think u would use the benefits that the government provides for disabled people? Why or why not? 

Do you mean financial benefits or service of kind benefits?

I only volunteer, but I do use disability insurance services, They have given my employer a new computer keyboard so that I do not injure my hands as I type, and the government helped pay for a new ramp for behind the giftshop as there was a step up to the counter. 

I can not earn a liable wage even if my gift shop job was paid. I'd make $120 a week, In Australia, that is not enough to pay rent and electricity, let alone groceries and bus fare, and I have additional costs like medication and Physical Therapy fees. I will always need help - either a service in kind (eg: disability housing) or a monetary pension as a supplement to my income.


&gt;17.How satisfied are u with the benefits that government provides? 

I am only on temporary payments ($250pw) the permanent rate is $600 per week. I think I will be much healthier and happier if I am approved, as I can afford to start Prolotherapy, and buy a new neck brace and a power-assist wheelchair (the public healthcare supplied one isn't what I need) and maybe that will help me manage my symptoms better and I could contribute more to my community as thanks, or even seek paid employment again.

But the government has provided a heavy discount on my wheelchair, and my Physical Therapy fees. They can also help refit my flat with essential accesibility changes (a ramp, a handrail in the bathroom) but my landlord is stuck in red tape limbo with body corporate so that's all on hold right now.

I think the government does a good job at making sure everyone gets the bare minimum for survival. We have an aging population, so our system is spread thin, I'm just grateful we have a support system.

&gt;18.What other benefits should government provide to disabled people? 

NDIS is a new service and our government is still ironing out the kinks, If it works as planned, it will be revolutionary and I could not ask for more. It's not available in my area but should be here by Jan 1st.

There are a lot of teething problems right now. so I can't really say for sure, But it's about setting people up with affordable preventative/management services and treatment now, before their condition gets bad enough that we need twice as much treatment to manage the worsening symptoms.


&gt;19.How do you expect people to treat u? 

Like a person, With respect. Keep an open mind and ear, and don't assume to fully understand and relate to a personal experience.

&gt;20.Describe your experience with employment?

Boom Bust.

I give my all, I burn out, My symptoms worsen, I am forced to leave and find a lower impact job. I give my all, My symptoms worsen. 

I'm doing as low impact a job as I can think of, I sit in a chair, get up and stretch as needed, and sell 2-3 key-chains on an average day. 6 hours, once a week. What else is there?",,,1,0,0,
8a04b6f0-e845-4da9-8f53-83a4c83565d4,1514519989,"1. Hard to say, since I was such an oblivious and clueless child I didn't notice when people were bullying me; If I noticed anything at all, I always assumed the best and that I was misunderstanding what they were saying.

2. This is such a broad question, it's difficult to answer. Assuming that you mean difficulties relating to my disability specifically, of course. I still have them to this day. I exist in a world which is hostile to my brain and my behavior. 

A few examples: I am often seen as antagonistic when I am trying to be kind (and thus have to put in 3x the effort the average person does to come off as polite); my food and sensory issues are seen as ""immoral"" or ""childish"" somehow; and I face a lack of support with specific symptoms of my disability, such as executive dysfunctioning.

3. I don't currently work, but I am a full-time student and may be accepting an internship soon.

4. At college, I live alone. Outside of college, I live with family.

5. I'm single. 

6. I haven't really had any formal relationships - a few things here and there have happened, but none were significant or long enough for me to consider them relationships.

7. Of course relationships are challenging. Relationships are challenging for all people, usually, as they require work and effort and sacrifices. Again, assuming that you mean specifically relating to my disability - yes, I suppose?

I have something called 'alexithymia', which is a common autistic trait. It means that I can have a hard time identifying and recognizing emotions that I am having. For that reason, it can be very difficult to tell if I have feelings for another person. 

In addition, there is societal stigma that says that (non-autistic) people only date autistic people out of pity or wealth-seeking, that autistic people are childlike and incapable of wanting sex or romance, that autistic people are undesirable partners, that autistic people don't date or fall in love or care about people. I have, as I have grown up, internalized a lot of these messages and thought they were true about me, which has made me scared to date.

8. Uh, broad question. Depends. I travel relatively frequently due to breaks during college, so I can go back home. Before college, it depended on how much money my family had at the time.

9. Airports are expensive and love to shove everyone in as tight of a space as possible?

10. Unless I specifically tell the employer I am disabled, they wouldn't know, and if I did tell them right away, I probably wouldn't be hired. So -- they wouldn't ask anything different, probably. Regardless, as far as I know asking disabled (potential) employees to disclose information about their disability is illegal, so...

11. I've never really done an interview for anything significant.

12. Uh, me? I'm independent. When I'm with my family, my mom will help me out and get food and stuff, but you realize that disabled people can often take care of themselves, right? Not all disabled people have caretakers or assistants.

13. My family. I'm still a college student.

14. ...Very, very broad question. Depends on the place, depends on the people, etc. I'm not sure? To this day, I am also still pretty oblivious, so I don't notice when people are being harsh or rude, but I do know that studies show that non-autistic people, even if they don't know we are autistic, tend to talk to us less, want to be our friends less, etc. So they probably aren't as nice? IDK

15. See #2? Also, not all disabled people ""overcome"" all of our ""difficulties"" in the same way not all able people instantly overcome all of theirs.

16. I'm not working. If I was working, maybe? It's very very very hard to get on Disability. You basically have to be dying in front of their face. I know that a non-disabled person likely wouldn't have the insight into my personal life to understand that I'm *truly* disabled, they would probably think I'm *high functioning* and fine, so I likely wouldn't get disability. 

17. I... I don't use them?

18. Free medical care (like other countries), free mobility devices, stuff like that.

19. I don't even know what this means.

It’s the SJWs in carparks and disabled toilets who seem to think we get issued with a card that says “DISABLED” and we have to show them to prove that we are entitled to slightly closer car park, or use of the disabled toilets.

She's probably mortified that her kid has asked what (to an adult) is a highly inappropriate question and wanted to answer her child with minimal intrusion on your life. It sounds like she did just fine from what you heard too. 

You are of course not obligated to disclose your disability to anyone. But kids are curious rather than nosy, and making it a teachable moment can be invaluable for the way they interact with others in life. I personally see it as a positive moment whenever a kid asks about my disability because it's a chance for them to hear it directly from someone with experience. 

I am a youth leader and the kids often ask about my wheelchair. I tell them about it, why my legs don't work, and let the more patient ones try my chair. Tell them to try and reach x item or try to go to the bathroom without using their feet. It gives them a real insight into things 'but Raargh that's so HARD, how do you do it?!'. Unlike adults they don't do the whole pity dance, they're more impressed that I can do wheelies and push myself around all day. I have then heard those same kids go on to explain to other kids why I use a wheelchair and they're very accurate. 

If you feel you can and want to do it, it does make a difference to explain to people why things are the way they are. A lot of the bad feeling around disability comes from ignorance and the fear or anger that results from that.

I mean kids often say things which can be a bit outrageous or socially inappropriate and often parents just handle the situation because it's ""their problem"" rather than confronting the subject of their kid's curiosity and making a spectacle out of things. There's also the risk of unintentionally encouraging socially inappropriate behavior by feeding it with lots of social interaction and fuss when instead you can just address the question succinctly and brush it off quickly.

Next time, if you wanted to, you could always wave to the kid and say hi especially if they are that close.

More and more, cross-Atlantic flights are getting “accessible” restrooms. This is an awesome development (since it was like purple unicorn just ten years ago), however there are limits to greatness. “Accessible” in this context means large enough to wheel an aisle chair into. And with a toilet approximately level with aisle chair—emphasis on approximately. 

There are two things to check if you want to use this: 1. Is there an onboard “accessible” restroom, and 2. (crucial) do they ACTUALLY have the onboard aisle chair ONBOARD. This chair is NOT the same as the one used to board the plane. That belongs to the airport and stays at the airport. The plane is supposed to have its own onboard aisle chair. “Supposed to.” It’s...not always there, even if they have the larger onboard restroom. (It’s often there! Just don’t rely on it without checking first.)

An important feature to take into account is that, almost always, the rule is that the flight attendants WILL NOT lift you. By almost always I mean, perhaps there are exceptions, but on every international flight I’ve taken (which is fairly numerous) I’ve been told this, rather stridently. They will push the chair, but they will not lift. If course, that’s just company policy, and flight attendants are people too. In reality they’ll often help a bit more. But officially...no lifting.

Overall, I think onboard restrooms on international flights are *verging* on something you can count on. So close. But there are many issues with them that suggest you shouldn’t  completely bank on them. The transfers are HARD (wow those little aisle chairs and weird cramped restrooms are awkward), the equipment isn’t always there, and help is minimal.

The planes all have “aisle chairs”, which are absurdly tiny chairs that they strap you into so the flight attendants can roll you from seat to the bathroom. So many straps, but if you don’t have use of your arms make *sure* they get the straps around them, because I’ve never had a flight attendant use that chair without bumping me into a half-dozen other seats along the way. Your hands could get seriously hurt if you didn’t notice.

So the big question is do you have use of your arms? If so, you’re probably okay: transferring to the aisle chair is easy enough (and they take care of all the straps. When you get to the bathroom, every single time The flight attendant has asked if I needed help getting inside (despite my being male/attendants being female). I didn’t, because there is usually a metal bar right around the edge of the door. I haul myself up on it and use the momentum to get to either the sink (and open the toilet) or directly onto the toilet if it’s already open. 

They always wait outside with the chair, and once they see me start trying to open the door they help. 

If you don’t have use of your arms, it will be more difficult. Everything from getting their attention (the call button is on the ceiling) to getting into the bathroom will be more complicated, but, again, they’ve always offered to help so I assume they have some training. 

There generally are not accessible bathrooms. I believe that a Virgin Air trans-Atlantic jet I was on had them once — but they were really just larger bathrooms for first class, and I didn’t get to use one. Generally they are so small that you can sit on the sink if you have to when getting in, and just turn yourself around to sit on the toilet.

I just had an absurdly long flight to Japan this year. My advice would be to take every lay-over you can find (the flight from Toronto to Narita was so, so much worse than the flight from Narita to Calgary) so you have access to airport facilities. 

Other than the bathroom stuff, you need to make sure the flight crew radios ahead to the destination to provide a ramp. I got stuck recently for almost half an hour because they hadn’t. Flight crews are generally very willing to bring you food/drink if you need to take meds — just ask them.

Many first applications result in a denial which will take around 2 years from the denial before having an ALJ hearing - which is important to have a disability lawyer for.

SS will want recent documented mental health evaluations (psychiatric/therapist notes). The more recent the better. They may also send you to one of their doctors to be evaluated.

As for still selling on ETSY/self publishing on Amazon - it depends on how much you make from doing so and if you qualify for SSI or have enough work credits for SSDI, either way this will effect the disability amount that you would receive.

This is a non-medical issue - they will have to reschedule the redetermination (periodic non-medical reviews). 

They'll go over all of the non-medical eligibility issues since your last review: where you are living &amp; with whom, how much you pay in rent, etc., any other sources of income during that time (public assistance, part time work, family members giving you money to help pay your bills), resources owned during that time (like vehicles, properties, bank balances), marriage, etc. If *any* of these things have changed at all since your last review (or since you were originally approved, if this was your first review) be prepared to provide details and possibly proof. The faster you can provide any necessary evidence once they get the review scheduled, the faster you can get reinstated. 

How long it will take is going to be entirely dependent on the local SSA office - the level of staffing, workloads, etc. I sincerely hope you live in an area with a well-staffed office, because no matter how bad things are, you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. It is very  important that you get yourself heard - it is also true that the individual working on your case probably hasn't had time to check their voicemail or return calls, and those things are in direct contradiction to one another. Most of our day is dictated to us - we don't get to say, ""I have a shit-ton of [very important workload] that needs to be done - I'm going to work on that today."" We have appointments scheduled *for* us, to hell with the work that may be piling up on our desk.

It's a disgusting situation, which does nothing but hurt the public. The people in your local office are 99.9% likely very hard working people doing the best they can with a shitty situation - it's the politicians that put us all in this situation, that refuse to replace staff, and it hurts only those in need.

I grew up needing a 504 plan, and I'm almost finished with my degree in special education, and all of this just makes me so sick. THIS is why I'm becoming a SPED teacher! THIS is why I'm going to claw my way to the district office and become an advocate (in my state at least, there is a particular person who can come to the IEP meetings to ensure that the school is doing what they're supposed to).

I am sad. I'm sad, and frustrated, and nauseous, and I kinda want to cry. I know what that woman's son is going through/went through. I have had teachers lock me in the bathroom (preschool) or put me in the hall (grade school) so I could ""cry myself out"" because I was overstimulated and scared. I've had teachers since kindergarten forget or ignore my 504 and place me in the back of the room or give me tiny print papers (bad vision). I got in trouble once for talking in the hall because I was asking another student to read my watch for me so I could know if it was time to take off the eye patch I often had to wear to school. Currently in college, I have had professors that refuse to let me take my test in the disability services building (where it's quiet and they print my tests bigger for me) or refuse/forget other accommodations on a regular basis.

Ambassadors are people who have various forms of disabilities, and we go into classrooms to discuss the concepts of accessibility and inclusion, as well as introducing Rick Hansen himself (he rolled around the world in his wheelchair!). Then we talk about our own stories. 

I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and I've been part of the program for a couple years now. I actually just finished being interviewed by a group of kids a couple months ago, where they came up with a Powerpoint presentation and wrote an essay about me. The previous year, for the science side, a group of kids tried to come up with some theoretical invention that would help me in my life. I really enjoy this kind of outreach. 

I highly encourage you to look at the Rick Hansen site here https://www.rickhansen.com/Our-Work/School-Program/Ambassadors 
They have free lesson plans to fit Ambassador presentations into all levels of Canadian provincial curriculums. You can choose to book a presentation by an Ambassador if you're in Canada too. All of this is totally free. Even if you aren't in Canada, I'm sure you can find some useful things on the site you can adapt. 

Personally, I've been in severe chronic pain for the past 17 years, since I was 13 years old. This impacts every facet of my life, but I've still been able to do some pretty cool things. I spoke at a conference at the University of New England to all of their medical-field students, and I actually got the chance to carry the Olympic torch for the 2010 Vancouver Games on behalf of all Canadians with chronic pain. 

I'd love to help if you're interested.

I live in a tiny town with no resources for groups or activities that I'm interested in (it's mostly old women with church groups). I feel your pain about feeling like you have nothing to give, and also about finding friends. It's really difficult. The only friends I have live in my computer, and I usually go days w/o talking to anyone on the phone or the computer. I only have reason to go out once a week for supplies, as there is nothing to do here. I've been single for 9 years now. I go on those free dating sites and you can guess what type of people are on those. In my area, mostly rednecks who have never been out of their county, much less state. 

Despite what people say, we're not living ""high on the hog"" getting disability. We're always going to be broke. I'm investing all of my backpay after buying a few needed things, and am living off of the monthly pay. It depends on how long you can stand living with your family. SAVE YOUR MONEY while doing so. Don't buy anything you don't need. I would stay as long as you can handle it, then you'll have a little nest egg if you move out. Any possible way you can find a room to rent? May be cheaper than low income? Just renting a room will give you flexibility to leave if it doesn't work out, not signing a lease with someone. I'm thinking of renting out my extra bedroom in my condo for about $400-500 all included. 

Anyway, I have no solutions for you, just to let you know you're not alone. I mean you are, but you're not the only one in that position. It sucks. Most times I am like a hermit. I stay in my home and only go outside to take the trash out. It's very, very lonely.

speaking from experience here. i've had good experiences with museums becuase they usually need people to help with organizing/maintenance or talking to the public (the last isn't my strongest suit personally but that's all the more reason to do it in an understanding volunteer setting when able).

moving out wouldn't be a bad goal either if you want to do it, but i wouldn't do it just out of embarrassment. in many countries extended family lives together for economic reasons, there's nothing inherently wrong with it. if you do still want to move out and low income housing is actually that terrible where you live then there are probably cities with a lower cost of living where you would be able to scrape by and you could move to one of those.",,,3,0,0,

I'm 37, have a wife of 12 years and our relationship is okay but there is a lot of room for improvement and I don't feel like my efforts are ever reciprocated. Have a beautiful three-year-old daughter who is quickly becoming my only source of joy in life. I have financial stability and I currently have reliable personal care.

So, what in the world am I complaining about? I was meant for more. I am an intelligent man who cares about others, talented at photography and I have had opportunities to use it for the benefit of others. Occasionally earns a few dollars but that always puts my financial security at risk. Lately chronic pain and unreliable people have just made me want to give up. I want to focus on my family but I have already explained the circumstances of my significant other and obviously I'll give my daughter all of the effort and attention she needs but I'm keenly aware of friends that are older than I, also disabled, whose lives turned to mush once the kids moved out because they had nothing for themselves.

I don't want to give up photography or what I'm good at, but people just continually disappoint me and show their unreliability. That silent invisible stone wall, all the time! My best bet is to try to book shoots with people who do not know that I have a disability and then they are stuck with me. Obviously I chose to reveal my disability to my wife early when we were dating and that was the right decision. As for models and other people I photograph, they don't need to know. Give them the first 30 min. of dumbfounded look on their face then we can actually get down to work and make great images. Too often location accessibility is an issue unless I'm making the calls, and future shoots, even though they rave about my work, often don't come together because I'm that guy who uses a wheelchair and he might not be able to participate.

Now I am ranting on your post. I see myself doped up, in a home, lighting stupid little still life things with flashlights and photographing them with a phone in 20 years. I hate that idea but I think I'm trying to come to terms with it because it is what it is, I don't believe in reveling in the glory days and I feel like I will find greater peace with acceptance of what is to come then with struggling against my own mobility, pain and access instead of struggling to wrangle the light in just the right way to make a great image.

I'm going to agree with the post to which I am replying, try to get some sort of stability, backup plan and minimalist structure and routine so that when something happens you can get through it with the minimal amount of further damage to your well-being.

i'm assuming you're going to get some kind of backpay? because that wouldn't count towards the asset limit for several months and then you add that to the $1.8k. once you're in a city it would be easier to do stuff like volunteer work, community college, etc, so it makes sense to me to try to move first rather than staying in a more isolated region where it's harder to work toward your goals. and then if your career goals didn't work out at least you would at least have some other things working out in your life.

Learn to live out of everything that you can fit into a hiker's backpack and have everything ready to go at a moment's notice.  Don't get too comfortable or attached to your current routine or way of life; you can not control other people, and they will always find a reason to give your living space to someone who can actually repay them in tangible benefits for the privilege of having a place to live.

If people were suddenly nothing but social perfection and you became highly sought after, circumstances be damned, things might be different.

Though it may not be impossible to find volunteer work, for instance, that and most other things would probably necessitate moving to one of the nearby 'cities'. The lack of support and judgment on the part of my family and the way I described it might be slightly edging on hyperbole, it's just that I was in a very diminished state when I wrote this and tension is pretty recurrent in this house as it is, at least enough for it to feel oppressive. 

I do -want- to live on my own but I'm simply at a loss for if it's really a good move. For right now I can easily save money at the very least, which is a plus, so if I ever did come to some kind of plan and utilized whatever savings programs they allow for moving or school or ....whatever....it's probably just become a thing of objective sense to stay living where I'd really rather not be. 

Obviously indecision and procrastination have become my chief skills and are typically exploited by my mental health or lack thereof. ",,,2,0,0,

All I can offer to the whole thing is this - my daughter, who is a very strong, independent woman with a good head on her shoulders - is in a relationship with a young man who I felt had nothing to offer. He is also on disability, also for mostly invisible conditions, and from the outside to someone who doesn't know anything about him, he looks like a loser. But, once she got to know him, she found that he treated her with more love and respect than any other man she'd dated - he's making her extremely happy, they've been together for a couple of years now, and are engaged to be married. 

There is hope for you in this area, as long as you have love to give. In the meantime, remember that anyone who thinks you aren't worth their time is *definitely* not worth yours. I know that doesn't ease the ache of loneliness, but perhaps it could be a light at the end of the tunnel.",,,7,0,0,

But it’s still shitty so I’m just... careful about who I disclose to. You gotta earn it. I decided to try and finally go to college so when people ask what I do I mention that or a hobby (oh I’m a student and photographer) instead of outright lying (I work blah blah blah job) or blatant truth (I don’t work I’m on disability). It’s a fine line... and I’ve had it thrown in my face. But you get better at spotting those who will be kind about things.  ",,,1,0,0,
