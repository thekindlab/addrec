She was out of line to demand that cart from you. Assuming that you were ""not disabled enough"" is a perennial problem in our society. People need to be taught about the various kinds of disabilities at an early age, so this kind of self-serving prejudice will not be as common, maybe?  Good supportive shoes are too hot for some people and good supportive sandals are expensive. I have ""hot-foot syndrome"" [my father has it too] and am still having trouble finding supportive shoes that don't make my feet feel like they are on fire. She may not have this syndrome though, and yes, she should wear better shoes that flip-flops. I see this some of this problem as the store's fault because disabled people are never their priority: profits are. If they buy another cart it'd cost them. I wonder if a complaint to the management would light a fire under them to get them to purchase another cart? ",,,13,0,0,

It would vary so widely between the different disabilities.  I think the reason people say ""just ask!"" is because everyone feels differently about it.  Personally, I would not want someone to call me disabled, but I know there are others out there that would not mind.  I think the very first question for most people would be some version of ""Are you comfortable sharing information with me about your disability?""  

After you've determined they are comfortable talking about it, I think any genuine concern or curiosity would be fine.  Using basic tact.. (Not ""What happened to you?"", rather ""I'd really like to know more about x disability, would you be comfortable talking to me about when and how you were diagnosed?"").

a9090660-b2d1-4f4a-b00d-32880c994553,1492015521,"My wife is a quad so adjacent info here:

Many wheelchair users get very tired of hearing ""You're such an inspiration"" or similar.  People mean it as a compliment, but wheelchair users often hear it MANY times a day and it ends up ringing kind of false, especially if the person is doing nothing more than just being outside the house rolling down the street.

In a similar vein, I am also told that I am such a great person because I chose to date/marry someone in a wheelchair.  I find it strange and it gets old.

Many people will feel awkward around a person in a wheelchair and will get super nervous or embarrassed and end up saying something like ""Just walk that way.....uh, um, uh...I mean you need to go over that way"" and turn beet red.  I would say 95% of the chair users I have met have no issue with someone using the word walk, they know what you mean.  A newly injured person might get angry at something like this, but even then it seems pretty rare.

A lot of my wife's good friends were initially supportive after her car accident, but drifted away over the next couple years.  Several reasons, but to me it seemed like:

*1) it is often more work to include someone in a wheelchair in your plans - and they didn't want to put in the work, wanted to be able to be more spontaneous.  

*2) didn't know how act/feel around my wife...they couldn't get past the chair/paralysis and see her as a normal person anymore.

*3) didn't like the attention that it brought them when they were out together - people do stare and sometime give disapproving looks, etc..

And there is only 1 wheelchair accessible bus (ie: with a ramp) every hour, But there is a standard bus every 15 minutes! 

You can lift a pram over the bus threshold without a ramp, you *can't* lift a power wheelchair.

Like, I get you were here first, sometimes the bus will pull over, the doors will open and the driver will just frown ""sorry, the wheelchair spot is full"". That's totally fine!

But what's not ok is when I;m at the bus stop for 10 minutes, then a person and their pram will arrive, push in front of me, lift their pram over the threshold, then park in the wheelchair spot, before the driver even notices I'm at the stop and need the ramp.

I've had some lovely drivers turn around at this point and tell the pram-owner that they pushed in and will have to get off and wait in line, if they can't fit on, that's their problem, they can wait 15 minutes, The wheelchair users have to wait an hour!

But some drivers will not be as confrontational, which is valid, because some pram-owners get really aggressive when drivers ask them to wait their turn

I don't use a power chair anymore thank god, I mostly use crutches but some days I have a transit chair. If I can't be bothered waiting for a wheel-chair accessible bus, sometimes I'll just crawl onto the bus and my friends will lift my chair on for me. Bus drivers usualy yell ""You need to wait for a ramped bus, there will be one in 90 minutes!"" but i've waited a number of times for the scheduled ramped bus, only to find the depot made a last minute replacement, and sent a standard bus, and I've been waiting outside in the elements for nothing, and I'll need to call a taxi anyway.

And taxi's aren't cheap. bus fare; $5.60 flat rate. Accessible cab flagfall; $12, + $2 per km travelled (Regular cabs are $6 flagfall :/ ). If I need to go to my doctors, 20km away, that's a $50-$60 taxi ride. I'm on a fixed income ($200 per week), I can't afford to travel like that. I need the bus to be reliable.

Uber is like 50c/km, able bodied people can uber instead of taxi if they miss the bus, I don't have that luxury.",,,4,0,0,

I got sick and eventually became disabled through and unfortunate turn of events, so I never had the trauma, but I've definitely had to deal with mourning the loss of who I used to be and the dreams of what I wanted to be. Everyone is different, but relearning that you're still a capable person while being disabled can be difficult. There can be a lot of self hatred and depression in the beginning, but you eventually come out of that and begin to realize that you're still you, you've just got different parameters to work with. And sometimes there's shit you just can't do anymore, and you have to figure out how to accommodate that. Honestly, the most worst part of being disabled is not the disability, it's how society treats you and your disability. (I'm positive that there are disabled people who disagree, because everyone experiences being disabled differently, but I would say this is a pretty widely accepted school of thought)

Just go ahead and know that the entire system of getting to this help is designed to thwart you and encourage people to give up. I know that sounds really...whats the word? paranoid? But it's something I've seen with my own eyes and it's an often repeated refrain from those who've had contact with this system. 
I'm currently on year 2 of fighting for assistance (I didn't stay after my case like I should have so some of this time is my fault) and have just obtained an attorney who is taking on my case since I've been denied (this is very very common in my state; Alabama). In the mean time you need to focus on insuring you'll have a place to stay while this whole process is underway. You mentioned Conway SC and a quick google search found some shelters around there that could potentially help you out, if that is even where you're still at. Make use of whatever resources are available to you locally and I'd also dig around online and see if there aren't charities or programs designed specifically to assist autists who are struggling in similar circumstances (i have a strong feeling such things exist).

If you are receiving SSDI, there is no prorated reduction in your benefit payment based on your monthly income.

Social Security will cease your benefits if your monthly income exceeds the yearly substantial gainful activity level ($1,170 for 2017) after you have already completed a trial work period.

What's a [trial work period](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/twp.html)? It is an opportunity to test your ability to work without any immediate effect on your SSDI benefits. 

While in the trial work period, there are no limits on your monthly income from work. Your trial work period ends once you have completed nine ""month[s] of services"" - any month in which your income exceeds $840 in 2017. 

So your benefits won't be jeopardized until you complete a trial work period (9 months where your earnings exceeded $810) and, even then, your income will not directly impact your SSDI benefits unless you make over the substantial gainful activity limit.

Even if all of that happens, there is an [extended period of eligibity](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0413010210#a) that makes it really easy to reinstate your benefits if your income drops below substantial gainful activity levels within 5 years of your benefits being ceased.

In addition, one thing that I've encountered a lot by medical professionals is a lack of respect towards my body and an assumption that they or their colleagues know it better than I do. I'm a wheelchair user with a progressive neuromuscular disease and I've had extensive spinal surgery. I've lived with my condition for over 26 years. Recently, I was at a neurology centre in a unit that supposedly specializes in my condition. I specified prior to the appointment that I would need a particular type of hoist (specialized for the type of surgery I've had) to transfer out of my chair and was told this was fine and no problem at all. When it came to transferring on the day, the nurse on duty refused to use the hoist I'd asked for (which was in a room across the hall) because she believed she knew better than me despite objections from both myself and my carer. What was the result? I was hoisted in a way that is inappropriate to my body and it is now 3 weeks later and I'm still in pain. She did not apologize but proceeded to tell me that she has lifted other patients like me and they've never had a problem. I can't describe how much that makes me rage. She caused me pain that I still haven't recovered from, refused to listen to my repeated instructions and continued to think her training and her experience was more important than my knowledge *of my own body*.

That's one example but similar sorts of situations happen often. I used to think I was just not clear enough or maybe I was too soft in the way I set boundaries but it has become apparent that it's just a lack of respect towards my body and myself as an individual. When you grow up with a physical disability, you become accustomed to viewing your body as some external thing. My therapist describes it as being a ""floating head"". It's like everyone has ownership and a say over your body when no able-bodied person would be treated that way. Frankly, over time, repeated events like the one I described above start to feel genuinely violating. It's upsetting not so much because of the pain, I can handle that, but because of the way it feels to have your body disrespected by the very same people who are supposed to be caring for it and healing it. I wish someone had taught me earlier as a child that I have the right to say no and the right to demand my body is treated with the respect it deserves.",,,3,0,0,

I've had people ask about my crutches, and my braces this way and it's always felt so polite and it's made me *want* to talk to them even if I was tired.

But I've also had people ask in a way that was rude/acusatory. phrasing questions like ""hey, yesterday I saw you on crutches but today you're out jogging, what gives?"" yes it's just a question fueled by curiosity, but the language unknowlingly taps into the disability binary, and it feels acusatory. Instead, try ""Oh hey, I saw you yesterday when you had crutches, does your condition waver? if it's not too personal, could you tell me more about how that works?"" because that just feels a little less like ""are you *really* disabled"" and more ""I'm so curious I just have to know!"" which is what I like to see.

The main thing to avoid is a language or tone that makes it seem like you think your entitled to the information. Sometimes things are too personal, or i'm in a rush, too tired, or having major sensory processing issues or brain fog and I just can't talk at that time, some people are polite and will say ""sorry to have interrupted your day, but i wish you the best, thanks for your time, bye"" but others will act all butthurt as if I am a bouncer, unfairly keeping them from information.

I think many of his utilitarian notions are based on completely generalized and misled notions regarding disabled quality of life. That said, this article is filled with faulty assumptions regarding Singer's own views, and I personally believe that if we're ever to win this argument, we shouldn't spend excess communal effort arguing points that aren't actually being made.

Singer never attempts to justify the rape of ""disabled people"". His arguments lie solely within the scope of this single bizarre incident. Singer simply poses the question of whether or not a person who will never be capable of understanding the psychological implications of sexual contact, forced or consensual, is risking anything by engaging in sexual activity (assuming of course that there's also no risk of pregnancy, STI transmission, or physical injury). The analogy that the article's author makes regarding molesting an infant is faulty because that infant will develop psychological disorders as it grows that it wouldn't otherwise have, thus there *is* a degree of risk. The entire principle of statutory rape is based on the widely-accepted fact that the people involved who don't understand the implications of the actions *at the time* might someday re-experience them when they manifest themselves as psychological illness. If there's no chance of this happening, and the individuals involved would experience physical gratification, is consent even a meaningful issue?

It's ridiculous because being a wheelchair user is the difference between living independently and being a nonfunctional, exhausted, ball of pain for me, but everyone wants to let me know what a tragedy it is.

People touch me all the time without asking. The worst was a bus driver patting me on the head and shoulders and telling me what a good boy I am, which was especially gross because 1) I'm black and an adult and do not want to be called ""boy"" by a white person, and 2) as a DV survivor I don't want to be touched without warning by strangers. People will also grab stuff away from me without asking in an effort to ""help""--door handles I'm already opening, groceries out of my basket to put them on the belt. If I say ""no"" they usually don't listen. 

Dorky jokes about horsepower and licenses and speed limits. It wouldn't be as big of a deal if it wasn't /always/ older white men.

I'm 27 years old and man oh man are they awful. Long story short I was told way back in high school that they had *so* many things they could help me with and this and that and I never got much of anything other than help paying for college for the first half of my schooling and only for specific portions. And even now with, thankfully, a job, both VR and the job agency they threw me with wants constant updates (which I mean really what am I supposed to tell them on a weekly basis? ""yep, still working""?)

But anyways, back to the topic at hand about Social Security. They honestly are the worst. Without getting too into detail because it'll probably turn into a completely separate and long rant, I lost my benefits for a year, a full year, while they tried to claim I never deserved benefits in the first place even though for about two or so years I would get letters verifying that yes I did indeed deserve the help. I eventually got it straightened out, but that was a miserable, stressful year of trying to fix it. (And to make things worse, that job thing? I have to report to them what I earn and I've been working since the end of January and I found out a few weeks ago the various agents I'd talked to over the past few months that repeatedly assured me I was set up in the system hadn't been telling the truth so my wages haven't been reported either, so that's great too. We'll find out next month if it's fixed or not.)

So, without turning this into a bigger rant than I probably already have, no, it's totally not just Nevada that's like that. It seems like SSI/SSD is a pain no matter where you are in the country which is just completely stupid. It's totally a broken system that I wish they'd fix already.",,,1,0,0,

It seems misguided to cut off someone who is disabled to save money when you have all these blatant cases of corruption that cost far more. In PA there was a story a few years ago where two judges were taking illegal kick-backs to send kids to private juvie detention centers, resulting in both a drain on the budget and the loss of civil rights for thousands of children. The two judges were later convicted but that doesn't help all the lives they destroyed (including a couple of kids who had killed themselevs over their experiences) and it does nothing to hold accountable the private corporations who did the bribing (last time I checked, if you bribe someone both you and the bribe-taker have committed a crime- so why did the companies get away with it!?!?).

- You have a lot of thoughts and they may be ""within normal limits"" or they may indicate a disease process. Almost impossible to tell over the internet. Please go see a psychiatrist just to get it checked out--if it isn't anything concerning, then at least you'll know it isn't a disease process.
- Regarding automation--yes, it is true that robots have increasingly large roles in the economy. Nonetheless, it is also true that people have been moaning about the negative effects of automation since the beginning of time. Has email led to a paper-free office? Definitely not. So it is almost certain that there will still be a role for people.
- You're correct that a mental health professional won't be able to help you with your faulty understanding of physics. But at least s/he can help you get to a mental state to really delve into and understand physics on your own or with help from someone else.
- Therapists (and medical providers in general) are trained to treat every single patient as worth saving. You are doing yourself a disservice to pre-emptively dismiss yourself this way.

No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual **on the basis of disability** in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.

42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)

&gt;(1)  Disability. The term ""disability"" means, with respect to an individual--

&gt;(A)  a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;

&gt;(B)  **a record of such an impairment**; or

&gt;(C)  being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).

42 U.S.C. § 12102

But...

&gt;(a)  In general. It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this Act that an alleged application of **qualification standards**, tests, or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation, as required under this title.

&gt;(b)  Qualification standards. The term ""qualification standards"" may include a requirement that an individual shall not **pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.**

Her SSI was going to be cut off back in February because it had been 3 years since she first got approved, and she needed to prove to them that she was still disabled. The doctor they sent her to determined that she wasn't any more, which we strongly contest for multiple reasons, but that's the point of the appeal and not what I'm getting into here.

We asked SSA and her lawyer, and both told us that ONLY the SSI was being discontinued, so we filled out the paperwork within 10 days of notification so she could both appeal and continue receiving benefits during the appeal process. In March, she received both checks and thought all was well. We received a letter stating that her SSI was going to be resumed during the appeal process, and in that letter we were told that the amount she was to be receiving from SSI was being adjusted because she was still receiving SSDI, just like it always had been. Now, her April checks were due, and she only has SSI, which hasn't been readjusted due to the removal of SSDI, and her SSDI has been shut off with no information as to why.

I'm assuming they lied to us and the renewal was for both, and when we appealed the decision, they only appealed the SSI and not the SSDI as well. Her lawyer reviewed the letters she had received, and ONLY her SSI was listed as being discontinued. We checked with the SSA, and they said that ONLY the SSI was being discontinued. March, she received both payments, and the last communication we have was regarding her SSI being reinstated during the appeal process.

I specifically ordered removable handles for mine that I only use to toss a backpack on. I've also had other young people give me the stink eye for asking to sit in a priority seat on a bus.

I have been unable to get into so many buildings because of the lack of accessibility. This includes doctor's offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, churches, houses, apartments, shops, and even newer buildings that definitely should at least have a ramp.

NYC transportation is super if you're able bodied, but just a handful of places are accessible. If the elevators are even working that day. Even busses can be a nightmare.

Having my own friends start to tell me what my limits were and weren't was super frustrating. Yeah, I started using mobility aids, but I'm not useless. I also stopped getting invited out entirely. Let me decide what is and isn't doable for me.

Help from others seems nice until you realize that it's largely based on the idea that you can't do anything for yourself. A common one is literally just scooting around the supermarket to get to another aisle and having someone stop you, mid push, to ask if you need helo. I mean thanks, but with what exactly? I will totally swallow my ego and ask for help when I need it, but this is frustrating when it happens several times during every outing.

Elevator speeches are a necessity when you're disabled. You will end up trapped in an elevator with someone who feels entitled to your whole life story. They will not get that this is intrusive and weird. I usually give them a few lines about having a genetically crappy body, but they always want to know more. Don't burn too much energy here. It also happens all the time.

Even when I don't get this, I get people saying how inspiring I am for just... Existing?

It's basically about making clear that it's just something that someone has instead of something that defines them. It has to do also with the fact that in most situations, you are not an autistic person, you might be someone who loves football, someone who likes to watch tv, someone who is a Knicks fan. Are you then in all situations a football loves, a TV watcher or a Knicks fan? You are only that when it is relevant. By using terminology that puts people first (person with...), you show that their disability is part of their identity, but does not define it. 

Same with the distinction between 'he is a wheelchair user' and 'he is in a wheelchair'. The first shows that it is a tool, the second implies that it's a state of being and implies some dependency. As a wheelchair user that can walk fine, this is inaccurate. 

This is the reasoning that I've heard, now how you deal with this whole identity business is up to you. I personally think you can't really blame people that are associated with the handicapped world to know what the appropriate term is.

cdb105b6-ddc0-4971-bf25-edfde46d978d,1493277082,"&gt;1) What’s your first impression? Does it seem like an interesting concept?

I highly suspect that many people have some ingroup favourism instinct which means that people with disabilities get shamed. The truth is that most forms of discrimination involved the group with the most social power shaming those outgroups with less social power to pressure them into following them.

Now this is an unpopular opinion but I don't think we should sell the idea that society values diversity and hence everyone should be doing that to little kids. Discrimination *definitely* exists in society, and by refusing that discrimination exists in society, you are just implying that the reason that we are struggling is because we haven't worked hard enough. Such comments are dismissive and come-off as rude. Society just talks about ""valuing diversity"" so that the underprivileged feels happier and to dismiss any accusations of discrimination. I feel like way too many people are using tokenism tactics to hide their closeted prejudices.

Another point is that sometimes people don't even know that they have prejudices towards the disabled when they already do. People with invisible disabilities can ""pass"" as disability-free and in some ways we do face more prejudice because of it. When was the last time you glared at someone who looks healthy who parked in that parking lot space for the disabled? That person may have arthritis or some other invisible disability.

&gt;2) Do you think there’s a market for it? There are a bunch of existing books about raising smart kids, raising empathetic kids, raising kids with character. So clearly parents want to be able to raise those types of kids. Do you think they also want to be able to raise kids who understand and are comfortable around kids with special needs? Perhaps more so now than in the past?

Maybe. Maybe not. The truth is most people are already conditioned to think of kids with invisible disabilities as ""odd"", ""wacky"", ""crazy"", ""lazy"", or ""defective"" and many are not that open-minded to changing what society conditioned them to think. The truth is there are numerous social issues out there are there is really no ""need"" for a parent without special need kids to read about how to interact with special need kids. They might be spending their time reading about poverty in developing countries. Or the issue of deforestation. Or politics.

&gt;3) What would you call a child who is disability-aware and not afraid to strike up a friendship with someone who has a disability or special need? A buddy? An ally? An advocate? None of those seem like the perfect word. Any other suggestions?

""Woke"" in the sense that they are aware of the issues disabled people face despite what society conditioned then to think. That's the word they use for POCs who do not experience internalised racism.

Btw check out r/sociology. Sometimes I think that it is better to just get everyone to learn about sociology so that they can understand how many societal norms that we take for granted are actually biased.",,,1,0,0,

There's a [comment](http://dailynous.com/2017/04/03/mcmahan-singer-stubblefield-victim-injustice/#comment-106788) on the Daily Nous post about the McMahan--Singer essay by James Todd, who was one of the expert witnesses in the Stubblefield trial. He claims that their essay is ""incompetent in its failure to contact the realities of the case"" and that several claims they made about the trial are false, for instance their claim that there was no testimony about 'facilitated communication'. Reading his comments, the case looks less tough and more clear-cut. Stubblefield is in the wrong.

My situation is a little different than yours. I have neurogenic bladder and most of the time I deal with retention, but I have spasms that will cause urgency and leaking. 

Increasing how often I cath, sticking to a schedule, doing timed voids helps decrease how often I leak. 

Keeping a ""bladder diary"" might be helpful for you in figuring out if stressing about accidents is increasing how often they happen. You track input, output, and how often you void/cath. You can also not how often accidents occur and how you're feeling at the time. 

In the meantime maybe looking into pads or carrying around a change of clothes might help ease some of the worry about having an accident in public. 

Other option is talking with your urologist to either have or repeat urodynamic testing. You could e having spasm triggering the incontinence, which seems likely since you mention cathing then having more leaks after. If you are having spasms there are medications that help.

11701371-6c4f-401e-9763-7a0168485ed8,1492458243,"This is a problem I have had a lot with support workers and friends, particularly in bars. I've had a whooooole lot of people pat me on the head for heading out and getting drunk. For context I am a paraplegic with motor neurone disease and require full time care.

With friends, I sat them down and asked that any questions directed at them but meant for me...were redirected at me. I didn't say *how* this should be done so they all have their own ways, some tell the person to ask me, some repeat the question to me in a very obvious manner, some make a joke or sarcastic comment about my big mouth etc. If he can think about how he'd like questions redirected that'd be a good start. 

To meet people it's really a case of putting yourself out there, a lot. It really is hard, 21 is a difficult age anyway and disability does affect how people react to you. Encourage him to try some groups he's interested in, college is fantastic for that. Some will do beginners groups for newbies who meet half an hour beforehand with an established member of the group, for those who aren't sure about hopping right in - they might be good for your brother so get him to ask. 

When you attend a group or club, make yourself busy. Be on the phone, fuck about on reddit, just give out some body language that you're not interested. Your brother will then be the one who is making the conversation and the other person has to hold it with him. If you get to the stage of conversation in a group and he's not included, make a concerted effort to bring him into the conversation. 'Remember that time when...' and let him tell the story. Redirect everyone's attention to him. If possible subtly move a group towards a table, it's much easier to hold a conversation at eye level especially in noisy environments. 

Definitely get him to push himself wherever possible, as well as good exercise it absolutely gives off the impression he's more independent. Personally I like to do as much myself as possible, I have my own adapted glass that I take to bars for them to fill, take a crazy straw, have my smartphone and adapted stylus to take numbers, have a bag I can reach easily...anything that means I don't have to ask someone else for help is a big plus for me. 

To make it clear, anyone who flat out ignores someone making conversation is an ass and not worth his time. Just blank 'em. 

For support workers I do it a little differently. Now this may not be appropriate for you as his sister, and everyone has a different relationship with their support worker/carer/nurse/personal aide etc. but I prefer to keep my support worker and my friends separate. I find it helpful to see them as a tool, someone who helps me with daily living tasks much as my wheelchair does. I keep shorter shift rotations (unless requested) and give lots of personal space. At home they have a desk and good internet connection in their bedroom or are welcome to use the living room, and I shout or send a text when I need them.

When we are out they are welcome to sit in the group but are part of the group and not sitting beside me watching over me. They are also welcome to wander off once I'm sat down and settled as long as they're in close proximity if needed. One of my support workers is a student and often brings her work out, we'll sit and get drunk and she uses the time to study close by. 

Initially I found this really, really odd as I'd always been friends with support workers, but in the long run it's done a lot for my mental health to not be good friends with someone who I am employing, especially if they change jobs. I do have one good friend who helps out with toileting when we're out and my partner does as well, they're treated as friends not support workers. All that said though I know many people who have a much more personal relationship with their support worker and prefer that. It's an individual choice.

Once he has a core group of friends everything gets a lot easier, because they introduce him to more people and the new people take cues from existing friends. So many people just don't know how to act around disabilities, they are afraid to offend or frightened of the disability itself. If they have someone else to take a cue from it helps a lot.

To answer your question about why ""person with autism"" might be considered offensive whereas ""person with disability"" is not, I think it's to do with how many autistic people see autism as a part of who they are (i.e. that they are not disabled, they are simply neurodivergent). I think people don't like Autism Speaks because it focuses on a cure and that means that it views individuals as having a disability that needs to be fixed. When you say ""person with autism"" it's like it's making a point that they have a disability whereas saying ""autistic person"" is just a descriptor of their neurodivergence.

If the landlords shut you down from there you could call the disablity rights center in your state, but usually those places take stuff to court. Legal Aid might have some ideas for solutions too. Edit to add that if it's a newer building there may be codes they have to comply with by law for handicapp access and the city building code enforcement often has people who can enforce those codes.

Often, ableism exists because of these reasons: it might not be that they are purposely excluding you, but that they don't consider any accommodations because they are able-bodied. By giving up, you are not going to push others out of their comfort zones or help them wake up to the fact that other types of lifestyles/abilities exist. 

That being said, if you are not up to it, it's totally understandable. It puts us in a very vulnerable position. But I've found that the more self-advocacy I do, the less resistance I experience.

""People with autism"" is considered less ableist because it is people-first language, implying there's more to the person than just their autism. ""Autistic person"" implies that their autism entails their entire identity, when in fact it might just be one part.

I personally prefer ""neuroatypical"" or ""neurodiverse"" as someone with epilepsy, as ""epileptic"" can be used as a pejorative -- ""jeeze are you epileptic or something?

His problematic views on disabilities don't make him a ""monster"", nor do they make utilitarianism a ""terrible philosophy"", as the article claims.

No real need to put it in one specific country. I might eventually decide to have it in a real location to give it a certain feel (I love how Scott Pilgrim *feels* like Toronto) but I'll probably stick with ambiguity.

The problem with shelf heights is mind blowing. Basically unless you get assistance there's a bunch of food/stuff that you'll just never get the option of having. Couple that with aisle width and something someone else said about IKEA and there's yet another thing I don't even think about that's just a shit time.

The not being seen/constantly seeing crotches is also an interesting perspective. Can't say I've ever walked into a wheelchair but it sounds like a shitty time all around. Canted pavements is also another reason why getting around the streets must suck, learning how to use the chair in general seems like a big ask.

Thanks for the advice on Meetup. I've tried there service but I live in a small town and there aren't a lot of groups around me. ",,,3,0,0,

An acquired disability demands a *complete* recreation of identity: before my accident I (my identity) was a surfer, a gymnast, a trampolinist, &amp; a performer. Post-accident I was none of those things, thus I had to rebuild my identity. Many people around me were forced to do the same (redefine their perception of who I am). Some people were (&amp; still are, in some cases) unable to ascribe any identity beyond ""quadriplegic"", or ""used to be a surfer"" etc. Personally, I had to go through that stage too, but after this I became who I am now: a programmer, a ""hacker"" (in the creative sense, not destructive), a creator of solutions to problems, &amp; an advocate for causes in which I believe. It has taken almost 20 years, &amp; I'm still growing &amp; learning!

Lots of food for thought :)",,,4,0,0,

One of the difficulties of disability is dealing with the question you're asking - except from the perspective of the subject. It can be *really* hard to figure out what identity you want to project, &amp; it can change from day to day. Something may be offensive when said/done by some person in some context, but benign when said/done by someone else in a different setting.

Sometimes we have to fight *hard* to make sure people know we are to be treated equally; ""don't assume I can't do things able bodied people can do"".

Then sometimes we need people to understand that we can't do some things able bodied people can do. It can be a very difficult thing to balance. Finding the right identity &amp; learning how to project that is just one (often overlooked) aspect of learning to live with an acquired disability.

Yeah, along those lines :)

Personally I'm fine about asking for help, &amp; I generally assume good intentions when people offer; for me it more arises in circumstances of my actions: (for example) I want my mother to know I intended to bring her flowers, but I want her to understand that getting in the car, out at the florist, handling cash &amp; flowers, back in the car, &amp; out at her house is an *enormous* expense of (limited supply) energy &amp; time, &amp; involves coordinating 2 or 3 people to help. In that sense, it's a case of ""please be mindful of my limitations"".

Then on the other hand: if I go for a job interview &amp; it is inferred that I might not be able to be as productive due to my disability, then I'd be vocally adamant of my equality. (in the background: yes it takes more time &amp; effort, but for their metrics they will not bear that cost).

It is a dichotomy, &amp; every individual finds their own balance. That's why it's hard to give a definitive rubric by which to write such a character. By asking the questions &amp; contemplating the answers, though, I'm sure you'll gain some useful insight :)",,,7,0,0,

I made a PayPal (again) this year and have sold some of my items for around $500. I found online somewhere, can't remember where but if you sell your items you have to have the money spent in a month. 

If you got donations(all profit) and job earnings (profit, working/job) you're supposed to report it as that's considered income and it's required to report. However, if you don't have SSI currently, then I wouldn't even worry about it. $350 isn't a huge amount and you're not even on SSI yet. I sold all my stuff before getting approved on eBay, didn't think anything of it, and never got questioned about it. If I were to get questioned, I sold my stuff for a loss. 

In the future, when you have/are on SSI, I would definitely report donations and job earnings as that's required(it's considered income)

In Texas they will ""check you out"" even if your conditions are Chronic. Also they will not help you if you ""earn too much money"" for medicine, despite the fact that your costs medicine puts you below the cost of living.

In my case I earn $400 to $1000 above the required amount for the Social Security Extra help program. Between that and taxes it puts me below the costs  of living where I live. However I ""earn too much money"" for any other state or federal assistance as well. They literally want you bankrupt before getting any assistance from them. I also literally may have to work a little less to make ends meet.

What caused this change when I got help before? I got a little more money from my mothers disability as I was considered disabled as a child. Because of that my base check is meager. With hers it should have evened it out. Nope... now I have to pay more money than I get from her disability.

I'm not familiar with all of them, but you can look at the regulations [here](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm) to try to get an idea.

Some states have their own laws and codes that are in addition to those provided by Title III of the ADA. You may want to contact the agency in your state that has oversight over these things, to check on the specifics. You can search, ""*your state*, ADA, oversight"" to find the proper office in your state. It usually falls under the Department of Human Services, so if you can't find it by searching the above terms, find the site for your state Dept of Human Services. They should be able to help you figure out what the requirements are.

Even if your landlord is not required to make modifications, you can still go to them and ask them if they will. Having the law behind you could be helpful, but you still want to be non-contentious about it initially, and give them a reasonable opportunity to fix it. If it turns into a problem, there are lawyers who will take on these cases, if your landlord is not complying with the law.

If she needs to return to a rehab facility again once they discharge her from the hospital, she doesn't have to go back to the one she was at previously if you don't want her to. If you are able, you can also go visit them to check them out while she's in the hospital.

I don't know if she qualifies medically, but if you can, get her into an ""acute care"" rehab instead of a ""sub-acute care"" one. Acute care centers are usually attached to hospitals and provide a higher standard of care. There's a website from Medicare where you can go to [compare](https://www.medicare.gov/inpatientrehabilitationfacilitycompare/). Look for one that specializes in hip and femur fractures. 

Sub-acute rehabs are usually attached to nursing homes and are hit or miss. You can compare them on Medicare's [Nursing Home Compare site](https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html?) She may only medically qualify for sub-acute, but you can talk to her doctor and the social worker at the hospital and see if they can get her approved for acute care. She may qualify based on the *combination* of her needs, especially since she developed a bed sore. If she does get approved for acute care, they will likely step her down to sub-acute if she needs more help before she can go home. So, it might be worth checking out both kinds.

A lot of times, where she goes depends on who has a bed available, so if you can coordinate ahead with the hospital social worker, you may be able to at least have some input. I wouldn't wait until they're ready to discharge her from the hospital. They may not keep her very long, so it's better to get ahead of it if you can.

A lot of times you can ask the doctor which one they would send their family member to. They usually have an opinion on which places are better.

They can always extend physical therapy, if they write the orders to justify her need for it to her insurance. Is she old enough to have Medicare? If so, she should have 100 days of rehab care available if she needs them and they are ""medically necessary."" Once she goes home, the amount of physical therapy and at home nursing available is usually nothing compared to what you get in a rehab, unless you want to hire someone privately. That can get pricey really quickly.

You usually set goals with your physical therapist, so make sure they know all of the barriers she has to deal with when she gets home- stairs, bathing, toileting, ambulating, transferring, etc. Depending on her insurance, they can usually extend her time in rehab if she won't be able to make due at home with the level of help available.

b1a1fab7-e002-426f-84c3-45a697ee02ea,1491793439,"I’m sorry you’re going through this! I identified with a lot of what you said. I have Lyme disease and/or chronic fatigue syndrome, depending who you ask. It started when I was 28, I’m 34 now. I definitely feel like a little old lady sometimes! My condition fluctuates, so some times are better than others, but when I look at the broad pattern over the past several years, I have been deteriorating gradually. I also struggle to feed myself (grocery shopping and cooking, not literally getting food to my mouth), and I don't leave the house very much. I've been living with family for a couple years. I would have a lot of difficulty if I was living on my own.

So, I'm in a similar boat as you, but I have a lot more help, and a different diagnosis.

I feel like you’re having two separate problems that you’re addressing here: the physical limitations, and the mental impact of those limitations. I’ll talk about the mental first. 

Some of the issues you’re talking about seem to me like they’re upsetting to you because of your perspective. You seem like you’re beating yourself up about not having an “excuse” for being sick. You also seem concerned with what other people think about your condition.

I have a diagnosis that a fair percentage of people (and doctors) consider BS. I don't really let it bother me. People who really know me remember that I used to be an ambitious young woman, so it doesn't make sense to them that I would be faking. People (especially doctors) who don't believe me get kicked to the curb pretty quick.

When you talk about explaining to people who aren't close to you, this is kind of a boundaries thing. You don't need to explain. You can tell them the relevant information (""Sorry, I'm not able to do X today"") without *making them understand*. Healthy people who don't have a person with a disability in their life probably can't understand. It's just unfathomable to them to live the way that you and I live, that that's even possible for someone who's under 80 years old. It's not your job to convince them. So just give them the information they need. If they're rude about it, you can abruptly end that conversation. I follow a chronic illness YouTuber who talks about this a bit [here](http://www.chronicbabe.com/how-to-say-no-when-someone-keeps-buggin-you-with-questions-about-chronic-illness-awapwednesday/). 

But I'm wondering if for you, this is more about what people might think of you, what they might say to you, than what they're actually doing or saying. I could see cognitive behavioral therapy being useful for those kinds of things if that’s available to you.

So, on to the physical…

It *is* upsetting to not have a diagnosis. You could try pursuing a chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosis. I’ll say this – Lyme disease is easy to get in some parts of the US, and difficult to test for. If you’ve tested negative for it, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re negative. However, treatment options for both CFS and Lyme are very limited. (For Lyme, there are expensive doctors who say they can help you, but I’m not sure how many people are actually helped. I did treatment for three years and ran out of money.) So, if you have either Lyme or CFS, having the diagnosis probably won’t change the outcome. *Except* in justifying it to other people, maybe, kinda. Not everybody buys into those diagnoses.

Moreover, it *is* upsetting to be worried about whether you can take care of yourself. It may get to the point where you aren’t able to live independently any more. At that point your options will be living with family or moving into some kind of assisted living facility. I’m not well-versed in this area because I had family to take me in, but [this site](https://longtermcare.acl.gov/) might be helpful. You may also be able to get in-home health care or assistance so you can stay in your own home. Your regular doctor should know more about that.

Coming to terms with these changes is not easy. Accepting that you may physically degenerate like someone 50 years older than you is really hard. I don’t have a roadmap of what’s going to happen to me; I don’t know if I’ll be at this same level in ten years or if I’ll be bedridden. I don’t mean to make it sound like it’s easy. Every new limitation is another process of acceptance.

The family I’m living with now is my parents, and they’re getting older, so I definitely worry about the future. I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen, I just can’t plan my life that far ahead. I moved in with my parents two months ago, and I have no idea how long I’ll be here. The only way I could live on my own is if I’m paying people to take care of the things that I can’t. I’ve started working from home, as much as I’m able, in the hopes that I can be live independently eventually. That’s what’s working for me, right now. I can’t tell you what will work for you, but it might help to talk it through with someone who can do some problem-solving, and someone who knows what resources might be available to you. Try and think if you have a doctor or therapist or social worker who could hear your concerns and point you in the right direction of resources. Even though the mental stuff is important, you might want to set aside time to just talk about the physical concerns: being able to get food, being able to leave the house, etc, whatever you are having difficulty doing for yourself. If you get the physical concerns addressed, it’ll ease your mind somewhat. You can even talk to them about trying to get a real diagnosis, if you can be persuasive enough that it’s not psychiatric; some doctors are willing to be open-minded, but some aren’t. It’s hit or miss, and difficult to predict.

I really wish you the best of luck. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me.",,,1,0,0,

Both of my parents are retired now. My lawyer was just really dismissive of it, I think because the history was a decade old and there was a large treatment gap. I suspect it was just going to be more work for him and the SSI case was solid once I had a lawyer so he took the easy option.

I have no idea what this person's situation is, but for a lot of people on disability (I'm going to assume that you know this but you asked a seemingly interesting question so I am going to answer anyway), the jobs that they are able to get are not high paying due to spotty work histories. There is not a lot of confidence that a person can maintain a consistently higher number of hours, and OP here is suggesting that his/her boss is occasionally offering hours but it doesn't sound like it is a permanent hours increase that OP could count on. So essentially, OP would be risking an awful lot in terms of jeopardizing the use of a trial work month which he/she may actually want to use towards attempting a higher paying more stable position in the future, just to pick up a couple of sketchy hours now. 

With the way social security is set up, it's terrifying to work. It's very much a situation where if you don't feel well enough to be completely able to work full time and fully support yourself and cover the cost of your healthcare and the cost of your disability and those costs, then risking losing benefits by working some part time low paying job is a terrifying prospect. This situation is compounded by the fact that a person on disability has often been out of the workforce for a while and probably (as I said) has a spotty previous employment history, if any. This does not make employers rush to hire you for jobs with competitive wages. Going from not working to working 40 hours a week is sketchy for most people and even with ""ticket to work"" programs that are poorly explained etc, many people are terrified. 

The fear is real. People need the health benefits to care for their disability. They know that there is no other way that is going to happen. The current healthcare system costs are beyond expensive and the copays and deductibles are unreal for people with true disabilities that require frequent medical attention. You add that to the fear that someone who is doing a little better now could relapse medically and then have to back through the horrific SSA system to regain benefits after attempting full time gainful employment and many people just give up. 

I personally do not see a path to employment for myself in the near or even few-years-out future as my condition seems to be deteriorating. I have seen this employment dilemma in other people though and I think that it is partially legitimate. I mean, I cannot really go into the Social Security office without fighting down panic. It was such a traumatic process to get approved to begin with, it's terrifying to even pop my head up in case someone notices me. Rationally I realize that the kind people at the SSA are not evil and you all are very kind when I have to come in. It doesn't change the level of terror while I am waiting for my number to be called though. 

I guess what I am saying is that all of the info about working etc is somewhat confusing and anything regarding benefits is terrifying to those of us who need them to survive. For many of us our lives literally depend on them so it's a life or death thing.

The amount I would receive under SSDI (which would be based on my parents income at the time that I was disabled as a child I think and their work credits) vs SSI is pretty dramatic.

7e68e93f-4294-4c4f-80ee-c7fb2f4e0a9a,1491192114,"So for some reason I can't remember exactly how long ago I was granted SSI, but I was 34ish. Possibly 33. So, yes. HUGE gap between that and 22. I spent my 20's literally just living off of student loans and help from my parents. I just kind of took classes (mostly less than full time status) and withdrew from semesters here and there. I started several graduate programs but I withdrew from all of them in the first semester. I worked odd jobs pretty sporadically (nothing lasting more than six months and only one full time job for 2 and 1/2 months) during the early part of my 20's but by 26, I was down to maybe an 8 hour a week thing that lasted for 3 months every other year until I was 28 and totally just gave up. 

I should be able (I'm assuming since they are medical records and I currently live in the same city as this health system is based in) to get a hold of my records from starting therapy at 14, to diagnosis and hospitalization at 16, to psychiatric treatment until 18 and partial hospitalization at 18. I also attended therapy until 18 and again for a period before 21. I would also be able to provide my high school transcripts which would sort of demonstrate that things were not going well (and that I left after my sophomore year) and my community college transcripts that show that I took one or two classes a semester until I was 21. I also attempted to go to a university at 18 and was forced to withdraw from there as well and there might be some kind of record of that, although since I withdrew without ever earning credit, I'm not entirely sure. I'm sure a bill exists somewhere for the housing that my mom had to pay or something. She is great at keeping fun memories like that around. 

My real concern is that I didn't seek help from a medical provider for this issue again until I was 28. It's very common with bipolar disorder though for that lag to exist and it certainly was the case with me. I did seek out help from the counseling center on campus in the intervening period though and I participated in group therapy and individual therapy at different times in that gap period. It's just that by 28, everything had sufficiently fallen apart to convince me that I really needed the intervention of a doctor. 

It's sort of the problem with psychiatric disabilities. You don't have the insight to know you are sick until everything has fallen apart around you in shambles and you can't ignore it. Bipolar disorder in particular because you can be a hot mess and manic and feel like the Queen of England. Heck, you can even think you are the Queen of England. It doesn't really lend itself well to seeking help or knowing there is an issue the way that a physical disability does. You know if you can't walk or can't see. It's a little dodgier if you don't know you can't think rationally.

So I can tell you all of that, but I don't know that it makes a difference to the SSA. I'm assuming I need a lawyer here to navigate this if it has any chance. I don't see a path to me working at a earning level where I can pay for my own housing and medical care given the treatment options available to me currently.

With SSI, my future is ugly. It might have to stay that way, but I was legitimately disabled by 16. The issue is convincing the SSA and if that is even possible. 

I appreciate your answer here and you taking the time to read my post. This might be kind of disorganized and I apologize. My brain is a bit scattered lately so I have to kind of pull things together. 

I will call an attorney tomorrow and see what kind of feedback I get. I suspect if I have to go this alone, it's going to be a frustrating and fruitless endeavor.

I did go to the SSA office here and the person I talked to was lovely and encouraging. 

I do have the ability to track down my educational records and since my guidance counselor came to the hospital to participate in some of the meetings while I was there, I suspect there would be some mention of my hospitalization in there. Obviously that is not as compelling as the records themselves if I cannot get them. 

I think it shouldn't be all that difficult to prove continuation of disability. I mean, when I was 26 I went on a manic binge for a few months that resulted in a 2 and 1/2 month $30k spending spree and a subsequent bankruptcy filing (that finally drops off next year and is probably the reason I have a payee). My college transcripts manage to show good grades in the classes I completed, but they are full of dropped classes and withdrawn semesters.

The medical record thing could be tricky though so thanks for the heads up.

I am even aware of *some of that employment information myself because I did have a small period where treatment seemed like it might provide some benefit but it ultimately did not for me. 

I will tell you that I have a college degree and am fairly intelligent and persistent and it was difficult for me to determine what the actual information is regarding employment and social security. 

What I gave you was the feeling that most people I know have about the situation. The information is not easily accessible and there is a TON of misinformation out there. People will tell you, ""if you get a job of any kind, SSA will think you can support yourself working and end any benefits."" Since, as I stated, SS benefits are a literal lifeline to many people, people are not willing to risk it. People are not going to come into the office or call and ask those questions either because they don't want their case flagged or something because they asked questions about employment. There is a lot of mistrust and fear largely due to the lack of transparency and information. 

If people understood the seeming lottery system for why some people are approved in three months and why others have to fight for 3+ years, perhaps this would be less terrifying. If the appeal hearing backlog wasn't 3 years. I mean, just things like that. It seems very arbitrary to people so that creates a large element of fear. 

To you, someone on the inside, you see all of the rules and policies. To someone who has to deal with your office, we see the way it impacts our life. It feels random. It feels random when someone I know with a disability that has been documented medically for maybe just over a year (and is definitely a disability) gets approved immediately, while my disability which was documented with notes from a specialist in almost 20 visits a year in at least a three year span, got denied and scheduled 3 years out for an appeal.

7e68e93f-4294-4c4f-80ee-c7fb2f4e0a9a,1492277872,"I am guessing they mean the Chinese government the way that you worded that. China is still a fairly restrictive state in a lot of ways and quasi communist so the appearance of equality of people is very important. In order to give someone special privileges in a line, I have to assume that a business (in this case Disney), would require some kind of authorization from the Chinese government to allow that. Especially given that the disability in question is an ""invisible"" one (I.e., not requiring a wheelchair). 

The problem you may run into with this is that China has particularly uncomfortable views on mental illness. Psychiatric hospitals are still used as places of punishment for political dissidents. Having a psychiatric diagnosis makes you somewhat suspect due to that and just a long standing harsh stigma in general in that society. 

Personally, I am not sure I would be comfortable alerting the government officially that I was coming into the country with a diagnosed mental illness. While they will obviously see the prescriptions upon entry, that is when you are already there. Assuming you are a US citizen and have applied for the VISAs required etc, asking for something like this could cause them to pull the VISAs theoretically. 

Mental illness is not exactly loved or accepted all over the world. Do your own research on this, but I have looked into the current situation in china surrounding mental illness and while it isn't overtly hostile, it is also not welcoming or understanding. 

As an example of this, I have a friend from China who is willing to treat his depression by taking a pill, but will tell no one, and absolutely refuses to see a therapist. He has lived here for 20 years and he still is dead set against therapy. Taking a pill is kind of okay because then it is ""just a medical issue."" Turning it into anything more than that is terrifying to him. It was his reaction to all of that that caused me to look into the current climate in China. 

Like I said, explore further. The US state department might have some solid information or advice on this subject actually and could be a good resource. It may or may not be an issue. I would find out before you announce anything officially to the Chinese government though. 

Edit: So [this article ](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21715701-sufferers-are-routinely-treated-danger-society-china-wakes-up-its-mental-health) from The Economist back in January of this year describes the current situation for people suffering with mental illness in China. It talks about how the government is still rounding people they know to be mentally ill up before important events because they are seen as potentially dangerous. It describes people being subjected to involuntary ECT treatment for postpartum depression in unpleasant and downright terrifying sounding facilities. As I said, I would speak to the State Department here before you talk to China. ",,,1,0,0,
7e68e93f-4294-4c4f-80ee-c7fb2f4e0a9a,1491249672,"Yeah. I talked to the school district I went to for 3 semesters. The whole area is on spring break but the admin building said that those records are housed at the high school and that they should include not only my transcript but any other information that was in my file. So crossed fingers that the guidance counselor who was so involved back then also took good notes. There is another school I attended for one semester and was also heavily involved with the guidance counselor at, but it is a private high school and they are also in spring break and don't have a central administration obviously to talk to per se. They are part of the Catholic system here but I'm assuming they deal with their own records so I will call them next Monday when school is back in session.

So really, the only records that are iffy are the outpatient therapy/psychiatry/partial program ones from the one clinic. I put a call into them but I don't have the best hope there since that clinic has moved  (once) in the intervening two decades. They may have warehouses them. I will find out soon enough. 

I was even able to get a transcript from the university I attended for half a semester when I was 18 and withdrew from. I am fairly certain that is not possible with the 4 or 5 graduate programs I started in my late 20's since I dropped all of those before a ""W"" was even entered so no transcript exists.

Other than that, I'm assuming SSA has access to my employment history and I have all of my transcripts from the community college and later, the university I eventually graduated from after 8 years. I will be able to get the high school ones and if I remember correctly those are ridiculous. I think my sophomore year it shows me being absent more than 70+ days out of 180 or something. And that I didn't return to finish junior or senior year. 

I sort of fully expect this to be denied on round one, but I might have a chance with an appeal I guess. We'll see. The lady at the SSA office was very kind today and set an appointment for me and my mom near the end of the month. ",,,1,0,0,

The diagnosis was made during the hospital stay but the continuation of care, therapy, and subsequent partial program a couple years later was at that outpatient clinic.

At least the hospitalization record exists. This seems like a better than 0% thing so I will pursue it. I'm not overly hopeful but any chance at having a future that is not horrible is worth looking into.

It does seem difficult to access the full picture about some of these services or programs or that conflicting information exists on different government websites. It is sometimes a challenge to sort all of it out.

Regardless of validity, it is stressful to have to go to SSA. It feels like grabbing the dragon's tail. I always find out that the person I end up meeting is very nice and helpful, but it never feels like it is going to be beforehand.

**Trains And The Underground**

If you're in a wheelchair, forget it. Too many hassles, too dependent on railway staff to help you on and off trains, and staff don't always turn up to help. Most platforms are not accessible and lifts are often out of action.
Probably OK to use trains if you're travelling between major cities, but forget travelling to towns or villages.


**Buses**

Bit of a mixed bag. I've been left at a stop by buses that don't even slow down, in broad daylight. Other times there are great drivers who'll physically clear the wheelchair space of buggies, babies and mothers so that I can get in the space.
In the UK, the law is ambivalent about wheelchair spaces. Yes, we **should** have priority, but nobody can be forced to give up the space for a wheelchair user. I've been refused space on a bus as ""we're full up"", which meant there were 2 buggies on board, not that there was already a wheelchair on board. It wouldn't have taken much to fit me on the bus. 


**Trams**

The best of the bunch. Easy to get on and off - mostly - and the space is usually given up readily when I get on. However, there was one time I got on and someone had left an empty buggy in the space. It turned out that they'd left the buggy and gone down the other end of the tram and the conductor couldn't be bothered to go and find them. I had to move the buggy myself, a dangerous proposition.



**Tips**

* If you have to be somewhere at a particular time, go early.

* If you're flexible about timing, avoid the morning rush, when schools get out in the afternoon, whenever the local kindergartens start and finish, and whenever there's a local busy period. On the bus route outside my house, there's always a quiet period between 10:00 and 11:00, and then there's 3 buses in 10 minutes soon after 11:00. Every. Single. Day.

* Check the timetables to see if evening or weekend journeys are feasible. In my area, the buses start running every 30 minutes after 18:00 Mon to Sat and all day Sunday, so I can have a long journey time in the evenings and on Sundays.

* Use Google Street View to check the journey, start to finish, looking out for where the bus stops are, is there a shelter to protect from bad weather, and is there a seat to sit when waiting for a bus. Sometimes it's better to go to the next stop if there's a shelter and seat.

* Download a Bus Time app if you can use one. I use 2; First Bus and UK Bus Checker. They work on a mix of actual times and timetable times and often can tell you exactly when the next bus is due at your stop. It means you don't need to have all the timetables with you when you leave the house.

* Expect it to be a struggle - either a bus doesn't turn up, or it's crowded, or noisy, or you get a grumpy driver, or it doesn't stop when you ask, or the other passengers have a go at you.

* Always say thank you to the nice people and feel free to express your disgust at the rest in the usual manner - a quiet tut.

* Obvious disabilities get better treatment than non-visible ones. That's just the way things are.

* Speak up for yourself, or for others in your party. Know your rights and make sure you get them. I've reported bad behaviour from drivers to their customer service departments in the past.

* Plan, plan and plan again. Work out as many options as possible, different bus times, different routes, different modes of transport. And be flexible on the day, unless you have to be at X by time Y.",,,2,0,0,

However, that doesn't mean that I won't report them for their actions. So, yes, I would say not to cause a scene or ague with a bus driver.

But, if a driver isn't up to scratch, then take a note of the bus, the number plate (if possible), and the time, date and location of the problem and report the incident to customer services. I've found that bus companies can track the driver down if they know enough about the bus, and then the bus company can deal with the driver's behaviour internally. I **always** make it clear that I use a wheelchair so the customer service people know that there's a possible disability discrimination case in the offing.

* Being told by a nurse to cut down on the sugar in my tea when my medication was giving me a voracious appetite, there was the lack of exercise due to me being housebound, and I was feeling suicidal due to ongoing health conditions giving me an almost zero quality of life. Sugar. In tea. Really?

* Being shouted at by a GP, telling me that IBS doesn't exist and is made up by teenage girls looking for attention - I'm over 50 and male. (I don't have IBS.)

What I'd like is a conversation. A two way conversation. But I want the medic to already be familiar with my notes BEFORE I enter the room. Then, you could start with, ""How are you feeling today?"", and LISTEN to the answer. Try, ""Is there anything in particular that's bothering you today?"" Take a holistic approach to health as an introduction to the consultation. Get an overview of how things are with me at that point in time. And then you can go into, ""And how is X/Y/Z at the moment?"" And follow up with, ""Can I ask you about the process of getting the diagnosis for X/Y/Z"".

I don't mind if a consultation gets personal. Talk honestly with me about diet, pooping habits, exercise, sex, relationships, mental health, bad habits, anything (as long as it's relevant), but let's have a holistic/general discussion first, just to ease into things.

As a person with multiple medical conditions - at least 18 - I'm not a simple case, and many of the conditions and medications interact with each other. And I also happen to have a Ph.D. in applied mathematics and I can do things with Google that most people know nothing about, and I was married to a GP for over 20 years, so there's a good chance I really do know more about my health than the ""professional"" in front of me.  Sadly, in the UK, medical records are disjointed and there's often not a general personal history attached, so the medic focusses on their particular interest, and misses the wider picture. 

If they were to ask me how I'm feeling physically and mentally, and how things have been over the previous X weeks, they'd get an idea of what's wrong with me, what's causing me grief, and what my current mood is like.

Here's an example of missing the broader picture. I have diabetes, and I also have bile acid diarrhoea (BAD). The diet advice for diabetics is to eat lots of fruit and vegetables. BUT, the BAD means that I'm unable to digest fruit and vegetables, and eating some vegetables often has disastrous effects. But EVERY dietician, diabetes nurse and consultant have harped on about eating fruit and vegetables. JUST LISTEN. Seek first to understand.

Try these:

* How have you been this month?

* What's troubling you today?

* How are you getting on with X/Y/Z?

* How does X/Y/X affect your daily life?

* I'm thinking about changing X/Y/Z. How would you feel about that?

* Let me explain my thinking about X/Y/Z

* I wanted to ask you about A/B/C. Is that OK?

* Are there ways you could cut down on alcohol/smoking/drugs?

* Are there ways you could increase D/E/F?

Often the medics want me to change something; medications, diet, exercise, smoking (which I've never done), alcohol intake (where mine is 0 units) I'm OK having a discussion as long as it feels two-way and not that they've already decided the outcome and they're just leading me to agree with them, which happens too often.

From my perspective, once we've had the general discussion and established a rapport, you can just dive right in with the personal questions and phrase them in an honest, empathic manner - as blunt as you like, but honest.

On a generic level, there are many YouTube videos that document people's experiences of public transport. BuzzFeed have done a few articles as well.

Specific to my area, the local transport authority have created ""Safe and Better Journey Cards"" - http://www.travelsouthyorkshire.com/TransportAccessibility/

Personally, since I use a wheelchair, it's fairly obvious that I need special care, but other issues with travelling are less obvious. One of the advantages of the cards is that nobody needs to say anything, so the other passengers won't know about your needs.

.

Having Aspergers, one of the issues I constantly struggle with is how to fit in. When I'm out and about I don't want people to stare at me, or single me out. I just want to fit in. (Difficult when in a wheelchair, but I don't want to stand out any more than I have to.)

However, I've also found that trying to be something I'm not was slowly killing me. Being true to who your are, being proud of who you are, refusing to bow down to societal pressure, are all things that make me stronger.

Part of the value you can bring to a young person's life is encouraging them to find the balance between fitting in and being themselves; when to hide their fabulousness, when to follow the rules, and when to do their own thing.

For example, getting on a bus is a time to fit in and follow the rules. It's just not worth the hassle of trying to be different. But, going down a wide street, or in a mall, that's when you've got the space to be more yourself. Making some noise or waving your arms around, or taking up a lot of space, are all OK things in a large public space. Nobody really minds. But take up two spaces on a bus when one will do, that's not on.

But working out all these rules can be difficult for some of us. Some guidance and encouragement to be yourself, to find the balance, would help enormously. Knowing that you can ignore what someone says about you in public because that person isn't following the rules is re-assuring when you don't understand the rules yourself. Clearly explaining what's accepted and what isn't, even if there's no logic behind the situation, is a big help.

Also, teaching someone that they will make mistakes, and that's OK, it happens to everyone, and that next time can be better. That's a difficult lesson to learn on your own.",,,2,0,0,

In the UK, the only reason that there's a large space on the bus where you can put an unfolded buggy/stroller is because it's the law to have a wheelchair space. Sadly, the law hasn't been strengthened to mean that a wheelchair always takes priority, but that's another matter.
Most times people will move their buggy to let me use the space but the worst times are when I'm already in the space and a woman with a buggy wants to get on the bus. (And it's always been a woman so far.) It's not micro-aggression, it's full-on volcanic anger.

I don't think most people understand the importance of a travel pass. If you can't afford a car, or are not able to drive, then you either rely on friends and family to get about, or you use public transport. Being at  the behest of family to go anywhere quickly becomes a drag on everyone. With a Travel Pass you suddenly have a lot more control over your movement. I know, personally, that the Travel Pass has made a huge difference to my life, but I have mobility issues and it's easy to understand how a travel pass helps someone in a wheelchair.

I have a cousin with mental development issues - one of life's gentle giants - and once he reached about 15 he was able to take buses and travel independently. His life suddenly bloomed. Whilst he was too trusting, and doesn't understand everything that's going on around him, he could get on a bus and follow a route and get where he wanted to go. It usually needed someone to go with him a few times and then he was OK. My how his life developed. He travelled all over the county visiting people, and going to day care centres, and going shopping and visiting his girlfriend. That control and independence changed his life.

I know you'll understand this, and I'm sort of writing this for anybody else that comes along, but giving someone a measure of independence, of control over their lives, it's a great gift. Thank you on behalf of those you've helped.",,,3,0,0,
00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1492683254,"I used to live on the outskirts of a village in Norfolk and there wasn't even a pavement until you got right into the heart of the village. There were two buses per day and you could just stand on the road and flag a bus down - official bus stops were rationed to one per village and were often too far away for most people to get to.

Then there's the issue of street lighting, or the complete lack thereof. Where I lived there was a strong movement to NOT have street lighting from long-standing residents, but incomers always wanted lights. Most of the villages near where I lived had no lighting.

So how does someone with disabilities get out and about? You need access to a car, or live near a train station, or live in larger towns or Norwich. And if you can get out and about in your village, you mostly go out during daylight hours, in case you get hit by a car or a tractor in the dark.

Where there's a will, there's a way, but I'd say that there are far fewer options in rural Norfolk than there is in London. For example, if there's no room on a bus where I live then I can wait for the next one and it's usually 15 minutes or less extra wait time. In Norfolk, if you can't get on THAT bus - or you're too late to catch the bus - then the next bus might not be for another 4 to 6 HOURS. You're getting on that damned bus come Hell or high water.

Taxis are always an option, but in Norfolk there are few black cabs around, just normal cars. So finding a taxi that can take a wheelchair can be difficult or impossible. Even those with restricted mobility can have difficulty getting in and out of a normal car. So you might have to hunt around the taxi companies to find somebody that can ferry you around. And once you find a taxi company that works for you, work hard at creating good relations with them so that they get to know you, know what your needs are and then you know you're going to get a taxi that will arrive on time and be suitable to your needs.",,,2,0,0,
00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1492127495,"Some tips I wish I'd known at the start:

* 1) Wear Fingerless Gloves. I've found that, with the state of the pavements in my city, gloves are essential when it comes to avoiding getting ""stuff"" on your hands; broken glass, vomit, dog poo, spilled food and drink, and worse. Also, because nothing is flat, gloves are essential for braking on slopes and when trying to really, really push uphill. I find the fingerless ones but with a full thumb work best. You need fingerless to have some dexterity with some of your fingers (and also to work touch screens) but the thumb is the digit that comes into contact with the rims and wheels most often and needs to be fully covered. My favourite one so far are black leather fingerless. Not a bad look in a GN.

* 2) You Can't Do Everything To Begin With. The chances are most people who have to move to using a wheelchair won't have the arm and hand strength to be able to push for long, or up steep hills, or cope with going downhill. It's very easy to overdo it, strain a muscle and then you're stuck indoors until your muscles are ready to go again.

* 3) Every Slope Is 10 Times Steeper Than It Looks. Slopes I wouldn't even have noticed before suddenly become mountains in a wheelchair. I live at the top of a hill - stupid place for a wheelchair user to live, I know - and in my early days I tried going down the hill to catch a tram. Half way down the chair started to skid as the slope was too steep and I ended up crashing into a car. The car was fine. I was a bit shaken, and one of my wheel got dented. Lesson learned.

* 4) Change Your Wardrobe. Clothes you used to wear will no longer work in a seated position. I now buy trousers with longer legs so that the legs part goes all the way down to my boots. ""Proper"" length trousers are too short now. And pockets. Rear pockets on trousers are now useless, as are the hip pockets up near the waist. Cargo pants with pockets on the front of the leg, not the side, work well, but the should seal with a zip and not velcro or poppers. Then there's tops. Most tops are too long in the body now and just crumple around my waist. And getting anything on or off when in a chair is a nightmare - try sitting in a chair and put on a jacket without getting the chair inside the jacket. And don't wear anything with baggy sleeves as they'll catch or rub on the rims/wheels and get dirty and/or full of friction holes. Tight clothing is the way to go - great silhouette, unless you're 50+ and fat and bald, but I ROCK that look. 

* 5) Get An Active Chair. If your hero is going to be using a manual chair, then it needs to be an active chair - light, fitted to their body, possibly/probably a low back, no arm rests. You'll see more of the person and less of the chair, but it's also the best for more active users. Also, active chairs have lots of options for colour schemes, not just plain metal and grey. Look at TiLite for ideas for good chairs.

* 6) Get Help Popping Wheelies. You'll need to pop wheelies often - usually when getting on and off pavements. The first few times are scary and, without help, you'll end up falling over backwards with your legs in the air. Nice image, but thumping headache.

* 7) Get A Comfy Cushion. You'll be in that chair for hours. Get a really, really comfortable cushion. However, this might not look great in a novel, so a thinner gel cushion will do.

* 8) Get A Bag. If you're being realistic, you'll need a bag for stuff; spare clothes, to put shopping in, all the stuff in a hand bag. The danger with hanging a bag off the back of a chair is that you can't tell when someone might be rummaging behind your back, so I carry the important stuff in my leg pockets, or I have a small shoulder bag for when pockets aren't available. It's for keys, phone, money, cards, etc.

* 9) Train, Train And Train. There's a lot to learn, so you'll be training for months, building strength and stamina. Endurance to be able to wheel several miles in a day, strength for getting up hills, hand strength for braking, dexterity for getting around, quick reflexes for avoiding people who don't look where they're going. There's a good Rocky-style montage in just getting fit enough to last full day in a chair.

* 10) It Gets Better. It starts off really tough, and everything is new, and difficult, and hard, and heart breaking, and annoying, and beyond you. But, it does get better. You can put a new life together, so keep going. There will be light at the end of that tunnel.",,,2,0,0,

The work has to be set somewhere, and there'll be a government, and a system of health care. And how big a part of the novel should the interactions about benefits, insurance payouts or the like be? If it's to be real the chances are it's a very depressing part of everyone's life.

Take me. I can still walk, a little, so I don't qualify for any NHS help getting a chair. I had to go private to get my chairs. Since I'm not able to work at the moment, I couldn't afford a chair without help. One part of the government said I was too ill to work and I got some benefits, but another part said I was fine and I was denied the benefits that would help me get a chair. In the end I had to take the government to court, and I won, and I have my chair now. That's a gritty tale to tell. If you get a chance, watch a film called ""I, Daniel Blake"". That's my life writ large. Truly. I went through exactly the same things as Daniel Blake does in that film, with one obvious exception towards the end.
Going through the money part of government and/or health schemes is painfully difficult. However, I find that those focussed on getting you better are usually great people.

I often wear cargo pants and use the big pockets to carry stuff I need, and that I don't want easily stolen. However, the pockets don't always close securely, so I eventually got a shoulder bag.

Here's why:

* A shoulder bag is harder to steal than a bag hanging off the back of my chair.

* A shoulder bag that sits at my side or in front of me is harder for someone to steal the contents.

* A small shoulder bag can hold my phone, wallet, money, cards, keys and travel pass easily.

* A shoulder bag with lots of pockets can separate all my stuff so I can find what I need quickly.

* A shoulder bag lets me get my travel pass out quickly, scan it and put the pass back again quickly.

* With an adjustable strap I can  get the bag to hang where I want and stay in place.

.

There's a big range of shoulder bags available that look good for both men and women - so boys don't have to have a pink Peppa Pig bag around their necks. They don't cost too much. I bought mine at a local market for less than £10. Mine has at least 5 pockets, so I can keep everything separate and safe. When I'm at a bus stop I can unzip the pocket with the travel pass, rotate the pass so that it sticks out of the pocket a bit and then the pass is quick and easy to get when the bus arrives and it's quick to put away again. Zip up the pocket and the pass is safe. (I only unzip that pocket when I'm at the bus stop. For trams, I only get the pass out once I'm on a tram and in position and the conductor will have wait until I'm ready before they can scan the pass.) I find it saves a lot of time getting on buses, and it keeps the pass in good condition.

So I've gone through the grief stages of losing the person you were and I've started on the journey to redefine myself and relearn how to live a full life. I only need the chair outside the house, which is handy as my house is totally unsuitable for chair use. I'm also in the UK, so things will be different compared to the US.

So here's a few things I've noticed being in my chair.

* 1) Accessible Toilets. Often, accessible toilets are also baby-change facilities. So the powers that be decide to put the rubbish/trash bins next to the toilet. So if you want to transfer from a chair, you have to be able to move the bins if you want to transfer laterally, otherwise you need to come out of your chair forwards, pivot in mid-air and place yourself on the toilet.

* 2) Shelf Heights. In ALL shops, shelves are stacked for ""normal"" people, so the trash is on the bottom shelves, the items to push are at eye-level, and most items are placed in horizontal rows. So small oranges may on the bottom shelf, and take up 6 feet of space. Medium oranges are on the middle shelf and also take up 6 feet of space. And large oranges are on the top shelf and take up 3 feet of space. My problem is that I can't reach the large oranges, and I don't want the small oranges. I haven't found any shops that stock items vertically so that people of all heights can reach everything. I know it's an impossible dream, but there's lots of times when goods can be made more accessible.

* 3) Spaces in stores. There are a few stores in my city where the distances between ""aisles"" is so narrow that I can't get my chair between the shelves, or hanging racks, or boxes, or whatever they've placed in the way.

* 4) Invisibility. Somehow, once you're in a chair, you become totally invisible. People walk into me regularly, in broad daylight, when they could have seen me coming from 30 feet away. Today, I had a guy walk right into me, placing one of his feet between my feet and my face was close enough to give him a blow job. Ew.

* 5) Crotch-watching. Since you're in a chair, you're at waist height, so you get to see all the badly fitting trousers/jeans/cargo pants that men wear and as many camel toes in a day to last a lifetime.

* 6) Canted pavements. Being in a chair, you notice EVERY slope, no matter how shallow. In my city, there isn't a single smooth, level, horizontal pavement to be found. If the pavement isn't going up or down a hill then the pavement has a slope across the pavement, usually lower on the road side, to allow for drainage of rain water. So I'm usually constantly going across a slope, with one arm pushing and the other braking - lower arm is pushing and higher arm is braking.

* 7) Badly Designed Public Transport. I don't have a car, so I rely on public transport to get around, mostly buses and trams. I can still walk a bit, so I could use trains, but those who can't walk find suing trains a nightmare. There are very few train stations where you could get to a platform and board a train without assistance and, if you need assistance, you need to give 24 hours notice. There goes spontaneous long-distance journeys. The local tram system is good, but limited in the locations covered, but I use it a lot now. Buses are usually badly designed in terms of getting into and out of the chair spaces. Since I can walk, it's usually a lot better if I board the bus whilst pushing the chair and then I can  get the chair into position before taking my seat. Otherwise I'd ahve to wait until the driver got out of the bus, lowered the ramp to let me on and then I would spend five minutes micro-manouvering my chair into the space. There simply isn't room to manouvre a chair on the local buses. Then I'll get wedged in by babies in push chairs/buggies, or just by empty buggies, and getting out would mean unpacking half of the people on the bus and their luggage and their babies and it's just not worth the hassle.

* 8) Staying Away. I have other issues apart from the limited mobility and, without a car, it's almost impossible for me to stay away from home, even for a single night. There's too much stuff I need to take with me and, if I'm staying in a hotel, there's no guarantee I'll be able to access the assigned room. And if I were paraplegic, three's a good chance that transferring to the bed in the hotel room would be almost impossible - the bed would be at the wrong height, or you couldn't get a chair next to the side of the bed. And that's to say nothing about the toilet facilities.

* 9) Starting Again. There are a lot of things that change when you start using a chair. Things you would never think about as an able-bodied person.

* Physically Impossible Tasks. If you're in a chair, or use crutches or similar, there are too many difficulties with public transport. Trains are by far the worst, with large steps onto and off trains, platforms that are only accessible via steps, buildings that are only accessible via steps. Buses are better and should be wheelchair accessible these days, which means a ramp, but not all ramps work, and not all buses will have a ramp, and sometimes there's no space on the bus even if there's a ramp. At least once a week I end up catching ""the next bus"".

* Inexperienced drivers. On the trams, I'm never given enough time to get on board and locked in position before the tram starts up. This happens every single time, even though the driver can see me waiting to get on the tram when he pulls up at a stop. On buses I'm often asked to fold my chair, not whether the chair **can** fold. But even if my chair folded, it'd still need most of the wheelchair space to  be carried on a bus - wheelchairs don't fold into a sort of golf-bag shape, they fold flat into a 1m by 1m by 30cm BIG BOX, if they even fold at all, but the drivers all assume that the chair will fold like a buggy. No, sorry. Often, drivers won't stop near the kerb when I'm getting off, even though I've pressed the ""wheelchair buzzer"" and there's lots of time to align the bus with the pavement. Or the driver won't stop exactly at the bus s top, which usually has a raised section of pavement to better match the bus door height, so you're faced with a much steeper ramp than normal.

* Buggy Woman. (Sadly, it's always a woman.) The woman who's got on first and she's not going to fold her foldable buggy just for you, or move her shopping trolley out of the way, or shift her 27 Tesco shopping bags. Or she gets on after you, and then makes a scene about how YOU are taking up all the space. Sadly, it's usually members of the public who cause the biggest aggro on a bus.

* Missing Buses. Despite modern technology, often the bus company doesn't announce that a particular bus isn't running and you'll have to wait for the next scheduled bus to arrive, along with everybody else at all the bus stops. A long wait in freezing weather and then everyone squeezes on like sardines. Not fun.",,,2,0,0,

I'd have to say that the bus driver training isn't all it could be. These are things that have happened to me this year:

* Being asked to fold my chair, or if I'm going to fold my chair. No, most chairs don't fold and, even if  they did, they're not going to fit anywhere except the wheelchair space.

* A bus didn't stop for me on a clear day with 300m visibility before my stop.

* A driver refusing to stop at my stop, even though it is a regular bus stop and I'd gotten off at that stop over a hundred times before.

* The bus didn't stop at my stop and the driver said that I didn't press the button, which I did. I know I pressed the button because a claxon goes off.

* The bus didn't stop at my stop because the driver ""didn't hear"" the claxon.

* The bus didn't stop at my stop because there was no light on the dashboard. As well as the claxon noise, there's supposed to be a light that goes on when the button is pressed. No light, no stop.

* The bus didn't stop because the driver forgot that someone had pressed the button.

* The bus didn't stop because the driver didn't know that there was actually a stop there. Perhaps we was new to the route. 

* The bus stopped at least 18 inches away from the kerb, on a straight road. Can my wheelchair suddenly fly and cross that chasm?

* The bus stops at least 15 feet before or after the actual stop, requiring some sudden movement to get my chair next to the bus door.

* The bus stops behind another bus that's already at the stop and then doesn't wait for me to get to the bus before pulling out.

* The driver forces people to take their buggy/stroller apart when all they needed to do was move it out of the way until I was in position and then put  the buggy at the end of my feet. Most spaces on my local buses can take a wheelchair with a buggy parked sideways. Often drivers will make people fold their buggy, or take them apart when all they need do is just move the buggy. I know the driver is trying to be helpful, but sometimes they go too far.

* Drivers will start moving the bus before I'm in position with brakes locked. I only need a few more seconds than normal, but I often find I have to hold on to something until we get to the next stop when I can then get properly into position.

* It started with a gut infection that wouldn't clear up. After 5 months the infection was finally beaten but the symptoms didn't go away. That didn't stop my GP continuing to check stool samples for several more months.

* Went to GP, the one who shouted about IBS, and he referred me to gastro at the hospital.

* Several uncomfortable tests and the FIRST consultant said I was Coeliac.

* Symptoms didn't disappear, so more tests by SECOND consultant and then back to first consultant. I was refractory Coeliac.

* Symptoms didn't change, so even more tests and then off to see consultant THREE. Definitely refractory Coeliac.

* Referred to consultant FOUR - a Coeliac specialist.

Fist appointment with FOUR and literally the first thing he said to me was, ""You don't have Coeliac's"". Even more tests followed and eventually I was diagnosed with BAD and after many months the symptoms became liveable with.

Funnily enough, ALL of the consultants had already made their minds up before I entered the room and weren't interested in anything I had to say, even number FOUR. Luckily the fourth consultant was right and I got the correct diagnosis, even though he wasn't much of a people person. At the time I trusted doctors and believed everything they said. By the time I got the correct diagnosis I questioned everything.

Probably the biggest thing to say is that WE are NOT our ""disability"". For some people their ""disability"" is at the same level as the colour of their hair (almost none in my case) and for others it's a much bigger partof their identity.

Be polite. Don't assume anything. Don't stereotype. Treat EVERYONE the same, whether they look ""normal"", have only half a body, are in a wheelchair or bouncing off the ceiling. Watch the X-Files episode ""Humbug"" for an excellent example of first impressions being wrong.

If a doctor is rude to all his patients then I don't have a problem with him. But if he is only rude to obviously disabled patients then he's going to find me talking to the hospital managers to get him sanctioned.

It's a bit like people who just walk up to a wheelchair and start pushing. No! Always ask before you touch a chair. Always ask before you pry into someone's life.

Would you ask a stranger, ""why are you so fat?"", or ""why are you so ugly?"", or ""why are you divorced?"", or ""why did you have an abortion?"" No. So don't ask, ""why are you disabled?"" as your first question. Be polite and lead up to the difficult questions.

* An Experienced Helper. It would have helped me a lot, when learning to get out and about, to have someone with me who knew how the transport system worked. How you paid, was it exact change only, was there something like an oyster card, where do you put your card, how much it was likely to cost, how do you let the driver know you want to get off, how do you get the doors to open. After a few journeys you know the ropes, but travelling with a disability is difficult enough without having to figure out what everybody else on the bus/tram already seems to know. Having a buddy to help and explain things, even for just a week would have made things much easier for me.

* Where To Go. If you're not going to a hospital, GP, school, work, or similar, where can you go to practice going out. My city centre is all hills and impossible for me to get around most days. However, there is an out of town cinema that I can get to, with large flat floors I can practice wheeling about on, and there's a very large ""mall"" at the end of one of the tram lines that I can wheel about in when the weather's bad. It's also a place that I can actually shop for things. Also, with the cinema, they often have autism-friendly showings which might be attractive as more of an Event.

* Find What Works For You. My city centre is hilly but, if I trundle down the hill I live on, I can catch a bus to the other side of the city, which is uphill from the city centre, and then I can start at the top of the hills and work my way down until I get to the bottom of the hills, where I can catch a bus home again. It's completely the wrong way to go about things if I could walk, and it took a few months to work out the logistics, but it makes city-centre shopping possible now. Experiment until you find what works for you.

* Use Headphones. If you can use headphones, then use them. Using headphones help me distance myself from everyone on the bus and I'm not trying to make myself invisible all the time and not get in anyone's way or inconvenience anyone. When I started I was hyper-aware of what everyone was thinking, but it was really what I **thought** everyone was thinking. With headphones I can lose myself in the music, not hear any comments, detach myself from some of the stress of public transport.

* Take It Slowly. Don't try and cross London and 3 different buses and a tube train on day one. Find a quiet time of the day, go just a few stops, cross the road and come straight back again, or maybe have a coffee before heading back, but don't plan to hit every shop on the high street before lunch.

* Be Flexible. If you're using buses, trams, trains, or taxis there will be things outside of your control and you have to learn to accept that, and adjust your plans for the day. It may be up to you **where** you go, but not **when** you go. Accept that and work it into **your** plans.  If an appointment time can't work for you, ask for a different time, on a different day if needs be, or let them know that it's 50-50 if you make it on time and that it's beyond your control.

* Is It Free Travel? Is there a free travel scheme in your area? Because I get a travel Personal Independent Payment (PIP), I get a free travel pass. I can use the buses and trams for free, otherwise I'd have to find £600 a year for fares. If there's something like that for you, get it, and then use it ALL the time.

And how do you define a ""benefit""? There are wheelchair spaces on buses because the law says there must be. But the spaces are used mostly by people with baby buggies/strollers. Without the law dictating wheelchair spaces there would be fewer or no buggy spaces on buses, as the bus company would see that they could get more people on the bus without the large space for wheelchairs/strollers.

If you wait to pay off the mortgage, (a) you're more financially stable in the short term and that's nothing to sneeze at, but also (b) you're giving away money on interest. So the math I'd be doing -- and it's a little subjective -- is ""how much will it cost me to hang onto this money?"" and then ""is that worth it to me personally?"" 

The former question has one correct answer, but the second one is totally up to you. My instinct is typically to pay off the thing and then solve the next problem, because that -- in theory -- keeps the most money in your pocket long-term. But if that's gonna put you into a situation where you're not comfortable, or where you might have to borrow something on worse terms in the future if things go badly (or it's in some kind of growth fund and it's earning a higher percent than your mortgage rate), then maybe you don't pay it off. Or, perhaps you pay off a portion of it? When you eliminate principal (principle?) today, you pay less interest for the rest of the loan. 

Basically, and I'm guessing you know this, you can spend some money to save some money. Idunno. I'd probably try to put at least a hefty amount of payment on the mortgage, if not the whole thing, but that might mean giving up fun things until the SSDI checks start coming.

Totally agree with you. I don't know how SSA can combat myths, because they are so ingrained in popular culture. It can be hard for SSA to give real simplistic information, because ultimately it can still be complicated. No two situations and beneficiaries are alike.

&gt; People are not going to come into the office or call and ask those questions either because they don't want their case flagged or something because they asked questions about employment.

Again, I'm not sure why people think this. The only ""flags"" that case really gets that will follow that person around is if the person is a physical threat (ie banned from the FO) or if there is fraud involved.

&gt; If people understood the seeming lottery system for why some people are approved in three months and why others have to fight for 3+ years, perhaps this would be less terrifying

The information about the programs is out there (the entire POMS is available online), but the hard part is that most people only see themselves through their own eyes, and there is this natural bias to be skeptical of the system.  Some people see themselves as 'disabled' but they don't meet the criteria for SSDI/SSI. Or maybe they do but their doctor's keep crappy notes (or don't turn them in at all) so the evidence isn't there to support them. Disability is ultimately a vocational program, and there are so many factors that go into it besides just medical. A person can be disabled (in the vernacular sense) but not qualify for SSDI

One of the reasons I like to post on this sub is to help give information and correct misinformation. Each case is different so you **cannot** compare two claimants side by side to determine why one person was allowed immediately while another wasn't. 

These stories always start out with ""someone I know.."" but the problem with that is that you don't know what was in that person's case file; hell, most people don't know exactly what was in their case file. Last year SSA processed 2.1 million disability applications, so you can't extrapolate a few anecdotes to the whole system.  

 A lot of the negative myths out there get perpetuated by anecdotal evidence, and then when faced with actual statistics, people still refuse to believe it. Take the ""everyone gets denied the first time"" myth. The reality is that about 30-33% of claims are allowed the first time (assuming it clears the first level of FO approval and makes it to the DDS). The reason that allowance rates increase the longer a case goes on is because the case file gets longer. Everyone says ""oh well they just deny you so you have to go in front of the ALJ"". One of the reasons more people get allowed at the ALJ (aside from judges being able to do whatever the hell they want, unlike the DDS) is that the case file is probably *double* what it was at the initial level. 

I can't tell you how many times I've posted actual facts on this sub, only to be told that I'm wrong, or that I'm lying. People insinuate that all I do all day is sit around and figure out how to screw people over. Its almost impossible to counter that kind of thinking. The unintended consequence of that is that these myths then permeate the discussions about the program as a whole, which will probably  negatively impact it in the future.  ",,,2,0,0,

SSA does take into account that certain mental disorders will have large gaps in treatment (since that can be part of the disorder).

I don't think that it is correct to think about SSI/SSDI necessarily in terms of medical care. The two are really separate. Medicaid is separate from SSI, so even if OP did lose their SSI benefits that doesn't necessarily mean they lose Medicaid. Its likely that they qualify for their state's Medicaid program (either through a buy-in, working disabled, or  income).  The good thing about Medicare is that if a person loses SSDI, they can still get Medicare (EMCP) for 5 years after they lose their SSDI. 

So when someone says that they don't want to work because they may lose their medical care, I don't think that is entirely accurate. From an outside (general public) perspective what you see is someone who *can* work the extra hours choosing not to.  

&gt; the jobs that they are able to get are not high paying due to spotty work histories

Having a spotty work history, no work history, or having no marketable 'skills' does lead to lower paying jobs; at least in the beginning. But this is the case even for non-disabled individuals, and I don't think its fair to use ""well they won't make a lot of money"" as a reason for not working. 

There is also a misconception with regards to what happens once you start working again. After a person has completed the TWP months, they begin a 36 month [extended period of eligibility](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0413010210) where they will get a check should they fall below SGA. 

So they get that 3 year period where they can test out working above the SGA level.   If their goal is to get to full-time work they can gradually build up to that. If it doesn't work out, or their condition gets worse, then they will still get their check.

&gt; then have to back through the horrific SSA system to regain benefits after attempting full time gainful employment and many people just give up

This is why there is the [Expedited Reinstatement](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0413050001), so that a person who tried working, but couldn't stay employed due to their condition, gets a fast track back onto SSI/SSDI.  As long as its within 60 months of their cessation, they are able to get put back on benefits right away during the EXR determination, which is almost always approved (it just needs to be the same disability as they were originally allowed for). They do not have to go through the initial claims process all over again. 

You're right that healthcare is expensive. But as I mentioned above there are options for medical coverage that are separate from SSI/SSDI. If a person is working full time, they often then will also qualify for benefits through work. For a person on SSI, they can usually still qualify for their state's Medicaid system. For those that were on SSDI/Medicare they have the [extended Medicare coverage](https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/extended.htm) program.  This allows for a person to keep their Medicare coverage for 8.5 years after they start working. The clock for this does start during the EPE; so realistically its 5 years after SSDI cessation. 

So really between the EXR protection and the EMC protections, a person who returns to work has a 5 year buffer; and that is after the initial 3 year EPE/trial run.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1492009299,"So, busses can be okay in a a lot of areas, but they come with their own problems. For instance, there was *no* bus service at my last home because I was too far out of town. The city I grew up in as a child simply didn't have bus service at all. Here I technically have access to a bus, but the bus stop is well over a mile away. So it really depends on where you live.

I think the focus is much easier to deal with in the GN because you can truly show things. The chair can be visible to everyone without someone having to mention it. It can bump into something with only a sound effect, instead of interrupting the flow. 

Something else I thought about is the type of chair that you will have her use:

* The standard push chair comes in a wide variety of designs. For instance, no one would seriously use the large wheeled type of push chairs that you get from the hospital for any length of time. They are the worst things in the world. Someone who's going to be in a chair for a long period of time will generally get one with a much smaller profile, like [this](https://at-aust.org/images/item_images/4320010.jpg?1488520831). They are generally rigid frame, meaning that they don't fold up like everyone seems to assume wheelchairs should fold up, but they are much lighter and easier on the user. Also, wheelchair wheels are similar to any other type of tire. Many of them are pneumatic, and can absolutely go flat on you. Even if they are just a little low on air pushing them across carpet can be nearly impossible.  Solid rubber wheels exist to combat this problem, but they are more expensive, and you can't replace them on your own because getting them on the wheel requires special equipment. I think having a flat tire on her wheelchair would make for a very interesting scene!

* Don't forget that learning to use a wheelchair is very difficult in the beginning. They will almost all come with ""[training wheels](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dXGz8c1GM20/maxresdefault.jpg)"" (technically called anti-tip wheels) that stick out of the back of the chair to keep you from unintentionally tipping over backwards. The problem with these, is that if you need to _intentionally_ tip your chair slightly, four example to get over a curb, those training wheels will prevent you from being able to do that. For this reason the owner generally takes them off of the chair as soon as possible -- sometimes before they really should.

* I don't know anyone in a push chair, who has the use of their arms, who actually still has the push handles installed on the back. There is a very, very good reason for this: people are fucking idiots. There often kind, and generally have good intentions, but there still idiots. For what ever reason, people seem to think that it is OK to come up from behind you, grab the handles on your chair, and ""help"" you. This often happens when you are struggling to get a door open, and someone thinks it would be helpful to just push you through. The smallest problem in that situation is that it throws all of your balance off which leads to a scary moment and can tip you. The much larger problem is that, well, it's essentially kidnapping. The wheelchair user is now suddenly completely at the mercy of which ever idiot decided to grab their push handles, and there is no way to get control back until they decide to let go. If they are someone with bad intentions who decides to give you a strong push towards traffic, there's really not much you can do about it. Not to mention that losing all control like that is just terrifying.

* Finally -- and this isn't something that doesn't get talked about very much -- there is a big difference in how a person in a manual wheelchair and someone in a powered wheelchair are treated, even if they have the same diagnosis. I use both chairs, and the difference is absurd. For some reason people assume that power chair users are mentally handicapped, regardless of whether or not that is actually the case. They'll squat down and speak to you very slowly, enunciating and using small words with large gestures, and wait for you to signal that you've understood everything they said before proceeding. It is demeaning and incredibly frustrating. To be fair, this exists to some extent with manual chair users, but not nearly as bad as when you're in a power chair. Some people just get dumb when they see a power chair.

Also, since we're on the subject, how do you think someone in a manual wheelchair uses an umbrella during the rain? Surprise! They don't.

I think her growing to love her chair is the right way to go about it. It becomes your freedom. The thing that gets you out of the house and lets you socialize or shop on your own. It becomes an extension of who you are, but not your identity. 

I'm glad to hear that you're open to attending a support group! I really think that's the best way to go about this, and I think that everyone there and would be happy to talk to you and help you with anything you need. It would be good for you to have some contacts in the local community there. Most importantly though I think maybe going to the first meeting as just a fly on the wall Will give you an interesting perspective into how people are adjusting and what problems they are facing.

Good luck with this, and please come back if you have other questions! It seems like everyone here is happy to help.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1491235450,"So, there will be someone at your hearing who is the ""Job Guy"" (because I can't remember the technical name for the position). His role is to sit there and tell the judge that it is the government's position that there is a specific job that you are able to do. Your lawyer explains why that job isn't possible, job guy counters and so on.

The biggest criticism of this (especially in years past) is that the jobs they will say you can do are not necessarily always jobs in the real world. Even when they are viable jobs, there is no requirement that there be a job opening. Even more frustrating, the job doesn't even have to exist in your city so long as it exists somewhere (even just on paper).

For example, they might say that you're capable of doing table prep at a restaurant, and define that as being the person who folds the napkins and divides the silverware into sets. However, in the real world this job is often rolled into the job of the servers or bus boys, so it is *highly* unlikely that you would ever find this position in the real world despite the fact that you might be denied disability on the basis of this ""job."" (Side note, I actually knew someone in college who had this job! worked well for him in his chair, but it was only like 2hrs/day twice a week or something.)

Another example would be them saying that you could do receptionist work on a limited schedule with appropriate accommodations. However, can you imagine trying to find a company who wants to hire you to work as a receptionist two days a week when they also have to dump $1k into accommodations *and* hire someone else (who likely wants to work full time and requires no accommodations) to work the three days you aren't? No company is going to split that job up in the real world.

Finally, the most common rebuff today is work from home, computer based customer service jobs. This has been a benefit because it does allow a lot of disabled people to work again, but there are a number of disreputable companies hiring for this, and it is now almost always the fallback during these hearings. These jobs allow you to field customer service calls for companies like Apple and American Express from your personal computer, theoretically while in bed with your own accommodations made. If you can sit-up, type, talk, and be available for decent hours, this is what they'll hit you with. Sometimes these jobs are available, but there are frequently loooong periods with no hiring, especially for the bigger companies. AppleCare requires that you leave your home and travel to attend an on-site training seminar before starting -- this restricts many people, but isn't accounted for and AppleCare is still cited as a viable option. The less-kind companies will also have required performance metrics (calls per hour, customer satisfaction, etc.) that foster competition and threaten job loss. This can create a hugely stressful environment, which is bad for most disabilities. So even though a job that you meet the minimum requirements for technically exists, they might not be hiring, or might require onsite training, or could actually foster an environment that exacerbates your condition. Once you weed out those companies, this job might not really exist for you either.

That was a long and rambling explanation, but it's a matter of how they define a job, and that there doesn't have to be any viable position available in said job.",,,2,0,0,

A few pieces of advice: 


* One of the biggest, most frequently overlooked struggles is transportation. A bottom-line wheelchair van costs around $50k new (and used ones have to be cheap enough to be disposable, given maintenance costs). Most areas don't have _any_ wheelchair taxis because, believe it or not, it isn't required that they provide an accessible option. Public Transport has to have an option, but they often operate as ""we'll pick you up inside a 2-4 hour window, and we're picking up a few other people for their appointments as well"" so it isn't uncommon to be _hours_ late for a doctor's appointment. And the fact that they work reduced business hours, and only Monday to Friday? Super irritating, and prone to leaving you stranded.
* Sidewalks are the devil. The lack of maintenance that most people overlook can literally be deadly in a wheelchair. For example, my chair can not handle cracks or rocks taller than 1.5"". Anything larger locks up the front casters and tries to dump me. Early on I wound up tossed into a busy intersection in DC because of this. As a corollary, whenever you park, try to spot the curb-cuts and think about how out of the way they are. Keep an eye out for the ramp to get into buildings that have stairs. 
* This one is kind of squishy, but I'll do my best. If your character is adjusting and having problems with the chair, it's okay for it to be a focus of their attention. Other characters should obviously acknowledge it, but making continual references gets old. It begins to scream ""Look at me! I wrote a character in a wheelchair! How progressive and inclusive I am!"" I recently read Marrow by Tarryn Fisher, and it blows my mind. The author writes such good things about the sidewalks, and how tough it can be to be in a chair that you just know she has personal experience with it. But her main character (who meets and starts dating someone in a wheelchair) mentions his chair in practically every sentence about him. It's extremely heavy handed and borderline offensive; in those moments it takes a relatively well rounded character and reduces him to his chair for the sake of parading the fact that he uses one. This would be less of an issue in a GN since narration is rarely used, but it is in prose.
* Finally,  I would really, really encourage you to visit a support group. Maybe touch base with the coordinator beforehand to let them know that you'd like to come and listen, and then go to 2-3 meetings and just listen. Hear about people's struggles and fears, get to know them. It's the best way to handle this.


Good luck!",,,6,0,0,

You basically have two options. The first is a monitored service like Lifeline (or some home security companies) where you pay an amount each month to have a horrendously large and ugly pendant that only works inside your home.

The second is the Apple Watch. You can use and app called Workflow to build in a single touch emergency call button and place it right in the middle of the watch screen.

It works off a Bluetooth connection between your watch and your phone. The downside here (and why I don't use this) is that you have to remove your watch every night to charge it.

I haven't found another smart watch that would work with iOS though.",,,1,0,0,

Even if it doesn't jeopardize those benefits directly, you put other benefits/options at risk and will earn yourself some new annual headaches.

For example, if your SSDI is greater than the limit for receiving SSI, he'd lose that. I am less well-versed in SSI income, but I know there are some very stringent income tests that go along with keeping it. The first one that comes to my mind, is that as a married couple, you will never be able to keep more than $3,000 (I believe -- that's close to the right number anyway) in equity and/or savings account, or he will lose his SSI benefits. If you stay separated, you would be allowed to save money for the both of you, and since you are only on SSDI, there are no limits on what you could save for both of you guys.

If your SSDI (and his SSI if he keeps it) is more than a certain amount, you will become ineligible for some state services that it's really hard to be ineligible for on your own on SSDI. I was trying to get a wheelchair van, and the lady told me that our combined was like $2,500 over the annual limit for the state to buy it. Her solution? ""Are you guys willing to get divorced? The only way I can help you is if you get divorced.""

Your combined income will be used for tax purposes. ""But anotherjunkie,"" you say, ""SSDI/SSI isn't taxed income!"" False. It is only untaxed if your *family* is below a certain limit. If you go above that, you owe taxes for the year. Since getting married we've yet to get a federal tax refund I lose an entire month's check to taxes over the course of the year.

There are other small things that can cause problems. Mainly having to do with trying to get assistance from the state. If neither of you have mobility issues, that becomes less of a problem (because mobility equipment is so much more expensive then you're able to afford on your own if you need it). 

That being said, we are both very glad that we got married, and we aren't overly concerned about these problems now that we've been dealing with them for half a dozen years. They caused an awful lot of frustration in the beginning, though, so know what you're getting into if you do decide to get married.

The most important part here, is that it *depends on your combined income*. You'll need to combine both of y'all's incomes and check all of the limits in the state and with the federal government to make sure you won't accidentally exceed something. If the marriage certificate really doesn't matter to y'all, this might be more dangerous than it's worth. Maybe y'all just have a wedding ceremony, with a friend doing the valves, you get rings and everything, but you just don't fill out the marriage certificate. In the eyes of everyone who knows you, and more importantly to yourselves, you guys are married. There wouldn't be any paperwork to prove it, but you don't necessarily have to tell anyone that either. 

I'm sure that there are others who will say differently, but I have been through the problems that having a marriage certificate causes first hand. I'd have my own wheelchair van free and clear by now if we weren't married -- instead I just don't leave the house because there's no transport available. 

I wouldn't trade my wife for the world -- just so we're clear on that -- but getting that certificate has caused some trouble for us.",,,7,0,0,

If you meet this age criteria and are also receiving benefits already under SSI and/or SSDI, you are automatically eligible to establish an ABLE account.

That part I find especially bad but I am sorry to say, not surprising based on some of the experiences we have had with professional staff. What really set me off thinking about the lack of accessibility in London was looking at the tube map and seeing how few stations were ""Step Free from Street to Platform"" or ""Step Free from Street to Train"" - for a city that is putting up posters celebrating their accessibility, it was surprisingly few stations.  
  
&gt; In the UK, the law is ambivalent about wheelchair spaces. Yes, we should have priority, but nobody can be forced to give up the space for a wheelchair user.  
  
This was a topic of conversation at work a few weeks back - where I mentioned that I had seen situations like the one you described. My co-workers were quick to tell me about [this ruling](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/18/court-backs-wheelchair-user-who-was-stopped-from-boarding-bus-yorkshire-leeds), and didn't seem to understand my arguments about the semantics in that article: ""Drivers **may** stop the bus “with a **view to pressurising or shaming** recalcitrant non-wheelchair users to move” **if they believe** a refusal is unreasonable, the judgment declared."" I mean, there's a whole lot of ""wiggle words"" in that which make me think that many bus drivers would just not bother. Perhaps I am being cynical though - have you seen any difference at all since this ruling in January?  
  
&gt; Use Google Street View to check the journey, start to finish, looking out for where the bus stops are, is there a shelter to protect from bad weather, and is there a seat to sit when waiting for a bus. Sometimes it's better to go to the next stop if there's a shelter and seat.  
  
I have always used Google Street View myself for going to places, planning travel training, and then showing the route on my iPad to the young people I have worked with - I like to know where I'm going so I always felt it was logical that I should show the people I worked with the same. I must admit, the lack of bus shelter never occurred to me as something to look out for and all this information is the kind of thing I want to be conscious about. I will now be thinking of the presence of bus shelters and looking for the stops either side of the closest stop to see if they have protection from the weather.  
  
&gt; Speak up for yourself, or for others in your party. Know your rights and make sure you get them. I've reported bad behaviour from drivers to their customer service departments in the past.  
  
This one I've encountered as a Travel Trainer and there was some disagreement with my manager and colleague about how it should be dealt with. A bus driver was incredibly rude - to the point of voicing slurs as we went to sit down - to one young man with Downs Syndrome who was learning to use the bus. All because the young man took a little bit longer to put his Oyster back in his bag and held up the bus for maybe ten seconds. I reported the driver and went through all of those procedures with TfL but always felt like I should have said something directly to the bus driver. I was new in the role at the time and had already been told my manager and co-worker that in those situations, I was not to cause any kind of ""scene"" and instead deal with it professionally. I asked the young man what he would have wanted me to do (and after that incident I now ask each young person what they would want me to do in this kind of situation) and he said that just reporting was okay but the driver should have been told off as well.

The thought of a driver asking someone in a wheelchair to fold up their wheelchair seems so ridiculous that I don't know what to think about the whole thing. I cannot imagine even thinking to ask someone to fold up their wheelchair - how on earth would I know that individual person's circumstances? Given how reluctant so many bus drivers are to ask people to fold up buggies this makes me somewhat despairing of transport staff.  
  
&gt; Or the driver won't stop exactly at the bus s top, which usually has a raised section of pavement to better match the bus door height, so you're faced with a much steeper ramp than normal.  
  
This is something else I had no idea was even a thing, I will be much more conscious of this in the future.  
  
&gt; Sadly, it's usually members of the public who cause the biggest aggro on a bus.  
  
This, unfortunately, is something I have seen time and again with the young people I have worked with.

It has been incredibly helpful and I don't think I can thank you enough for the time you have given with your replies. I have learnt a lot from reading it - there were things I had never even considered and going forward I will be conscious of these barriers and how they might affect the people we work with.  
  
&gt; My city centre is hilly but, if I trundle down the hill I live on, I can catch a bus to the other side of the city, which is uphill from the city centre, and then I can start at the top of the hills and work my way down until I get to the bottom of the hills, where I can catch a bus home again. It's completely the wrong way to go about things if I could walk, and it took a few months to work out the logistics, but it makes city-centre shopping possible now.  
  
Again, these logistical steps are the kinds of things that I have not always thought about as much as I should have - too often in our work we are thinking of the shortest or most straight-forward route but this might not always be the most accessible. Combining this with what you said about bus shelters in another comment, I have already decided that I will ask travel trainers in my new role to think differently when looking at the routes from location to location.  
  
&gt; Is It Free Travel? Is there a free travel scheme in your area? Because I get a travel Personal Independent Payment (PIP), I get a free travel pass. I can use the buses and trams for free, otherwise I'd have to find £600 a year for fares. If there's something like that for you, get it, and then use it ALL the time. There might be a lot of paperwork involved, but it's worth it.  
  
There is meant to be the Freedom Pass available - but so many young people we have worked with have been denied a Freedom Pass (including those who have had epileptic seizures within the past year and so would be excluded from driving so should be guaranteed a pass). Young people or their families become discouraged with having to reapply and I can't blame them. I have helped to support applications for Freedom Passes in the past and I am currently writing a supporting letter for a PIP for a young man I worked with in the past but I feel like we should do more.

I would apply now and put this upcoming appointment on your application. The application process takes a while.

When you apply, disability examiners are required by law to write to all your medical sources within the adjudicative time frame. For SSI, this is a year prior to when you filed, for SSDI, this is a year (for physical, three for mental) prior to when you allege you are unable to work. If you listed sources that you went to in this time frame, the examiner HAD to write to them to get medical records. If you did not have medical records, or records were not received, you would've been sent to a consultative examination (which it sounds like you were).

CEs can be tricky. They are a snapshot in time. They can only really document how you are doing on that day. CEs generally include background information, but if you're not swollen on that day, the CE can't document that you were. The CE doctor probably had you perform ""stretches meant for a back problem and limb issues"" because the examiner asked for information on your range of motion- how far you are able to bend. It's a fairly standard part of a CE.

As for not getting ahold of your examiner, the best thing to do is call the disability office (NOT the field office- not where you dropped off your application, but the actual office where disability examiners work- this info should be on the letter you get at the beginning of the process that says ""we have your claim"") and ask to speak to the supervisor of your examiner. The supervisor should take action to ensure you get ahold of the examiner.

Again, with the continual loss of your paperwork, drop it off at the disability office. NOT at the field office/SSA office. Field offices/SSA offices are overwhelmed, busy, and overworked. Going to the disability office and dropping it off with your examiner insures that they received it. Keep a copy for your records as well. 

I can't help you much with the lawyer. It seems that they...well...suck. There are national disability firms like Allsup and Bradford Myler. Attorney reps are most useful at the administrative law judge level. Prior to that, they really only provide paperwork, updated medical records, etc to examiners. Sometimes, as you've unfortunately found out, they can be very detrimental.

The issue I see with your impairment is that it comes and goes. It is like MS- it waxes and wanes. If you do not have objective documentation (ER visits, doctor visits, x-rays/other testing)(and yes, I know you mentioned lab work, but description of swelling by an MD would be helpful in your case), it's very hard for a disability examiner to just go on your description of the issue. Examiners need objective medical evidence, which is why we send claimants to consultative exams. And that evidence needs to be recent. So, if you decide to continue pursuing disability, it wouldn't be a bad idea to go to your medical doctor/ER when you have an episode so swelling so it is documented.

Your age works against you. The younger you are, the harder it is to be allowed on physical impairments. This is because Social Security believes there are more jobs people can adjust to when they are younger. And while disability examiners do take your prior work record into account (and the fact that you have had trouble maintaining a job), it is VERY hard to be allowed below age 50 unless you meet a [listing](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm). 

You can apply for disability as many times as you'd like. So you can apply again, starting fresh, or you can get a good lawyer and continue the process, assuming you are not outside the appeal date.
