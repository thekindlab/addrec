The eeg showed the brain wave pattern. Without her records that the drs in FLa neglected to oder that establish this in detail, they had her second guessing if she even had epilepsy at all. They gave her all sorts of grief doubting her official dx. Treating her like a drug seeker  when the only drug she took regularly was lamictal.

0f315b73-da52-4b44-b8e5-5c225f386053,1476661923,"&gt; Hey HereNowThis! I have very similar disabilities, though my story differs (multiple mental health + fibromyalgia). I was diagnosed with JIA before 18. I started having mental health issues right when I applied. I applied at 18 (my mother is a disability advocate, which made the process much more feasible). I was rejected twice, but was awarded at the last appeal with a judge. It was the mental health component and the chronicity of the rheumatoid arthritis (was actually fibro I later learned) that put me over the edge. It also was before Obamacare, so I needed health insurance to stay okay. 

&gt; I've been in voc rehab since being awarded, earning an education  that can allow me to work with my disability. Because I'm under voc rehab, I'm under the Ticket to Work program. As long as I'm making substantive progress, I don't get reevaluated. I feel like the situation would be similar if you are able to get SSI/SSDI. 

&gt; The nice thing on Ticket to Work is that it ""reserves"" your benefits in case you cannot work. There is a lot of complexity to it, but that's the gist of it. [Here's a link to the page](https://www.chooseworkttw.net/about/how-it-works/index.html) I'm about to start my career, hopefully. I'm scared about being able to sustain work, because I get months-long downspells sometimes and I've never worked (or been able to) 40 hours a week before. I'm hoping with extensive accommodations (multiple telework days, etc) I'll be able to figure it out.

&gt; Oh, and I think there is a reduction if you live with family, but only if you are claimed as a dependent (don't quote me on that one).

&gt; Let me know if you have more questions. 

&gt; By the way, have you ever gotten a diagnosis for your mental health? My docs always give me the excuse that my fibro prevents them from assessing a diagnosis. I definitely have a mood disorder, but I'm also highly engaged in ""magical thinking"", making me close to being schizotypal. It's frustrating to just tell people ""it's complicated"".

Like all my experience is in the food industry or retail, which i can no longer do because i can't physically be on my feet for 6-8 hour shifts, and reasonable accommodation is a thing but at some point they'd rather hire someone who can help other employees with more mobile tasks than someone who needs to stay in the same place most of the time.

b42fffd2-39df-45ba-b52f-c9b51c39b55d,1476801697,"My agency actively blocks Dragon from functioning, &amp; terminates anyone who needs it or requests it.

79 Dragon users have been terminated in 6 months - after management was made aware that Dragon is being blocked from functioning by the Agency's IT contractor's IT settings.  

It's not legal, but enforcement is left up to us individuals with disabilities, &amp; just the costs of the lawyer, let alone the almost decade it takes for the legal process to get anywhere, is too high a price for any of us to pay.

Between Section 508 of the Rehab Act of 1973, as amended, &amp; the ADA, federal agencies are 'required to make it work' - even the Access Board states this, emphatically   (they're ones in charge of telling individuals how to 'enforce' the law - by filing useless complaints that paint a target on you &amp; only result in termination).

My agency's management says they 'are in a standoff' with their IT contractor over who must pay for the manufacturer's support ($1,500 per user, annually) to get Dragon functional and keep it functional.  

And both the Agency &amp; the IT contractor have repeatedly stated that they 'have no legal obligation to provide accessible access to IT to anyone, disabled or not'.

My direct supervisor told me ""it's going to take someone MUCH higher up than you or I to convince them to follow the law &amp; make Dragon work.  This would probably have to go all the way to the Supreme Court.""

Another manager told me 'off the record' that upper management knows it can stomp on EEO laws and then claim ignorance/incompetence and 'force the retirement' of a retirement-age, willing scapegoat - IF the complaint ever gets to court.  

I've read far too many court cases where their go-to strategy has worked at the EEOC level (10+ years to reach this point).  

It doesn't work in federal court, which is the option after the EEOC process finishes, but that can take another 5+ years, &amp; the costs are astronomical.

And during this decade to decade and a half EEOC/court process the filer's career is decimated.  The entire process is horrible &amp; provides zero protection for federal employees.  

I accepted my position in large part BECAUSE my agency had claimed that Dragon was 'certified for use' on their system/computers. 

It's still listed online as currently 'certified for use' on their computers &amp; system ....even though it has never actually been functional anywhere on the Agency-wide network of over 300,000 computers.  

The kicker is Dragon HAS been &amp; IS functional on the small pockets of computers at different sites across the country that don't have the Agency's IT contractor's settings, AND the Agency even has the support contracts in place to keep Dragon functional on those computers - but these are in only use by NON-disabled employees.

Meanwhile the Agency refuses to provide this same technology to disabled employees.  

The discrimination is blatant, and is being committed openly &amp; with the full knowledge of even the highest levels of management.

They know there is zero enforcement, &amp; know their internal EEO office has high priced Agency staff lawyers to help them destroy anyone who files a complaint.  

My Union reps couldn't believe the discrimination was so cut-&amp;-dried, obviously illegal, &amp; blatant.  

They thought like I did at first - if the correct people in the Agency were made aware of this Agency-wide EEO violation, it would be corrected &amp; Dragon would be made functional for every employee who needs it now &amp; in the future.

Unfortunately, that's not what happens.  At all.  

My Union is the only reason I wasn't &amp; haven't been terminated (yet).  Instead, I was 'placed on Admin Leave because Dragon doesn't work, &amp; while the EEO case is being processed' shortly after my Union became involved.  

I would much rather have gone my whole life without learning any of this.

I went back to college expressly to serve my country.  

When my hands stopped working, I sought out &amp; became proficient in the assistive tech tools that efficiently &amp; effectively 'act as my hands'.

I was recruited by my Agency for my position because of my professional skills &amp; abilities - under a disability hiring initiative &amp; with their full knowledge of my needing Dragon in order to work.

It seemed like the perfect opportunity, complete with 'guaranteed advancement' - &amp; I relocated 5 states away from family to accept it.

But it quickly became a nightmare - one that's caused 79 disabled Dragon users to be terminated so far &amp; put the rest on the fast track to being terminated.

I had no idea that the calls to 'hire people with disabilities into federal service' were just lip service &amp; PR sound bites, with no actual intention of providing the equal opportunity to work.  (And neither did my direct supervisor.)

My own career has been derailed, &amp; my health and life are being destroyed over this.   

I just want to WORK, not spend the rest of my life in a fruitless, endless, million dollar battle (that I can't afford) in an attempt to force an Agency with a budget of hundreds of billions - including a $5+ billion budgeted for IT - to just comply with the EEO/RA/Disability laws.

My hope is to find an employer where there are people who are currently actively using Dragon - in the hopes of not ending up back at square one at a new job with yet another nonfunctional Dragon. 

I just want the equal opportunity to work.

If the mountain trike is out of your reach, an alternative is a Freewheel and chunky tyres.

Together they were Â£500 so much cheaper than the Trike. Depending on the size of his street wheels he may also need longer axle pins for chunky wheels, they run me another Â£40 or so.

In Pennsylvania, the Department of Labor &amp; Industry handles unemployment benefits and determines eligibility on a case-by-case basis. Applicants must meet the following three eligibility requirements in order to collect unemployment benefits in Pennsylvania:

â€¢     Your past earnings must meet certain minimum thresholds.

â€¢     You must be unemployed through no fault of your own, as defined by Pennsylvania law.

â€¢     You must be able and available to work, and you must be actively seeking employment.",,,2,0,0,

&gt; received the same level of intervention any other suicidal 14-year-old would

I somehow doubt, in a case that made international news, that a 14-year-old was not given intensive psychiatric consultation. The author seems a little too fixated on the idea that they could have 'fixed' her with the right words, which is pretty disrespectful. 14 is not an adult, but it's not a child either. She knew the realities of her condition and made a decision based on that. 
&gt; Iâ€™m saddened â€” as were many others with S.M.A, and some disability rights groups â€” to think others might grow so weary or apprehensive that they follow her example.

Well this is going to be a matter of opinion, but I don't think that being weary of life, when there is no realistic option to change that weariness, is a bad reason to die. If you're so ill you cannot do anything and no longer enjoy your life, what's the point? That sounds like being alive just for the sake of living, and frankly, fuck that. I'm alive to do and think and feel and when it comes to the stage where I no longer have the ability to do those things, or where weariness blocks out the good, you're damn right I'll be popping my clogs. That line is different for everyone and assuming otherwise from a few news stories is just silly. 

Society 'needing' disabled people is a really fucking awful reason to stay in a life of misery and I really hope that comes across wrong rather than the author genuinely believing it.

There are certain types of trusts or annuities that you can set up. But because you're on SSI (as opposed to SSDI) it is important that you speak to an estate or disability attorney who can steer you in the right direction.  The question is going to be whether you want to save the money for later (trust or ABLE account) or whether you have needs that you want to take care of now. 

Eventually you are going to need to let SSA know. Along with an attorney you should speak to an SSI CR and they can explain the rules and the process. IIRC, when you get a windfall such as an inheritance you will get a certain amount of time to spend that money before it is counted against you. For the sake of argument, lets say that is 6 months. So for that 6 months you'd be exempt from the asset limit so you get a chance to spend that money on things that you need. 

When I was a representative payee I had a client, on SSI, that received about $30K. Due to the program she was in, we had to spend that money ASAP. We spent most of the money pre-paying things for her housing. We paid a year's worth of rent and paid a few thousand on her utilities so that way she had that ""credit"" built up. After that we bought her some new clothes, a new TV, etc. The benefit to that is that, then for year, she didn't have to worry about those bills and she could use that extra ""income"" each month towards more fun activities that came up throughout the year.

That's a direct translation of what we call the procedure in Sweden.

Lightened steering servo can be done in most vehicles, some are easier than others. In fact for some brands you can order this directly from the factory, others are done electronically and others mechanically. **Some brands however, are not even possible**, so be sure to check what applies to the car you want before buying a car to adapt. 

In fact that is great advice when it comes to all adaptations. **Always talk to your vehicle adaptation technician before buying a car.** Not only does the car have to suit your taste it must be compatible with you and the adaptations you are going to use. I mean, just because a swivel seat suits one person in let's say a Volkswagen Golf, doesn't mean that it will be a good car for anyone that needs a swivel seat. After all we're all different shapes and sizes. 

To make a steering wheel easier to handle you can use what is called a **steering device*, **wheel spinner** or **steering knob**. There might even be more names for this kind of product that I don't know about. They come in all shapes and sizes, from plain flat grips and round ball shaped, to more ergonomically correct flat-oval shapes as well as a stick like grip with pins that will keep your hand in place for those that have little to no grip strength. There are even some with electronic controls for various functions in the car. 

These are great ideas and I'll be sure to add it to our todo list.

I was diagnosed with JIA before 18. I started having mental health issues around the time I applied at 18 (my mother is a disability advocate, which made the process much more feasible). I was rejected twice, but was awarded at the last appeal with a judge. It was the mental health component and the chronicity of the rheumatoid arthritis (was actually fibro I later learned) that put me over the edge. It also was before Obamacare, so I needed health insurance to stay okay. 

I've been in voc rehab since being awarded, earning an education  that can allow me to work with my disability. Because I'm under voc rehab, I'm under the Ticket to Work program. As long as I'm making substantive progress, I don't get reevaluated. I feel like the situation would be similar if you are able to get SSI/SSDI. 

The nice thing on Ticket to Work is that it ""reserves"" your benefits in case you cannot work. There is a lot of complexity to it, but that's the gist of it. [Here's a link to the page](https://www.chooseworkttw.net/about/how-it-works/index.html) I'm about to start my career, hopefully. I'm scared about being able to sustain work, because I get months-long downspells sometimes and I've never worked (or been able to) 40 hours a week before. I'm hoping with extensive accommodations (multiple telework days, etc) I'll be able to figure it out.

Oh, and I think there is a reduction if you live with family, but only if you are claimed as a dependent (don't quote me on that one).

Let me know if you have more questions. 

By the way, have you ever gotten a diagnosis for your mental health? My docs always give me the excuse that my fibro prevents them from assessing a diagnosis. I definitely have a mood disorder, but I'm also highly engaged in ""magical thinking"", making me close to being schizotypal. It's frustrating to just tell people ""it's complicated"". ",,,1,0,0,

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1477354327,"That's a cute idea. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a wheelchair user who would take offense at that. Also, kudos for coming here to ask for advice and opinions.

But, just playing as the devil's advocate here: I think the danger you were running into is that you're implying a servile nature/requirement at the same time that you're implicating handicapped people.l, and It is always going to be clear that you're using a handicapped parking sign. Defacing one could be seen as inherently disrespectful (what I think the admin was getting at when she mentioned ""vandalism""). Changing the symbol into a king and asking everyone to serve this king (who is still obviously a wheelchair symbol) could be seen as mocking, or implying that disabled people aren't capable of doing things on their own. 

The problem is mainly the word ""serve,"" because it almost always has connotations of a hierarchy. If a wheelchair user were carrying the sign it would be fine, because it's self-deprecating humor. When an able bodied person carries it, it's seen as humor at the expense of a disadvantaged group, which rarely goes over well publicly.

Again, I don't think that there would be any serious issue from within the PWD community as long as your transformation of the figure is well done. I certainly wouldn't care, and the folks I know personally wouldn't. However, I can still see it from the perspective of an overly-cautious administrator, because, as I explained above, you're implication is that a group of people is less than someone else (the king), but you're using disability imagery to get the point across -- and the two just do not easily mesh well. Especially in a photo, which is what would be posted online, since photos do not convey the context or meaning behind what you've created. If I were the administrator, the transformation to King wouldn't make any difference to me. To cover my own ass I would require you to use a different sign or none at all.

Also, if it wasn't a school thing, you'd be perfectly fine. Wear it to comicon and no one cares -- if a picture of you winds up on tumblr and they decide they're offended, you're the only one who takes heat for it. But at a school event, the school is going to get hit hardest for allowing this if someone decides that they are offended and wants to make a fuss. Worst case scenario and a handicapped person in your school finds it offensive and finds out that it was pre-approved by an administrator, the school could even get hit with a Title IX suit over it (the suit wouldn't really go anywhere, but the district would probably be forced to settle and your administrator would be fired).

At the end of the day, sometimes the people who ""look out for"" people with disabilities can take more offense/be more sheltering that PWD would themselves. I think that's what's happening here. It's just a sign. It's a non-issue. But I wanted to explain why it could be offensive to those people out there who are looking to be offended. And there are plenty of them.


To be clear: I don't care, I think it'd be fine anywhere but in your school.",,,1,0,0,

I ordered Dragon in early October that year, it arrived on a Wednesday, &amp; the 10 page paper I handed in that following Monday was done entirely by voice, complex financial calculations and all - using Dragon.

Almost a decade later, Dragon is still providing me the means to use the computer- at home at least.

There are lots of helpful Dragon troubleshooting websites, here are just a few:

One of the best tips for checking recognition &amp; the microphone - under 'sound', turn on the 'listen to this device'.  This lets you hear what sounds Dragon is hearing- &amp; tells you if there's background inference, if the microphone is set to quiet or loud, or if the microphone's connection cord is broken  (this last one has been an issue for me 3+ times now).

Also, download the user's installation guide &amp; the administrator's guide.  These contain a lot of excellent information (&amp; are how I figured out and identified why Dragon wasn't functional at work).  

There are lots of settings, compatibility fixes, &amp; adjustments that can fix any errors &amp; issues people encounter.

 For seizures, most individuals will have some sort of postictal period that can last for a few hours to a few days. If that person was working they would likely have to miss work for at least 1-2 days following a seizure. So if you have seizures lets say, 2-3x per month that is unsustainable and you wouldn't be able to work because you'd only be at work 75% of the time. Now, contrast that with a person who has 2-3 seizures per month but they occur ALL on the same day (for whatever reason).

Ironically enough, the way that seizures are evaluated by SSA is based on their frequency (depending on the type - grand mal or petit/other). Generally they require a seizure at least once or twice per month (depending on the type) over the course of 4 months.

You must report Substantial Gainful Employment to the SSA. SGA is generally earning $1,130 or more per month.

After those 9 months, you enter the Extended Period of Eligibility where your benefits kick back in any month where your income drops below the SGA level. This period lasts for 36 months (minus the initial 9 months I just talked about). During this time you will not need to submit any new applications for disability.

After that, if you are receiving MediCare, those benefits will continue for 93 months after the initial 9 months of the Trial Work Period. If, during this time, your employment was to end you can apply for disability again but it will be expedited so that you only spend about 4-6 weeks waiting for an answer and you don't have to resubmit documentation of your disability.

Hope this helps.

In terms of wheelchairs, that is a really quick turn around. Then again, the one chair is pretty cheap.

&gt;He made a few adjustments to the arm and head rests and the feet plate. I drove around for a bit and got a little dizzy but I thought it might have just been because that chair is significantly faster than my current wheelchair. 

Ok it seems like the tech did a fine job in terms of tweaks. The speed could definitely could be a factor. When I went from a [rear wheel](http://admin.selfcarehome.com/images/products/3GAR_400_A.jpg) to a [mid wheel](http://admin.selfcarehome.com/images/products/5906b6ce-f9b.jpg) I had some dizziness for about a week, maybe a bit less..


&gt;I thought I could get used to it but after using my new chair for a day, I got even more dizzy. 

You may him to turn down the speed. I don't know the specifics about your chair, but you can fine turn the top speed and acceleration for forward/backwards, independently from those in regards to turning on mine. I have it: pushing the joystick all the way forward, allows me to hit top speed as fast as possible; anything less than full forward, is a gradual increase (3 or 4 seconds vs 10), and the sensitivity is mid/high (7 out of 10, I think). Turning is another story, a light push vs full on is the same speed, speed is capped to about 25%, and the sensitivity is reduced some. It took us a few visits to get it correct.",,,2,0,0,

Typically we have clients come for an orientation and paperwork meeting.  Afterwards we talk about employment goals and set up a trial work experience with a local employer.  An evaluator goes out with the client to assess their work skills.  Upon completion of the trial work experience your assessment is reviewed and depending on your performance results you will either be recommended more supplemental programs to aid employment or be refered to job placement.

I have had too many crying old ladies tell me they just wanted to die because life wasn't anything any more, and it was much more noticeable in those who needed extensive physical care. Some people are lucky enough to keep their physical health into old age and keep up hobbies, many do not. Additionally so many people now have very little saved for retirement which makes life so much harder.

I think you are right about the records and one thing we did that put my daughter's case over the top was to represent her seizures by category on a calendar style sheet. Out of desperation to try to convey how many seizures she had every day in a visual format so that the judge could instantly grasp how debilitating they were on a daily basis. Our attorney Paralegal told us that this image was most likely the sole reason she got approved instantly once the dr saw it. She had a myriad of records and imaging and such but when judges see so many cases of text and sifting through them, I can imagine they get bogged down. The visual thing gives you a snap shot and the records back it up. 
If anyone wants to see what we put together, I can upload an image later. 
The other thing we learned is that (you are correct). Even if you fill out forms, sometimes drs don't respond to them or someone drops the ball on the other end. It's a very good idea to have your records in general if you have a chronic issue that has to be treated. All of these records can show how much you are having to go through. My daughter learned a valuable lesson abt this. 
Also, the communications she gets from SS were like an avalanche because it involved Social security, medicare, Medicaid premiums, pharmacy plans. We had to get a 3 ring binder and separate them out in order to grasp what was happening. It's still daunting but it helps to catalog it all. 
My daughter has to live with this GD epilepsy forever apparently and she can't live a normal life because of it since age 11. 
The other note I have since I am blathering on is that when my father had dementia, the process for all of these govt agencies is mind bogglingly complex and it's hard to navigate even if you have all your faculties. If it's new to you (like my daughter) or overwhelming because of illness, it stinks because you almost need a lawyer to understand it all.

Because its either keep trying for SSI and be homeless, living in my car with 190 in food stamps every month and no way to cook food, or move in with my parents, make my mental health even worse, and go back to my old job or get a new one, both would be equally bad so probably back to my old one. And then what? Just keep spiraling, getting worse and worse, hoping constantly for a miracle to happen? Cuz then SSI will 100% deny me forever saying I'm ""capable of working"".

Don't take this the wrong way or as an attack on you, but you used my absolute most hated term, wheelchair-bound.

Excuse the sarcasm, it's not your fault. It's just a very derogatory way it has been phrased for far too long. I find using the term handicapped, which has been much less politically correct for a long time, now, is still quite common in the United States. Less so here in Canada but still combined with certain terms like handicap parking spaces.

You make such a superb point about a wheelchair user being the symbol for disability. I don't know what the appropriate symbol is but it is very lacking if you were to try to incorporate something like sensory disability or people like Josh Sundquist, an incredibly able amputee.

There is no hard set rule that says we can't cease them though, so it does still happen. The longer they have been on benefits we just have to have a stronger case that they should be ceased. The older someone is as somewhat of a same rule as ""time on the rolls"" does. But also, remember that it is easier to be allowed benefits the older you are and those same rules are used for a CDR, so that is also a reason. 

The older someone gets we do give them longer review periods (so instead of 3 they get 7) because the cessation chances are low.

There's a scale you can look up to see how many credits you need to qualify for SSDI. Google ""work credits eligible for SSDI."" It will come up in one form or another. Basically at 28 you need 20, and by 50 you need 30. You can earn 4 credits a year and have to make at least around $5k a year to earn those. Your eventual SSDI check will depend on the average you earned over the time you earned your credits. 

There is another program called SSI which is need based and requires absolutely no work history. It's usually significantly less money (being married you might only receive $450 a month or something). It does make you eligible for Medicaid immediately in almost every case, and qualifies you for food assistance and housing assistance etc. 

There is a program within that program called ""ticket to work"" where you can work for a year or so and not be kicked off benefits if you feel like you are close to a credit limit, but not quite there. This could be a possibility for your wife.

Your lawyer may not like this option. Filing for SSI is essentially a new application. It would restart the clock I believe and also, since it is a smaller pot of money, your lawyer gets a much smaller cut when you get it.

Outside of conditions expected to improve quickly (e.g., a broken leg), Social Security regulations provide that a review should be scheduled every three to seven years based on the nature of your impairment. [See here](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-1590.htm). 

If you return to work, that can trigger a review earlier than scheduled.

* Work

If you qualify for SSDI, you get a [trial work period](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/ssdi-only-employment-supports.htm) where you get to work without any negative impact on your benefits for several months regardless of your income. Your trial work period ends only if you make more than a certain threshold ($810 per month in 2016) for 9 months total in a 60-month period. Social Security may cease your benefits after that if you starting engaging in substantial gainful activity (i.e., income over $1,130.00 per month in 2016) or they may start a review to determine if they should cease your benefits for medical improvement. If your benefits are ceased due to your income, you will enter an extended period of eligibility that makes it easy to re-initiate benefits if your income drops below substantial gainful activity levels.

If you only qualify for SSI, Social Security uses a formula to reduce your monthly based on your wages. The formula does not count the first $65.00 of income and reduces your benefit by $1.00 for every $2.00 earned. Working at substantial gainful activity levels will result in the cessation of benefits; there is no trial work period or extended period of eligibility.

There are also some separate work incentives that provide additional rules or exceptions to the above. [See here](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-work-ussi.htm).

* Living with relatives.

Living with relatives can decrease your monthly benefit SSI. Basically if family is providing you a benefit you'd otherwise have to pay for (e.g., rent or food), Social Security will consider that in-kind support and reduce your monthly SSI benefit.

Living with relatives should have no impact on SSDI benefits, though.",,,5,0,0,

As for the other stuff I said, if you get on disability after 18 but before 21, you are considered an adult disabled child until you get married, and you qualify for SSDI (work based disability) on your parents accounts if they're dead, disabled, or on social security retirement. If you are over 21, you only qualify for SSI, which is supposed to supplement some other income, and if you legit can't work at all, you're kinda just fucked, because it's not supposed to be a livable amount. Trying to support me and my carer on just over $700 a month sucks ass.

Hopefully you will still have a working cell phone; if you can give them a mailing address of a local friend/family member where you can pick up your mail. If there is no one local a lot of times homeless shelters will allow you to put their mailing address down and collect your mail there. With SSA knowing that your mailing address isn't all that reliable that lets the DDS examiner know that the best way to contact you is via phone. Normally we send out letters/forms for information but if I know a person is homeless I will always call to get the information over the phone; it is less time and more likely to be successful. 

Your case will be flagged as ""homeless"". It won't necessarily change the decision but it will afford you some additional case protections against ""failure"" denials. I know you've filed before, so you remember those ADL forms and perhaps you went to a consultative exam or two. If you're homeless they will make sure to not schedule the exam too quickly (to allow you time to get the information), will give you extra phone calls, and get a third party involved to make sure you make the appointment. Even with the extra protections homeless individuals have the highest ""failure"" rate just because SSA can't get in touch with them. 

If possible, try to stay within the same state, even if you are moving between places to stay. If you stay somewhere for more than 60 days you're considered a resident of that state and they have to transfer your claim which will slow it down. 

Again though, when you apply tell them you are homeless and then once the DDS gets your case I would reiterate it to them as well (in case the field office didn't flag it correctly). SSA will go out of their way to help (if they can) but you just have to let them know what is going on. Depending on your financial status (which, if you're being homeless is probably poor) you might qualify for ""Dire Need"" status which will also speed your claim up a bit. ",,,6,0,0,

1) Fold up stroller, hold baby and sit down elsewhere.
2) If stroller does not fold up, put stroller on bus wherever it fits, hold baby and sit down elsewhere.

Most of his patients are middle-aged and suffer from random aches and pains.  I can ask if he knows someone who can help me adjust the chair.  Thank you for the suggestion!,,,1,0,0,

If a person decides to appeal the cessation they have the option to elect for benefit continuation during the appeal. If you do elect this benefit you do sign a form saying that, if your appeal is denied, you have to pay that money back. 

That is why OPs wife owes 18 months. Well, that or she committed fraud and/or hid work activity, but the benefit continuation is still most likely. ",,,3,0,0,

You should try and keep that account open because I at least get my ssdi through direct deposit. Forward your mail to a cheap P.O. box so you can still get paperwork.

I have 4 (one being an expert) physicians all saying I am a danger to myself and others if forced to work. I have been to a hearing judge and this has been going on almost 4 years now. I am a single mother w/ 2 kids and would of been homeless but was taken in by a friend. I have written to my Congressman and Governor and I even wrote to the White House. They do not care. Their goal is to drag our process on for so long that we give up. Do you know that 80%, YES 80% of the homeless people in downtown San Diego are people who either suffers from a mental or physical disability or is a disabled Veteran that ended up homeless because they could NOT survive the wait time of the SSDI years and years process. They end up homeless and usually on drugs. It's sad. It's really sad because I know people who have never worked a day in their life that was not born in our country and they get SSI or SSDI, I worked as a HR administrator for over 20 years and when I became sick, I just wanted to die, still do. They make me feel like I'm worth more to my kids if I were dead. Crazy part, Social Security got $800 a month from me and my pay checks for 23 years. Assholes. DONT GIVE UP, and get a social security attorney NOW. Don't wait. Go with a private local one from your town, not the ones that advertise with 1-800 numbers.

With her attitude towards me getting on disability being heavily towards the negative, frequently if not every time it's brought up saying I'm never going to get on it and my age makes it impossible because they'll see it as me being so young that I will eventually just snap out of it as if it's not actually as serious as it is. I genuinely am afraid that my therapist doesn't really have my back and that they don't genuinely see or believe just how severe the depression is even though I try to be as clear about it as possible. She always subtly gives the pull yourself up by your bootstraps speech not in so many words but practically the same thing. So if they go mostly off of her records I'm afraid that I might be fucked. Although there is record of me being put on long-term medical leave from my current job because of the depression and anxiety but I don't know if that will help or not. I've been going to her since May of last year.

The other thing that I'm afraid of along with the not embellishing things is it so bad that even when I hear myself explain just how bad it is I feel like people are just going to not believe me as if there's no way it could be that bad. Which I guess could come from most of the people in my life not seeing my illness as severe as it is.",,,1,0,0,
