The difficulty is that we are a highly variable population and voting trends amongst people with disabilities aren't homogenous. While many of us tend to be supportive of government programs such as ssdi, snap, tanf, etc., which trends democrat, a lot of other issues are more sticky and our votes trend along with whatever other racial, religious or regional groups we belong to. 

For example, an anti-abortion voter with a disability is still more likely to vote for an anti-abortion candidate over a pro-choice candidate regardless of whether the pro-choice candidate's platform is better overall on disability issues.

To be honest, calling ahead has never helped in my case -  unfortunately. There seems to be some kind of loss of communication between the people you call and the people who are at the airport. I really don't know why. This is definitely something that could be improved though. 

For me, the biggest help would be for people at the airport to be able to communicate well with me and appreciate that I have a good understanding of my chair and my body. Sometimes it can be hard because the people working these jobs are hired for their physical strength but they may not be able to speak the language well (this bit is purely my personal experience in the UK, may be different elsewhere) or communicate well or they think that all disabled passengers and all chairs/mobility equipment are the same. I've been in situations where I've repeatedly said things and given tips and been ignored, only to result in damage to my chair or even unsafe/damaging handling of my own body - not out of malice, purely out of a communication barrier and a lack of understanding that one size does not fit all. Also, airline staff often don't know the regulations in place surrounding disabled passengers and on top of this each airport has its own set of unique policies. So in the end, even though you try really hard as a disabled person to organize and communicate about the situation and be proactive, the system is such a chaotic mess that all of that just gets lost. 

Maybe a consultation between airlines, airports and wide range of disabled people might help to identify weak points in the process? That's probably what I would suggest.",1,,1,0,0,

When he goes to the ""Savage Land"" (An island with dinosaurs and crap where mutants lose their powers) he is able to walk again because his second body was physically fine but his mind did not process this due to the Shadow King injuring him on the astral plane, meaning when his powers are gone the block is also gone. I assume they were referencing these events (albeit poorly) in the movie.

Speaking of comic book characters that I felt were good representations of the disabled, Oracle was the wheelchair bound Barbra Gordon (previously Batgirl) turned hacker/catch all resource for the Justice League and Batman.

The initial claim level and reconsideration level (the first step of appeals in the vast majority of states) are fairly easy to navigate yourself if you normally can take care of your own business affairs. Only if you appeal to a judge should you get a lawyer; anything prior to that you are just giving away your money."" 

**This is really, really bad advice!**   I'm a lawyer with practice concentrated in disability law and spend most of my time trying to help individuals, like yourself try to prove that the medical and/or mental health conditions they have are ""severe impairments"" such that they should qualify them as being ""disabled"" under all of the complex rules and regulations used by the Social Security Administration in weighing,evaluating , and deciding such cases.  Thus, unless you are familiar with all of the acronyms, definitions of words and terms, rules and regulations, policies, procedures, etc. used by the Social Security Administration when deciding whether a person's claim of being ""disabled"" has any merit you should definitely not attempt to apply for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration by yourself!

Contrary to the assertion,""[Y]ou are just giving away your money,"" a lawyer handling a person's disability claim before the Social Security Administration does not get paid unless the client gets paid and awarded past-due benefits.  Social Security Administration rules specify that 25% of past-due benefits are withheld from an award to you of past-due benefits for the purpose of hiring a lawyer, so it really only makes sense to get a lawyer to handle your case from the start.  

&gt;""The initial claim level and reconsideration level (the first step of appeals in the vast majority of states) are fairly easy to navigate yourself if you normally can take care of your own business affairs. . . . ""

**The foregoing statement is false and misleading.**   Be leery of anyone, who tries to tell you can apply by yourself and don't need an attorney helping you.  The SSI/SSDI Examiner, who posted it is paid by the Social Security Disability Determination Services (DDS), and after all is trained to read though the application paperwork people submit and discard as many files as possible into the ""rejection"" bin,  Only a few get set aside by the Social Security Examiners for further review by their supervisors in which submitted paperwork and medical records call for taking a second look.  

With this in mind make sure that the lawyer you previously talked to is actually willing to sit down with you and actually fill out all of the needed application forms to start the case and prepare answers to investigatory questionnaires you will likely be sent in the mail as the case proceeds.   There are many lazy lawyers, who suck up the false propaganda like the SSI/SSDI Examiner posted here and will tell you to, ""Just fill out the application using the Social Security Administration's Internet website, and if you get denied come back and I'll help you later if you have to see the judge.""  There is noting more frustrating than meeting potential clients who have tried to fill out their own applications and evidentiary documents, or had someone (sister, next door neighbor, aid at nursing home, mental health counsellor , etc.) who was not an attorney trying to ""help"" them.

The simple fact is that lay people simply are not going to be familiar with the sources of the rules and regulations the Social Security Administration set forth in the POMS (Program Operations Manual System), which are applied in deciding disability cases.  In fact a large number, if not a majority of the people I meet, who have been denied after trying to apply themselves don't even know the difference between Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and with the way your inquiry is worded (asking only about SSI) makes me suspect you would also appreciate a lengthy detailed explanation about the two benefit programs and not the quick, ""SSI is a welfare program,"" answer clerks working at the local Social Security office spit out for people who come in or call on the phone and ask about applying for disability benefits.  Understanding the concepts of your ""Alleged Onset Date,"" knowing the ""Last Date of Insured Coverage,"" and identifying that point in time when you no longer had earnings indicative of carrying on ""Substantial Gainful Activity in our Economy,"" are all critical in filing an application that will be approved at the initial stage and by yourself without prior experience and understanding how these factors operate you are only setting yourself up for a denial.  Keep in mind, that the examiners at the Disability Determination Services (DDS) are on the lookout for every little reason to deny you benefits.  

Finally, as I already mentioned, make sure the lawyer you are using, not only fills out the application forms, but stays involved and helps you fill out all questionnaires mailed out to you afterwards.  If you get told, ""Just fill it out yourself and mail it in!""  Fire that lawyer immediately and quickly look for a new legal counsel!  A large number of lawyers supposedly practicing in field of Social Security Disability take the attitude everyone gets denied when they first apply, so it isn't worth my time doing much until the case is up for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.  That attitude is simply not true!  In the past month I have had four clients all approved at the beginning  application level and I don't think any one of them were fluent with the process and familiar enough with evidence that needed to be submitted that they would have ever been approved without a wait of two years for a hearing.

I have every ability to separate emotion from the facts and I realize that is my job. But sometimes claimant's shoot themselves in the foot and I try to help them NOT do that. 

I am not a doctor, a social worker, or a therapist. So to say that my comment is like asking a claimant not to cry in their doctor's office is unfair don't you think? My job is to process as many disability claims as possible. Nationally last year SSA processed over 2.6 MILLION disability claims. So while you are only concerned about your disability claim we have to process hundreds of cases at a time.  If I allowed each person to sit and cry to me on the phone for 10-15min about how their car got repossessed or their cat died or their marriage is falling apart I wouldn't get anything else done. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't just hang up on people but I will redirect the conversation back to its original intent. EVERYBODY who applies for disability is going through the same struggles so (warning: cynical comment coming) calling me to cry about it is not going to make you claim go any faster or take pity on you and give you benefits when you don't deserve it.

If you don't have many medical records, or medical records that tell analysts what they need to know, the analyst will have to send you to a full physical exam. We cannot get a sense of how healthy you are without medical records, and if you have not been to a doctor - for whatever reason - we don't have any information to go on. We send you to a doctor to get a complete physical. SSA does not do any invasive testing, so we would not get blood testing or anything similar.

A physical exam would tell the analyst if you can sit. If you can squat. If you have the range of motion and capacity to lift the weight necessary to perform movement necessary for a light range of work. Remember, social security is looking to see if you can do any work, including sedentary work. A physical exam tells us what your body can do. Without medical records, which is why you were send to the exam in the first place, we are limited in our information.

 I'm guessing you have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I know this syndrome is very painful, and chronic. However, it does not meet any of social security's listings, nor does it equal any. According to SSA standards, you would be capable of sedentary or light work, depending on records. I know this does not seem...right, as you are often in a lot of pain. But social security standards are strict, and the analyst has to abide by them. I hope that makes sense.",1,,1,0,0,

1b6d1d2d-56b7-4f3e-9c59-3b4b06713228,1453939197,"Personally I think the issue with the whole 'inspirational' thing largely comes from what it implies.

A person that's inspirational is someone who's achieved something that you thought was extremely difficult, or even impossible. They have inspired you by showing you that 'this can be done'. A civil rights activist who puts their own life at risk is inspirational for the bravery they show. Someone who managed to work their way up from poverty to a wealthy and comfortable life is inspirational for their work ethic or creativity. Someone who climbs an imposing mountain is inspirational for their physical prowess and tenacity.

Which leads us to the question, if you've only just met someone five minutes ago, what could you possibly be finding inspirational about them? All you know about them is one fact, that they exist.

In my view that's what makes calling a disabled person inspirational such a back-handed compliment. You're telling them that the fact that they haven't keeled over and died, that they simply haven't given up on life, is so unlikely, such an achievement, in your eyes that you find it inspiring.

Last year, I went through hell and back all because I moved from one area to another for professional &amp; educational reasons. I had to be reassessed to qualify for funding for the 24 hour carer I need (to complete tasks like wiping my ass and showering me, fun things). The cost of this care? Almost £900 a week - not money I have. The new area didn't give me funding for 4 months. I was told wonderful things by my social worker such as ""have you considered institutionalized care?"" and ""what about if you wore a diaper at night so that you wouldn't need an overnight carer?"". I was lucky my carer at the time stood by me for those 4 months. I was lucky not to end up ""ending myself"" because I was made to feel so completely worthless and I had a complete and total mental breakdown. I was lucky I didn't end up homeless.

When I tried to tell this experience to people on reddit (in other subs) and when a journalist I knew tried to write about it, the vast majority of people didn't believe me or thought I was trying to cheat the system or thought I wasn't worth the funding anyway. You know, because needing money for some random to wipe my butt 4 times a day is the way I'd go about it if I wanted to ""cheat the system"". The anger I feel towards these people, and the media in particular for doing the dirty work of politicians who want to spread this misinformation (putting it politely) is enormous and overwhelming at times - to the point that it can ruin my whole day if I come across something like that article you shared.

The saddest thing of all is that sometimes the feeling of worthlessness is so great that I start to fall into the same trap myself and I'm sure others do too - I start to bring up the things I've done to contribute to society. I've pushed myself so hard to be useful to society, to prove to people that I deserve this welfare I'm getting - sometimes to the detriment of my health. Even though I'm proud of my achievements, I have to keep reminding myself that all that isn't relevant. We should be treated with respect and dignity and we should be allowed to access our independence regardless of what our ""output"" is. 

I think you're not at all alone here and it's important to keep remembering that. Most of us are tired of pushing against a system that monetizes our worth and our life and that provides no opportunities or just the illusion of an opportunity for some better state of existence.

You don't need to take any medical records as SSA sends them all your background info and records. Just make sure you have your ID, a current med list, and any glasses, canes, prosthetics, etc (if it's a physical exam)

My best advice is to just be honest. How people get themselves into trouble is they try to ""act"" disabled and what that does is create inconsistencies in your record. Inconsistencies are what sink disability claims. Just be honest about your conditions and you'll be fine. 

And for the love of God make sure you go to the exams. When you get the appt letter call SSA to confirm (and send back and confirmation paperwork), put the appt in your phone, tell a friend, write it on your hand. If something comes up and you can't make it (car trouble etc) call BOTH the doctor and SSA. If you just don't show up and they don't hear from you they'll likely just deny your claim. ",6,,6,0,0,

The main reason for this is because the majority feels that ""hearing impaired"" implies that we are broken as a whole, rather than just our hearing. The loss of our hearing does not necessarily put us at a huge disadvantage, rather it gives us a lot of advantages and opportunities that we can embrace. ""Deaf and hard of hearing"" accurately targets the disability in mind and it stops right there; we are deaf, which means we can't hear and that's it.

when you apply for disability you are essentially telling the government that you are physically/mentally incapable of working and supporting yourself. That is the inherent statement you are making when  you sign the application. Any behavior that you do that contradicts that will affect your application. Think about it from the government point of view--

* if she works 25 hours per week what is stopping her from working 40?
* if she spends her days volunteering at an animal shelter or at a church why could she not do these same activities in a paid capacity?
* if she is going to college that implies that she is bettering her employment prospects and doesn't consider herself disabled.

Based on the little information provided it sounds like she does have a 'curable' condition that she may be able to return to work at some point. She may not end up qualifying for disability.

Or, she can keep doing what she is doing (school, working part time, etc) and 2 years from now she could be in a whole different position. 

At this point I would focus on figuring out how to get her that surgery. Even if she does get on disability Medicare won't kick in for 2 years. Has she applied for Medicaid?

Edit 2: [I drew you guys a picture of the 3 ways I am in bed with the computer.](http://imgur.com/1cwd2C6) No. 1 and No 3 are most of the time. No. 2 never lasts more than 3 or 4 minutes at a stretch. No. 3 is the killer on the computer as everything's totally sideways it's usually resting on the magsafe power cord. ",4,,4,0,0,

I recommend remembering that most children who get seriously ill or have major problems like yours typically get better. There's lots of stuff out there written by other parents who have been through similar situations - likely also forums and other support groups online.  I know this sounds overly simplistic, but this kind of thinking and research helped me conquer my terror about flying.

If I could, I would share with you the (complete) tale of friends whose baby was born 6 months ago with a defective heart. Part of it was barely working. Worse, he kept developing infections and having feeding problems, and he was touch-and-go for a while. His parents, like you, had moved into the hospital to be with him.  I'm happy to say that when he was 3 months they were able to give him a new heart and they're all now living at home.  There are still a lot of hurdles, but his prognosis is excellent.

Lastly, I leave you with this little pearl: A friend of mine got pregnant while she was going through medical school. She was at that point where you spend 2-3 months in a variety of departments to try out specialties.  She was 6 months pregnant when she was working in the neonatal unit.  Everyone asked, ""How can you handle that when you're about to have your first baby?""

She said, ""There are some real tragedies but in the vast majority of cases I've seen, things work out in the end.  It's a big comfort knowing that health care is at the point where we can save the lives of kids that 20 years ago would have been doomed.""  (And that story is almost 20 years old, so...)",3,,3,0,0,

Stay away from pull up style diapers unless your wetting is light, they just don't hold very much. The kinds that tape up on the sides are much better, especially the plastic backed kind. They are also better because you can change in a stall without having to take your pants off.

If Tranquility ATN Briefs aren't absorbant enough for you then you should go to one of the more expensive premium brand adult diapers like Abena or Molicare.

For someone younger to be approved, he/she must not be able to sustain competitive work, meaning he/she must not be able to do a desk job, or he/she must meet one of SSA's disability listings. It is difficulty to do either of these things, which is why so many younger people are denied. 

Analysts are supposed to take all conditions into account, meaning they are supposed to look at how all your conditions *together* effect your ability to work. You do have many conditions that are difficulty for analysts because they are umbrella conditions. Fibromyalgia, for example, is a general condition used for chronic pain. Most reports of fibromyalgia are subjective, meaning they are the patient's reports of pain. It is difficult for the doctor to assess these types of conditions.

Where in the process are you? Have you been denied once? If so, I recommend filing for a reconsideration and hiring an attorney. A reconsideration means that another examiner will look at your claim to make sure no mistakes were made. An attorney can have your doctors submit paperwork with their opinions about your disability- a ""medical source statement"". These can be very helpful to your claim. An attorney can be helpful if your reconsideration claim is denied, because then you can proceed to the ALJ (administrative law judge). This is where many decisions are overturned.

If a person argued that women aren't punctual because it took them longer to get back from the bathroom or that the expense of installing a women's bathroom was a burden on society, that would be ridiculous. Similarly, a person who uses a wheelchair needs a ramp to enter a building. Using a wheelchair is not impressive and shouldn't inspire pity. It's normal for those people.

It is not the job of those professionals to express their own personal feelings or perceptions about disability, whether or not a life is worthwhile and whether or not a group of people need to be ""eliminated"". That's what people tend to object to. 

Incidentally, I say this as someone working on congenital malformations in the public health domain. The language and mentality surrounding Downs Syndrome is some of the most skewed and loaded. All health problems and disabilities pose a ""burden"" to health systems and many pose a ""burden"" to social care systems but that shouldn't be the deciding factor in medical or social care.

Now if you're the guy in the next lane over and you see me paddling away, going farther than you are, you might reasonably conclude that 'wow, I thought I was kinda tired but look at him go -- and he's only got one leg! That's crazy. You know what? I'll do another lap and get faster.' That person has just been inspired in a perfectly natural, non-offensive way.

I think a *vast* majority of the time, this is what people mean -- but on an emotional level. Someone had a bad day at the office and they were grumbling on the phone about having to go to the store and pick up milk, but look at that girl with... is that a guide dog? And she's out her buying her own milk too? 'Man, and there I was complaining about it, too. I'm such a jerk -- I don't appreciate the things I have. Screw it. I'll buy flowers, too, do something nice.' That person has been inspired.

Why do I suppose this is the norm? Because I'm pretty sure that most people in general are more self-centered than others-centered. They are not doing complicated mental-math about your lot in life -- they're comparing themselves to you and noticing that 'themselves' could be better. Yeah, okay, sure, that implies that you must be at a disadvantage somehow but *aren't we though?* I will never run as fast as I did when I had two legs, never swim as fast, I'm disabled and that's unfortunate and fucking whatever, moving on.

While I agree with some of the statements made in the article -- like let's focus on bringing awareness to accessibility -- I don't agree with generalizing the threshold for what is deemed to be extraordinary. It's a disservice to the disabled people among us that can't ""just get out of bed and go to work in the morning.""

For example, if you saw the way I get out of bed in the morning (it's literally 100+ different small muscle movements and shifts and rolls and oomphs and twists and pushes and pulls) you might want to call my getting out of bed pretty fucking extraordinary. I mean there are times when I am doing it and I'm like, ""There's no way I should be able to get out of bed myself. This is amazing."" 

I'm not looking to be praised for getting out of bed in the morning, but if someone finds that amazing, then dang, that's fine with me. I don't give a crap what sort of pity-mechanism goes on in an able-bodied person's head (if at all). Because if it helps someone else with MD figure out a way to get out of bed in the morning, then that's even better than great. Put it on a poster. I am willing to accept a percentage of people ""feeling sorry"" for me if it means another (admittedly smaller) percentage of people will be moved to do something positive. Perhaps the pity is a casualty of actually having an impact on the people who need it.

We shouldn't forget about those disabled people who NEED this inspiration to improve their lives. Sort of like, ""Wow, if she/he can do that, then so can I!"" Personally, I was tremendously inspired by this wheelchair tennis player who doesn't look like he should be able to hold a stick, much less a racket. If you talk to him, he doesn't think what he's doing is that extraordinary. But to me, I was like, ""Holy shit, if he can do that, so can I!"" And starting to play wheelchair tennis changed my life. It's funny because maybe he wouldn't want to be on a poster, and maybe the author of this article would say, ""No way, that's inspiration porn!"" but why take away the possibility of changing lives?

And isn't it also a bit inconsistent to be all, ""Don't pity me because I can't climb the stairs to get somewhere!"" as if to say, ""Oh it's not a big deal..."" but then get all upset when there are stairs somewhere? Let's face it, we have a struggle. For some of us, the struggle is navigating last steps to the place we want to go. For others, it's getting out of bed. Everyone has their Mt. Everest. Let's not diminish the height of someone else's mountain just because some of us have already climbed it.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1453738647,"there are going to be 2 aspects to your eligibility: financial and medical. 

Lets start with financial: if you are actively working for the church and making more than 1090/month then no you will not qualify for SSI/SSDI.  However, if the church continues to pay you without you actually working then SSA doesn't consider that to be ""earned income"" and you would be eligible to file for SSDI. But, if the church does continue to give you that money I *think* that will knock you out of eligibility for SSI as that will still be too much money coming in per month. SSI eligibility also considers all your assets (stocks, savings, property) as well as any income your spouse brings in. 

I would note: certain occupations like clergy and self-employed people are a little trickier when it comes to what counts as work activity. There are different sets of rules that even I'm not 100% clear on. For example, your church could only be paying you 1000/mo but if you are still performing church duties for 40hrs/week they can consider that to be ""substantial gainful work activity"". This is most commonly seen with self-employment or people who own their own company. They essentially will try to ""pay"" themselves less than SGA while still working full time hoping then to draw on SSDI benefits. SSA is really cracking down on this currently. 

On to the medical: that you won't really know until you apply. You are young and that will work against you but it is not impossible. You have pretty significant cardiac conditions and you could probably make the argument that you wouldn't be able to sustain a full 40 hr work week. Do you know what your current Ejection Fraction (EF) is? That is the metric that a lot of disability examiners will use for cardiac conditions.

Ultimately there is no harm in applying for benefits. The worst that they are going to tell you is that you don't qualify (either financially or medically). You mentioned a lawyer in your original post; I would recommend not getting a lawyer at this point. The initial claim level and reconsideration level (the first step of appeals in the vast majority of states) are fairly easy to navigate yourself if you normally can take care of your own business affairs. Only if you appeal to a judge should you get a lawyer; anything prior to that you are just giving away your money. ",1,,1,0,0,

Technically, the EU regulations state that they cannot take the chair from you before you go to the gate unless you're OK with that. For someone like me, who has a specially designed chair and a severe disability, I simply can't give up my chair before reaching the gate. However, some airports don't have the provisions needed to get the chair directly to the baggage hold from the gate so sometimes you have to give it up at check in (very inconvenient) - this violates the EU regulation I described above.

Once I arrive at the gate, my wheelchair battery is disconnected and the chair is taken from me to be stowed away. I'm lifted onto a manual aisle chair which two people then load onto the plane. I'm then lifted from the manual aisle chair into a regular plane seat. 

So, yeah, there can be a lot more of a process. Of course this may be a lot less for someone who is a lot more mobile.",1,,1,0,0,

however, i did find a place just a block away which is a smaller house but on a larger property. the house next door is fully renovated, but the smaller house is still in very good condition, and the smaller house is going for about half as much as the house next door. if i can get the first time homebuyer loan with 5% downpayment assistance, i'll have a slightly higher interest rate, but it will help cover closing costs and all of that.

I've been told not to bother getting SSI without another disability on top of my hearing loss because it's supposedly very difficult for the deaf and hard of hearing to get it.

I have undiagnosed mental issues, and no money to see a therapist.  I went to the social security office for help, they basically gave me the cold shoulder, saying they can't help me unless I find some way to borrow money from someone for my therapy (so I can get diagnosed) and to pay for my hearing tests (6 year old hearing test says I have 60dB across the board but word discrimination is 64%).

After I do that, THEN the office will send a doctor free of charge to re-verify everything.  We couldn't get the money in time and we ended up losing our apartment and 90% of our stuff.  We had to move out of state and crash with my husband's parents (I'm the disabled one, he isn't).


Surprise, surprise after we moved here, the state cut funding for all welfare.  For me to get medicare here, I have to be working part time.  Hard to do with broken and weak hearing aids.  Vocab Rehabilitation gave me the cold shoulder and refused to help as well.

Husband and I don't have jobs yet, I had high hopes that after we move, I could get SSI, that the welfare office or social security office would have more resources or something.  Nope.

**What happens to your right to Social Security payments when you are outside the United States**

If you are a U.S. citizen, you may receive your Social Security payments outside the United States as long as you are eligible.

However, there are some countries to which we cannot send payments. [Those countries are Cuba, North Korea, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.]

**What you need to do to protect your right to benefits**

When you live outside the United States, periodically we will send you a questionnaire. Your answers will help us figure out if you still are eligible for benefits. Return the questionnaire to the office that sent it as soon as possible. If you do not, your payments will stop.

In addition to responding to the questionnaire, notify us promptly about changes that could affect your payments. If you fail to report or deliberately make a false statement, you could be penalized by a fine or imprisonment. You also may lose some of your payments if you do not report changes promptly.

**Things you must report** 

Listed below are things you must report to Social Security. An explanation of each is given on the
following pages [let me know if you want any of the explanations copied]:

Change of address; Work outside the United States; If you return to work or your disability improves; Marriage; Divorce or annulment; Adoption of a child; Child leaves the care of a spouse or surviving spouse; Child nearing age 18 is a full-time student or disabled; Death; Inability to manage funds; Deportation or removal from the United States; Changes in parental circumstances; and Eligibility for a pension from work not covered by Social Security.

**How to report**

You can report by contacting us in person, by mail or by telephone. If you live in the British Virgin Islands, Canada or Samoa, you can send your report to the nearest U.S. Social Security office.

In all other countries, send your report to the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate. Visit www.socialsecurity.gov/foreign for a complete list of offices. If you find it easier to contact us by mail, send your report by airmail to:

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1453061950,"&gt;I am trialing some high pressure tyres now and enjoy the speed but curbs are a bit tricky now. Are they worth the speed with the rough ride?

I'm not sure what tyres are in your pic above, are they solid or pneumatic? I personally do not like solid tyres. They are more durable and obviously don't need pumped up but they're so much heavier and bumpier to me they're not worth it. Remember if you don't like the pressure in a pneumatic tyre you can tinker with it a bit, there's a range printed on the side of the tyre so you can experiment with the PSI until you find what suits you. A lower PSI will give a smoother ride. The width and texture of your tyres will also affect the ride, I have slim tyres for nice weather/mostly indoors, slightly chunkier ones for harsher weather, and want to get a good knobbly pair for hiking etc - think mountain bike tyres. I love going fast so I built up my core and learned to move with the chair wherever possible, over bumps, round corners and so on. If you can manage it, a strong core makes a world of difference in an active chair.

&gt; What setup for the rims do people use? I have my rims in as tight as I can to the wheels and push off both rim and tyre. Am I unusual here?

My rims are about an inch off the wheel, I like to be able to wrap my whole hand round the rim and only brush the edge of the tyre. Some people will do what you do, some have no rims at all. It's just personal preference. I don't like having my hands on the wheels directly as they get so dirty and run through gloves much quicker too. I also had an interesting experience with an older chair where I pushed on the tyres themselves, pushed a little too hard and broke both thumbs catching them in the brakes. If you have scissor style brakes or the self control to not drink and roll this won't be an issue.

&gt; Do people put the chair in the front or back seat of their car? I transfer it into the backseat, I just got into the habit having passengers I guess. Is this a waste?

I don't drive so I can't give you a personal answer here. However the other wheelies I know put it in the back seat, or those with leg function put it in the boot. I've never seen anyone put it in the front seat but I know there are people who do. Again, personal preference.

&gt; What sort of camber are people running on their wheels? I used to have a bit but have lowered it over the years. Do people have much? I really like a lot but getting through doors etc is a pain.

I love a lot of camber especially on hills, but have the same issue with doors. I'd have to check the angle for you but mine is not huge. If (in a dream world) I could have separate outdoor and indoor chairs I'd have one with high camber and the other without.

&gt; How do people handle the shoulder pain? I dont get much but when I do its crippling, is the lightest chair possible what people normally aim for?

I'm not the best person to answer this as I have shoulder pain without the chair. You should not be having crippling pain however unless you've pushed it too hard that day, normally after a day of hiking my shoulders are screaming bloody murder. Were you measured by a specialist for your current chair? I wonder if the pain is more from the setup of the chair (too high, axle too far back, wrong seat angle etc) causing you to push at a funny angle rather than the weight. When I went from an off-the-peg chair to an active user the weight difference was only 5kg, which isn't a lot. The difference is more in the setup of the chair which makes it much easier to push.

I would *strongly* recommend that you go to a wheelchair department or specialist shop and try some out for yourself. They will be able to look at how you currently push and ask what you want from a new chair. It makes a huge, huge difference to have someone who knows what they're doing say 'you're reaching too far back/your plate is too low/your frame isn't right' etc.",2,,2,0,0,

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1453856329,"I was recently approved for a guide dog at one of the major schools in the US so I've done quite a bit of research on service dogs in general in the past year.  I admittedly know next to nothing about hearing ear dogs but I did some searching and found [Dogs for the Deaf](http://www.dogsforthedeaf.org/).  They are a little different from guide dog schools (at least the ones I looked into).  You will have a $50 application fee and a $500 deposit.  The deposit will be returned after 1 year of working with your dog.  Guide dog schools are generally completely free.  The other difference is that they will send a trainer to you for what looks like 5-7 days to train you to work with your dog.  Most guide schools have a one month program that is residential and will only train in the home in special circumstances.

&amp;nbsp;

I mention all of this to give you an idea of how this compares to another professional service dog training organization. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have heard about a lot of people handler training their service dogs.  I don't know much about the intricacies of managing with a hearing impairment, so I don't know how easy it would be to owner train a hearing ear dog on your own.  I know that training a guide dog is something that really only professionals can do, but the website I linked to seemed to indicate that their dogs only indicate on 7 sounds so it may be simpler to train them.  Either way, if you have never trained a dog before I would definitely seek a professional opinion from a dog trainer, preferably one that has trained service dogs before, and someone who is familiar with hearing ear dogs.

&amp;nbsp;

If it were me, I'd probably go with a professional organization that does this full time.  It's kind of a safety thing, and the $50 fee would be very worth it to me for the assurance that the dog was trained properly by professionals and knowing that I received the instruction necessary to handle it.  Plus you do get the $500 back if you are able to part with that for a year.

There's also Guitar Hero.   Even though they don't play exactly like a real guitar it helps you get your cordination down with holding down notes while strumming the guitar.

There are a lot of able-bodied people who would have  difficulty transferring a patient even with help.  My aunt, who is less than 5 feet tall and weights less than 100 pounds, comes to mind.

My guess is that they have provisions for that already, or that it wouldn't be hard to make them.  Presumably they don't fire pregnant women, for example.

So I guess my question is, what's your biggest concern?  Do you doubt that you can fundamentally do the job? Are you just worried about bringing it up in an interview?  Something else?

For confidence, if you can get an internship or something where you're doing parts of the job then I imagine you'd have more confidence about what you can or can't do. I took OT for years (as a child) and my therapist never had to move anyone.
 
If it's about bringing it up, I think you'll find people quite receptive.  Even with a visible condition (mine is quite visible) people don't know what I can and can't do until I tell them.  I had a phone interview once (so the person had never seen me) where I felt that I had to bring it up and it was absolutely no big deal.  It just led to a discussion where we sort of collaboratively figured out whether I could do the job or not.  The guy didn't hold it against me at all.

I've rambled for quite a bit but I'd be happy to answer follow up questions.  I hope this helps.  I could go on for quite some time, but I really do believe people will take your word for it if you say you can do the job.  You are the expert on you.

One said hers was really bad, in the same area mine was, and she went to the hospital for hers. I explained to her some of my neurological symptoms, two matched up to mine immediately (our talk was short and off the top of my head) and told her to get a hold of her hospital records from that trip and see what she found. I had found the TBI diagnosis in my record, and have been trying to get my insurance to pay for a follow-up. (That's another story entirely.) 

My managers generally have an idea that something is up. One caught sight of my leg brace when I was wearing one, and was going to tell me it was a uniform defect because it had some white on it, until she figured out it was a brace. They were going to call me out on going to the back room a lot, until they realized I was going to the back room for medication.

The only way someone could ever say that is if they don't have the slightest idea what it means to be disabled.

You experience it even when you're laying in bed at night.

And that attitude is super-harmful in another way too, I think, in that it strongly discourages the formation of a community.

1. It can help other people. I spent a lot of time ignorant of my health conditions, and ashamed of the symptoms. So I talk about them, I put a label on them. I go ""yup, this is a thing, and it's okay, and you can talk to me about it if you want."" It's led to some uncomfortable conversations sometimes, but overall it's been net-positive. 
2. I've found being silent has had a more negative effect than being loud. I got into a passive-aggressive shitfight with a teacher my first semester at my four-year. I asked her about my grade, saying she hadn't really put anything up, and I was a bit concerned about where it was at. She attacked my computer accommodation--granted by Disability Services for my Traumatic Brain Injury--then sent then an email requesting proof I actually had an accommodation. I know this happened because I got a copy of the email they sent back to her saying I did, indeed, have one. Immediately afterwards, she was handing me a list of resources all over the college, and did give me an update on my grades. (I was at a 3.5; I was fine. She could have just told me that.) That teacher definitely held blame there--for example, she had been sent the accommodation notification before--but just sitting down with her and explaining ""hey, this is what I need from you"" that can help.

I have stayed absolutely silent in one area though, which is my work. They know that my leg gives me pain, and that's it. I'm about to find out how much this specific silence has worked for me.

First, yes they are expensive compared to baby diapers.  The main reason is they are just bigger.  More material.

Second, you will save quite a bit buying in bulk online.  In fact, I would not recommend buying in a store at all.  All store brands are over priced and have poor quality.  That said, it is hard to know which diaper is best for you, and if you get a case that doesn't work for you, that's no good.

I recommend xpmedical.com  The owner is incontinence and has personally used everything he sells.  If you have questions, he will answer them.  He also sells sample packs that will include one or two if each of the diapers he has to offer.  This will give you a chance to try a good variety.  Once you find the one that works for you, then you can start buying cases at a time.

There are other sites that sell as well, but not many with as much personal experience and attention to the customer.  I personally use vitalitymedical.com  The selection is much greater, and the prices a bit better.  But, having worn for years now, I know what I'm looking for and the best deal, is the best deal.

The amount of SSI benefits you wife gets will be reduced by your income, it does not matter if you keep your money in a separate account or not. SSI benefits are $733.00 max, it does not matter what state you live in. Married couples are subject to the following rules. The first $20.00 dollars you get into your household is not countable and does no effect your wives check. The next $65.00 dollars you earn is not counted as income, and will not reduce your wife's check. BUT, for every $2.00 dollars you earn or receive from any source, SSA will reduce your wife's SSI check by $1.00 dollar ! This rule is based on the legal definition of marriage which states that 100% of all income, is the property of both spouses.

Physically moving patients *can* be a big part of the job depending on the setting. The setting I want to work in (more outpatient-based) doesn't involve much if any transferring, but these jobs can be harder to get as a new grad. So I'm worried I'll have little choice (loans only wait so long) but to get a more physical position. 


I'm mostly worried about bringing it up in interviews because some job postings will say things like ""must be able to perform a max assist (patient does 25% of work, clinician does 75% of work) independently."" So obviously I shouldn't take those jobs, but I'm concerned those might be the only jobs available to me for a little while.

Can someone explain to me why anyone would go through all the effort of dealing with those frustrating applications and all the drama and BS that is DHS for such a meager sum of money?! I mean do people even realize what typical benefits actually look like?

Worse than this though is I come from a family of relative means. Now my parents are retired and in their 70s and the economic crisis had a significant effect on them and our state as a whole. They're also some pretty toxic people who have not supported me much and aren't healthy for me to be around (and see mention of my totally able-bodied mooch of a brother) But I had nice things my parents bought me or that I saved up for. I've had hospital social workers and even someone from a disability org who was supposed to be helping connect me to resources judge me because I had an ereader and a laptop and phone or whatever. The irony being each of those was far out of date. It's nice you think my Mac looks fancy but it's 10 years old. Ereaders go for like $50, etc. Situations flipping change. And the woman who made the snarkiesy remark literally had my bank statement and benefits info right in front of her so it should've been clear. And frankly who doesn't have a phone and some sort of computer or whatever, right?

Why? Because people want to work! The vast majority of those I know with a disability would MUCH RATHER work than receive a rather paltry benefit which basically leaves people on the poverty line anyway, if they were able to do that. The issues are sometimes the nature of the disability, sometimes discrimination, and sometimes employers unwilling to make reasonable accommodations like letting a worker have a flexible schedule when undergoing treatment. AND the fact that they lose access to things like subsidized carers that they would be unable to afford anyway if they're earning more.

Honestly, I think the crude comments and judgment come from people who hate working and see disability as some kind of vacation instead of well, disability, which involves some obstacles they can't relate to and a much greater financial struggle than that faced by people who are lucky enough to be in employment.

First, I suggest talking your state's vocational rehab office. In my state it's called ""Rehabilitation Services."" Their goal is to help disabled people find and keep jobs by determining what they *are* able to do and what skills can be developed and/or enhanced.  If needed, they can help you get ADA accommodations so you're able to perform the job.

As for ""filing for disability"" - without a strong work history you're unlikely to qualify for SSDI, which is funded by taxes that come out of your paychecks.  You have to have worked so many hours over a certain period of time to qualify for SSDI.

You may qualify for SSI.  SSI is intended for disabled people with limited financial means.  It limits the amount of assets you can have (outside of one car and a house, you cannot have more than $2000).  SSI payments are relatively low (IIRC it was $780 in 2015) and most people on it can qualify for their states Medicaid and SNAP programs.   

You can apply online at ssa.gov [here](https://www.ssa.gov/onlineservices/#&amp;a0=0).  Note that the application is very long and it's easier if you gather all the relevant data before you start - doctor's names and contact info, dates of any testing done, etc.  The initial application process (from filing until you get a decision) usually takes at least a year, and only about 1/4 of applicants are accepted with their first application.",2,,2,0,0,

I'm a little different as my shit will change as time goes on, but with the same injury for 20 years and chair experience it makes much more sense for you to get a fully fixed frame, it's what I would do in your position. Less moving parts, less wasted energy and less to break!

&gt; Do you find that pushing of just the rims messes up your push? I don't wear gloves and so slip on just the rims.

I don't, but I do wear gloves with rough material on the palms for grip. I did originally just use my bare hands but if I ever had a few days off in bed the callouses would heal and I would get burned hands again. Avoidable if you can deal with going slow but fuck that for a plan, if I see a hill I'm bombing down it. This means though that you need to burn your hands, develop good callouses or use gloves. The first two are useless in the rain, which over here in the UK we get a lot of. This was in fact how I broke my thumbs, I left without my gloves as I was in a drunken hurry and thought 'fuckit, I'm not going back for them' and so pushed on the tyres instead, a little too hard and a little too far, right into the brakes.

I think it helps that I have small hands but long fingers - my fingers can wrap around the rim while only the pad at the base of my thumb brushes the side of the wheel if that makes sense? If I had larger hands I could see myself accidentally brushing the actual wheel and fucking with the push, unless I was aiming to grip both. If you want to use the rims, have you looked at pushrim covers for grip? I've heard great things from other wheelies and want to give them a try in the summer when gloves are more of a PITA. 

Thinking on it actually I play murderball and those chairs have no pushrims, but on my street chair I still prefer the rims. I don't know if this is a fair comparison though as my sports chair is much lower and a very different pushing angle, the wheels are much closer to the body and for me are more waist height than hip height as on a street chair. I think it would feel very odd to use pushrims on a sports chair, whereas it's just right for me on a street chair. It's also not unusual for me to push the spoke cover rather than the tyre itself which isn't doable on a street chair. Aaaaaand now you've made me want to try pushrims on a sports chair haha.

&gt;Also do you have the back lock into place? 

Mine doesn't lock but it's been folded probably twice in its lifetime and as a result I always forget to lubricate it when I do the axle, castors etc. It's only ever been folded to fit into taxis when a roll-in taxi wasn't available, but I wouldn't do it again. Last time the driver folded the back without asking me after I'd transferred into the taxi, and when he couldn't get it back into place at the other end (not lubed remember) he stood on the footplate as leverage. And fucked it. 

With a new chair I would have it locked so that my poor chair doesn't have to go through that again. Additionally the more joints you have on a chair, the more kinetic energy is wasted with each push. So if you don't need the joints, remove them. I'm not allowed to drive due to epilepsy so normally use buses and trains with the occasional taxi - I rarely use the fold as I'm sitting in it 99% of the time anyway. If I could drive the foldability would no doubt be much more important to me unless I knew I would always have a car it could fit in unfolded.",2,,2,0,0,

It's up to you!

&gt;I suspect that if I were ever to try to get accommodations for work or school, I wouldn't be provided any. 

Outside work or school, they aren't typically even allowed to ask you for any proof!  

But for work and school - if you have a note from your doctor stating a few of your conditions, and you ask for reasonable accommodations, there's no reason they'd say no.  

IBS and anxiety are more than enough to impact your life in a big way.  

If you consider yourself disabled, no matter how invisible the conditions are, and you have disabling conditions?  You are.

Pads/pantyliners are less expensive than briefs, and if you leak a little bit throughout the day, it's going to save in the long run to change the pad through the day instead of changing the whole brief. Also, baby powder is your friend! I use liberal amounts and it helps keep my creases dry because my skin is super sensitive (I have auotimmune issues, and will develop rashes from multiple factors, including sunlight exposure). It might be a little weird getting used to extra padding down there, particularly if you're a guy, but it only took me about a week actually. To be honest, I love wearing a brief.

Before my disability I too was very demeaning to especially chronically fatigued people, as I 'felt' that ""it was just laziness"" and they weren't trying to ""beat the system"". How stupid, ignorant and selfish I was (I've the same issues now).

I live in Malaysia, Asians of different races, cultures and religions around me. Disability is often looked at as a ""flag"" that you're somehow just doomed to be invalid for life, or a result of bad karma, or demon possession, or whatever they can cook up. Some people here tend to be nearer to two extremes, bad mouthing you silently behind your backs, or in your face loudly. Thankfully, not everyone is like that.

I've had good intended people from the nearby church pop up at my home one day and they tried to ""cast out the demon"" in me (I got angry, to which they got even more intense, ""AH THE DEMON SHOWS ITSELF"", to which I just left the premises). The ""we need to pray MORE"" thing is just as annoying.

I've had numerous people claim I was just lazy to move my limbs. I've had people (strangers) remarking to me randomly, ""Good! This is the result for your misbehavior!"" (bad karma).

Don't get me started on other disabled people who are in the running for, ""who's condition is worse?""

To which I've learnt:

- No disability is the same (even amongst disabled). Our challenges is our own challenges.
- No one can fully understand, they're not us. This doesn't mean they can't partially relate, or empathize.
- Most people just cannot understand, until they themselves get something similar. I understood that they can't understand.
- I think I understand my condition fairly well, and it's not something I'll ever wish on people (discounting angry moments and remarks).
- Your ability AND disability is all part of who you are, duh. We come to terms with it to know what we can do and cannot do. What battles to fight, and what to not fight.

It is very unfortunate that you've loss someone that is supposed to be a friend due to this. I personally have blocked all contact with a ex-friend for 6 years because of her insensitive remarks, similar to yours. The only thing different is I did the blocking, due to myself not having the emotional stamina to deal with that (I was returning to study).

On a side note I have known a person or two who are the personification of what your ex-friend addresses. However, the cause isn't just the disabled ""embracing their condition"" as much as the environment around them causing them to ""give up"" on fighting or trying to even live.",3,,3,0,0,

I wouldn't take it to the initial application (if you are doing an in person interview); I would wait until you get your activities of daily living/work history paperwork from the DDS.

As for whether it will help/hurt that really just depends on the examiner. The general rule I tell people is that the more information we have the better. That being said, try to keep the letter to less than 1 page (single-spaced). When people send in pages and pages of personal statements it gets tedious to read and often times the information is irrelevant. I would stick to the facts (what conditions you have, your symptoms, and how it affects your functioning) only and leave any sort of ""sob story"" out of it. It sounds cruel but disability examiners, while we care about people, hear sob stories all day every day. If we got emotionally invested in every case we wouldn't be able to do our jobs.

If you really want to help your disability claim you need to make sure that you submit all paperwork timely and follow up with your doctor's offices to make sure that they sent in their medical records.

""Disability"" arises when just like the word implies, you're ""not able [to ____]"". This is further enforced by the environment around you, specifically referring to the basic expectations of a ""normal person"", physically, mentally and emotionally. For example, this encompasses even small things like, opening a bottle cap (screw type), or even cutting fingernails for me. 

I am **unable** to unscrew a bottle (the first time, whilst its still sealed) without a second hand to hold the bottle still , so I have to resort to unconventional means to do so if at all possible (hold it between your thighs, ask someone else to lend a hand).

I'm not sure how to cut the fingernails of my hand using the same hand... derp.

From that, disability doesn't necessary just mean ""I absolutely cannot"", but also include, ""I can do it, but with a significant amount of extra effort/adaptations (or compromising certain things) compared to the minimum expectations"".

One area I'm quite into is disabled gaming (we still can have fun too!). The ""expectations"" of capabilities (physical/mental/emotional) vary from game to game, differing from control schemes (2 hands almost always assumed right?), being able to see or hear or speak, or certain levels of reflexes and dexterity, as well as emotional endurance (especially when dealing with real life people). It's always inspiring to see people challenge the 'system' and succeeding.

The army is a cultural touchstone in Israeli life due to its universality;* your service creates network connections and serving in a prestigious position or unit in the army can help with employment later in life. Asking a young adult ""What unit did you serve in?"" is kind of like asking ""Where did you go to college?"" but much more universal.

Although most youth with disabilities are exempt from service, many opt-in to serve anyway if they are allowed. It is a formative experience in many Israelis' lives, and conversely, those who can't serve often feel left out of an experience all their peers are participating in.

Obviously, it is still a military—it's not all fun and games. But when the entire country serves, Israelis would see integrating PWD into the army as a way of recognizing their value and their ability to contribute to protecting the nation.

*Not all groups serve; ultra-Orthodox religious Jews (haredim) seek exemptions at a high rate, for instance.

I removed it after a few occasions when people emailed me back to tell me they couldn't review my application because I was a disabled candidate. Yep, they actually said those words in an email. That's how brazen the discrimination was. This may not happen to you, I think I must have hit a goldmine of really dim people, but it is quite likely they will just ignore your application altogether.

You are totally right that having a complex disability gives you all kinds of skills that your peers may not have acquired yet. People who know you will recognize that, people who don't know you will just see the disability. You seem like a confident person so I would recommend you state your skills without mentioning the disability. Then, in the interview (where the interviewers are likely to be politely smiling but in an internal state of shock lol), you can confidently weave your background and skills into your answers to show the people that actually your disability is an asset.

That said, if you've lived with your condition for a while, you can probably trust your gut pretty well.  If you're uncomfortable with a max assist, there's an argument to be made for pushing for a different type of work.

Jobs are a funny thing.  I dunno where you live, but in the USA I feel like there are pretty much infinity opportunities (especially in medical stuff like OT) as long as you're willing to move.

Hey! I have left sided hemiplegia. Honestly, the biggest pieces of advice I can give you are:
Start with a Ukulele. The neck is smaller so you don't have to reach so far at first. Plus some chords translate back to guitar, for example a G on a Ukulele is a D on a guitar, etc.
If your fingers won't cooperate, just work on holding your fingers against the frets with your dominant hand to instill the muscle memory. I had to do this, and it was very frustrating, but it helped.
Your hands are going to cramp, it's going to hurt. Push yourself, but try not to over-do it. I suppose that it really depends on how bad your spasticity is, but I hope that this helps some!

Also, Holding your fingers on the frets with your right hand is just to reinforce/instill the muscle memory. It's not about playing but teaching yourself how to hold and grab the chords. You can get an alternative sound on an Uke, I covered Nine Inch Nails on mine. It depends on the kind you get, really. There are other kinds of Ukulele's aside from Soprano (which is standard) that have deeper, richer sounds. It's a very versatile instrument.
