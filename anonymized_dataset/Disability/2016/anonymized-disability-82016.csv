I understand the frustration with the different programs, but, in your situation, I don't think you can afford to rule out any options. SSDI/SSI and Medicaid is more difficult when you have a rarer condition but it is not impossible. And there is no ""judgment"" with these programs - when they send you to doctor's appointments and order different tests it is because they are required to in order to determine eligibility. Its cynical to think that SSA doesn't ""understand"" these illnesses; we do understand them but we also have regulations and rules to follow. We are not able to just say ""well, they say they have this condition and these symptoms so it must be true"". Objective evidence is required as part of the program, in part due to remove some of the subjectiveness of the decision and keep determinations consistent across disability examiners.   

From where I'm sitting (and not just from an SSA perspective but also as a former social worker) your best bet will be a combination of disability and Medicaid. You say that you don't need home health, which may be true, but sometimes these programs will give you access to services that can help you with some of your non-medical needs.  When I was a mental health case manager I would often help out my clients with routine errands/chores when they needed it.

As for non-government options, could you consider getting a roommate? You could even consider giving them a small break on the rent (say you pick up $50/mo of their portion) in return for them helping you out when you need it.

I bought a van to live in at the beginning of my mental breakdown when I knew I'd be losing my apartment. The sub r/vandwellers has some great advice about living in a vehicle and the site www.cheaprvliving.com is full of advice and sample budgets for vehicle dwellers at $500 and $1000 per month. 

Vehicle dwelling is attractive because you have a sense of independence and a type of stability. BLM land is a great option but OP will need to track in her own water and track out her own waste as well as figure out ways to stay warm and cool. She might find some luck rotating parking in Walmart parking lots- I believe r/vandwellers has a link to the Walmarts that welcome vehicle dwelling. 

In my experience it was hard to live in a van and I have a nice little conversion with a real bed and a bit of floor space to move around in. If I had to do it again though I think I would have liked a trailer. It would have been so much nicer to stand up and if you live in a vehicle that breaks down you are without shelter when it's in the shop. Could you possibly buy OP a small used trailer? Depending on where she parks she might be able to bike or take public transport to get around. 

For long term I think your friend should apply for section 8 housing. The waiting lists can be long but they won't take more than 30% of her income for rent. As your friend is female she may have more options than living in a vehicle. Maybe try some women's shelters and churches to see if they have housing options.

a506c97a-9ebd-4c8c-9cfe-a61788847d15,1472268282,"I'm a 26 year old woman with Spastic Diplegia.
In preschool (age 3 and a half, I believe) I had tendon releases on my adductors, toe cords, and heel cords to relieve much of the high tone. 

Recovery was unpleasant, I wore casts after for a few weeks and then had to sleep in full leg braces for another year. I don't remember much except always feeling sore. I had intensive PT 3x/week for the next 8 years, but I went from not being able to walk, to standing on my own, to walking with a walker, to crutches, to one crutch, to a cane all throughout elementary and middle school. Reducing the muscle tone allowed me to gradually gain more strength and control of my legs and core muscles. 

Because of all the treatment and PT I had to do, as an adult I can walk independently at home but I use a cane outdoors because I struggle in rough terrain, on curbs, with stairs, and with long distances . When I am on my feet for a long time, I also  wear MAFO orthotics. They hurt a lot, but when I'm fatigued I can't walk without tripping over my feet unless I have the braces on to stop my feet from pointing down.

It was rough on my childhood to spend so much time doing things that were unpleasant, but I have more access to the world now on my own two feet than I would in a wheelchair. I'm glad my parents made me go for surgery and dragged me into physical therapy crying. I hated it and I must have told my poor therapist I hated her a million times. She never gave up or let me give up, saying the word ""can't"" in her office was like a swear word. I'm really better for it. 

Another thing that might make him feel more positively about his situation is spending time with other children like himself. That was a HUGE help to me. It made me feel like I was not alone, and it made me feel grateful for what I *can* do instead of sad or frustrated by what I *can't* do. It also made me learn that there is no shame in asking for help, or in needing to use some sort of device to get around. It was comforting to realize there are MILLIONS of disabled people in the world, and even though I might feel weird being the only one in a room having to get around the way I do, there's somebody somewhere who needs the exact same thing, or maybe even more help. I came to see it as just a part of life and it bothered me a lot less. I'd ask around with doctors, therapists, his school for resources in your area.

My biggest source of support was The Southampton Fresh Air Home, a 3 week sleep away camp on Long Island, NY, like nothing else I've ever heard of. It's for ages 8-18. They're separated by age and gender, but they accommodate all levels of disability. I went there every summer from age 8-15 and it was the best experience of my entire life. I felt like a ""normal"" kid when I was there. I could have fun and forget about real life for awhile. I'd look into that, or something similar if you can find it, when he's old enough. If you can't afford it there are scholarships, the camp is funded by the very rich of Southampton.

They get mostly New York kids, but there was a girl who flew in from Georgia every summer. That girls mother, and one of the directors of SFAH,  founded a similar day camp called Lindsey's Place in Savannah GA

If there's any way with the help of therapy and other treatments you can work, you'd be so much better off. 

I wish you much luck.",1,,1,0,0,

For background: I've been blind since birth, started learning braille at around 2 and a half. I could read grade 1 by the time I started school at 4 and a half, was done with grade 2 by the age of 6 or 7.

I also started to learn to touch type at age 5, and continued to learn to use tech throughout primary school. I was fortunate to come from an area where the teacher for the visually impaired was pretty amazing, as many kids don't receive services that are to this standard.

So braille is, and will always be my primary reading method.

These days I don't use it so much. I've become lazy, I suppose. 

I actually went to a blind school for a few years starting at age 11 and ironically it was there that my braille skills began to decline. Once I returned to mainstream school I used braille more often, however at university I only use it on and off.

I have a braille display and I find it useful for things like presentations and public speaking events in particular. I'm not connected to my pc through a headset, or relying on listening to a screenreader and repeating what it says.

I actually recently made a sort of promise to myself that I'd use braille more, because I know my reading speed has declined over the years and I'm not happy about that. 

I should also add that I use braille for labeling things like makeup, so I can identify the colour. ",1,,1,0,0,

I have a small learning disability  (plus a major medical one which is why I'm on this sub but didn't get any help with it in college) and when I was in college I got extra time on tests. We would have student Procter? there to make sure we weren't cheating or whatever.

I have a weird relationship with learning because my IQ is pretty high but my basic spelling and sight reading (if you show me a word without context I get it wrong lot) are really bad I feel weird asking for extra time on tests.

We want to create a sort of linguistic Lourdes, where evil and misfortune are dispelled by a dip in the waters of euphemism.

I just wanted to pop in and say that if you like science, you should keep in mind that there's a lot of science you can do despite being quite physically limited (e.g. epidemiology, biostats etc). 

If you want to stick with neuro, I might try finding out what neuroscience careers look like in terms of how much you have to be on your feet if I were you. Then think about whether that's feasible long-term or what kind of assistance you might need and how to achieve that. If you have good upper body mobility and get a power wheelchair** you will be able to do a hell of a lot (take this from someone with no lower body strength and very shit upper body strength who did molecular bio). Short-term, you might want to use this time to obtain qualifications or do some training in things that are a) helpful later on in your science studies but b) likely to be of use to you/financially beneficial even if you don't go into science and also in the shorter term. I'm thinking IT-type stuff which are cool bonus skills in science but which you can also develop into a home-based job of some sort *IF* neuroscience doesn't work out long-term.

ca2d5ddf-11bc-4597-abb5-d3f7ae707019,1471671817,"This is good information and certainly needed.  Our experience recovering from a disaster was a hodgepodge solution.   In 2011,  our house was destroyed by a 1/2 mile wide F4 tornado.  We lost our house, 90% of our possessions and car when my son was 7.    

Medicaid only gave us 30 days to file a claim for lost equipment and supplies.  It took several months for them to process and replace my son's wheelchair headrest.   No headrest was a big problem.   Riding the bus in his wheelchair without a headrest introduces the possibility of breaking your neck in a collision.   Since he couldn't ride the bus to school in his wheelchair I had to borrow a car and drive him.   If I hadn't been able to borrow a car he would have missed at least 2 months worth of school.  Something as simple as a wheelchair headrest can make a huge difference.  

Supposedly they were to reissue medications for those in the area of destruction no questions asked but they didn't.   My son missed almost a weeks worth of medication because the pharmacy made us redo the authorization even though the last authorization was less then 30 days old.   The infusion pharmacy was excellent.   They sent replacement equipment and supplies immediately.  

The hospital replaced his car seat for free when I took him to the ER.   They also offered to put us up in a hotel for 2 nights since there weren't any accessible shelters locally; we had relatives in the area so we declined the offer.

We got significant help from two local church, when my son's PT spread the word that he lost all his equipment.   They replaced his oral sensory tools, Talk 9 communicator, youth diapers, ostomy supplies  as well as ordinary stuff like clothes and toys.   For those who are not religious, please know when churches help like this they don't care about your beliefs.   

While all the help didn't put his world fully back to normal, he was at least able to live somewhat comfortably vs the first few days where we had next to nothing.  

I found that asking people you knew was the best way to get help.    We didn't even try to go to big disaster relief organizations because I figured we wouldn't get the right type of help for him.  I don't really know how others did it that was just how we survived.     ",1,,1,0,0,

 It is more difficult these days in general, for everybody. I make a good, solid living working for the government but I still struggle being single. I know couples where one spouse can't work due to the cost of childcare, or people who have so much medical debt it is bankrupting them, extended unemployment, having to take care of a sick relative, etc etc. I mean no offense with this, but because she cannot work due to her medical condition doesn't necessarily mean that she is entitled (again, because she hasn't worked long enough to be insured) to extra help that isn't going to be available to other families with one income.   

As for the SSI, the rules have to be arbitrary and have to cut off at some point. The SSI checks come out of the general tax fund and not the SSA trust fund (which SSDI and RIB come out of) so integrity of the program is important. I wish that our country was better about taking care of citizens in need, but, this is the system which we have currently and I don't see it changing anytime soon. 

My best advice to you guys: you need to prepare and plan for supporting both of you on one income. If you guys do get married and she loses her SSI, could she work at least part time? You didn't say what her disability was, but, outside of catastrophic injuries, most people are capable of at least some work. Even if she only earned $500/mo that would help immensely. 

While you guys aren't married I would check to see if her state participates in the ABLE accounts. My best understanding of those is that she can put away money in these accounts (up to 100K) and they won't be subject to asset limitations as long as the funds are used to eligible expenses. She can try to start saving money now (which I know won't be much) to help with the transition later. 

Again, I am very sympathetic to your situation. For years I supported myself and my ex making $30K/yr. It sucks but it is possible. You just have to live below your means, budget well, and if your income is low enough you guys might still qualify for some state-benefits like SNAP or TANF. ",2,,2,0,0,

This means, (even though you did this on the application), you need to document your employment history and why each job didn't work out. Either why you left or why you got fired. Like every one since you were 16. When I went to my hearing my main argument was that I had never had a job for longer than 6 months. I was like 33 at my hearing and they saw on my social security employment record that when I was 16 I had a job for like a year. I had to explain that I only worked 6 hours on Saturday at a flower shop. So document that crap. Bring one copy for you to reference and one copy for them to have.

Make sure they have all of your current medical records, including any assessments your doctor may have done. 

Make a list of all of the ways that your life is hard due to your mental illness that specifically make working difficult. So, for bipolar, for me it's functional things like there are so many days when I am depressed that getting out of bed is physically impossible. Not showering for a week is a real possibility. Going to the store is overwhelming sometimes. Also manic symptoms like I had to file bankruptcy because of manic spending (that made the judge make me have a payee), being so manic I decided to drive 300 miles 3 hours before a shift started because I wanted to see the lake.

If you have any other issues along with bipolar like anxiety, talk about that.

If you tried the medications for a reasonable amount of time and had negative side effects, or didn't get the intended benefit that would be one thing, or if you have a diagnoses of pharmacophobia. But really what is there to do for Fibro other than medication and exercise?

You're (likely) never going to return to 100% and that is very frustrating and I struggled with it for a long time. You need to move the benchmark. I liken it to a West Wing example: they were wanting approval from all the EU countries for some treaty, which they were never going to get. Along the way though, they realized they had all the key NATO players, despite not having the full EU. So the press secretary decided to change the goal post and narrative, brief that we had full NATO support, and move on. It was still a win when framed that way. So you need to find a way to re-frame your win. Talk to your doctors to get a feel of what a normal 26 year old should be able to do, and what someone who is 26 with your condition should be able to do. Maybe there are some ""reach"" activities between those two levels of activity you can look for as a long term goal. Maybe you're less functional than someone in your condition should be, and you can look for some wins that are within your reach. Your winning isn't going to be running a mile or driving a car, perhaps. But it might be cooking your own meal or dressing yourself, whatever it might be. You are in control, and you get to define the narrative and your story. If you can shift your perspective in this way, it may help with your coping with your disability. ",4,,4,0,0,

However, you can accept that your disability might define a part of you but doesn't have to define all of you. People are more than their limitations and challenges. Coming to acceptance is easier/faster for some, depending on their condition, their initial frame of mind and personality but it also likely depends on what support systems in the form of friends and family are available, whether there is access to therapy, access to education and access to independent living.

There is actually something written into SSA policy (I'm too lazy to cite it) that states that the longer someone has been on disability and the older they get (generally referred to 'age and time on the rolls') the less likely it is that they could work. Especially with progressive impairments like DDD and arthritis. 

The only thing your mom need to worry about is making sure she attends the appointments, fills out paperwork, returns phone calls, etc. They can cut off her benefits for not cooperating but medically they are not going to find her improved. 

NOTE: I say that there is no way in hell that she is going to be ceased, but I've seen some strange things happen before. SSA is a workplace just like everywhere else; we have idiots in the ranks. If she does happen to get ceased, make sure she appeals *immediately* and selects to have her benefits continued. That way she still gets paid while she goes to the appeal/hearing level where they will reverse the first decision.

edit: I just kind of read through the rest of your question regarding the payment and types of benefits. SSI and SSDI are really the same thing. So if she were ceased for SSDI that would make her ineligible for SSI since they use the same medical eligibility. Once your mom his full retirement age (66) her benefits will automatically switch over from disability (DIB) to retirement (RIB) benefits. Worst case scenario and her disability benefits are ceased at this point she is old enough that she could elect to take early-RIB benefits.  ",3,,3,0,0,

d42770b1-9f84-462c-9536-090461a2ff56,1471234214,"I did not access disability services while I was enrolled in school, but my current employment includes working with students who are transitioning/aging out of secondary school, as well as with adults who have disabilities. I can give a summary of some of their experiences, as well as share in the experiences of my S/O and close friend, who have learning disabilities. I hope this can give you some help with the paper, at least on the ""system"" side of things and how individuals access services through their schools (in Florida).

The overwhelming tendency is that unless the student has a parent/guardian who is extremely active and effective at advocacy, or the student's disability is highly apparent (e.g., developmental disabilities), even obtaining a diagnosis to receive services is incredibly difficult. I have a client who was pushed through secondary school up until the eleventh grade with no accommodations or even receiving any testing before dropping out. She was diagnosed with an intellectual disability at age 26 through my agency, and tested at a first grade reading level and with very limited adaptive skills. My S/O and close friend were not tested until their junior and senior years of high school, forced to take remedial classes multiple times in spite of having good grades in all other subjects. My close friend, who was diagnosed with a mathematics disorder, was forced to take four math classes in her junior year to be able to graduate on time, because those were the only classes she had failed in her previous years. Conversely, I have had clients whose parents are highly involved and have gotten technology, counseling, and worlds of support for their children as early as primary school. These are predominantly white and higher income families who have been able to pay for testing outside of the school system.

When it comes to testing, school psychologists often forego an actual DSM-V diagnosis to avoid ""labeling."" In my state this is especially poignant because the agency here that provides services to individuals who have developmental disabilities will not accept applications from people whose diagnosis did not occur before age 18. Students who are in special education do not age out until age 22, so if they and their families have relied on a report without an accurate diagnosis until after they are out of high school they will not be able to receive invaluable supportive services (e.g., supportive housing, life coaching, employment services, etc.) once the student is out of high school and their services are no longer an entitlement, per federal law.",4,,4,0,0,

When you first apply for ssdi they will be looking at your disability in something they call the ""disability blue book"" you can find it online and should look to see the specific requirements of your disabilities (you can apply under more than one at once). The key is that only what is documented will act as proof. So the fact that you can only walk 15 feet only matters if it's charted somewhere. As a previous comment or stated, it's highly unlikely to be approved at this stage - doctors simply don't write their notes with ssdi reviews in mind. If you don't meet the listing they will look at something called the grid (which you can also google) which determines if you can work based on a mix of your age/education/previous work experience. Based on your age - you won't pass this level. At this point your case will be denied as a whole. You can appeal in which case it will go through the same process and be denied again. Then you can appeal and it will go to a judge. He will still be looking under the same requirements but you are able to make your case and the judge has more discretion than the caseworkers who decided before. It takes about 1.5-2 years if not longer to get in to see the judge.

SSDI - beneficiaries have paid in thru FICA to qualify financially. There is no asset limit, their spouse can make six figures, they can inherit a million dollars. Not one penny of it affects their monthly check. Only their own, personal earned income can do that. 

SSI - this is a disability welfare program. Beneficiaries are limited to $2,000 in assets and their earnings *as well as* those of a spouse will affect their monthly check.

I taught for a little and had students with undiagnosed disabilities and we had some vague tactics that seemed to help, but they came more out of trial and error than any real knowledge of disabilities and how to work with them. 

* If there are students who are having trouble because they can't keep track of where their homework/textbooks/pencils are, and you've tried and failed to get them to be able to do it on their own, try keeping a little cabinet in the classroom for them to store their stuff just for that class. 

* Sometimes students have trouble sitting all day. Try incorporating some movement into each class. Even if it's just a time to stand up and do a few jumping jacks or stretch. 

* Having a few fidget toys on hand can be great, especially for those who have trouble focusing. 

* Give students as much routine as possible without making things boring.

* Make instructions very clear and simple. Make a clear time to write down homework.

Disabilities can be widely varying and the accommodations needed are just as varied. You might identify a few disabilities that you think students might have and look up supports specific for those disabilities.

Why are you paying medical bills? Is she on SSI or SSDI? Why doesn't she have medical?

There is NO Section 8 in most places, but it's different if you are disabled. 

A completely disabled person can't live in her car, or a trailer! How will she use the dump sites, unhook the trailer, etc. I've lived this as an elderly person. She will roast, and freeze. She can't afford solar panels. Who will change her propane tanks? A site with electricity and water costs as much as a motel. Just, hell no. If she's in a van, how will she get to the bathroom? Will she poop in the van? Where will she shower? This is not an idea for a disabled person.

She needs to find a place to travel to, and then go to the housing authority, a public hospital emergency room, or a shelter, and ask for help. 

Or, BEST, does she have enough for a Studio 6 type motel? These get you a roof, tiny kitchen. water, electric, TV, cable, even toilet paper and clean towels, for one price. Then she gets her food card and medical, and she's set. I've done it, and it's perfectly fine. She needs her check to be just a few dollars more than the motel; for the laundry. and an occasional trip to dollar tree. She can get an emergency food card in just days, but you have to request EMERGENCY CARD.

For comparison, I filed just before turning 24 due to the lower work credit requirement. It took me a year after leaving my last job to convince myself I needed to apply. My claim is nearly 2 years in now, since we have to take it to a hearing. That's with 13 years of medical history supporting one condition, and coming up on 4 years for another which has put me in the hospital around 40-50 times *and* been looked at by 10-12 doctors who all had no clue what to do. It's a slow and frustrating process, and without family supporting me I'd be screwed.

Quick approval isn't unheard of, but it needs good supporting records and usually an early application. They're not just looking at whether you can do your current job, but also if you can be trained to do any job that can accommodate your condition. The law firm managing my case spent most of the consultation making that extremely clear, and wouldn't take the case without a solid reason why I couldn't do something like assembly line work. They were trying to get the point across that SSDI isn't meant as a temporary thing, so you have to prove your condition isn't temporary either. If you apply after many years of coping with your condition and succeeding in work you'll have a much harder time convincing them you can't manage anymore.

If it's something you think is worth exploring, look up a good law firm that deals with disability. They're prohibited by federal law from charging you for consultations *and* for legal fees until approved. If your case is approved they can take percentage of backpay up to a maximum dollar value. The main downside to that is it incentivises the law firm to take care with longer backpay time or to work slowly to the maximum they can get is reached.

By not acknowledging my hardships I did a great disservice to myself and continually set myself up for failure and social isolation. 

Now though it's really important for me that people know of my conditions and the limitations they bring. I don't like to hurt people by being flaky, unreliable, unhelpful and sometimes very difficult to be around and it's important to my self worth that people don't perceive me as simply lazy, selfish and uncaring.

For therapy, push him but realize he doesn't like it because its painful and he may resent he's the only one who has to do the extra work. Even at that age fitting in starts to be important. Bribery is your ally here. 10 minutes of stretches per night for a week and he gets a sticker every night, 10 stickers and he gets to go to McDonalds or something. 

I never had surgery but I did do casting a few summers. Long-term I'd say it helped somewhat but as a kid all you see is not being able to play as  much...and the embarrassment of sponge bathes because you can't shower with the casts on (those waterproof covers are crap, I had to redo a week the first and only time I tried one). Wore AFOs until I was about 17 which I think did help though he might not need those if he's a chair user. 

I had Botox injections too, they hurt like hell and it'll be hard on all of you for him to be in pain but it goes away in less then 20 minutes. 

Now some downsides. As he gets older he'll likely have a period where he resents his disability, including therapy. Fitting in becomes important. Therapist, Doctors etc. are good people who dedicate their careers to helping you. But I realized CP has no cure; all these people career's are to help me 'as best they can'; the unspoken message there is I'll never have legs good enough as everyone else-I am still lesser. I'm better then I was now but I won't lie, age 12 was a hellish time for me. 

My parents raised me as nothing special, and I'm grateful for that. But I was forced to use a Walker at school for 6 and a half years starting at age 12. The main reason I was given is it'd help me in crowded hallways. Not even a teenager yet and I looked like a senior. That was 6 and half years of misery everyday, it cleared the halls but also of most people my age-kids that are different don't always have the best time. If he needs mobility equipment start him on it NOW, it'll spare him the harsh transition I had. I dropped the Walker as soon as I finished high school and haven't touched it since. You mention he likes being out of his wheelchair and roughhousing on the floor-it might be because he feels the most like the other boys that way even when crawling. I don't have a giant fix for that, only let him do it in private at least sometimes or he'll resent the chair more. Eventually he'll grow out of crawling when he catches the stares. 

Be cautious of disability groups; finding people like you to talk with can be great like you have with other parents. But I resented them as a kid I never found anyone my age and level of disability, the stress of stares of us in a group increased when I wanted people to look at me less. And I resented the only reason we were put together is because of what was *wrong* with us. He might be more open to it but if he's not don't force any of those disability day trips on him.

He might be into disabled sports and make friends that way, I wasn't because I couldn't play the 'real' sports with the regular kids at my school, I felt like disability sports were 2nd rate (look at media coverage of Paralympics to regular Olympics to see my point) but if you start him early and nudge him now he might make bonds with other kids like him that way. 

When he's old enough that his friends are getting paper routes, start him volunteering. It'll be a lot easier on him for first jobs that way, getting experience.  Personally I'd say not with a disability organization as you don't want the first thing on his resume to be the disability (ableist bias is real). A pet shelter, a YMCA, something where he'll get workplace tasks to complete and feel like he has a shot of being hired. 

Think about transit options now. Can he get around daily for work, grocery shopping and meeting friends with wheelchair buses regularly? Does he need hand controls to drive a car? Research how to get those in your area now so you know what to do both practically and financially when the time comes. I'm almost done driving school after a year and a half of government runaround and $5000 not including the car or insurance. 

This last one is the most complex...relationships. There's only so much anyone will listen too from their parents on love and sex and I can guarantee the public school sex ed does not help with this. The Walker really killed my self-esteem and it taken me years to self-heal and feel like I'm not bottom of the barrel. Even a lot of therapists don't give advice on this topic. I have a lot to say on this topic, PM me for more. But I will just say The Ultimate Guide to Sexuality and Disability book by Corey Silverberg and 2 others was great for me. Get a copy and check it yourselves. When the time is right maybe even give it to a therapist to give to him if he brings up questions like that. Its too much for a 12 year old but knowing I am a valuable partner and can have a good sex/love life then would have really helped. I'm going to leave two videos and articles here as well. Just so you know what he'll face.

When i finally treated it though I didn't feel that it had changed my state of mind, I felt I was finally myself again and had gone who knows how long NOT being myself without realizing it. Because that's what depression does. If you had diabetes would you not treat that? They are both a part of you malfunctioning so why treat one but decide the other was meant to be? If you feel it's different because of the effect on your state of mind switch diabetes out with schizophrenia. I know you didn't ask for advice on medication or treatment but I feel really badly for what you are going through and hate the thought that it might be happening needlessly, there might be a better life for you, but you will miss out on it because depression has convinced you it's not right.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1471265916,"so you are 6 weeks out from CTS surgery? Am I reading that correctly?

You still need to give yourself more time to heal after the surgery and make sure that you aren't ""pushing"" too far with your activities. CTS recovery, depending on how serious the issue was (was this bilateral? or just one side), can take a good 8-16 weeks to heal. 

Unfortunately, being approved for disability *just* based on CTS is going to be exceedingly difficult, especially at your age. I'm sorry to hear that you've been an artist, that is probably not going to be an option for you (at least as a FT job) for a long time, if ever. 

I would be looking towards any type of employment that doesn't involve extensive typing. Have you considered teaching art? That would minimize how much you are actually performing the art-related tasks but still will be within the type of work that you enjoy. Otherwise, at 27, you are young enough to move into a new career path.

From a medical perspective, if you don't already have a pain management doctor I would see if you can get a referral. CTS is nerve pain and so a NSAID (like ibuprofen) is not the best medicine for that type of pain.  Not to mention taking that much of it on a consistent basis is not good for your liver. If not pain management then a neurologist or rheumatologist; both of these will be familiar with the types of issues that CTS presents. ",1,,1,0,0,

As a joint unit both of you will be subject to the asset and income restrictions of the program.

As for your questions about work, you *can* work while collecting SSI however the work rules are a lot more strict for SSI than they are for SSDI since this is a needs-based program. General rule is that your SSI benefits will be decreased on a 2:1 ration (so decreased by $1 for every $2 you earn); you become ineligible if you make over $1130 for the month. If you do apply for disability while you are still working you have to be making less (gross) than the $1130 for them to even take your application. Also, you will almost certainly be denied if you are working while you apply.

I don't have CP but I do have a severe physical disability and one thing I would advise is that you should try to give your child as much opportunity and incentive to have therapy as you can. The truth is, I think a lot of disabled children come to resent this at some point in their lives. There were times when I hated my parents for pushing me but I look back and I'm thankful they did because it means I'm in a better position now than I would have been.

However - you need to balance this with the emotional repercussions on the child. Try to make things as fun and engaging as possible in terms of therapy and pay attention to the therapist's relationship with the child. I think a lot of the time we focus on the physical issues a disabled child has and we forget that there is an emotional side too that is equally important. If you ignore that, it can lead to problems in later life. As your child gets older, there may be physical activities that become too difficult. Learn to pick your battles and recognize when the balance is off - ask yourself if a particular task or exercise is worth the emotional difficulty and/or the physical strain. Most importantly, speak to your child about this as they get older and encourage them to evaluate this themselves. Ultimately, also try to remember this is *their* body and as they mature they should have a say in how much they do.

Basically - be positive and encouraging about physical therapy, push hard for it because it matters in the long-term more than people realize. But communicate with your child, listen to how therapy affects them and be sensitive and mindful of the fact that the emotional and physical states aren't always that easy to pick apart. Remember that not all physical activity is worth the exhaustion or emotional upset that comes with it and show your child that you respect that.",1,,1,0,0,

A. Medically documented persistence, either continuous or intermittent, of one of the following:

1. Depressive syndrome characterized by at least four of the following:

a. Anhedonia or pervasive loss of interest in almost all activities; or

b. Appetite disturbance with change in weight; or

c. Sleep disturbance; or

d. Psychomotor agitation or retardation; or

e. Decreased energy; or

f. Feelings of guilt or worthlessness; or

g. Difficulty concentrating or thinking; or

h. Thoughts of suicide; or

i. Hallucinations, delusions, or paranoid thinking; or

2. Manic syndrome characterized by at least three of the following:

a. Hyperactivity; or

b. Pressure of speech; or

c. Flight of ideas; or

d. Inflated self-esteem; or

e. Decreased need for sleep; or

f. Easy distractibility; or

g. Involvement in activities that have a high probability of painful consequences which are not recognized; or

h. Hallucinations, delusions or paranoid thinking; or

3. Bipolar syndrome with a history of episodic periods manifested by the full symptomatic picture of both manic and depressive syndromes (and currently characterized by either or both syndromes);

AND

B. Resulting in at least two of the following:

1. Marked restriction of activities of daily living; or

2. Marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; or

3. Marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or

4. Repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration;

OR

C. Medically documented history of a chronic affective disorder of at least 2 years' duration that has caused more than a minimal limitation of ability to do basic work activities, with symptoms or signs currently attenuated by medication or psychosocial support, and one of the following:

1. Repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration; or

2. A residual disease process that has resulted in such marginal adjustment that even a minimal increase in mental demands or change in the environment would be predicted to cause the individual to decompensate; or

3. Current history of 1 or more years' inability to function outside a highly supportive living arrangement, with an indication of continued need for such an arrangement.

&gt;I absolutely think that there are changes that need to be made within SSA. People like your father fall into these traps where they aren't quite old enough, or just not quite bad enough to be allowed.

He is over 50, thus the requirement it has to be any job no longer applies like it did initially, so this doesn't matter. The second part highlights the problem. For someone who is in constant pain as if he is on fire with the most painful disease on the planet, stacked with other physical ailments like arthritis, on top of 10 different medications that don't even allow him to drive to not be ""bad enough"" says all there is to say about how the cards are stacked against you. If that isn't considered disabled and unable to work, then we don't have to search very far on what the problems are.

What would I change? First, both the rules and the mentality needs to change. The entire system is built around telling you No. It leaves no benefit of the doubt to the applicant, nor does it even give a shred of impartiality. My lawyer is the only Ohio Certified Specialist in Social Security Disability Law in my state and gives training to others, and at the ALJ stage, he told me they could literally deny every single case that comes to their desk and have a legal reason to do so. What part of this is trying to actually distinguish who is disabled?

In our last hearing, the judge actually proclaimed, ""I've never heard of full body RSD, are you sure you have that?"" After looking directly at the medical record that states it. Does that sound like someone trying to help someone disabled? The mentality currently is, ""What loophole in the law can I find to tell this person No"". That needs to change. While the judge gets to ride her horses on her acres of land(overheard this convo she had with the guard), my dad sits in shambles with his house falling apart and no A/C for 4 years running. When you have someone who is even close to borderline ""disabled"" according to guidelines, they need to be given benefit of the doubt. You are playing with a person's life here, not deciding on what's for lunch.

I would change the role of medications in determination. My dad is like a zombie on his meds. The amount of things he isn't allowed to do is a list just as long as his actual disabilities, including driving. This needs to be a factor. 

I would also change the sheer ridiculousness of the entire process. My dad can't even remember to pay his bills. If he hadn't of had kids, how was ever supposed to go through this process? People wonder why there are so many homeless? This is part of it. We have waited 5 years and counting. How does someone with no kids live 5 years with no income? Unless you are 100% mentally there, there is no way a single person can keep up with this process.

When reading both the ALJs decisions and the Attorney General at the federal cases, your honesty is used against you and your words twisted. I could go on and on and on about what a joke this is.

For now, I'll just say what I tell everyone else. You better pray you never become disabled before 62, and pray you can work full-time the entire time or you are going to go through a hell you have never experienced.

If you have no rent, utilities, trailer payment, etc, you may only get $21.00. If she has real rent (not on a car) she'll probably get the full amount, ~200.00. I think this is why her QMB (Medicare help) is screwy! If she doesn't end up with the full amount, her check amount is definitely already enough to get by! Also, some states are better than others.

I simply don't see how a DISABLED person is going to use the bathroom several times a day in your van scenario. I've lived in a damn nice travel trailer all over the country, and the details of doing it are not that easy. 

Answer this: How will she stay warm? How will she stay cool? Van dwelling is hard. What happens when she has to poop, for gods sake?

So:

*The monthly motels can be had for around $800 or less. Or a mobile home park, bills paid. 

*SNAP, *$194.00. (She CAN get this if she's paying RENT)

*Medical, free, except for under $3.00 for most drugs.

*Toilet paper, but not needed at the motel. ~$8.00

*$3.00 each for each drug.

So she needs a check of $808.00 + drug deductables. And a few bucks for Dollar Tree, please.

It's not technically discrimination if they believe that the accommodations I would need fundamentally alter the academic standards of the curriculum.

There are a few vets out in the real world that practice this way, but nobody has ever graduated from a veterinary program already requiring those kinds of accommodations. Some human med schools have done it. But most human med schools still will not graduate a visually impaired student. Graduating me would be a huge risk for my school to take, and not all clients would be comfortable with a veterinarian who can't see very well so employment once I graduate may be difficult to come by.

At least the HK notes will corroborate the diagnosis even if they don't recommend accommodations. 

Since you are submitting to ETS and not to a school there is no guarantee, even if you had both doctor's supporting the accommodations, that your request will be granted. I think that you are probably underestimating yourself a bit. You've got a Masters in Mathematical Finance with only accommodations for that last year, if I'm reading your post correctly. You made it through presumably 5-6 years of rigorous, collegiate coursework without accommodations. If they do deny your request I would bet that you will do well on the GRE; you just can't make it a 'self fulfilling prophecy' and tell yourself that you can't succeed without them. 

EDIT
I just saw that you posted this on a bunch of other subs and the kinds of accommodations you're asking for. I mean, you are really shooting for the moon here. The whole point of the GRE, ACT, SAT, etc is that they are **standardized** tests; it is supposed to even the playing field and give a grad program an objective measure to compare students with. Its one thing to ask for a little extra time, or maybe a spot in the front of the room with less distractions, but to ask for extra time, the ability to eat/drink as much as you want, and take unfettered bathroom breaks puts you at such a significant advantage over other students. Not to mention the possible test integrity issue with you leaving the room so much.

I know that this is not a popular sentiment on this sub, but at some point asking for too many accommodations will hurt your employment abilities in the long run. You made it through 20-24 years of your life without the accommodations; and, to me, now it seems that you are asking for these accommodations not because you *need* them, but because you think you will score better. ANY student taking the GRE would do better in a private room with extra time and unlimited breaks. The goal of accommodations is to even the playing field, not put you at an advantage. I think that it can be short-sided to request all sorts of accommodations that may or may not be available in a ""real"" working environment. You'd be better off finding a right combination of meds and coping mechanisms to function without the accommodations. Getting a B+ without accommodations is better than getting an A by having the bar lowered.

By the time I explain to them that I had an anxiety attack and couldnt call in they have already cut me my last check and looking for someone else 

plus I do not have the skills or ability to do any hugh paying jobs.

So I would steer clear of  being overly optimistic about what therapy can do, it's not necessarily going to drastically change your overall well-being and that may need to be acknowledged. For me, it's about maintaining certain abilities for longer even though I know that in the long-term I'm likely to lose them. The benefit to me is when I compare myself to people with my disability and I see that I'm able to do things they are no longer able to do. My day will come when that's no longer the case but I'm honestly glad that it's not at 25 years old and may be at 35 instead. It's also about the bigger picture. Therapists focus a lot on strength and mobility but therapy has other benefits too, it keeps the cardio and respiratory system as healthy as possible.

Growth spurts are a tough one. Those affected me too. I'd improve strength and then have a growth spurt and suddenly I was back to square 1 because the additional weight of my body negated the increase in strength. So it was like a constant game of catch up and it was exhausting and demoralizing. Up until the age of 8, I used to wear calipers to help me stand up and I could use a walker to shuffle about super slowly. I had a wheelchair but my parents were very strict about me having to use my calipers for several hours a day as a form of exercise. When I got to age 8, my body was just too big for me to be able to stand without being exhausted and I stopped being able to shuffle around with my walker. It went from being a boring but tolerable experience to being torture so my mum asked me if I wanted to stop and I said yes. 

When I was 11, I had a massive spinal surgery. After the surgery, I lost a lot of strength in my arms which completely changed the way my parents treated me and I recognize now that it was because they were panicked. I didn't understand that then. Surgery can take an enormous toll on the body. Before surgery, I used to love swimming because everything felt easier in the water. After surgery it became too difficult. This was a major issue between my parents and myself. They could not understand how I could suddenly hate something I loved so much and swimming is so so good for people with mobility or respiratory issues. They were obsessed with getting me into the pool to improve my strength after surgery. They meant well but they consistently guilted me into swimming and sometimes they even forced it when I had clearly said no and when I was obviously in pain. There were times when I cried as I was put into the pool and cried during the entire swimming session too. This went on for years (not weeks or months, years!) and it created a lot of resentment inside me. The fact that their intentions were good did not matter to me at the time. I became extremely reactive to any form of therapy and it backfired badly on everyone because I refused to do anything at all and it's much harder to force a 16 year old than it is to force an 11 year old. 

Fast forward to my 20s, I decided to go to psychotherapy and I've started to learn about loving your body. It hadn't ever occurred to me that I should love my body. It had always been treated like something that needed to be fixed. I was used to decisions being made for my body, without my opinion mattering anymore. I'm 25 now and recently I decided to start doing little exercises by myself but I feel upset that I haven't had therapy in several years. I can't get back the strength I lost in that time, it has been too long now. I think if things had been different, if I had been treated differently, I wouldn't have reacted the way I did and lost so much valuable time. But, the past is the past and I can only change the present. 

Sorry this is so long, I hope that you can get something useful out of other peoples experiences even if it's not the same exact situation as what is happening with your child.

I really don't like Apple Products, but it looks like the Apple Watch can monitor wheelchair usage...

""As part of its watchOS 3 update - which will be a free update available to all Apple Watches; no new hardware is required - Apple has researched and designed the Activity app so it can track distance, speed and calories burned when wheeling, instead of just walking or running.

It will determine calories burned in a wheelchair according to how hard the surface is, such as carpet or asphalt, and its gradient - whether the person is pushing uphill or rolling downhill. Different seats and wheel heights are also considered, and varying formulas for different disabilities.

While I think it's great that you want to get more exercise, losing weight through exercise alone is actually very difficult. You don't burn nearly as many calories as most people think exercising and need to look at your daily calories too. Even though your stomach is much smaller, if you are eating calorie dense foods it's certainly possible to plateau out like you're doing.

Weight loss is done in the kitchen, and strength and mobility done in the gym. As you have had a bypass, are you still in contact with your doctors? They should be able to refer you to a dietician/nutritionist to give you a hand with your meal planning. By all means go ahead and get a handcycle, but don't rely on it solely for weight loss. I can eat back in one meal all the exercise I do with six gym workouts a week! I'd suggest you contact the local bicycle clubs in your area, they normally either know the para cycle sports clubs in their area or occasionally have them as part of their own group.

You can also do good work in your standard chair, I do/did 'runs' of around 30 miles a week total in my chair, split into a 15 and 3 x 5. You can track yourself using Strava and make it harder with added weights to the frame or incorporating hill runs once it gets too easy. If you have a local gym ask for a tour - I was surprised at the amount of machines that move to let me in in my chair, so it's worth checking. And you can always do weights which is great for general strength as well as calorie burning. 

I've been unable to exercise for the last two months due to a brain injury but am still losing a steady 2lb a week which is a healthy, sustainable loss, purely through reduced calorie intake. If you eat less than your TDEE (basic daily energy requirements) you will continue to lose weight with your bypass. If you'd like to get a headstart before talking to your doctor I suggest /r/fitness, there are a lot of people there who have had bypass/banding/diversion surgeries and will have been in exactly your position.",1,,1,0,0,
e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1470799024,"I am specifically replying to your question 'is it worth applying for disability'. I am not a disability examiner, just someone who knows a few people who have been through it. There are a couple of examiners on the board, one of them may pop in.

&gt; Those stopped mostly due to me refusing to take them and willfully acting as if they were doing more harm than good because I don't agree with changing my state of mind.

This isn't going to go down well with an examiner. Many people have to change in order to survive, be that with medication, through therapy, using assistive devices. If everyone refused to take medical assistance because they didn't want to change, there would be a tremendous number of people on disability.

The system expects people to take responsibility for their own health and only support those where long term treatment has not worked. If some medication has not worked for you, speak to your doctor and try another. Bear in mind as well that antidepressants particularly take several weeks to have a full effect, so it will take time. Taking medication as a teenager is also very different from taking medication as an adult, at 24 you will have changed a lot.

&gt; For myself, I group that sort of stuff alongside drugs and alcohol because it changes who I am. 

You are welcome to classify it that way if that's how you feel. However a disability examiner will not see a medication to help a health problem as the same as drugs and alcohol. You are asking for money from the taxpayer, as such they expect you to have made reasonable attempts to deal with your own illnesses and that includes trying medication. 

&gt; Since finishing high school I have no medical record of my mental state 

You will not qualify. You must see a doctor and get up-to-date medical records. 

&gt; I also believe I might have Asperger's or a similar disorder

Do you have a record of a medical professional saying you have Aspergers or a similar disorder? If not, you cannot use this. Self diagnosis means absolutely nothing to a disability examiner, they won't even take it into account.

I would suggest you make an appointment with a doctor, see about trying some talking therapy or new medication. Once you have a handle on the basics you can ask to be referred or recommended a service that helps people with disabilities get back into work. Given your lack of medical records and unwillingness (not inability) to follow treatment, you won't be accepted for SSDI.",2,,2,0,0,

&gt; 30% is first the initial application. That's acceptable to you? 

It is, and here is why: When you picture someone applying for disability you are picturing your dad. What you don't see are the people who are forced to apply for SSDI to get medical benefits (a requirement for a lot of state's Medicaid programs), to satisfy probation requirements (if you have a pending application you don't have to look for a job), and those people who don't consider themselves disabled but just can't find work. I would say that, out of 10 applications (and this is going to be anecdotal), maybe 6-7 of those applications are ""legitimate"". And that allowance rate also factors in non-medical factors. So if someone is over the resource limit for SSI, or they have been out of work for 10 years and so aren't insured for SSDI - those count towards the rate as well. Those people could very well *be* disabled but they don't qualify for the program. The reconsideration (step between initial and judge) and appeals council levels are statistically the lowest because they are designed as more of a ""check"" system for the level before. You said that 90% of claims are denied implying that it the total of all levels which is not accurate. 

I absolutely think that there are changes that need to be made within SSA. People like your father fall into these traps where they aren't quite old enough, or just not quite bad enough to be allowed. People forget that being disabled means that there are NO jobs that a person could perform in the national economy; it is not just whether they could go back to what they used to do (or, as we see a lot of with younger claims) what they want to do.

I could go on and on about the things that SSA could improve, and, while they do make minor changes to the program throughout the year, it is hard to make major changes to the program. You are approaching the problem emotionally, from a client-based perspective (which is totally expected given your situation). 

From a pragmatic standpoint - what would you change? Honestly. If you make it so that 70% of claims are allowed how are we going to pay for it? The retirement wing of SSA is in financial trouble so I guarantee any sort of changes to shore-up the program go there first.  If your goal was to expand to the 70% what changes should we make? Just allow anyone over a certain age? do we do it by condition? If you make the program requirements too lax the program will go bankrupt and, then everybody will be SOL. This is where the problem becomes the representation in the legislative branch, not SSA. ",3,,3,0,0,

For my understanding (someone else feel free to correct me) is that lawyers basically fill out minor paperwork for the application and then send off for records, updating them monthly. When they really shine is during the ALJ. However I have had many clients report that sometimes their lawyer didn't even know their face/name and listened to the judge, presented no information and the case was closed (and lost). I do think you have to toe the line with making sure you're lawyer is invested in your case without becoming annoying. For the record I have heard that the field doesn't pay very well for lawyers and they do have to keep case loads high in order to keep their doors open. 

SSA states that they make ""all reasonable attempts to obtain records"" which sounds great but when you look closer it stays they they simply mail a request out twice. If there is no reply they then don't pursue it. Usually large hospitals get everything send in fast and efficiently but private practice therapists etc will often drop the ball. I'm sure they don't have the resources to be as compliant and it would be a good idea to give them a ring if you're missing something from them, just as a friendly follow up. 

The doctor assigned by SSA (the CE physician as you will see it in paperwork) is there to make an independent examination. Their opinion carries less weight than your pcp or specialist but they can help fill in gaps that you're Doctor may have left out of their documentation. This isn't was I was referring to however. 

The RFC form (residual functional capacity) is completed by your doctor and details how your disability limits your ability to work.

As for important things for a parent to know: when it comes to public education (if that's what you decide to do for your son), know your rights. Don't let school administrators short-change your son on accommodations he is entitled to. Read his IEP carefully and address anything that seems fishy with the school team.  My IEP team once tried to put a provision that if I got all As, my accommodations would be revoked because I would be ""demonstrating adequate coping skills."" Literally. 

Let me know if you ever need someone to talk to. While CP impacts the lives of the people who have it most, it is incredibly hard for their caretakers as well. Don't burn yourself out. Care for yourself so you can care for your son.

A little bit about SSDI/SSI. They are completely different from a financial perspective. Exactly the same as far as disability requirements to obtain them. If you can collect SSDI, that's a better benefit in many ways. You can have unlimited assets, if you were to marry you wouldn't lose your benefits and his income wouldn't count against you.

Focus on how your disability detracts from living. The lawyer I had asked me questions like, Am I able to fold laundry (I cant). What is wrong with you isnt nearly as important as your inability to function. Thats what they look for.

Audiometry. Your average hearing threshold sensitivity for air conduction must be 90 decibels (dB) or worse in your better ear, and you must have a bone conduction hearing threshold of 60 decibels (dB) or worse in your better ear. Your hearing loss needs to be calculated by averaging your hearing at the sound frequencies of 500 hertz (Hz), 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz.

OR

Word recognition test. You must not be able to repeat more than 40% of a list of standardized words spoken in a word recognition test (which tests speech discrimination).

I've had Ankylosing Spondylitis since 17, (28 now), and I just started using a cane last year. I have been figuratively hitting myself with it for not using one all these years. 

Get one with a nice pattern or color you like, decorate that thing with some rhinestones or stickers or paint or whatever! It makes it actually fun to use and walk with when you get compliments about what now feels like a fashion accessory, not a medical necessity. Depending on the sort of cane you need, you can probably find something on Amazon (that's where I get mine! I like collapsible canes too, so I can fold it up and stick it in my purse when I'm not using it, or if I'm having a good day but don't want to risk being out without it. I'm constantly on the lookout for crazy fun canes too, like at Renaissance Faires- I really want a sweet wizard staff, haha

I was really self conscious about using it at first, and was scared of the stigma attached to being more visibly disabled, but mostly it's been a wonderful change. For me the biggest benefit is people don't yell at me (or even follow me into places) for using handicapped parking (I have a placard). For whatever reason, this is a huge problem for me where I am. 

But with my cane out, that doesn't happen. People are politer to me, hold doors when my free arm is full, and even pick things up when I drop them (my meds make me clumsy, it happens a lot!). I especially notice more senior citizens will compliment my pretty pink cane, and give me often welcome words of encouragement. 

The extra attention isn't always welcome admittedly, I want to be a person not a pity project, and sometimes people try too much to ""help"" and just offend. But I will take well meaning interlopers over being stared at while I limp along unassisted, or stalked by self appointed parking police. Some of the politeness of strangers is however honestly probably at least partially because I am a super smiley petite white woman who looks maybe 18-20, and I can't ignore that this gives me a certain level of privileged perception by others... :-/ ",2,,2,0,0,

If it was your reconsideration decision or if you live in a prototype state, you can appeal at the hearing level and may want to see if an attorney will represent you.

In the meantime, continue receiving treatment for your GAD.  If at all possible, seek regular treatment from a specialist, not just your primary care physician.  Try to make sure the specialist keeps good records which include periodic discussions of your symptoms, their severity, and whether you are improving/worsening/same.  If you can't afford a specialist, try to go to a clinic/free psych help program if you can tolerate being outside the house.  Going to the rehab program is almost certainly a good idea if your insurance will cover it, even if it's only for three days.

It is odd that the decision included a residual functional capacity assessment with physical limitations if you have not alleged any physical impairments.  Typically, psych only denials only include non-exertional limitations, for example: simple, routine, repetitive work with no more than occasional contact with co-workers and no contract with the general public.

Regarding short on the job training, it's likely you were limited to unskilled work at SVP 2 due to symptoms of your GAD.  SVP 2 jobs are defined as taking no more than 30 days to learn.

Real talk though, unless you have anxiety so bad you need a social worker/family member if you leave the house, or have regular decompressive episodes (panic attacks so bad they require hospitalization), you're in for a tough sell to SSA.  It's not easy to get approved when you're so young and only have depression/anxiety. 

My advice would be to try to find a job you can do from home if you have trouble going places.  Maybe learn to code and do contracting work, or get the skills to do editing or copywriting.  Plus, with no work history, SSI alone doesn't pay much, although the Medicaid is very helpful to those without insurance.  In general though, being employed is better if you can at all manage it.  Regardless, SSA won't hold it against you if you try -in fact, multiple attempts where you have to cease working due to symptoms of your impairment is seen as a positive credibility factor.",4,,4,0,0,

The point I was making, and rereading it, I feel it is still clear, is that as a society we must judge each action for itself and stop being so doggoned pissed about everything. Can you infer the intent from the photographers and  models in the pictures? Was their conferred intent to insult? No. It was not. One must be looking for a reason be insulted to judge their actions as worthy of offense. 

The author goes so far as to say that they don't know why this is offensive, but that it probably is: reaching much?

As for my best friend: yes, I can reasonably infer his intention because I know the circumstances surrounding it.

And the guy at the gym? Based on the rest of my conversation with him, I can infer that he was trying to negate the problem's severity, while still trying to acknowledge that a problem existed: but he failed. Am I really offended by him? No - because I can reasonably infer that no offense was intended.

We, as a people, have the responsibility to judge each act by itself, based on the j formation we have at the time (the evidence at hand,  or the circumstantial evidence). If we make up a few arbitrary ""offensive"" things and judge everyone universally to those standards, we are the absurd ones.

Further, there is a big freaking difference between causing offense and ethnic cleansing.... Like.... Huge..... Like.... Did you really make that argument?

One is based off of social rules that change frequently (growing up, I was ""physically challenged,"" then I was ""handicapable,"" then I was ""mobility challenged,"" and now *everyone of these terms is considered by some to be offensive*) when the rules change to fit the whims of the sub-culture, (that's the definition of arbitrary) - we cannot expect to apply those rules university. Thus, judged intent, based on context, is critical to understand whether we should be offended.

Ethnic cleansing, on the other hand, is not really acceptable anywhere, and thus the behavior of ethnic cleansing can be reasonably assumed to be wrong regardless of other context, and regardless of intent: because it is universally, not arbitrarily wrong.

TL:DR - my call is that we use attribution inference, not fundamental attribution error, because I am saying that we should make individual inferences based off of surrounding context.

And if you are so easily offended by every word that might be construed to be offended, that makes me sad. Ours (the disabled) is a hard enough world without assuming that everyone is out to get us.

It can be hard to differentiate for people who aren't versed in either disability or disability issues.

Just like the fact that I'm queer, that I have mental health issues, that I like science fiction, that my family immigrated to another country when I was little doesn't define my entire being neither does the fact that I've got a genetic physical disability that looks like cerebral palsy. 

At the same time, I get the fear that that's all people see. And part of the problem is how invisible we are in society, and how ignored we are, and oppressed. There are many different groups of people who fear that when they are meeting people for the first time - and it just takes getting to know the person to make that go away - but it's made more awkward for many because of how absent we are in workplace (the rates are similar in the US and Canada, for those of us able to work we have an unemployment rate that's more than double for non disabled people), the media, etc etc.

I think what I'm trying to say is I get it, because it's happened to me - but at the same time I don't want to deny my disability as something that is essential to my being - and if it means being loud about it, and having to explain it to people over and over I will. No, I won't always be nice about it because sometimes I get angry as fuck, and annoyed, and I'm tired of it.

In regards to you being unsure still about mental disabilities, if you don't want to be uncomfortable, you can read articles/watch documentaries/etc, the more exposure we get to things, the easier it can be to approach it, it gets less scary the more information and time we spend with it.

When that happens, a weird thing I've noticed is if I'm listening to just a voice with no video to see the speaker's face as they're talking, even though I can hear the sound, I sometimes have difficulty deciphering the words. It's similar to like how if you repeat the same word over and over eventually it stops sounding like a word at all and just becomes gibberish sound, if that makes sense. Is that similar to the difficulty you experience with people wearing masks in movies? That you can hear the sound of the voice, but the visual disconnection somehow makes it difficult to decipher the words you're hearing?

962bc8ef-23eb-429d-bec6-b55a57f46549,1470675842,"Adapt. Adapt. Adapt.

As a mentor to kids with disabilities and as a person with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita ( AMC ) 
I often find myself having to adapt to the world around me.  We live in a world that's NOT designed for the disabled. 
 We are the minority.  And that's sorta ok. There are more able-bodied people out there than chairs. so this makes sense.  
Living in the US happens to be a good thing because city planners have to abide by the law of putting in curb cuts and 
providing street access to both the physically and visually impaired citizen.  
Other countries don't necessarily have these things set into law yet.

Your question really should be broken down into different sections.


Socially:


As a person who grew up with very small legs and a huge upper body, I just looked different. I walked different and used a chair sometimes. 
There was no getting around it.  So I just learned to accept that as a fact , much like the fact that my brothers were white and I was brown.  Humor was a huge part of my upbringing and I learned very early on that if you can't laugh at yourself or your situation, then life's gonna be hard.  As an adult, I have explored many interests and have found friends that share these same interests.  This has led to friendships, community and a healthy social life.
I try not use my disability as a ""crutch"" for meeting women.  Yes, some members of the opposite sex are shallow.  that's just how this world works.  They put more weight into how a person looks vs how a person really is or doesn't want to take the time to get to know someone.  Well guess what? we all do this whether we think it or not. 

My mom once asked me ""Aedonr do you have a date to the prom?  I was like ""no cause I am disabled and was feeling sorry for myself"", to which she replied, ""ok then if you don't have a date to the prom and Prom happens, you will be grounded until you leave this house cause you are acting like a moron and if you don't ask anyone in the first place and deal with the rejection and move on then that's worse than not even trying at all and sitting in your room blaming it on your disability""
Dammit , mom was right, I asked a girl out that I worked with and she had no issues going with me.  HOWEVER SHE WORE HIGH HEELS AND WAS HELLA TALL. lol.  But EVERYONE is hella tall compared with me. Just sayin.


Physically:


I have used crutches and a wheelchair for my life.  As I get older, I find myself using a chair more often than not because it saves wear and tear on my hands and wrists. I find that having my hands free allows me to interact with people in a more ""natural"" manner then having my hands be supporting me while standing on my crutches.
I will often get a wheelchair and tweak it so it fits my specific needs.  I have smaller legs so my lap is small and cant hold stuff so I have attached bungies to my chair so that I can use them to strap things to the front when I need to carry something.  I didn't like the sideguards on my chair so I created a template, went to the plastic store and had some made that fit my chair perfectly.  They work well with the bungies that I use.


I am not one of those people that get angry when someone tries to help me.  I see them as a person that just simply wants to help out.  I say ""thanks, but I got it"".. or ""Sure, that would be nice"".  I see the world as a group of people just trying to make it and sometimes we gotta rely on each other for help.  Sometimes I am in a grocery store and I need something off the top shelf and while I COULD do some sort of gymnastic move on one arm, I find myself simply approaching someone and saying  ""Hey your tall, can you grab something for me?"".  I love doing this with someone who clearly isn't that tall, but loves to be called ""tall"" and is taller than me so its all about perspective.  Its also a good way to randomly meet cute women. Just sayin.


Emotionally:


Guess what? If you let it, you can become disabled in two places.  Physically and Emotionally.  Sitting around complaining that the world is out to get you and wont adapt to YOUR needs will stunt your ability to grow emotionally.  

This goes for all people able-bodied and not. 

 
You have to learn to adapt to this crazy world and take some ownership over where life is taking you.  Once you do this, you will find out that you really have a lot of control and power over the things in your life.  Love, Friends, family... if your head isn't in the right place, these things can be greatly affected by how you are dealing with things internally.

Sometimes its just a simple matter of perspective and changing it.

this exactly, the complaint should be filed with the instructor, not the disability services department.  I've seen this case a lot, where a student says they need an exam moved because of an appointment.  If the appointment is crucial to your health and absolutely 100% no questions asked could not be changed, then the exam should have been moved.

to put it in to perspective, a university disability services office cannot move exam times/dates unless it conflicts with another course (i.e. extended time accommodations) or the exam is held outside of their office's hours and the instructor is not able to provide accommodations. of course if the instructor just said it was okay to reschedule, that's a completely different story and likely the nice/courteous thing to do, but not legally",1,,1,0,0,

I will say that you are correct that the medical records you do have are going to be too old. You likely were applying for SSI and they only look at 12 months prior to your filing date. Medical conditions, especially mental ones, wax and wane over time. The fact that you had some 5150 hospitalizations years ago has no real bearing on your current status.

If I can be honest with you I think that where you need to put your focus is getting yourself into treatment. Disability is really intended for those medical conditions that are disabling *despite* medical treatment. You say you've taken steps to better yourself, which is great, but you need to give medical treatment a try again. Depression, anxiety, and ADHD are conditions that generally improve with treatment. Getting into treatment also then has the secondary effect of starting a paper trail should you decide to apply for disability again. If you are in treatment for a year (and really put in the work and effort) and things are still no better then you can apply again but this time you'll have a big stack of medical records to support your claim.

f8ac573a-3576-4db7-8773-7060c72d4b86,1471293042,"Ok, great! Unfortunately I have very little awareness of the USA's educational system and how it differs from Canada's, so I won't be able to compare them much, sadly.

I was diagnosed with several serious medical conditions as a preteen, so my experience as a disabled person interacting with the educational system started for me in grade 8, which was high school (The school I attended was 8 - 12). It was DISASTROUS. I had multiple teachers flat-out accuse me of faking doctor's notes that I would bring in, explaining things like why morning classes were hard for me, why I yawned a lot in class (I seriously had one teacher on my ass about that, ""I'm sorry, am I *boring* you?"" all of the time, while I was blitzed out on prescribed painkillers in an attempt to be functional.) The worst was my P.E. teacher, because even though I had doctors' and parents' notes, at that point my illnesses were still invisible, so he thought I was 'faking' to get out of more strenuous P.E. activities. I had to monitor my heart rate and the gist of the notes was that I was supposed to make my own calls about what I could or could not do, in terms of exercises, based on my body that day. The P.E. teacher did not have that, and I'd get a lot of the usual refrain people with invisible illness get, ""Well you look fine,"" and ""Yesterday you could do it!"" I was an A+ nerd student previous to illness, and my dramatic lapse in grades and constant school absences had the teachers label me as a ""delinquent"". My poor parents tried advocating for me but it was hard going, and I eventually left school anyway halfway through grade 10 because of my health, but also largely because of the zero support I got at school, and how hostile it felt.

I got a lot more support when I attempted distance learning, which is sort of like home-schooling except assignments would be mailed (wow that ages me - this is before everyone had a computer and the internet). Though there was more support, they weren't particularly equipped to help with my specific needs, so it fizzled out.

I tried an ""alternative"" high school after that, basically for kids who couldn't cut it at ""regular"" high school, the demographic of which was about 50/50 kids with hardcore criminal histories and kids with serious medical illnesses or disabilities, so it was a weird mix. Amazing though is that we all seemed to get along as ""under dogs"" and I got a LOT more peer support their than I ever had before. However, because these were two such disparate groups, the school didn't have a cohesive plan for helping each person individually, and shortly after I left, the school (in that current iteration) closed.

The best experiences I've had were with further education, from a local college and from the Ministry of Education. The local college I attended had an amazing disability resource centre (DRC), and right off the bat helped me assess what my needs were and how I could go about getting them met so I could attend school there. They were always available for check-ins and to help, and would create form-letters to give to professors that explained I was registered with the DRC (without disclosing my specific disabilities!) and what my needs were. They held professor's accountable too, and would help me make sure of a professor's reputation before I signed up for a class. I had zero negative experiences with professors because of this! After my experiences with high school, I was blown away by how pro-active and accessible the DRC was. They also helped me get grants from the ministry of education, who has some awesome programs to encourage people with disabilities to go to school... So each year I'd be eligible for $2400 per semester (so $4800 total) for tuition, text books, and accommodation materials. I had to be accountable and show what I was spending the money on, so it wasn't just like free cash money, ha ha. But it made a HUGE difference for me. I also was given a macbook and a printer for free!! Which made a huge difference for me, especially the printer, because that was just another issue in terms of needing to leave the house (which is hard somedays). Also because I live on financial assistance because of my disabilities, there was no way in hell I could afford either of those pieces of equipment otherwise. Woo Ministry of Education!

So the TL;DR of it is, high school experiences were shit, and I largely think that is because at that stage the Ministry of Education doesn't seem so involved and policies regarding children with disabilities are lacking. College was awesome and helped me along every step of the way, for which I am so grateful! They hooked me up with the Ministry of Education, with whom I've only ever had positive experiences!",2,,2,0,0,

You can request to not have a payee and, if you have your doctor's support, it should not be a big problem. The payee part is not part of the official ""decision"" so you can't appeal that part of it so there is no need to worry that they will overturn the decision.  

There is a misconception that a payee will ""control"" your life. That really is not the case. A payee has a fiduciary responsibility to make sure your basic needs (home, food, medical) are met. I always recommend an institutional payee over a family member. You may have to pay a bit for their services (although some community mental health centers have them for free if you use their other services) but they have strict rules that they need to follow. Sure, they will 'control' it to a certain degree - they won't let you spend your entire check on lotto tickets in lieu of rent - but after your bills are paid they money is yours to spend as you see fit. SSA recommends payees in situations where there is evidence that you would have difficulty with managing your own finances. A history of impulsive spending behavior, mental illness that has a lot of psychosis/loss of contact with reality, dementia, mental retardation, and a history of substance abuse. ",4,,4,0,0,

First, as others have said, you can appeal the payee decision. 

Second, there are several agencies that can act as your payee. Most agencies that are disability advocate agencies provide this function, as well as agencies that contract with community mental health agencies. Additionally, any adult over the age of 18 can provide this function for you, so you can have anyone do it really.

When the agencies do it, they vary widely on how they handle it. Some are super bad with everyone, some are super lenient, some are very responsible and handle things on a client by client basis according to their needs. You get to decide who your payee is and can change it at any time. You control that process. Ask around. People will tell you where the right place is if you need to go the agency route.

That's still a pathetic approval rate. 90% is when you deny the appeal after it before it goes to the ALJ and waste everyone's time. It's now in the 40's for ALJ to approve, and the appeals council is 2% approval rate.

Look, I'm not saying you are a bad guy, but you not recognizing there is a huge problem and you are part of it is why it will never change.

Not to get into specifics and I know you weren't the worker here, but when our case first started 5 YEARS ago, my dad, a crane operator\heavy truck loader was denied by the case worker because he could stand 2 hours out of an 8 hour work week and still had 50% range of motion that he is not disabled. That is not an acceptable metric, and shows both no basis in reality and zero clue on how the work force operates. It is now 5 years later and his condition is much, much worse with still no end to denials in site.

At this point, telling the truth gets you out on the street in shambles and jobless for 5 years with medical conditions you can't cure. It is simply better to recommend acting like you are manically depressed and suicidal, and throw in a few other displays of craziness and cruise control to SSDI, and that would be the exact advice I would give to anyone who cannot work due to disabilities.

Sorry to rant on you, but the SSDI system is a broken piece of trash that doesn't care if someone is actually disabled, and both you and the general public need to understand how bad it is to get any progress on changing it.
