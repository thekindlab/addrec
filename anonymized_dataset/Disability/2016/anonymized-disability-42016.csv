The idea is that SSI is supposed to be the bare min anyone can possibly survive on, which means in theory it would be impossible for you to live off of it if any of it were being siphoned off. 

By the same logic a lot of creditors/collections agencies are banned from going after a bank account if SSI is the only source of the deposits. However a single deposit from a non-SSI source, like if you deposited a $10 check once two years ago, ruins the immunity and would allow lenders to go after the funds.

The one about blind people having sharper senses is actually true; when you don't use that part of your brain for vision, it goes to other senses, most prominently touch. That's my understanding at the very least; if anyone thinks I'm wrong, go ahead and call me out on it.

However, it's absolute bullshit that someone without a disability should ""try out"" disabled life for a day. That statement is highly presumptive and condescending as it assumes the medical model of disability. Disabled people tend to assume the social model, not the medical model; we tend to believe that it is social constraints that disable us more than our diagnoses do. Think about it for a moment. There is no Braille section of Barnes and Noble, and that lack is not a symptom of any visual impairment that I'm aware of.

The idea that autistic people don't like to be touched is also nonsensical. Some do despise being touched, but that's not always true. I'm autistic myself--and I can deal with being touched just fine. The only time I don't like it is if I'm visibly annoyed, angry, or otherwise stressed--largely because that's just how cortisol fucks with my brain.

And students with disabilities don't always learn best together. Disabled people are just that--people. There are personalities we like and personalities we hate.

If you google ""ssa sequential evaluation"" it will kind of take you through the steps. The Blue Book listings are designed for certain conditions (and severity of those conditions) that are so severe that they would preclude all work despite any other factors (age, education, past work, etc).  If SSA deems you to have at least 2 marked areas of limitation (or 1 extreme) due to your condition then yes, you will be allowed benefits. These marked limitations need to be present despite treatment.

When you apply for disability it is not your responsibility to obtain all of the necessary documentation. SSA will obtain all of your medical records to make their decision. You can supply supplemental documentation (letters from family, etc) but what really matters is what is in your medical records. 

Really the best thing that you can do at this point is just apply. I think that you are over-thinking the situation just a bit. Just make sure that you continue to get treatment during the course of the application because the treatment notes are going to be the best evidence of your disability. ",2,,2,0,0,

The problem with ALJ wait times is that there just aren't enough judges and too many people filing for disability over the last few years. With the most recent budget agreement they are flooding ODAR (the office of disability adjudication and review) with money to get more judges and support staff. But it takes time to train judges and with more and more boomers applying for disability its just hard to catch up. 

As for what you can do, there really isn't anything you can do to make it go faster. *Sometimes* a judge will grant a ""dire need"" waiver but those are rare. Dire Needs are intended for the most severe of circumstances that would need someone to jump the line. I believe the most common would be something like terminal cancer with only a few months to live (but generally this are allowances at the initial level unless its a new diagnosis). You can file a Dire Need request due to financial/housing constraints such as pending homelessness, etc but the unfortunately reality is that 85% of people filing for disability have those same types of problems so I don't think that they grant those waivers very often. 

One thing you can do is to make sure that you (or your lawyer) stay on top of your medical records and other documentation. Sometimes during a hearing a judge will then request some additional records (to fill in any gaps between when you first applied and the hearing) and if you can be proactive about getting them it can at least get you a decision a bit faster once you've had the hearing.

The frustration for me is that this is a change in the system due to inadequate doctors that puts imo unreasonable stress on patients. 

Normally when the system is working well I would have yearly monitoring appts with an opthamologist tied with imaging, the ophthalmologist would decide if/when/how to intervene and this would be reported back to my GP. The GP would oversee any prescriptions and make sure that there was no complications. Now it seems they want to push all of this onto a GP that I can't get because there is none available in the system

So that means I have to go to walk in clinics, wait for several hours to see a different doc every time, then explain every time what I have to this doc and tell them how to solve the issue.

I've already done this a few times and it sucks. There is no discussion, no consideration of anything that would work better; they are literally just drugs dispensers at this point. It's not fair to me and it's not fair to them.

But I don't agree with the idea that disability *always* means suffering, or that this suffering always comes from the body or mind. I agree there is someone born disabled or who developed it very early life vs. someone disabled as an adult.

Nondisabled people don't want to become disabled for the same reason a lot of developmentally disabled people don't want to become nondisabled. And that's understandable.

But on the flip side, a lot of DD people who say, ""we like who we are,"" are treated badly. An Autistic and dyspraxic actor got a lot of flack for *suggesting* an alternative to the word ""disorder."" In case someone didn't identify themselves with that term. It was awful because it told me that disabled people can't speak their minds on their own disabilities.

As you probably read, I am OCD. I suffer a lot due to the more obsessional parts. A lot of people trivialize OCD as just being orderly and clean, and that sucks. But I want accommodations and acceptance for the more compulsive parts (cups, occasionally writing, tics, recently checking, etc.) and for autism (including sensory hypersensitivity).

But there is a reason I talk largely about my own disability, because I don't want to speak for anybody else. I do talk about other disabilities, but I try to not override the opinions of people who actually have that disability. I want all disabled people to be able to speak their own mind on their own disability. I don't have most disabilities, and thus, it would be wrong to speak about it like I do.",2,,2,0,0,

Even if you are not legally married, they will still treat you as a married couple if the relationship is a marriage for *all practical purposes*.

One of the SSI questions thrown out there for annual re-eligibility testing is (paraphrased): ""are you in a relationship with someone YOU consider to be a like a spouse?""

Likewise a lot of gov programs are catching on to the fact that people, especially poorer people, just aren't getting married anymore by using the term ""couple"" in place of ""married couple."" I.e. a ""couple"" can have up to 1 car and $3,000 in financial assets. Whether that couple is legally married or not does not really matter.

Not that they would know whether two room mates are in a long term relationship or not. But if they ask you while under oath, you'd either have to lie (commit perjury- a crime) or answer accurately (&amp; possibly have benefits redacted &amp; have to pay the gov back for what they would see as overpayment).

Sometimes they are mine, others they are my wife.  We are required then to pay our lawyer at $375/hour (which we don't have) to review all this every year to protect ourselves.  

For us to get married we had too create what is known as a first party special needs trust, which acts as a shelter for income and can be used too reduce our income and prevent these bills.  This cost about $2,000 in legal fees when we got married to setup.  The issue is that there is some restrictions on how you can use money that is in the trust, and these restrictions and the rules regarding trusts change each year requiring additional lawyer fee's that we can not afford.  

Some of these restrictions are that you can not use the money for what you NEED, but only what you WANT... I can not use it to pay for food, but I can buy a computer with it.  I can pay for the mortgage, though up until this year we would have had to refinance and put the mortgage in both our names (this costs allot of money too refinance).  Putting the mortgage in our name would help, but the situation would re-appear when my wife graduates from school and her income increases.

Then a new bureaucrat gets hired by the county and she says that this is happening because the rules are changing and the old person in that job was supposedly not doing their job.  It is however pretty clear that she is attempting to cut spending.

It is true that a person's approval chances go up at each appeal level.

Millions of people apply for benefits each year; trust me we don't just do things to make more work for ourselves. The real reason that a person's approval changes increase is actually a very logical one. The longer that a person's claim is active the *more* medical evidence is added to the file. The more medical evidence that is received the greater the chance that someone will be allowed. When someone applies at the initial level that decision has maybe 12 months worth of medical records. At the recon level a few months later now maybe there is 18 months worth of records. Then at an ALJ level you may have 2-2.5 years of records.

Even more so if you are proactive about your projects and your paper hasn't passed its due date in which case I'm sorry I'm late and that you're like me. I am a 27 year old white male who is paralyzed from just above the waist down. It was the result of a fall when I was 22 and in college (finished). So on to trying to answering your questions without writing a book.
 
1. This is the hardest question to answer because of everything I learned in 5 years dating as a person with a disability and having dated as an able bodied individual till I was 22. For a long time it drove me crazy to think about the possibility of now having a greatly reduced population of women I could potentially be with and where it not for paralysis we would be madly in love. Some reading this will probably think the same as I have been told, ""well that's not someone you would want to be with"". I think this is a poorly thought out attempt at council. I've had times where it was all I was concerned about. More than just the concern of ""I want a girlfriend"" or ""I want to get laid"". **I was also quite bothered by things like society's unspoken responsibilities of a man, or some people's assumptions about wheelchair users being asexual or needy** I guess the only reason it bothered me is because I was told about this supposed feminist movement lol. For a while now dating has been much less of a concern. 

2. Personally, I would set this question up differently. No biggie though because I laughed at my knee-jerk answers like. ""Sure I'd date a girl in a chair, if I even remotely liked Bumper Cars"". But seriously, I know mine isn't the only disability but admittedly its the one I think of first. After all, there is a very bad picture of me in every parking lot and public bathroom in the country, but I digress. All the girls I've dated have been able bodied and the experiences were so variable it makes my head spin. I actually fucked my therapist in rehab once I was done with inpatient (oral and heavy kissing though since I didn't have medicine yet but I'll take the street cred) and we would have dated had I not only lived there for rehab. **I also dated a freak of an amazing woman whom I fell in love with and had the best sex of my life, pre or post paralysis**. I loved her for reasons beyond sex but sex is very important even more so to people in my situation. She was just so **open when talking about sex** and her interests were not only similar to mine but they complimented the strengths of a paraplegic sex life. **Also she not only didn't pitty me or tip-toe, she cracked jokes and made light of the fact like I do.** Only because its relevant, one Saturday we were out having fun all day and later had probably a four hour fuck session that afternoon which was followed by an awesome nap. She fell asleep with her head close to my feet and I had a spasm that woke her. Days later she told me her version of that nap. After my leg woke her up she laid there for a minute just looking at me. Then she put the palm of her hand on the sole of my foot hoping I could feel it and started crying. She told me that she loved me more because of it and it was kind of her time to ""mourn my injury"". That relationship unfortunately had a couple compounding Achilles heels or I imagine my two cents could stop here. At the other end of the spectrum, I'm currently seeing a gril that I won't be for much longer because its like she fears having an honest conversation about sex or almost anything personal. **Plus she doesn't let me go down on her, HUGE red flag**. Another time a while back, I was having a great conversation with a girl I liked and she said I should date a girl in a wheelchair and that she thought it would be super cute. For some reason her question disturbed me on many levels and objectively seems like the least enjoyable and least pragmatic relationship I can think of. Maybe it would be different ff she had feeling and could occasionally stand to avoid any relationship future be laced with wasted cabinet space ha. **Just to be clear, if the roles were switched I would absolutely date a girl in a wheelchair.**

3. **I would tell people with physical disabilities like using a wheelchair not to use tinder unless their self esteem is rock solid.** The whole premise of dating apps like that are to judge a book by its cover. So I say spare yourself the anxiety of being swiped from judgmental assumptions or the worry that you've been matched with an asexual weirdo that thinks you can't have sex and avoid the disappointment when she won't sit on your face. Lastly, **disabilities offer slightly messed up opportunities for a persons greatest strengths to shine.** Therefore, what is most important is knowing yourself well enough to be aware of those strengths and what makes you happy because no is dating an already unhappy person for very long. 

PS. I recommend this post as reading material to anyone with a spinal cord injury/wheelchair user, anyone doing a project like this one, or anyone who ever considered dating or is dating someone in a wheelchair.  When I found this I was confused and thought I posted it when I was drunk or something because it very much parallels how much I see intimacy as a wheelchair user.

My frustration with situations like these is that I feel like people are expected by society to provide care for their disabled partners. I'm not saying this is necessarily the case for you, perhaps you and your wife discussed these things and decided this is what you wanted - that's fine. A lot of the time though, partners are forced into caregiving roles because the right systems simply aren't in place to allow disabled people to live as independently as possible. For example, when my care allowance is decided by my council every year I am always asked if I have a partner or friends who can do it for free instead. As if having your partner assume a caregiving role always provides the same level of independence as a professional employee.

I don't know what your situation was exactly but I am sorry to hear that on top of having to deal with the emotional impact of your wife being very ill, you also had to endure a caregiving routine. That must have been tough.

I'll be honest, as a disabled person this is what scares the shit out of me when it comes to relationships. I never want my partner to be responsible for my care. It makes me so mad that we're not progressive enough as a society to provide people with the support they need regardless of their relationship status (this absolutely relates to benefits payments too).

So for example I require 24 hour care as I can't walk or stand, can't go to the bathroom myself, shower or dress or anything. Can't even get out of my house without assistance. Direct payments for care in the UK are related to income. If I was to get married, my partner's income would be counted and I would be completely unable to afford care. I'm not talking a few hundred $. My care costs £4,000 a month. Hence my sensitivity about the subject.

I needed a chair for large stores, malls, and stuff requiring walking more than that. At age 14, I got extremely sick, and was in bed for 2-2.5 months. For a lack of any better way to say it, I forgot how to walk. I went from being able to walk independently for just about a mile, to 20-30 feet on a good day.

d43ea476-9a65-4aa9-8133-c4b9e5b6ea8e,1461807264," If you get SSI, when you start working, SSI does not count the first $85.00 dollars you earn, you put it in your pocket and SSI will not count it as income. But, if you earn more than $85.00 dollars in a month, SSI will reduce your current months check, by one dollar for every two you earn. This is a major pain in the ass! It works like this, you receive your benefit check in the beginning of the month, but you don't know how much you'll earn until the end of the month. You then need to call SSA and report your gross earnings for the month. It then takes SSA approximately three months to deduct the ""countable earned income"" from your benefit check for the month you earned it. SSA calls this an ""overpayment"". They then send you a letter telling you they will reduce your next benefit check by half of the amount of money you earned over the first $85.00 dollars. As you can imagine it causes most folks, much stress and confusion. Also to make thing worse, extra income can affect food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing allotment. BTW, SSA does not care how many hours you work per day or week. Nor does SSA cae how long you work in months. Its only concerned in your gross income per month. Now, there are some exceptions, but it would take me the rest of the night to explain them.  For the whole story on SSA benefits while working, talk to the folks at the ILC, they will help you develop a solid plan to follow the rules and not get cheated of your benefits.

Think about it. It doesn't matter how disabled you are; no amount of positive attitude will turn all the books in Barnes and Noble turn into Braille. The fact that a blind person can't just browse Barnes and Noble whenever they want isn't a symptom of them being blind; it's society that does that.

This is not true. The SSA-827 form indicates that they are permitting SSA to obtain their entire medical record. So anything that is in that doctor's file is fair game. The SSA-827 also gives SSA permission to call and speak to your doctor about what is in your medical records, and what their opinions are on your disability status. In theory, your doctor could withhold information from SSA but I don't think most are going to do that since this type of behavior can get them in trouble with OIG and can threaten their ability to receive Medicaid/Medicare reimbursements. 

SSA has been cracking down on fraud/similar fault (FSF) cases over the last few years. One thing that qualifies as FSF is when a claimant knowingly omits pertinent information during the course of an SSA investigation. As an example, if a person has 2 treating doctors - one who supports their disability application and one who doesn't - and they omit the non-supportive doctor on their SSA application that would qualify as FSF. It is the purposeful manipulation of facts in order to fraudulently obtain benefits. This type of behavior can be used to deny someone's claim, of if its found out after effectuation of payments, can be used to retroactively reopen and deny the claim and collect all overpaid benefits.

If you are looking for full-time work; look into SSA's Ticket to Work Program as they can help with employment resources in your area and they will make sure that you still follow SSA's rules regarding returning to work. On a more local level, check out your states Vocational Rehabilitation programs as they can help with any job training, obtaining assistance devices, etc that you may need. 

If you are looking to just supplement your income, please be aware of all of the income and working restrictions with SSDI. I would seek out a local benefits planner who can go through the rules and regulations with regards to work. In short, you can work as long as you are staying under $1130/mo gross.

As for types of employment, do you have any history doing desk/sedentary type work? You mention not being able to stand for more than 30min at a time. You could look into doing part-time receptionist work or data entry? You can even do some transcription work from home if you are proficient with a computer.

1. Alarms. My smartphone---most smartphones, I imagine----can be set to go off at customized times. I like to literally plan my day in increments, ESPECIALLY when I know I'm off work and don't have school to provide needed structure. Something about an alarm going off means it's Time To Do The Thing, nipping the panic-spiral of procrastination in the bud. You can also set reminders in advance for things like turning in school projects, meetings, family events, tests, etc. 

2. CAFFEINE. Medication is insanely expensive to get refilled, and runs out faster than you think. Luckily, caffeine tablets can be had cheaply at any gas station or on Amazon and have a similar effect. Probably not so great on the kidneys, granted, but neither is ten cups of coffee. 

3. Having a plan for where the most important things go. If every day you leave your keys, wallet, shoes, phone, etc, in the same place, you know where to look for them and can eliminate some of the 'OMG I LOST THE THING MY WORLD IS ENDING!!!!11' freakout.

4. Regular exercise and Benedryl for sleep. A lot of people with ADHD also have one of several sleep disorders, and racing thoughts that can make it hard for their brain to shut up for the night. Wearing yourself out via the treadmill promotes natural tiredness, and a dose of Benedryl is enough to keep most people under for the minimum 6 hours you need. Progressive relaxation can also be helpful, though guided imagery tends not to work so well. 

5. Lots of water. Stimulant medications can dry your mouth out. Sugarless gum or hard candy can help too.

6. Fidget toys or white noise music! Sounds dumb but some people really do focus better when doing two things at once. Having a piece of jewelry to fuss with, a ball to absently toss around or some soothing noise to block out, can actually improve concentration, particularly when trying to study. 

7. Need to be able to always find a certain folder? Make it bright-colored, so it will catch your attention right away. 

8. About to listen to a long lecture or instructions and worried your brain will go 'FUCK THAT ITS DOODLING TIME!!!1'? Get a voice recorder and record the thing, then play it back repeatedly. Do make the effort to pay attention of course, should you need to ask questions, but having a hard copy of lectures to go back and listen to has saved my ass more times than I can count! (Because it's a lot of times; not because I can't count very high.)

9. Get a smaller purse/wallet/desk, etc. ADHDers tend towards clutter, so having a smaller place to put things will force you only to keep what you really do need. 

10. Multiple to-do lists: I know I personally tend to lose lists, so I make backup copies and leave them everywhere so I will be sure to see and absorb them----on my nightstand, on the bathroom mirror, on the kitchen table, on my computer desk, next to my phone charger, etc. I also try to make a digital copy in my phone using Evernote. That way I always have access to what I need to do, and in what order. 

11. Always have scrap paper/Evernote ready to 'brain vomit' those little sudden intrusive thoughts that can get in the way of productivity. 

12. If a big Important Task needs to be done, I like to break it down into little chunks to avoid getting overwhelmed by the overall Big Largeness of the whole task. 

13. There are apps that can block access to certain websites for specified lengths of time. No Reddit during school hours? Done! Blocking Netflix after 10 pm? Can do! No Youtube before nine? Good deal. This way you can avoid falling down the rabbit hole of hyperfocusing on the wrong things. 

14. Autopay for bills. This is a lifesaver to a scary degree. 

15. Reward successes---this one is huge for me. Sometimes I'll kind of bribe myself to do something I'm not looking forward to or really anxious about---'After it's done I'll cue up that movie I've been wanting to see on Netflix!'  or 'After I make this call I'm going to get a gyro for lunch!' etc.

This is a lie.  Liar-liar, pants on fucking fire.

It does exist, and it's called Vocational Rehabilitation.

Here's how it works:

State VocRehab agency or similar company receives a federal grant.

With that grant they purchase a big all inclusive insurance policy.  

Then they wait for unskilled disabled people to come in saying they want to work.

Grant pays for adaptive tech, training, aforementioned insurance, and stipends for the disabled worker, as well as salaries of VocRehab employees.

You are assessed, sometimes trained, and you are placed into a Trial Work Experience that might fit within the frame of your disability, for you to just try out, no pressure.

This is attractive to employers, because:

1. They don't pay you, the grant does.

2. They don't pay to insure you against accidents, the grant does.

3. They still reap the benefits of having an employee.

This is attractive to disabled people because:

1. You get to learn a new skill.

2. You begin padding your bleak resume.

3. You get to try working and get some extra money without losing benefits.

4. You get a foot in the door at a company that wouldn't look at you twice otherwise.

However, the success depends largely on a few things.

1. Your level of readiness and dedication to change.

2. Your case manager's number of fucks given.

3. Your employment consultant's number of fucks given and number of actual active employer contacts.

It's not a new model *at all*.",13,,13,0,0,

Are we taking about an elevator that just rides 1 floor? Or 15 floors? If we are talking about multiple floors then I think that elevators need to follow the ""first come first serve"" method. 1 or 2 floors and really people should be taking the stairs if physically able anyway. 

But, if those with disabilities get priority, where does the line get drawn? I have a bad back and I can only walk about 3 flights of steps. Looking at me most don't know it. So if I'm taking the elevator should I get priority over someone else? I don't think so. Does someone with a walker get priority over a wheelchair since it's probably harder for the walker person to stand there? 

I think that most people (or I like to think) will show common courtesy to people who have disabilities. But I don't think that there needs to be rules in place as to who gets priority over others.

I think, in the situation that the blog OP describes, perhaps they brought it up in a weird way that made it awkward?

**Autism**: Autism is the most prevalent thing in my life, ever. It affects everything I think, do, believe, and even sense (SPD). Even the other mental disabilities I have are related to autism. The phrase ""autistic joy"" exists for a reason. I like having special interests. I like stimming. Autism is a source of pleasure. It isn't something I suffer from.

Don't get me wrong, allistic joy is a thing too. But *I'm* the one that is pathologized. Autism defines me, and that's okay. 

Autism requires impairment, but social model of disability. It is okay that I'm unproductive in a capitalist system. It is okay I have different social and sensory needs for other people. It's not my fault I was bullied a lot. Special education is a hell-hole.

It isn't wrong that I have a sleep schedule that is nocturnal. Like, some days, my body wants to go to sleep at 7 AM. While it is painful in this NT world, it isn't wrong. Just the minority, and things are built for the majority. This is actually an argument for depathologization. Autism even affects how we sleep. So, it is inseparable from who we are.

**OCD**: Pure O can go die, but I want to keep my pure C stuff.

Pure O sucks. I hate the constant doubt. I hate the constant guilt. I hate having my mind screaming at me. I hate it when I am always thinking about how terrible I am. If there was for *only* the pure O stuff, I'd take it. And I have more O than C.

I want to keep my pure C. While this *sounds* trivial (it is not trivial), I can't drink out of cups with specks inside them. Which would be fine, but a lot of cups I have access to have hard to remove specks. I've been unable to drink liquids because of it, but if they're not there, I have no problem. It is okay that I have tics. Tics can feel good, sometimes. And I have more compulsive behavior that needs acceptance and accommodation.

During your Trial Work Period (9 months) you can earn as much as you want and still get your benefits. After that your benefits will be reduced based on how much money you make (I think the going rate is $2:$1). If you are on SSI you do need to still realize that, even if you're working, you still are held to the asset limitations. 

If you do go back to work, your SSI is ceased, and then you have to stop working again, it is much easier to get put back on benefits. Typically you can apply for an Expedited Reinstatement which will allow you to quickly be put back on benefits and get paid while you wait for them to process the application. 

There are several benefit planners that frequent this sub (I'm blanking on their user names) that can probably give you a lot more information than I can.

I truly believe that the legal advice we sought when we did get married was wrong, that anyone with experience would have known that marriage just empowers SSD to find more avenues to tax you or your spouse and that not getting married would keep you protected.

This entire solution may work for someone who is disabled while already married, but for thoose of us disabled before there is simply no other way to look at the situation then with the ideal that getting married will only open up a can of worms that you don't want to be find yourself in.

My response to these feelings is usually to turn towards gratitude and look at what I do have.  There is some common characteristics of depression too.  It feels very permanent and it feels as if it has always been as bad as it is on your lowest but I find this too be very rare.

Drugs generally are the first step, if your reaction too one drug feels as if its been a negative experience then you really need to let your doctor know and try others.  First they may put you on another few drugs in the same category of medications or they could change categories.  If you have gone through many different types, then maybe you have been diagnosed incorrectly.  

Are you turning towards illicit drugs or drinking alcohol?  Many mental health diagnoses result in depression.  If your not properly diagnosed then you may only be treating the result and not the cause.

This process takes work, but it is worth it.  Have you tried making a gratitude list?  Do you also utilize mindfulness and meditation, maybe prayer if you believe in a god.

But beyond that, it isn't so black and white.  For reference, I was married to a disabled woman for 8 years; she died about 6 years ago, and I remarried to someone who has a different kind of disability.

I totally understand the rejection, and the family members warning women to avoid someone (me).  In my case, my ""disability"" was being widowed.  Women in their late 20's and early 30's just could not deal with that situation (even though there really wasn't anything to ""deal with"" in my case) and their families warned them about all of the (false) problems they could have in dating a widowed man.  

Having said that, there's another side to this coin.  You're 100% right in your definition of being brave, and you're also correct in noting that most things people would be ""brave"" about should not require ""bravery"" at all.  But to assume that all disabilities are this simple is disingenuous.

My first wife had arthrogryposis congenita- basically, her joints did not form correctly while she was growing in her mother's womb.  For the most part this was not a problem.  However, it became a very big problem towards the end of her life.  To make a very long story short, she became very ill one November and was hung up in the hospital for 3 months.  She came home on a ventilator.  Every night when I came home from work I had an intense 2 hour caregiving routine; it was very emotionally and physically exhausting.

When I jumped back in the dating pool a while after she died, I did not want to get into a situation where I was repeating the caregiving routine.  So I specifically excluded any women who had a disability of any sort.  I'm not ashamed for having done that- I was attempting to avoid a repeat of a real problem that had a significant negative impact on my well being.

Well, the universe had other plans for me and I met my twin flame, who has a disability of a different sort.  She has several rare neurological diseases that manifest themselves in truly bizarre ways.  In one instance, after a routine surgery, they had to call a code on her because she just stopped breathing.  We had to fight with the head neurologist at that hospital because a few hours later, he wanted to release her home straight from the ICU.  Luckily we prevailed, because over the course of the next week she stopped breathing 5 more times.

Don't get me wrong, I love my wife more than life itself.  When we met it was like lightning struck... I am sure that she and I have been together for a very, very long time because I do believe in reincarnation and souls that find each other in subsequent lifetimes.

Having said that, if something happened to her (or us), I really don't think I could do this again (become involved with a disabled person).",3,,3,0,0,

She lost that job and she is making around minimum wage.  Your solution to look at both peoples income makes getting married for people who are already disabled before marriage as a marriage tax and I do not see why you would want to tax someone more simple because they decide to marry someone who is disabled.  The solution your purposing creates this issue and it is a discriminatory policy.  You can try to explain it away under any dialog you choose, but if we get a divorce the amount we owe to the government DECREASES by OVER $550 each month.  If I choose to get married any time in the future it will then increase again based on who I marry making marriage an emotional decision with allot of economic penalty's.   

What more, it makes no sense to continue to be married with my life because this policy is standard and we continue to be challenged on a yearly basis for making too much more.  The rules change each year requiring lawyers that we can not afford, and pushing us to use resources such as legal aid to defend ourselves.

In addition, being married also presents other challenges.  For instance, as a married couple under SSD we can not have any significant savings and are pretty much required to keep our equity in non-liquid forms that can not be touched by SSD (401K &amp; Mortgage).

https://www.disabilitydischarge.com/

A few things that are my understanding (but you should double check before taking as hard truth):

* permanently disabled under their terminology basically means ""unable to have gainful employment for at least five years."" It does not mean unable to do any work forever. It does not mean unable to work at all now. It does not mean stuck in a bed for the rest of your life. 

* You are even allowed to work some and continue to receive the discharge. Their income limits are much higher then SSI or SSDI

* You don't need to have SSI/SSDI to get this. Actually, unless your SSI/SSDI review is 5-7 years away (mine is shorter than that) the doctors note is what they're going to look at. 

* They make the application process unbelievably simple. It's not like applying for medicaid or SSI/SSDI at all. Their support people (chat button at the top of their webpage) are knowledgable and helpful. 

* This is only for federal loans. They're not going to help with your private loans. 

* Yes, you will have to pay taxes on any income discharged. I haven't gotten there yet so I don't know how that will work. ",6,,6,0,0,

I fight these thoughts and feelings a lot too but for me it's usually about school/work. I've been able to go far academically but every boss including my current advisor has told me I'm good at what I do but I physically don't show up enough (which is almost all due to chronic illness/disability). 

In fact one boss told me that I was the best worker she had in terms of quality of work and efficiency but I just wasn't in the office enough. I wasn't physically reliable. So she was afraid she'd have to fire me. (I ended up moving so it didn't come to that) 

I think I'm of afraid of similar things in relationships. Even friendships. I don't feel unloveable necessarily (I actually think I'm pretty damn great) but it's hard to be so unreliable. To cancel plans last minute and have dietary restrictions at restaurants and not be able to walk long distances. Or to need to sleep so frequently. 

I've learned to deal with it but it doesn't seem fair to bring anyone else in. That's worked for me since I'm really not the relationship type in general.

Graduate faculty in particular seem to be really bad about disability accommodations. You did things right, ish.  As someone who used to work in college disability services and who had to ~~fight for~~ advocate for accommodations myself at school and in the workplace, there are some recommendations I'd make going forward.  More about that later.

For now with the current issue, I would say consider filing either a federal complaint with the Office of Civil Rights or a formal internal grievance with the school. 

For the former, you can get info here: http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/howto.html?src=rt

For the latter, write to the disability services director and CC the dean of your graduate program letting them know that you wish to file a formal internal grievance regarding this professor's behavior and the department program manager's behavior. You may be referred to a form, or to some information on their formal grievance process. You may wish to research it yourself beforehand.   

In your grievance, be prepared to write up a short summary of what you think is wrong, what you'd like done about it, and a supporting narrative of your version of events, including that you went to the DS director and what he said.  Dates are very helpful, if you can remember them. Be sure to put in the most recent date of the problems, i.e. that you just found out *now* that you still don't have a grade. The recent date is important because if you wish to file a federal ADA complaint (now or later), that is time sensitive.  You don't want them to back date it to last semester when this all *started*, you want the clock running from as late/recently as possible to give you time for this. There's more information about timelines for federal complaints here, http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/howto.html?src=rt 

Dig out your emails to and from the professor and your group. Print them or save them digitally into a local folder, you may need them. Also add in any emails you had with the DS director around your accommodations, and specifically about this class/professor.  If they seem helpful, add them to the grievance and then reference them in the grievance. Don't add anything you aren't going to reference.


Going forward, here and elsewhere:  

* Follow up. I know it's hard to be a squeaky wheel. You have other things to do, and you shouldn't have to babysit people like the DS director to get him to do his job. But the reality is, you sometimes have to be a (polite) pain in the ass to make sure you get what you need and are legally entitled to. Especially when graduate faculty are involved.

* Relatedly, any discussion you have that is **not** by email, start making a habit of summarizing it in a follow up email to the person you talked to. E.g. ""Dr. Professor Bigshot, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today about my accommodations in your class. My understanding from our conversation is that you will allow me to turn in XXXX next week without penalty to my grade as part of my accommodation for extended time on coursework."" 
 
* CC yourself if you don't have an easily accessible sent mail folder.

* Make a habit of organizing emails about your disability/accommodations and backing them up. Print as PDF, save them locally. Do this more after any big issues like what happened last semester.

Good luck, and let us know what happens.",2,,2,0,0,

Social security disability is for people unable to work due to their disability.

One of the first things to do is take a look at the initial form you'll need to fill out - one example is here, with some tips to help: http://www.levinebenjamin.com/index.php/how_we_help_you/resources2/form_ssa_3368_disability_report_adult/

Once you do that, it may be valuable to find a lawyer in your area who will help you fill out any forms and help you with appeals and ensuring that everything is correct.

Typically, since the program is a federal one, there aren't differences between states, but each court is slightly different. A local lawyer will be able to explain the courts in New York and New Jersey better.

I have lupus and I'm a 26 year old woman. It manifests with my immune system attacking my kidneys, joints, digestive system, and sometimes the lining of my heart and lungs. I have chronic migraines and IBS/acid reflux and interstitial cystitis which are caused by the lupus. So, any part of my body is essentially a ticking time bomb of inflammation. I'm seeing my doctor every couple weeks to every month, as well as specialists for neurology, nephrology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, urology, etc.

&gt;These questions are mostly pertaining to physical disabilities but all are free to respond:

&gt;1. How do you feel about dating with a disability? Is it a concern of yours?

I was diagnosed while with a guy and my diagnosis came at a time when my body was really falling apart. I could barely move and I had kidney failure and the treatment for it caused me to lose all my hair. He felt guilty because we didn't know whether I was dying or what, so he stayed with me, but we eventually broke up. After that, I knew that the next person who I dated had to be okay with my illness and the unpredictability of my future.

Eventually I found a man I'm crazy for. He has a disability as well, so he has true compassion for my issues, and I for his. It is easier being with someone who knows how terrible - and wonderful - it can be. We've been together over 4 years. He has neurofibromatosis type 1, which is a condition in which hundreds of tumors - some quite painful - grow on his nerves all over his body.

&gt;2. Have you ever dated an able-bodied person? If so, what was that experience like? Did they ""tip toe"" around the situation or pity you? What was that dynamic like?

Yes I have. I dated a couple guys before I was diagnosed, when I was much healthier. Take the first guy I mentioned above though. Once I had The Big Flare of 2009 - which is the year my kidneys failed and they knew for sure I had lupus through a biopsy - he lost his love for me. I retained water due to kidney failure which stretched out and scarred my skin, lost my hair through chemotherapy, the whole nine - and he just didn't want to touch me any more.


&gt;3. What advice would you give to someone who has a physical disability and is nervous about how others will view them when they're out on a date?

Just be yourself and let your freak flag fly. Everyone has issues, those with disability just have very obvious ones. They aren't even ""flaws,"" because in my opinion our suffering brings us more wisdom and compassion and therefore beauty. If the person you are dating doesn't see that, they're not worth your very precious time.

&gt;
Thanks for your time! I will check back a little later to see if anyone's responded.

Your true friends will find a way to interact with you such as potluck dinners, getting together for games or movies etc. And, you don't have to tell them every detail. Simply tell them enough that it is important to make changes due to your medical condition.

For dating, you can try a site to meet other disabled individuals interested in dating. I'm married so I don't have one to recommend. Just do a google search and investigate further. 

If you have yard space, you can do an accessible garden. http://support.naturalyards.com/building-a-garden/ There may be someone in your area who can build it for you.

Since you are well versed in a variety of topics, you might teach local workshops or offer workshops online. See if your community has a Friends of the Library club. They raise money for the local library. My town is really small and there was one I participated in. 

The other posters' advice to apply for SSD right away is very important. A lot of the help available is connected to having SSD. You may also be eligible for food stamps, rental/housing assistance or other help. Check out your state website and US government site. You may also be eligible for your states version of Medicade. It offers vision and dental care along with Rx discounts and sometimes free transport to doctor appointments.

Any disability can feel like a heavy burden. Think about what you can do to break down all of the overwhelming feelings and medical information. Here are a few things I do.

Take things one second, one minute, on hour, one day at a time. I've found that staying in the moment helps relieve stress.

I also created a document with all of my medication and doctor's addresses and phones. I take this with me when I go for a visit so each doctor knows what I'm taking. I also use it to help me keep up with who I'm seeing. 

See if your pharmacy can assist you with planning refills so you don't have to make two trips or so each week. Some even deliver so you wouldn't have to drive and walk around the store.

It's so hard to go through this without the support of your friends. Is there family you can rely on for support? I go to counseling to discuss my emotions and find coping mechanisms.

6714ab4f-4ee4-4c52-90dd-e30a8194a6e3,1461427090,"I was born with congenital cataracts and do not have lenses, therefore I wear pretty thick glasses.  My disability might not be as prominent as other people's, but it's very clear that my lack of vision is outside of the norm and I suppose some people might be concerned about having children with me with those disabilities.  I'm also going to answer your questions out of order.

Question 2.  I have dated a good handful of people in my life (7 plus a few flings) and have been in a relationship with my partner for 4 years.  All of the people I have dated have been able-bodied, although I guess some of them may have had varying degrees of anxiety/depression.  I've talked to a few of them about my disability, but I think the most common response I've gotten was that it didn't matter that much to them or it was kind of an afterthought.  I honestly wasn't that comfortable about admitting how severe my disability was until my current partner, so maybe they thought that since it wasn't a big deal to me, it shouldn't be a big deal to them.  Right now, there are a few times when my partner doesn't seem to understand why I don't feel comfortable doing something (jay-walking a busier street, cycling on roads, etc), but he generally understands when I need help (reading menu items behind counters) and tries to do that.  He, and many of my other partners, treats my disability as a characteristic of mine and not my defining feature.  I know that I am lucky in that my disability is not as noticeable and many people do not have that luxury, but I guess this is just a personal issue.

Question 1.  For me, it's definitely a concern in terms of jumping from casually dating to being in a serious relationship.  I'm conventionally attractive behind my glasses and have a wide variety of interests, so a lot of people have been attracted to me.  The issue is how will people react to finding out that I have a genetic issue and there is the potential for whatever children we have being born with the same condition as me (I've looked into it and there are options, but still).  The relationship I am currently in is my first truly serious relationship, and while that is partially due to a lot of issues brought on my my mother and her emotional abuse, maybe some of it was because of my disability (although I think it was mostly about my personality).

Question 3.  There are things in the world that we are unable to change and have no control over.  We cannot change the fact that we have a disability and we cannot change the fact that there are some people out there that will never date us because of our disability.  But there are a lot of things that we can change.  Have hobbies and go out to do things you care about.  Learn about things.  Take care of yourself by eating healthy and exercising (if you are able to).  You don't need to dress up in the latest fashions, but try to find clothing that fits you well and looks a bit more stylish.   Don't think that because you have a disability, you have to live your life in isolation.  Be a part of the world and do the things you are able to do.  I'm saying these things because I have met a lot of disabled people through meet-ups that are unrelatable, not because of their disabilities but because they do not socialize the same way as people my age.  This isn't their fault (the adults in their lives tend to isolate them from peers and treat them like children, so of course they're not going to be able to relate), but it's a problem in a lot of aspects of their lives.

SSA does not generally care about drug use when it comes to disability decisions. the only time that drugs/alcohol come into play with  decision is when said drug/alcohol use becomes *material* to a person's disability. If a person is disabled because of their drug/alcohol use (called DAA) or their other conditions wouldn't be disabling absent of the DAA use then we will deny the claim. However, these denials are still fairly rare as we have to be able to definitively prove that the DAA is responsible for the persons symptoms or medical conditions. We realize that a lot of people, especially those with psych conditions, will self-medicate with drugs and alcohol and generally look the other way. Consideration is also given to damage of DAA that is beyond repair. Someone who OD'd on MDMA/X and now has permanent brain damage can be found disabled since, although drugs caused it, even with ongoing sobriety the damage is already done.

Some examples of when DAA would be material:

* someone with liver disease due to their alcohol use (when its not yet damaged beyond repair). Their doctors tell them to stop drinking and take their medication. The person continues to drink and be non-compliant with treatment. In that situation DAA is material because, if they were not drinking, their condition wouldn't be disabling. 

* an individual has bipolar and a history of substance abuse issues. they go through a couple of years being in/out of the hospital due to psychosis due to PCP. They get clean for a year or so, take their meds, and are generally functional. They start using PCP again and their psychosis comes back and they apply for disability. In that situation we have evidence in file that shows, when they aren't using PCP, they are not disabled. When can connect the disability to the drug use so that individual would be denied for DAA materiality.

My seizures have led to chronic pain due to muscle damage, and I also have bi-polar 2. However, in general unless I am seizing I can look fairly normal.

1. Whenever I start dating someone or even if I am simply negotiating having casual sex with someone I become nervous because my seizures are still not controlled. I am always fairly straight forward about my epilepsy, and look for ways to place it into the first conversation in a way that isn't uncomfortable in order to gauge their response. It helps that I have training as a counselor and was raised around medical personnel so I can talk about my disability in a way that so far has not made people uncomfortable. The moments that make me nervous tend to revolve around sex, simply. What if I seize during sex? That could result in legitimate bodily harm.

What you will need is a note from your neurologist indicating that you need accommodations with your scheduling (saying you can't work more than X hours at a time, or need to be off by Xpm, etc).  From there you would need to speak with your HR person about the accommodations. 

So how does the scheduling work exactly? Do you work some day-time shifts and then some late night shifts? Does everybody equally share in the late shifts? Your employer will need to accommodate you to the best of their abilities, but there is a chance they may try to argue the schedule change will be unreasonable. For example, if they are 12 hour shifts and you can only work 8 hours, that would be difficult for them to do, scheduling wise, as they would have to mess with other people's schedules. 

From a practical standpoint, you also want to consider what is going to be best for your career and health in the long-run. If everyone has to ""share"" in the crappy shifts then, if you get preferential (even if legally required) treatment you may run into some animosity from your coworkers. If you do start to feel ostracized a bit, or if they balk on the accommodations, I would start looking for another job. Don't quit your current one, just start looking for something that will give you a more regular schedule.

It does not make you eligible for SSI nor does it hurt (at least in my state).  You can disclose your history, or you can keep it private.  You do not need to tell SSI all of your medical history, you just need enough to get what you want.  

I was approved 5 months after a stay at a rehab, though I had many diagnosis that made me eligible.  I too quit smoking for 4 years too get sober from alcohol.  As far as substance abuse, it SHOULD be considered another reason to approve disability, though I have seen some states do some really stupid shit to reduce costs.  I would be careful.

I am not really certain you suffer from substance abuse.  I suspect you are finding out that even after removing the substance (Pot) your problems are continuing.  The consequences your experiencing from usage are real, but they are most likely consequences of using a substance that is under heavy prohibition like high cost (leads to financial problems) and arrests.  

I am a recovering alcoholic, and I find that the best way to asset someone for addiction is that if you struggle controlling your usage, then you suffer from addiction.  

This is often expressed by the idea that once I start drinking (even just one), I can not stop and will find myself very drunk and passed out in a short time.  I have heard of pot addiction, and seen it, it is real, but its not when someone gets arrested for it.  Someone is addicted if when they buy a bag of pot they find they smoke all of it every time and can't control it.  It is extremely rare, and I think its more prevalent then exercise addiction only because of the extreme value placed on an item that would otherwise be something you should find in bulk at GNC.  Addiction is obsession.  There is no dependency to Marijuana, and thus we won't even talk about it here.  No withdrawal’s...

I can understand the confusion.  People think that their few times using POT is typical of everyone experience... but it is not.  Anyone who smokes on a daily bases simply can not experience anywhere near the level of intoxication as someone who smokes irregularly.  I barely get a buzz, and personally I don't even find it to be enjoyable in of itself, but I do find the reduction of symptoms to be enjoyable.  

I think you need to get a lawyer if you intend to do SSD.  I would not suggest you file without one as there is questions regarding which medical history you will send and which will you keep private.  I would not go foreword without one.  Lawyers should not charge you a penny unless they win, and their fee's are taken from the settlement of back pay you receive.

The first step is writing a plan. You want to do job X but physical Y and/or mental Z limitation is preventing you. VR should be able to provide you services with Y or Z medical vendors and use relationships with X vocational vendors to help solve your problem.

In theory, this should work. In reality, these variables are highly dependent on where you live and how you can sell yourself.

Now please understand.  I have chronic pain. I take Butrans and my deductible is $100 for 4 patches.  I had to fight tooth and fuckin' NAIL to get them to *cover* the 4 - really my doc wanted me to change it every 5 days but they weren't having that.

So yes.. this has a major freakin' impact.  I realize I'm in a lucky position where I have a car, my doctor is 25 miles away and when traffic is light, I can be there in 30 mins.   

That being said. read this carefully:

&gt; § 7 — OPIOID DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS
&gt; 
&gt; Seven-Day Supply
&gt; 
&gt; The bill prohibits a prescribing practitioner authorized to prescribe an opioid drug from issuing a prescription for more than a seven-day supply to (1) a minor or (2) an adult for the first time for outpatient use.
&gt; 
&gt; When prescribing an opioid drug to a minor for less than seven days, the bill requires the practitioner to discuss with the (1) minor and (2) if present when the prescription is issued, minor's custodial parent, guardian, or legal custodian:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. the associated risks of addiction and overdose;
&gt; 
&gt; 2. the dangers of taking opioid drugs with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other central nervous system depressants; and
&gt; 
&gt; 3. why the prescription is necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; The bill defines an “opioid drug” as any drug having an addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability similar to morphine or being capable of conversion into a drug having such addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability.
&gt; 
&gt; Exceptions
&gt; 
&gt; The bill allows the practitioner to prescribe more than a seven-day supply of an opioid drug to an adult or minor if, in his or her professional judgment, the drug is required to treat the person's acute medical condition, chronic pain, cancer-associated pain, or for palliative care. The practitioner must document the patient's condition in his or her medical record and indicate that an alternative to the opioid drug was not appropriate to treat the patient's condition.
&gt; 
&gt; The bill's provisions on opioid drug prescriptions do not apply to medications to treat opioid drug dependence or abuse, including opioid antagonists and agonists (e.g., medications such as morphine that activate the same areas of the brain as other opioids).
&gt; 
&gt; EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 2016

* If you are a chronic pain patient (MS, CRPS, Fibro, back issues, cancer, et al) and you have a standing relationship with a doctor that already has no problem with you taking opioids and isn't a piece of shit, this shouldn't have any effect on you.  The rule directly states that if, in the doctor's opinion, the opioid is necessary to treat your condition, they can give you a full 'script, so long as they document it in your chart.

* If you are a chronic pain patient (MS, CRPS, Fibro, back issues, chronic pain, whatever) and have a standing relationship with a doctor who doesn't like giving out opioids, this is just going to give him more of a reason not to give you opioids.

* If you are a chronic pain patient (MS, CRPS, Fibro, back issues, chronic pain, whatever) and have a relationship with a doctor that is on the fence and isn't an ass?  You may want to point him to the specifics of the law if s/he isn't the type to get butt-hurt and think you're trying to show them up.


Please don't take this as me trying to justifying this.  I think it's fucking bullshit and hurts a lot of people.  It has the exact OPPOSITE effect that lawmakers intend; more people will turn to the streets for drugs.  I'm only trying to make sure people read the fine print and don't panic.

If you have an established patient/doctor relationship, you're probably going to be ok.

Any student loan debt over $600 that is forgiven under a TPD discharge is also filed as taxable income to the IRS.

I think that understanding the WHY can lead people to realize that the disabled are people too. Unfortunately it's pretty common and most people don't see anything wrong with it when they do it. It's all part of ableism and there are several blogs on Tumblr (yuck, I know, but there are some hidden gems in the filth) like annieelainey.tumblr.com, spookyspoonie.tumblr.com, my-trex-life.tumblr.com. All of these bloggers have YouTube channels also and sometimes have videos explaining ableism and it's different forms, if you're interested. 


For me in particular, as someone who is newly diagnosed, I'm still just crossing the fence. There's a part of me that still wants to tell myself I'm less than, that my parents should have aborted me, etc etc. But then there's the new part, the part that's more accepting of my disability, and the part that really wants to understand now why and how things are hurtful. Most abled people are never going to have that point in their life where they suddenly want to understand, I don't think. Because they just can't see how it affects them. 


I would say, when you go forward and tell people that certain words are harmful, explain why. Explain the background of the word, how it's used as a slur or just a derogatory statement. That way they can at least have some sort of understanding and maybe that will show them that we're people too.",5,,5,0,0,

I personally think there is a place for simulation activities provided the focus is still on the idea of equity/barriers and there is adequate reflection on the consequences. Furthermore, engaging the kids by having with coming up with creative solutions.

I personally would set up some kind of orienteering obstacle course, blindfold / earmuff / put a kid on crutches / in a wheelchair, buddy them up with a non-disabled kid and have them try to complete the obstacle course together. Relate various obstacles back to real life things (eg. Wheelchair vs. Steps and things too far up, visually impaired vs . Text only signs, hearing impaired vs. Voice announcements, crutches with carrying objects from one place to another) and have them identify other things they see in everyday life that might be difficult for a person with that disability. Have them think about how much help they needed from others and what they might do if help wasn't around. Then have them design/craft a solution for what we should do instead to make it more fair so that the obstacle course can be overcome equally by all without needing a buddy.

Kids have such unrestrained imagination and creativity, I think the idea of funnelling it back into making the world easier for others is a great way to engage them - but they can't really grasp it without a little first hand experience.

Substantial gainful employment (or SGA) applies to SSI or SSDI. You cannot earn above a certain amount of money for EITHER type of disability. However, after reading through EVERYTHING on this thread, it is evident that you have SSI- income based disability. You qualified for disability due to your income level, not due to how many credits you earned through working. Your wife's income is NOT a factor for SSDI; only SSI, because it impacts how much income you have as a couple, and as SSI is the INCOME BASED arm of social security, it would become relevant. SSDI is really only determined by how much you have worked and how much you have paid into the system.

I understand you have talked to two lawyers. I get it. However, you have multiple people here who actually WORK for SSA/DDS. If you don't want our advice, then don't ask for it. People in this thread is trying to help you to the best of their ability, but you continually tell them they are wrong and throw their advice in their faces.

What they will have to do is get a sling under you and then hook the sling to the lift.  The lift will lift you slightly higher then wheelchair height and then they can bring the wheelchair under you and lower.  

I haven't made use of a lift yet but I have been researching and watching a lot of Youtube video demonstrations.   I need one that lifts from floor to bed for my son because at 50lbs and still growing he has just about outgrown my muscle power and I would prefer to have a solution before we get to emergency status.   

Make sure you are very specific with the DME rep and double check the model and sling before ordering because my understanding is that not all slings and lifts are capable of lifting straight from the floor.

I was pretty annoyed by a couple comments by disabled people making sweeping assumptions about all disabled people - though at the same time I get it - because I'm definitely still working on internalized ableism - but the first step is even just acknowledging that it's ableism and that can be a hard step to take.

I just was discharged from a Treatment Center fours days ago and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD. I have been battling this for almost 3 years and never knew what was causing me to lose touch with friends, family and love. I had the biggest breakdown of my life and checked myself in to treatment. The medications are working but very slow. 

It is a real battle and it can take it's toll. I lost the love of my life because of this. I lost many friends because they felt I was ignoring them and missed out on many family events. It is hard. 

You should never have to hide your illness from people. If they are adults and are mature they will understand, if not, then they are not worth being in your life at all. It hurts in the beginning but you will soon realize it is for the best! 

I encourage you to apply for benefits as I'm in the process of Reconsideration. It takes months so it's best to get started right away! If you get denied, do not get down, do not let it just go away. If you know something is truly holding you back, then by all means keep going! It will work out in the end. Only you know how you feel inside and you should not have to doubt yourself.

However, the way you view the battle is very important. If I'm ""brave"", then my partner is more so for welcoming an outsider like me into their world. So many times I've heard about the struggles in this community that able-bodied people take for granted. No matter how much I read and listen, it will still not be the same as experiencing a disability first hand. My husband was the one who was willing to take the chance with someone ignorant like me. On top of what he deals with on a regular basis, he had to show me the ropes and comfort me when my parents threatened to disown me because of him. To this day, I cannot even begin to fathom the amount of guilt he held because his disability ""caused me pain"". He actually repeatedly asked me to break up with him when we first started dating because of that guilt, but I'm a stubborn hardass and questioned him to give me a valid reason for dumping him. He was never able to give one that wasn't drenched in social or medical context. Bravery requires confronting your fears. That's what he did. Dating is difficult as is and even more so when you throw in elements you cannot control. I think you're brave for choosing a relationship with someone from a different background (because that's what a lot of disability entails). ",6,,6,0,0,

I don't expect special treatment but I can't tell you the number of times I've waited patiently and had people push past me because they're quicker and stronger, causing me to have to wait until noone is around. It's not ableism, it's just inconsiderate. Also, it's different in different cultures.

I became disabled over a decade ago, and it took me a long time to start to accept myself for who I am, right now in this very minute. 

What really helped me was learning how to release my expectations about pretty much everything. We often make ourselves miserable because things are ""supposed to be"" a certain way, and we are not able to be that way for one reason or another. The process of releasing those expectations, is a grieving process. 

We have to allow ourselves to feel the loss and sadness of not being able to live up to our own expectations. We have to forgive ourselves for being imperfect and human. We have to be kind to ourselves, and not judge ourselves for having a range if human feelings. Otherwise we tend to get stuck in the grief. We have to be able to release the feelings, whatever they may be, so that we can move beyond them and live life as best as we can.

The best way I've found to deal with grief, is to honor it, comfort it, and then ask it to leave. Inevitably, it will come back again. It is not a bad friend. In some ways, it helps us to see our ""hurt places"" more clearly, so we can be even more kind to ourselves and to others.

Imagine you had a friend with the same problem. What would you say to them about their feelings? You would probably say, *it's ok to feel however you feel,* and *I can understand why you feel the way you do,* and tell them, *no matter what, I love you just the way you are right now.* 

So, this is what you should say to yourself. Don't worry about how you think you're supposed to act or feel or be. Don't worry about what a divine being would think- none of us can really ever know if or what those thoughts might be. Just focus on being kind to yourself. 

If you feel stuck in the sadness and can't get out of it, then go to someone for help. Coming here was a good step. I don't know what country you live in, but if they have good mental health care, don't be afraid to talk to someone professional. If you have problems with hormone levels, you may need some medication or hormones to help you feel more balanced. You may not have had the right kind of medication yet. It can be a trial and error to find one that works. There's a [genetic test](https://genomind.com/talk-to-your-doctor/) that helps figure out what medication might work better for you. I don't know if it is available in your country or affordable through your health care.

Therapy can make us feel worse in the beginning because it makes us feel the feelings we want to run away from. A good therapist can help us move through our feelings and feel safe while we work on them. You may need a different therapist. It can take a few tries to find one that you feel comfortable with.

I had a teacher who said, *resistance causes persistence.* I hope that translates into your language so you can understand it. It means that when we deny our problems exist, they never get better. They just persist (stay the same). We have to deal with our problems for things to change. But, we must deal with our problems with kindness. Kindness for ourselves, kindness for our feelings, kindness for our grief. 

Today I send you loving kindness, and wish for your ability to have loving kindness for yourself too. 

Here is a recording I like to listen to that helps me learn to be more kind to myself, and to others too. It's a [guided loving kindness meditation](http://secularbuddhism.org/2012/12/16/guided-loving-kindness-meditation/) Maybe it will be helpful to you too. Best wishes!",6,,6,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1459855697,"How the payee sets up their relationship with you will really depend on the agency. 

I can tell you the system we had when I used to be a payee, but of course YMMV. I worked for a community agency and we had people in 24-7 care (in their own homes) and, one of the stipulations for our servies was that we became their payee. 

Their SSI/SSDI checks were deposited into their own bank accounts however I (and the agency) were co-named as owners. I don't know exactly the verbage for how it was set up, but I was the only one that had the ability to write checks and make withdrawals from the account. All that our clients could do was cash checks written to them (usually by me) and none of the accounts had ATM or credit cards. 

Every month I was responsible for making sure all of their bills were paid first. The clients would gather all of their bills and I would sit down and write out checks for their housing/utilities first, then pay any medical bills. With what was left over was theirs for the month.  But then you have to keep in mind that, as a payee, I have to make sure all their needs are being met. So I wouldn't just hand over all that money. I would pre-write checks to the grocery store and walmart weekly and they knew how much they had to spend (their staff would be with them). If they overspent one week then they would get less money the next week, etc. After groceries and other incidentals were accounted for then what was left became spending money (received in cash weekly). The staff/client had to keep all receipts and give them back to me so I could ensure that the money was being spent on what was intended (and for liability to make sure no staff was stealing) and in case I was ever audited by SSA. Mis-use or misrepresentation of funds is a HUGE deal for payees. 

Now, you're system will likely not be that complicated as you seem to be higher functioning then the people we worked with. But you have to always remember that your payee is responsible to SSA to make sure all your needs are being met and they have to think ahead and plan ahead to make sure you won't run out of money each month. When you look for agencies/payees you'll have to ask them about how they deal with spending money and all the other things. 

If you are getting psych services through any sort of community agency see if they have a payee on staff. When I did community mental health (not the job I mentioned above) our office had a payee who, after bills were paid, would just cut a check for the remaining money for the month to our clients. Granted, then those clients were constantly out of money because of how lax it was, but that is the way they did it. 

However your payee system is set up, it will take some getting used to. The hard part for my clients was knowing that the money wasn't in their control even though it was ""theirs"". While I tried to always get them what they wanted its hard to support someone on $730/mo. I always tried to keep some extra money in their accounts for when they wanted a bigger ticket item, or to give them extra money for a birthday, but it wasn't always possible. People used to be mad at me all the time and think that I was hoarding it from them but that was never the case. I, legally, was not allowed to let them spend all their money on lotto tickets and mountain dew. 

As for the money that your mom sends, that will depend on how much it is. If its just $20 here or there it shouldn't matter but if it is a significant amount of money you would need to check with the agency. If nothing else they need to know that in case that money from your mom puts you over SSI resources. Whenever our clients got gift money from their parents I always let them keep it (unless their parent specifically gave it to me to dole out in smaller amounts) and spend it how they wanted to.

First, if you have a psychiatrist in your corner DO NOT leave. The grass is not always greener. Plus, I have learned counseling is not necessarily a psychiatrists best ability. They listen to how your feeling and adjust meds as needed. A good counselors though will listen. You can very easily find out if he is in your corner by getting copies of your medical records. You NEED to do this, do not trust attorneys to do it. I was a week out from my court date and found out my attorney's office had NO records from any of my psychiatrists, only medical doctors (I also have a major back problem). No wonder I was denied twice! They are your records! Get a binder and keep them organized make it your only true job. My ALJ had a high denial rate but was very impressed with my case once he actually heard from me. I also walked into his hearing room with binders of medical records. One of the binders was from my psychiatrist with the last 2 years of records and his mental capacity form. The judge had NONE of that! I gave it to him and immediately improved my case. 

Anyway, if you feel your psychiatrist isn't helping you then by all means, change. It sounds like he is trying though and that is very much a good thing. Many are afraid or unwilling to get behind your case. 

It is a process and I do understand both sides now having to deal with it. It does seem however (especially in cases involving mental health) there needs to be a better, more expedited way. I think you should get assistance quickly with doctors ok. Then if they find you not truly meeting their standards of disabled you are on the hook to pay it back. It is just such a burden on someone suffering mentally it is easy to snap. 

Best of luck and remember it is the process you must go through. It's backwards, and stressful but you must do it. You can't work, you need it and once it's over you can truly focus on getting better. Any questions let me know I will be happy to answer. ",2,,2,0,0,

Mobility devices aren't ""giving up"" or ""being bound,"" it's giving you *freedom*.  When I got a mobility scooter I got all of that crap, with the usual added bonus of ""You wouldn't need that if you weren't fat"" (apparently, people really believe that weight loss can regrow broken body parts).

What the scooter does is let me get to places I can no longer walk to or around. It lets me do things with my friends and family. It gives me freedom.  But here's the thing -- it doesn't mean I am no longer using my legs, ever.  Not everyone who uses a wheelchair or scooter is completely immobile otherwise.

2dafdc84-268c-4df0-9514-e8cff6548971,1459503529,"It really depends on which culture you study. My area of interest has been focused on Brazil, which has one of the largest disabled populations in the world, but has only recently began to address any issues facing that population in public policy. With the paralympics looming and the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities being the first Human Rights treaty ratified in the Brazilian Constitution, Brazil is feeling the pressure. Whilst many argue Brazil is slowly becoming more Americanised, the country itself seems to have a more accepting view overall. Whilst disability is related to poverty in almost any culture Brazil recently established a form of welfarism, lifting millions out of less than $1 a day poverty. This combined with other government initiatives has begun to increase accessibility and visibility, at least in the larger cities. The country is huge and experiences variations between states, but from my own personal experience, the people are more accepting and friendly towards any disability. One of my fondest memories is watching a bunch of kids include a non-verbal autistic boy in every activity without question, and making allowances for his difficulties without marking him as different. Gave me hope that my own brother who is also on the spectrum could find that level of acceptance elsewhere.

The drips and drabs from other cultures aren't particularly accessible in worldwide academia, most probably due to language barriers. Most theories in social science are only recognised internationally when published in English. A perfect example of this is the work of Hans Asperger. Although he published many theories and studies surrounding autism in the 1940s, they only gained popularity worldwide in the 80s or 90s, after it was translated from German to English. Imagine what other, Non-European languages could be discussing, and it's not global because it's in the 'wrong' language. The Internet is helping break this, but slowly. 

The whole Medical vs Social Model of disability begins to take on a different light when compared across cultures and ethnicities. The Medical model is pretty universal, considering it states a person's impairment is their disability, and therefore their responsibility to 'suck up' and deal with it. The Social Model on the other hand argues that a disability is socially constructed - if a society was constituted only of deaf individuals, their lack of hearing would not be seen as a disability, and their society would be built around accommodating this. What is disabling then depends on what society an individual lives in. Going back to autism, the website 'WrongPlanet.net' supposes that anybody on the spectrum can sometimes feel like an outside observer, an alien trying to learn a bunch of Social Rules and Norms which are never clearly explained. It's a sentiment which resounds with a lot of people on the spectrum and gives another perspective to the debate which isn't based purely on physical disability.

So then, a non-westernised view of disability can become a very specific idea. The whole 'disability as tragedy' viewpoint is echoed in places without welfare, with a lot of beggars etc showing obvious signs of disability. Among the Tuareg in Mali, freckles and small buttocks are counted as a serious impediment to marriage and could therefore be considered a disability.  In the mountainous areas of northern Pakistan community disability programmes do not exist,  but it is common to see individuals with learning disabilities wandering about free and perfectly accepted. The infantilisation of people with learning disabilities does not occur in the same way that it does in my own culture, Britain. In Afghanistan, an individual with any kind of disability is considered 'shameful' as their impediments are a barrier to marriage, and one individual with a disability (particularly congenital disabilities) can impact the chances of marriage of their entire family. Impairment itself is only an impairment when it impedes on the mainstream narrative of a culture, and so these cherry picked examples are only a small glimpse into the global experience of disability. Westerners like to medicalise everything, while some other cultures do not, whether it is through lack of resources or lack of faith in western medicine.",3,,3,0,0,

I would try to look into finding a doctor who specializes in autonomic issues to do a full work up. Some causes of autonomic dysfunction can be treated very successfully, some you have to kind of chip away at with a variety of partial measures, but there are things that can be done so please don't let what sound like less than informed doctors talk you out of trying to find a diagnosis and treatment. 

As for the ""don't push for a diagnosis or your license will be revoked..."" advice that you're getting, from doctors?  I would say find a new doctor. I've had syncope since I was 8 years old (I'm in my 40s now) and although I had a hard time *getting* my license, that was because I had NO diagnosis when I was a teen, just a ""hey you lose consciousness and we don't know why, so take these seizure meds or be loc free for 6 months, otherwise you can't drive"".  At that time, because they didn't know what I had that was causing or precipitating my passing out, they were just like ""uh, maybe it's epilepsy?"" and I got treated as if I were likely to have a loc at any moment without warning, when in reality, I have orthostatic intolerance issues and driving is usually ok (and on days when it's not, I don't drive).  I also have notice before my syncope - it's not like it just comes on where one second I'm fine and the next I'm unconscious and convulsing.  Having the diagnosis of orthostatic intolerance and neurally mediated syncope helps for me because it's recognized that there are measures you can take to prevent or post-pone a loss of consciousness, and that there are situations where it is more (and less) likely to happen. Does that make sense? 

Are you in the US? Have you asked for accommodations at work?  Having it on your medical record that your doctors think you should have a job where you can lay down would help a disability case I think. Based on my own experience, I'd say having asked for accommodations helps too. If you can show that you tried working with accommodations but still aren't able to maintain gainful full time employment, then you might have a better chance of being approved.",1,,1,0,0,

4d0fb8e4-d3d6-42c2-863f-a48b7a95aa91,1461189486,If I could get rid of my anxiety I could. It sucks. I don't like the meltdowns and the OCD flaring up when something bothers me and I don't like getting anxious in social situations or when I start to worry and I don't like how I can't handle stress well and any huge change in my environment. Asperger's is the least of my worries. ,1,,1,0,0,
77da6e06-5445-48e8-bc8b-22909861660c,1461554958,"One of my biggest concerns about this type of parenting blog is its impact on the child later in their life. I can't imagine how awful it would be to have a detailed account of my every childhood embarrassment just sitting there online, especially if the names were not redacted. Applying for college, getting a job, dating, finding housing, and many other processes would be very difficult with this type of material out there. The parents who write ""disabled child"" blogs without anonymity are creating time-bombs that could destroy their children's chances at an independent adult life.

It seems like parents of disabled people write these blogs assuming that their children will never be capable of adult life, or will never be competent enough to read what is being written about them. The problem with that way of thinking is that people change and learn. Yes, some people may keep in adulthood the same ability level that they had as children, but many can become independent if given the right resources. This is the 21st century, so of course they will use the internet and find the things their parents wrote about them! Even entirely dependent adults will be affected by the existence of these blogs--I can easily imagine a caregiver searching the name of their patient and finding all kinds of potentially biasing information.

I think parents of disabled children should be very careful to keep their posts anonymous if they choose to have a blog, and they should try to avoid posting embarrassing images or videos. Actually, I'm beginning to think that they shouldn't even be posting publicly in many cases. If you absolutely need to get your parenting experience out there, why not set up an email newsletter or password-protected blog? Parents could still share the newsletter or blog on other platforms (hopefully without identifying details, as that would defeat the purpose), but it wouldn't be indexed by search engines.

Life is already difficult as a disabled person. Why should a parent make their child's life harder by releasing material that could be used to harass them or discriminate against them in the future?",5,,5,0,0,

I have a care manager who is my point of contact if I need to make a complaint or resolve an issue with my carer and the carer can go via the manager if they have an issue with me too. Cost is enormous but that might not be the case for you if you're not looking for someone full-time. 

The experience has been mixed to positive. I have had some really great people and I have also had some people that have turned my life upside down. It's a huge learning curve and you do get better with time but it can be tough occasionally. Do you have any specific concerns?",1,,1,0,0,
82905be6-8ec4-46d7-b1d9-93b9f7796b4b,1461693152,"It’s impossible to assess your likelihood of qualifying for disability without a thorough assessment of your medical records.  However, if you believe that you are disabled, it is in your interest to contact your local SSA field office and get the ball rolling on the application process.

In order to improve your chances of qualifying for disability, you will want thorough and comprehensive medical records.  You have stated that your alleged impairments are depression and fibromyalgia.  Regarding depression, it is in your interest to have records documenting regular treatment with a specialist (psychiatrist or psychologist).  You will also want to have your prior and current medical regimes documented, and have documentation regarding the ineffectiveness of the medications that you have tried.

You describe Fibromyalgia as a “non-starter” but that is not always the case.  Frequently, claimants allege Fibromyalgia with little to no medical documentation except for complaints of chronic pain and maybe a diagnosis by their primary care physician.  Claimants who have undergone thorough testing, including tests such as a tender point examination, rheumatoid factor test, anti-nuclear antibody test, and other blood work (see the SSR I link below) will generally be viewed more favorably.  The SSA policy on analysis of fibromyalgia can be found in [SSR 12-2p]( https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR2012-02-di-01.html).  

I won’t lie to you.  Your young age and your particular impairments are unlikely to make for a quick approval.  If you get denied in your initial and reconsideration hearings (unless you are in a prototype state, in which case no reconsideration hearing exists), you may appeal your case to an administrative law judge.  At that point, it is in your interest to try to find a disability attorney.  Don’t bother getting one prior to the hearing level appeal.

In terms of the negative, I'm perennially concerned about not being good enough. It took me an extremely long time to accept my condition (still working on it, actually) and to recognize that others can accept it too.

Regarding the positive, I think that living with a disability has given me a slightly different perspective on relationships (of any kind, romantic or not), on what it means to listen, to care, and to provide support. I believe that living with a disability has enabled me to be a better partner, emotionally speaking. This is a wonderful advantage.",2,,2,0,0,

They will make you sign paperwork stating that you will pay back the continued benefits should you lose your appeal. However, if it does come to past usually you can get it expunged with a hardship waiver.
