Basically, if you want to get her on disability, you'll likely have to support her yourself for however long the approval process takes. If you can get her on foodstamps and state disability, and write up a ""contract"" to ""pay you back"" for rent and whatever else to show the SSA, she'll have a much easier time getting on disability, and won't lose a portion of any income-based disability payment (SSI) she might get because of not having a high enough rent payment. Not all states will give you state disability while applying for federal disability. Check with whatever organization handles Medicaid/foodstamps in your state. If she's living with you, you'll likely have to right a letter saying she is sub-renting and responsible for all her own food and food prep for her to be able to get on foodstamps.

The author has Ehlers Danlos and is presumably not a full time wheelchair user as she claims to have an invisible illness.

They are both classified as much higher than their quad teammates as they have far more function. 

There are para sports out there for people with EDS. Someone who instantly dismisses para sports with no comment as to why or the classification in various sports just sounds like someone who hasn't done their research. If you have the stamina to be a law student (not an easy courseload), run a popular blog, coach other people and hope to run a charity, you have enough stamina to do some sort of para sport.

phys C 8/15-nl vis, nl gait, nl stance, incomplete squat, no AD, nl transfer, mild decrease ROM L spine, hip and R knee, strenth 4/5 LEs, 5/5 UEs, nl sensory, joints stable and non tender""*

No new medical evidence since your reconsideration (basically since your previous claim). Physical consultative examination (the SSA contracted doctor) shows normal vision, normal gait, incomplete squat (you couldn't go down all the way), no assistive device, normal transferring on/off table, mild decreased range of motion of your lumbar spine, hip and right knee. lower extremities 4/5 strength (which is a mild decrease and not considered all that significant), upper extremities 5/5 strength (normal), normal sensory exam, joints stable and non-tender (which means no evidence of ligament/tendon damage). 

Essentially what they are describing is an almost normal physical exam. Looking at your CDR screenshot the medical evidence does show that there has been some improvement in your condition when compared to when you were allowed for benefits. I can only go off that document but it seems like when you were allowed you sought consistent and non-conservative pain management treatment with sensory issues (hypersthesias) and you were in pain bad enough to need a wheelchair. Now look at it from SSA's perspective for the current situation: you don't have a regular doctor, don't get regular treatment, and your exam was normal. 

I'm going to be honest with you. If I had your case (assuming the CDR analysis form is factual to the medical evidence) I would've ceased you as well. I can understand a gap in treatment when you move but you've been living in Florida now for over a year and still don't seek regular care. For someone that supposedly has chronic pain (and this coming from someone with a chronic back issue and a SCS) that is incredibly inconsistent. Again, I don't say this to be mean but this is the way that SSA is going to look at it. 

I think that your plan of having detailed notes at your hearing is your best bet. Continue to try to get a doctor but that should be for your own well being, not for SSA. I think it is wise for you to look through your medical records and make notes of things you think are incorrect or inaccurate but please realize that this only will get you so far. Unless you have some sort of compelling proof that your doctors wrote down inaccurate information SSA will side with your doctor.

Also make sure you tell the psychiatrist how much GAD has affected your life and still does, and what kind of obstacles it creates. Be as concrete as possible when you explain why holding on to a job would be impossible - I cannot drive due to X, and so on (just an example).

Best of luck. Tell us how it went if you feel like it.",1,,1,0,0,

5fd5dee1-e998-4e91-aee9-a4d85bf387dd,1468702624," I think there are some little changes that could be made to make the game accessible to everyone without making major changes like adding or moving pokestops and gyms. Feel free to add or critique. These are just what I've come up with using the app occasionally as a cane user. 

Maybe your ""ring"" can be wider, allowing you to walk fewer steps before seeing a Pokemon, as well as simply making Pokemon more likely to appear in suburbs and rural areas. The rings for gyms and stops could also be wider. Perhaps even make incense/lures more affordable (right now I believe it's 8 incense for $5/500 coins). 

Your eggs could automatically gain ""steps"" each day simply for using the app and maybe doing something extra to the eggs each day, like tapping them. It will last slightly longer but they will still hatch eventually. Maybe there could be an ""egg warmer"" item or something that boosts a hatch. 

Allow users to mark places accessible/inaccessible. Other users with this feature on will be able to see if a location is inaccessible or not before they get all the way there. 

Add a feature to make things larger or more prominent (which is really basic and should have been included in the first place, along with other vision accessibility features). 

Get a ""free"" stop every day you login with tiered rewards, similar to other mobile games that give rewards for daily players. These could be your usual pokestop items. 

Allow users to battle any gym on their screen, whether they're in the ring or not. I have a gym across the street from me and even in the parking lot of the library I'm not close enough, which is kind of annoying especially when I can see the gym players from wherever. For users that don't have a gym that close to their house, you could get a couple chances to battle a ""national/state/local gym"" every day. Those gyms would be available to anyone living in the country/state/city of that gym. This however may be the most work out of any features but still worth looking into. ",4,,4,0,0,

The biggest issue I have now is the pain.  Over the past 10 years it's defined every day of my life.  Leg pain, back pain, neck pain and burning in the shoulders.

In order to attempt simple everyday tasks, you have to put your body thru motions that it wasn't really designed to do.  Your muscles have atrophied away to where there's nothing left.

It's kind of one of those ""invisible"" disabilities.   You look normal enough where people think there's nothing wrong with you but odd enough that people stare and make fun of you.  

You have a caved in chest because your pecs are gone.  Your muscles that hold your shoulder blades down are gone so your shoulders hang forward.  I can only raise my arms to about mid chest level.  When I do, my shoulder blades stick way out because there's nothing to hold them down.

Your legs throb and you find it difficult to walk ever short distances.  Your neck can't support your head weight and your head droops forward.  Your face muscles go and you can't whistle or blow a balloon up.  Your face appears to be emotionless.  Your entire upper body is void of most muscles.  Nothing but bones.  Your arms become sticks.  Your belly protrudes out like your a lifelong beer drinker.

I've always had a hard time accepting my disease.   As a kid I was proud of my muscles.  I tried to be normal but you are always finding out you can do less and less.

I was embarrassed of my chest.  Mortified when I had to take my shirt off.  Having to listen to people make fun of my body or endure the stares, the whispering and fingerpointing.

Such a lovely disease.  Lol.  No cure and your muscles are gone never to be seen again.  Oh 
...and it keeps eating away till the day you die.

I've always dreamed about what it must feel like to raise your arms over your head.  It really does look like it must be really cool to do.

Anyway....that's a little more insight.

I'd suggest adding a class system where players can take on one of the vast number of roles found in the Pokemon universe. In addition to the trainers the games centre around, there are also breeders, nurses, professors, rangers, and so on. A Pokemon nurse, for instance, could set up a hub near their location that trainers can visit to heal their pokemon (is that a thing in Go?) and get rewarded with points and egg progress etc whenever someone checks in, thus circumventing the need to walk large distances.

19.4%.  a very high number. (almost 50 Million) but still no-where near half. 

Nearly 1 in 5 People Have a Disability in the U.S., Census Bureau Reports
Report Released to Coincide with 22nd Anniversary of the ADA

About 56.7 million people — 19 percent of the population — had a disability in 2010, according to a broad definition of disability, with more than half of them reporting the disability was severe, according to a comprehensive report on this population released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The report, Americans with Disabilities: 2010, presents estimates of disability status and type and is the first such report with analysis since the Census Bureau published statistics in a similar report about the 2005 population of people with disabilities. According to the report, the total number of people with a disability increased by 2.2 million over the period, but the percentage remained statistically unchanged. Both the number and percentage with a severe disability rose, however. Likewise, the number and percentage needing assistance also both increased.

I mean, I'm all for making entertainment accessible, but if you're talking about a game that's main mechanic is movement, and you're movement-impaired like me, you just don't play that game. It's not about making a small change here or there, it would involve a complete overhaul of the mechanic the entire game is based on, and very likely break the game for the majority of other users, and that's just not reasonable to me. There are certain things in life that our limitations are most likely going to keep us from experiencing, regardless of adaptations, and I think part of being disabled is accepting that and knowing when it's reasonable to expect adaptations and when to accept that asking for them goes beyond what is reasonable and becomes an entitled demand, and I think this borders on that.

Do you have to get a certification or formal training for your dog? No, and anyone who offers a service dog-specific (rather than general obedience) certification is scamming you. Are there certain standards that your dog's training should meet in case you are ever in an ADA suit and prove that your dog is a service dog in court? Yes. 

Right now your dog has an untrained instinct; in order to legally be a service dog, it has to perform a *trained* task. That means that you have to train your dog with a specific warning response or other behavior when he detects a seizure. Without at least that much training, you would not have any legal rights that would be supported in court. 

So obedience training, at least enough to have a trained seizure detection task, is critical. There are a million billion kajillion reasons to have a much higher obedience training standard than that for a service dog, but the task-training is the primary legal requirement. So go take an obedience class and progress through CGC/advanced obedience to learn the skills as an owner-trainer to train that task; hopefully in the process of learning dog training (because obedience classes are about you as a trainer, not just the dog) you will learn more about service dogs and the obedience standard you need to meet to be, not just the bare minimum standard of ADA-compliant service dog handler, but a good ambassador for the service dog community.

You need to know your rights and responsibilities ASAP.  Talk to people who have SDs, learn about all the bullshit we face from the general public and whether or not it will make any anxiety worse (sometimes it does, especially social anxiety or agoraphobia).  Talk to your doctor.  Find a trainer who has experience with training SDs, get your dog evaluated to see if he/she is stable enough to complete the training for public access.  It's very extensive, and honestly, the majority of dogs can't do it.  Your dog will need to be 100% bombproof in public and with task completion.  Make a list for the trainer of tasks that would be helpful to you.  A SD legally only has to do one task to mitigate its owner's disability, but three is suggested by the IAADP.  Seizure Response (helping you during/after a seizure) is a good one to start with.  Keep in mind that Seizure Alert/Seizure Detection (alerting before a seizure) is NOT considered a task because it is not a trained/trainable behavior.  Some dogs do it naturally, but we don't know how/why or how to train it.  So your dog will need to be trained to do at least one task other that Seizure Alert.  Task training is the fast part of SD training.  Public Access training can take about a year or two, and during that time, your dog would be considered a service dog in training, which are not covered by the ADA but *may* have state laws protecting their rights.

4bf3a028-2408-429b-98da-35b2148745ee,1468680463,"Ok here are my thoughts:

As I understand it the game data is just spoofed from Inverness, which is why there are problems with rural areas (that might not be correct, but it's my understanding.) If they're going to go back and change things to add stops in rural areas, would it be so difficult to also add stops in a few accessible places also? I don't know that much about game development, but I don't see why one is different from the other. 

I agree that asking the game developers to take away stops is harsh and pointless. Except maybe the one at the holocaust museum (accessible or not.)

As someone who struggles to walk I have a very bittersweet relationship with Pokemon go so far. The entire point of the game is to walk. They're not going to change that, obviously. But the fact that the game locks you out if you're traveling over 20 mph makes it hard for me to even ask someone to drive me around to play. That's a safety issue to stop people from playing in their cars, but could it be tweaked? 

Incense is supposed to bring Pokemon to your location, but it seems to work poorly. I would be happier if I could drop a lure module at my house or something. 

I can walk a little, and when I do I want it to count. This game is actually encouraging me to walk more than ever! I'll leave it to my physio to decide if that's a good thing. One tiny tweak that would improve my experience and help me budget my spoons so I don't get stuck outside chasing me pokemon too far from my house or waste my walking energy on nothing would be a better Pokemon locating system. Fuck, sell it in the store and charge pokecoins! But the one step, two step, three step system is hard to actually use if those steps hurt. I would love an arrow pointing in the direction that the Pokemon you're chasing is. That's all. One step north. Three steps south.

If you start letting yourself try to take on the future's problems you will quickly get swamped.

Build a health care team and look to them for answers. Choices like which mobility device to use and when you finally need to agree to use it, these decisions can/should be left to experts. Physical therapists can teach you how to use devices correctly as well. If you are having problems ask for help with solutions or recommendations to resources that can help you find solutions.

Treat your mind as well as your body. Disabilities are stressful. Stress can exacerbate symptoms. Besides therapy I try to practice meditation and daily gentle yin yoga.

Look for support. There are books, support groups, and forums dedicated to handling these things. Try to keep close with friends and family too (even though it is tempting to push them away during these times).

""Without treatment, a person with avoidant personality disorder may lead a life of near or total isolation. They may go on to develop a second mental health disorder, such as substance abuse, or a mood disorder, such as depression"".


Therefore, I wonder if professional help is available over the phone or online. Further, you could try 7 cups of tea which is the website for free peer counseling. But I would recommend a professional in person.

 you are totally looking at the worst. If it is doable In spite of ADHD, you rationalize that you couldn't do it because of avoidant personality. vice versa also. I believe you must find something you want to do! Teaching music, making a website, writing a book, going on dates, working out, knitting, woodwork! Anything. And then invest a lot of your time into learning the skill. Try not to spend money at first other than for necessities. The library is a good resource. The Internet is a good resource. Talking to people online is a good resource. I think as you immerse yourself more and more you might want to meet other people with it. You might be able to make money with it.

I didn't learn it in school (they thought my vision was not going to get worse. oops) and I really wish I had learned it earlier. I took a class through the mail to learn it.

If you're totally blind a screen reader may be enough to get by, but if you have low vision (like me) and you don't use a screen reader 100% of the time, only when your eyes are super tired/etc., then the screen reader can be very frustrating because you don't practice with it enough to actually get good at using it. Does that make sense? 

Braille is, in general, better for any type of public speaking, or using around the house for labels, or for signs in public, etc. I can't think of a way to use a screen reader or electronic speech to do any of those things. The reason people don't want to teach braille isn't necessarily because screen readers are better, but because teaching braille takes more time and is more expensive.

If your disability prohibits you from engaging in certain sports, you either partake in adaptive forms of the sport (example: ""wheelchair basketball"") or you accept that this particular activity is not for you. What you don't do is insist that if you can't play, then nobody should. That's a juvenile mentality.

If I am remembering right, the DSM has somewhere between 8-10 diagnostic ""criteria"" for BPD. To qualify for the diagnosis you only need 5 of those traits. So you can be diagnosed with BPD regardless of any previous ADHD diagnosis or absent any impulsivity issues. 

One also needs to look at the **intent** of the impulsivity. ADHD is characterized by inattention and impulsivity in almost all areas that require some degree of concentration. This includes being unable to finish school work, pay attention to a movie, etc. The impulsivity comes from the inattention and inability to focus. 

Impulsivity when you talk about BPD is characterized by actions that are inherently harmful. The DSM requires this impulsivity to be in areas that can be considered ""self damaging"". Impulsivity with a disregard to any physical/emotional consequences (self harm, binge eating, substance abuse, etc) is one of the hallmarks of BPD. This is also why those with BPD often have extremely caustic relationships with others. We all get mad at our significant others, but a normal person may leave the room for a few minutes to calm down and collect themselves. A BPD person is more likely to make a vague suicide attempt/self harm as a response to the conflict. 

TL; DR: they don't cancel each other out because of the causes and intent (or lack thereof) of impulsivity are different.

They won't provide one if you already have a chair but if you don't have one at all they usually do?

As for tips - a couple of things I learnt the hard way:
1) Make sure the front wheels are aligned with the back wheels, that way you can go up those two track ramps.
2) If you want it to work well outside make sure that the front and back wheels aren't too thin in diameter (eg the alber efix is a cheap chair that they say is good for both indoors and outdoors but if you look it up you'll see that the wheels aren't very outdoorsy). If you can get solid wheels (ie wheels without air) that's a big bonus.
3) Ask about what the mileage is on the battery and make sure that fits in with your daily activities.
4) You might not want something too heavy depending on your weight and your daily activities (bear in mind that most ramps have a 300-350kg weight limit and that if you do any travelling by plane then this might make things a bit more difficult). I doubt that you'll find anything that's ridiculously heavy in that price range though so you can probably ignore this point. You also don't want it to be too light if you're doing a lot of going up and down hills.
5) Ask about different seating options, some are more comfortable than others depending on your condition.

Hope this helps a bit.

If changing the game to suit a minority ruins the experience for the majority, I don't see that as fair. We're talking about a game after all, an app. Not being able to play a game really isn't an infringement on your basic rights as a human being, and lots of people are restricted from various games for plenty of reasons, from where they live to not being able to afford them. From what I understand there is already a mode offered that brings the pokemon to the player. That sounds as though it should fix the problem (from what I understand of the game, mind). I see the overall benefits of this game as being far more important and longlasting than a some hurt feelings here and there; sedentary kids being more active, getting more exercise, cutting back on juvenile obesity, which leads to less preventative health problems that are a drain on medical resources, which leads to more resources available for people like us who rely on such help. That's far more important in the long run. 

As for the fact that you pity me for accepting my limitations, well, I feel the same for you for having bought into the hubris of insisting you have none. It's fallacy, a self-serving delusion. *Everyone* has limitations, not just disabled people. Some people aren't smart, aren't good looking, are poor, etc. If you're allergic to peanuts, you don't eat peanuts (or keep several epi pens on hand). If you're epileptic, you probably have to stay away from games, movies and shows with flashing lights. If you're diabetic, you may have to skip on dessert even if you really want it. If you have dwarfism, you're not reaching that high shelf without help. If you fight these things, you're fighting yourself and reality. Now, you can certainly refuse to let certain things get in your way if you're determined, such as the disabled players who have figured out how to work around the Pokemon Go mechanics in order to enjoy the game. But that means what they're dealing with is a difficulty, not a limitation. Just like diabetics who perfect sugar free recipes to enjoy the foods they want, or a dwarf who is handy with a step stool and a grabber, if they prefer to help themselves. But to get to that point, they had to accept that their circumstances afford them challenges others don't experience, and to know when something is a lost cause. Like eating peanuts if that is going to kill you. 

As for your question regarding getting into a theater; I get there just fine. Getting places is not much of a problem for me, even if stairs are involved. It may take me a little longer, but I'll get there. My problem is sitting still for extended periods of time. It's painful, and my lower legs swell if they're not elevated, but that doesn't mean I expect theaters to completely renovate to add recliners. That's not feasible. So that means if I go, I sit at the end of the row so I can get up periodically without disturbing others. That's on a good day. On a bad day I get random episodes of convulsions, and I stay home, for my own safety. The former problem is a difficulty, the latter is a limitation. If I'm in a place where I can't quickly lie down before an episode starts, I'm going to fall, and probably injure myself and possibly whoever I fall into. These are dystonic convulsions caused by autoimmune inflammation in the brain, I lose complete control of my left side, and there's really nothing to be done except wait them out. I accept the limitations the random, untreatable aspects of my condition impose in my life. When it comes to simply having motor dysfunction in walking, or being allergic to sunlight, I've found ways around those problems. But random convulsions? Not much to be done except accept that they're part of my life, and make jokes about getting a young priest and an old priest to exorcise my demons. I really have no chance for advocacy because my combination of issues is so rare and strange very few people are affected by them, and demanding changes to accommodate at most half a dozen people out of hundreds of thousands doesn't make sense to me.",1,,1,0,0,

Beyond the obvious comment of ""screw what other people think of it"", there is another perspective: cane as signifier. A cane (or other medical accessory) signifies to other people that your pain is real.  Yes, it sucks that people don't recognise invisible disabilities for what they are (and we should all work to educate people about that issue), but you may find that having the cane is actually helpful to you insofar as it validates your pain in the eyes of others.  As another commentor mentioned, the cane means ""I'm not drunk, its this damnable medical condition!"" - it means ""Take me seriously when I say I need to sit down for a minute"".  

So get yourself a fabulous cane (or ten) that screams *you* and rock it. Talk to your friends and family, explain why you need it - you'll probably be surprised at how quickly it becomes a non-issue.  Good luck :)

What I *don't* support is someone making that decision for someone else while they sleep by stabbing them to death. What I *don't* support is that jerk up above who thinks the disabled should only be allowed to live if they can meet his criteria. 

Moreover, many of the things you talk about (which are real struggles for those with disabilities) are things that could be vastly improved if society actually could be bothered to put aside their assumptions that all disabled folks are just useless resource-drainers. My guess, from what you've said, is that you can work but a. your options are limited and b. I assume you come up against pretty regular discrimination (I know I sure do. Hell, I'm working from home and I still haven't told my employer that I'm disabled for fear that I'll be let go.). 

According to the person I replied to, you should only be allowed to live if you can fend for yourself. Well fuck. Bye Stephen Hawking - you can't fend for yourself so we're going to let you die but, hey, thanks for all those cool things that you did for quantum physics. Too bad you couldn't benchpress 100lbs.

I would love to be able to have an open conversation about the right to die.

I'm too busy trying to justify the fact of my existence to people like the guy I originally replied to.

I regret that my opinion upset you so much as to throw up such a large wall of text as a rebuttal. For what it's worth, I have revised my opinion (I'm allowed to do that, right? The unspoken rules of Reddit change so often it's difficult to keep track sometimes).

Perhaps it would be better to say that the game should have been made differently. I think we can both agree that the game does have mechanics that by definition exclude people with physical disabilities. I don't play Pokémon myself, having gone through puberty long before those cards hit the shelves, but I would think that it shouldn't be impossible to create a game mode that is more inclusive, perhaps an alternate game mode that doesn't require walking long-distances. I'm not a game developer but as a disability advocate and disabled streamer, Not to mention someone who interacts with game developers on a regular basis, I hold to my opinion that Nintendo got it wrong when it comes to inclusive video game design. And if you read many of the articles and accounts written by disabled and able-bodied gamers alike, they all are in agreement that this game excludes people with physical disabilities to an unnecessary degree.

Of course, you do bring up an important philosophical point: and that is why game development companies should develop their games to be as inclusive as possible for the maximum amount of people, if they should be inclusive at all. From my own part, I believe that physical limitations are not something to be simply ""accepted"" unless it's a last resort. I feel terrible for you that you have looked at your own limitations in your life and leave them as anything other than obstacles to overcome. Out of curiosity, when you're out and about, and you want to go to a movie theater but can't get in for some reason, do you just accept that and not make any waves and leave the problem for some other disabled person to deal with further down the road, or do you advocate for yourself and do something about it?

Sure, the two of us will never be professional counterstrike players, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't find ways to play the game if we want to, and that doesn't mean that we shouldn't pressure game companies to patch their existing games for accessibility and to develop their future games likewise.

I really hate to respond to a novel with a novel, but you raise a great many points: some of which have caused me to revise my opinion that distresses you so much. I no longer believe that Pokémon go should never have been made, but I do definitely believe that the game could and should be made by accessible for the physically disabled. Unfortunately, as a disability advocate, I would be extremely remiss if I didn't say that the game needs some serious and immediate changes to include people like us.",2,,2,0,0,
ca2d5ddf-11bc-4597-abb5-d3f7ae707019,1469033908,"You need a really good positive reinforcement that will motivate him.   These kids have been in therapies and educational settings most if not all their life and know how to sabotage a lesson if they aren't motivated to participate.   The key is to find something to motivate them.    

What stood out to me was he likes making sounds.    Have you tried rewarding him with a fun sound activity for participation?    My vision impaired child tends to gravitate to those types of things also.   

Story time isn't above and beyond duty.    My son's teacher works almost every lesson she has to teach him into a story because that is one of the few ways he will respond.  

Build trust with him, take time to do something he enjoys and you will probably find he will start to respond better to you.   Once again positive reinforcement is very effective.   

Change and transitions are very difficult for children with multiple severe needs.  You most likely won't see great results until he has had a chance to bond with you and you have learned to adapt yourself to the way he can interact.    I pretty much expect little to no progress from my son when he is in a new school environment for at least a few months due to this issue.   It is just one of those things you know will happen and you make the best of it.   Fortunately our school specializes in multiple severe disabilities so they always strive to keep things on an even keel for students as much as possible to minimize this loss in progress.     

As for potty training I doubt you will have much success unless it is done in the home setting also.   You may want to bounce this off of one of your peers and see if anyone has had success without home participation.  You may also want to talk to the parents/guardians there may be a valid medical reason they haven't tried.    

ETA:    

We don't use food for motivators (my son is NPO due to severe gastric issues).     Sound books, keyboard time, child's drum (the lollipop drum specifically because my son doesn't know how to break it), adapted stories, Ipad apps etc....         

Do you have good adapted equipment lending libraries nearby?    If not you may have to do some fundraising or ask for straight up donations.    In my area people seem to financially back special needs students.   We have major bank and snack company sponsors for one of their field trip days.  Because our school is specifically special needs the school district didn't want to spend the money to stock the library.    Parents were the ones who paid for the books so our children could have a library.    I am not from a wealthy district.

I always kind of feel that way though I have no official diagnosis. It takes me awhile to pick up on things and I'm ridiculously hard on myself when I feel like i'm falling behind (which makes me feel worse and fall further behind). Look for a job that is fairly basic (I started out as a bank teller) and learn all there is to learn about your job.. even if its something like working at Chipotle or whatever. Give yourself time to learn the job, ask lots of questions from a place of process improvement/money saving. If its an office job, take lots of notes. Find a friend who you can ask your silly questions to so you're not bothering the boss all the time. When you learn enough, start paying attention to the things your manager does, the way they interact with people, etc. and consider whether you'd be good at that job. I started out as a bank teller which is pretty simple task wise. I became really interested in banking related things and researched a lot of stuff on my own. This helped me chat with customers more and be more confident about considering branching into other areas of the industry. I did some temp work as an operations assistant for a few months (I didn't learn a TON but I DID learn a new banking software to send/receive wires and a little bit about ACH). With this knowledge of this software, my bit of operations experience, and a little bit of college under my bed (seriously, one class), I landed a job at a larger bank as their project assistant with similar roles to my operations assistant position.. and I used the same software for wires. So I had a leg up there. Once there for awhile, I learned all the jobs in my department and was able to fill in as needed. Eventually they moved me into a permanent role in one of the roles I'd learned during my rotation in the department. I didn't like it at first but later went on to really excel and I think I made a difference in the process. It was a far more complex risk management position that I never thought i'd be capable of handling but it turned out to be a total breeze. I found a friend (the person who got promoted out of this spot that I took) and asked her my questions and she helped me a TON. I took TONS of notes and asked lots of questions. 
In a future job in payroll at a large company, I started out without any experience and slowly let the information sink in. I asked questions until I understood and used that information to make suggestions to process improvements to save money and time. My coworkers (all older women) LOVED working with me because they saw me as a young person eager to learn and someone willing to ask questions about other duties in the department. They liked explaining their jobs to me and were really kind when I did struggle because they could tell I really enjoyed it. 

In the interm, have you looked at any government or city jobs in your area? The government is usually really hard to get fired from and they're far more accommodating and understanding to those with various struggles disability wise. 

You could also just keep looking for the right culture. The manager of my current job is the absolute best. I was overwhelmed with the information being thrown at me when I was new and feeling like i'd probably get fired... he assured me that he doesn't evaluate speed performance until after a year... before that, he expects that the quality of your work be high and your number of of tasks completed lower. As you have more experience, you learn more and move faster.. that's really an excellent way to manage a team of people, IMO. I really lucked out in the manager department ;)",1,,1,0,0,

37f84417-f829-4671-99d3-7ee8393787ad,1469636030,"Yeah, we definitely do require more resources, no denying that. But there's this underlying assumption by a lot of these people that resources are ""one-use-only"" and that they're being wasted on us. Disabled people, in my experience, pretty much have to spend everything they receive. That money all goes back into the community in one form or another and some of it is paid back in taxes on products, services etc. I hate this idea that we're just a black hole down which money is thrown and never seen again.

I wish people would also understand that sometimes you need to make a large upfront investment in order to get a payoff later. If the government spends money so that disabled people can access their independence and employment then disabled people will be less reliant on some forms of welfare and will be contributing to the system that helps them in the first place. 

So, I totally agree with you. More inclusion is the answer and we have to keep fighting for it, hard. But I think we also need to find a way of including people who are never ever going to be able to work or contribute in the traditional sense. One thing that worries me is that if we make the conversation too focused on employment we risk falling into this trap in which we propagate the idea that peoples worth is only defined by how much dollar they produce. I think it's important to acknowledge that the vast majority of us can probably work with the right support, in some capacity or other. But some of us never will be able to and we have to make sure we don't leave them behind, I don't want them to face the disgusting behaviour of large portions of society on their own.

Parsing geographical data for accessible paths of travel is difficult on the level of natural language processing - not impossible to do at a basic level, but with current tech it's just not feasible at scale.

If it were a crowd-sourced it'd be slightly more attainable, but even then you're talking a very small body of contributors over a huge area. You'd be better off using existing data from crowd-sourced access maps.

I understand what you mean about them basing their assessment on my medical files, I plan to print out my entire file and review them again. I also plan on bringing detailed notes to my hearing. 

I was examined by one of their (SSD) doctors in August 2015 (that's what 8/15 is referring to). 

This was the doctor's explanation of evidence to back up his claim of my Exertional Limitations (I understand it is based off my files they have, but it does not reflect what I am truly capable of at this time. I say this without exaggeration.) I thought I made myself clear about my limitations at my examination by their doctor in August, but it seems that this was not reflected accurately. 

Is there anyway I could get an explanation of what these abbreviations mean?:

Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/7v42N) of my CDR Analysis form dated 2/16, which is the same as the physical RFC form. 

I am not sure as I need to go over the many pages of my case file, but seems that the implantation of my Spinal Cord Stimulator in November 2012 got lost in the shuffle as it was implanted after I was first granted benefits in 2011, and the review only requested the files from my doctor for 2014. 

Do you think it's enough if I come prepared to detail discrepancies in my files? Also another factor is that I moved from NY where all my doctors were in March 2015 (I'm in Florida now) and I don't really have the resources to find a doctor down here (other than a psychiatrist). I did try to book appointments with two doctors relatively close to me but they only take new patients on a case by case basis and I was denied. I also don't know how realistic it is to try and find one before my hearing on the 26th of this month. 

I'm sorry if I seem that I'm rambling I'm just very nervous about this and frustrated. I just don't know what else I can do other than come prepared to my hearing as my physical limitations are very real.

Bipolar is a recognized reason for disability, but it's not often an *accepted* reason. That's because many people with bipolar can be medicated and work well (like any illness, there's a wide spectrum of severity), even though there are some that can't. For that reason, if bipolar is your only issue, you are far more likely to be denied at any given stage than someone with bipolar + something else.

Interestingly enough, because it's a diagnosis of exclusion, fibromyalgia is NOT an recognized disability (it falls under one of the catch-all areas), so you are essentially guaranteed to be denied during the first two stages (initial application and appeal). However, fibromyalgia is a much more frequently *accepted* disability, so those who have enough documentation to prove they have been diagnosed and that it is interfering with their lives are more likely to be granted disability by the ALJ. 

It's a weird distinction, and stranger in this case because the bit that's likely to win for her is ignored until the ALJ hears it.

At this point I'm not even sure what outcome your searching for. SSA does not award disability onset based on your financial need.

Since you were employed at the time you applied, your means were calculated based on that income projected as lasting through the month of time at applying.  Obviously that abruptly changed and now the financial information that you applied with will likely alter your qualification status now.  It's why, once you do qualify and are enrolled, you are required to report ASAP any significant change in means to determine how it will affect your stipend amount or perhaps even your qualification status altogether.  

So yes, you'll need to reapply online. But I assure you that online process is SO much faster than the old application process used to be in the 1990's. We had my son's determination within 6 weeks IIRC versus the 3-4 months it took with the old process when he was a toddler.  

The disabling condition criteria for SSDI is much more involved and complicated than those for SSI.  If you met the disabling condition requirements for SSI last time around, you'll meet it this time likely as well. Just make sure to include all the info from last application with the new diagnosis to show that again.

You can be diagnosed with both BDP and ADD/ADHD, though the impulsivity would likely present differently in various environments. 

If you're concerned or confused about your diagnosis it may be helpful to read your medical records. It could be that you have some of the diagnostic criteria met but not enough to be considered for the disorder.

&gt; The number of work credits needed for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally, you need 40 credits, 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However, younger workers may qualify with fewer credits.
The rules are as follows:
Before age 24--You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts.


The other issue is the amount. You get a percentage of your earnings when you became disabled. Working part time suggests that your earnings will be low. For example, If you earned 10000 in the past year, 364 would be your monthly check. https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/index.html You can register at social security website and somewhere in there is a page with your dollar amount you would get for disability.

The documentation part will be a minor hurdle. The disability people ask you how the disability affects you. That seemed to be a large part of what they wanted from me. If your doctor doesnt provide enough, you will be assigned a doctor appt with ssd doctor and they will add to the evaluation.

While I think there are areas that can be improved (hearing wait times being #1) when you look at the time between application and decision through the first round of appeals most of the reason that it takes so long is due to forces outside of SSA control. 

80% of a disability decision is gathering paperwork and other evidence. You'd be amazed how uncooperative medical sources, employers, banks, and even claimants can be.  For a disability decision it will only take about 8-10 hours of *actual* time to make the decision. Where the time comes from is waiting for the documentation.  Every time SSA sends something out they have to wait 30 days to get that information; sometimes longer. And those are for sources and claimants who cooperate. If a source is uncooperative we have to get a SSA exam which add another 2 months of processing time by the time they can schedule it and then waiting for the report to come in.

c994b5c6-8bbc-4f0c-8a88-385ea8922f08,1467672316,"First of all, be certain which benefit you are receiving. 
SSDI is based on your work and earnings, and payments could potentially be over $2,000/mo. SSI is needs-based, and will never exceed $733/mo (in 2016, excluding state supplements.)

SSI looks at work to determine SGA when you are filing, but after you're approved, they look at earnings only as income; there are different rules surrounding earned vs. unearned income, but it's all just income.  If you have too much income one month, you aren't due payment.

SSDI also looks at work at the time of filing, but is completely different after approval. There is the 9 month rolling trial work period, during which you can earn *any* amount and still receive payment, after which you go into the extended period of eligibility (EPE) which lasts an additional 36 months. During the EPE, you may be due benefits some months, and not others, depending on whether it is determined that you are earning SGA. **Please note that SSA will not know which months you are due/not due until after the fact - you need to learn the rules and keep track yourself, so that if you are paid for a month you aren't due, you can set the funds aside to repay later. It may take some time, but you will eventually be expected to repay.** If after 36 months, you are determined to have performed SGA, benefits will terminate. If you stop working or drop below SGA, you will have to refile either a new claim, or an expedited reinstatement - both of which are medical reviews. 

During the EPE, if you are working for **wages**, they look first at the gross amount. If it is below SGA, no biggie. If it is above, they can then discount certain things; for example - if you are only required to perform *some* of the job duties that other employees in the same position receiving the same pay perform, they may discount a percentage of your pay equal to the portion of work you aren't doing. They will have to get input from the employer, but if the boss says everyone in this position is paid the same, but GL_HaveFun  can only do 60% of the job, they will deduct 40% of your earnings. 

Likewise, if you have out-of-pocket, unreimbursed expenses related to your condition that you have to have in order to continue working (medications, etc.) these expenses may be able to be deducted. You will have to provide proof of payment, and if it isn't clear how it relates to your condition, your doctor may have to chime in. 

If you are **self-employed**, they will look at your gross/net earnings, whether or not you receive unpaid help from others, whether you have impairment-related work expenses as described above... however they will also look at your ""worth of work."" You may be working 10 hours per week doing [insert whatever you're doing], and you're barely breaking even. They may look at the type of work you are doing, and come to the conclusion that if you did the same work for an employer, you could be earning $50/hour, and the worth of your work is therefore over $2,000/mo. 

There is no alert telling SSA ""he's working!"" until a year or more after the fact - it is your responsibility to report your work and earnings to SSA every single month. If you do online work, you will almost certainly be considered self-employed, so be sure to keep good records of your hours, income and expenses.

If they do allow user subs, I doubt rural areas will have problems for too much longer given how popular the game is.  As far as the locator goes, I remember the terrible GPS drift from Ingress and I know that part of that is a purely technical problem - but that doesn't mean there isn't a solution out there.  I love some of the suggestions below, particularly the ability to mark an area as inaccessible on the map.  Not only would it help players, but it would be a good conversation starter for someone trying to explain the importance of accessibility.

I played Ingress obsessively until my most recent bout of medical nonsense and I have what I think is an interesting bit of context/trivia.  Local players would often go out in groups to take over an area for their faction, and wheelchair users were prized players. The game is really rough on batteries, and having a wheelchair user on your team means you can carry tons of extra battery packs.  I even saw a conversation once where one local faction was (good-naturedly, of course) accusing the other team of ""cheating"" because one of their players was in a chair (and what a chair it was, all tricked out with his faction's logo in LEDs and with a huge battery pack strapped under the seat).  Obviously these people were players in their own right, not just battery mules, but it does give your faction an edge.

I know that doesn't really answer your question, but I wanted to bring it up because it flips the script on disability somewhat - in collaborative play, wheelchair users bring something special to the game and are highly valued by the community.  Maybe that adds something new to the conversation, or maybe its just a bit of interesting trivia.

Further in therapy people often listen rather than give advice so that could be frustrating. Perhaps a life coach is something to consider because that is more advice driven.Finding someone in training who would do it for free or supercheap. Online. Drugs are probably a bad idea unless they are given through psychiatrist. But I do know there are meds that reduce discomfort in your social situations as well as reduce your resistance to doing things.

The issue is, you as a person probably do want to do things, your mind is just so overwhelmed by this condition you are not sure what they are. That is the argument for medication

I feel like you think way too much about the short-term. It is really limiting. Like, treatment might not be good in the short term but would help you long-term. You might not get necrosis if you don't treat yourself, but you will never get better still. One day your hobby will turn into an awesome thing, but it might be a little boring in the short term.

1. 1619B.

To get 1619B you need to be disabled and have income below the income limit. The limit varies state to state but is WAY over the SGA. If your income is over the limit for your state you can request an individual income limit calculation (a base number + what Medicaid spends on you annually).

My legs were going numb, and although I could walk I would stagger and stumble a lot, but was hesitant to use a cane because of the stigma. I used to have people comment that it was a disgrace that I was drunk at such and such a time in the day. Somebody (may have been on here, I can't remember) told me that using a cane would be beneficial for me obviously, but also gives a visual clue to other people. Before they would assume I was drunk/high, but when they saw the cane they then assumed there was a medical problem and I never received any comments again. Living in Scotland I could have got a walking stick provided for me, but I bought my own so it didn't look like the ones handed out to anyone. Again, it's just peoples perception - anybody can fake the need for a cane and get a free NHS one, but mine was purchased, looked different from the NHS ones, and the perception was that it was genuinely required. 

If a cane helps, then definately use one. Most people wil. see it and accept that you have a genuine need for it. There will always be arseholes that try to judge you, but just ignore them. I had an elderly couple behind me in a line at a till when shopping discussing if they bought a wheelchair the government would give them free money - they soon shut up when I pointed out I am virtually paralysed from the chest down, and the wheelchair cost me £3.5k, and wasn't provided free.

ca2d5ddf-11bc-4597-abb5-d3f7ae707019,1467602145,"Everyone I know with children that have complex medical needs writes up doctors orders that are signed by a doctor.  Often those doctors orders will state medical needs will be adjusted as parent sees fit.  Kids with truly complex needs will require constant adjustments in daily care and it simply is unfeasible to go back and forth to the doctor to adjust everything.   These orders will outline daily care, school accommodations in regards to medical issues and steps to take in case of an emergency.  Once the nurse receives the doctor's orders (s)he should look over this plan and then write and submit a nursing plan the parent signs off on.   Nowhere in any of this do they need access to all medical records at the school level.  

As for prescriptions, OTC drugs as well as sunscreen they do not require medical records; Schools require a doctor signed form.  The form must be a standard form from the school district. 

As for public school admittance, services for IEPs is based on developmental evaluation and IQ tests not medical diagnosis although they may use a previous IFSP or IEP for short term until the evaluations can be done (because every school has insisted on doing their own even those in the same district).   The only time medical diagnosis comes up is a very brief outline on the front of the IEP and there is only room for a paragraph or two.   

504's are a different beast and I doubt even a concern since the child sounds very involved.  Vision services are about the only thing that needs medical records we have run into and even then they do not need an entire running history just the relevant diagnosis and doctor's notes from the last vision exam.  

IME doctor patient confidentially should be preserved.  Schools only muck things up if you give them too much access.  Unfortunately, I know of quite a few other parents who have been burned when they gave the schools too much access to doctors and medical documentation.

Opps I forgot special medical devices usually are also put on those Rx forms.

 I got a pretty blue cane that felt like a fashion accessory as well as a mobility device instead of a clinical looking one, which really boosted my confidence.

Basically they would perform care, not in the method that I felt was good for me or my long-term well-being, at whatever time of day they were able to show up, by whoever they would send.

They selectively chose which doctors' opinion they would listen to and left me back into a corner, wondering if it was worth it to even try to survive. Thankfully I am an intelligent, articulate and crafty 35-year-old man, with a supportive wife and family. I fought hard, insisted on all communications being in writing and was able to catch them in their lies, deception and methods. Of course, I'm just one guy against a public system where no individual would ever be held accountable.

The short conclusion to my story is that because they knew they were caught and they knew how determined I was to fight back no matter what the hurricane of feces would look like if the media got a hold of this, they back down rush me into the provincial individualized funding program and I was able to hire another private care company to take over. Until the precedent was set by my situation, no one approved for the individualized funding was able to use another company, it always had to be private individuals, which comes with its own set of challenges. Of course there our benefits, but by having a private organization I don't need to be responsible for training or having backup people forward regulars are ill or taking a vacation.

I think that it was probably the best outcome that I could've had, but the fact that the public system just simply was ready to kick me, and almost anyone else who had a long-standing care situation with them, out and simply say they can't provide your care is just another example that our system is a long way from fully public and the sooner we get a hybrid system similar to some European countries, the better it will be. But, that will never happen with these wasteful, irresponsible Liberals holding the chequebook, clinging to old ways that they shouldn't and charging forward without caution in ways that they shouldn't.",3,,3,0,0,

The trick with an SSA application is that you have to tell the truth about things with exaggerating one way or another. Some people over exaggerate their limitations while some people understate their limitations.  

How I would phrase it similar to ""I do go to piano lessons twice a month but sometimes the anxiety makes it difficult. I really like playing the piano but I often have to cancel my lessons because the anxiety won't let me leave the house"". That kind of statement shows that your condition directly impacts your ability to do something that you enjoy. It quantifies your anxiety. ",5,,5,0,0,

Since you are already in pay status there is no way for them to get paid.

&gt; I noticed on their Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment done by their doctor in February 2016 does not accurately reflect my physical abilities at all. (I can post a redacted version if necessary)

I want to touch on this statement just for a minute. I think you are looking at it backwards. The RFC may not reflect what you *think* your physical abilities are but it will reflect what your medical records and statements show them to be. Those RFC assessments are based on medical reports firstly and not your statements so the first place you need to look is within the medical records themselves. I am not saying that the doctors/examiners don't make mistakes - but they can only go off of what is in the medical records. Anything that you say about your limitations has to be backed up by objective findings in your doctor's notes. So if you have a lazy doctor who keeps poor records (you see it a lot in electronic records where the default is a ""normal"" exam that doesn't get changed by the doctor) that is what gets sent to SSA.",3,,3,0,0,
