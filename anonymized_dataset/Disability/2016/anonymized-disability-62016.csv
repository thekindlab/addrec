The two biggest factors when it comes to disability decision (outside of the medical evidence) comes down to a person's age and what their past work (in the last 15 years) is. You're mom being 62 is a good start as a person's chances of approval go up significantly after the age of 50. What kind of work does she do? If she has been doing more labor-type jobs (anything being on her feet most of the day) she has a better chance of approval than if she has done sedentary/desk work.

You say that she has only been out of work for a month. Has she been getting treatment for the vertigo? Has any of it helped. Part of a disability determination is also that the condition has to last (or be expected to last) for at least 12 months. So if the vertigo is a relatively new thing they may give her an ""E3"" denial which is basically saying ""you're bad now but its not expected to keep you out of work for 12 months"". I know you mentioned the other conditions but if she had been able to work despite them (DM is controlled with meds, TN only causing issues a few times per year) then those will likely not be enough for an allowance. 

If you're mom is considering applying for disability then she needs to start the process sooner rather than later. It can take 3-24 months to get approved benefits (if she is approved). As far as the short-term financial needs she needs to look towards  state assistance (some states have LTD programs). Call the united way (2-1-1) to ask about any local programs as well. Even if she applies for SSDI today and is approved tomorrow there is a 5 month wait before benefits start. ",7,,7,0,0,

Benefits:

* State usually gives you a deduction off your taxes.  For example, in my state (Georgia), They let you deduct 2k * 6% = $120 off your taxes.
* When you spend money from the account, the money isn't taxed.  (Really only a benefit to those with more than 33k (single) or 66k (married) income per year, i.e. not on SSI)
* Doesn't affect your eligibility for SSI / Medicare if balance is below 100k.

Any amount of shit you can give them, that gets them away from you without a fight, is better than fighting. Period. **Do that.** Okay? Okay.

So with that understood, 99.999999% of all dangerous encounters should be resolved. *Almost nobody in the country will ever have to fight for their life.* Times are awesome like that. But what if you have to, though? Well..... You can google some techniques, you can get some advice, but here's the truth of things. In a life-or-death crisis you're not fighting with your brain, you're fighting on instinct. You can fill your head with all sorts of ideas and they're not gonna do you a single lick of good. Once in my life, I did something in a fight that I saw in a movie because my brain thought it would be a good idea. Guy was tossing around a scrawny friend of mine, and I wasn't having it, so I punched him in the neck like Jet Li does in movies sometimes. It was a good hit. It hurt the aggressor, I could tell. Then he proceeded to roundly kick my ass for about five minutes until somebody broke it up, and I couldn't tell you a single thing I did after that initial hit because that whole 'having ideas' thing just goes away when the adrenaline hits.

You don't need advice. If you're concerned for your safety, what you need is *actual training.* And you can probably get it. Somewhere near you there is a self-defense class that can take you through the motions and put this stuff into practice. They're not going to just give you ideas, they're going to give you instincts. 

Now I know what you're gonna say. ""I was actually thinking, like, is there a taser that would work, or something like that?"" You might get some good pointers on that front, and that's good info to have in your brain. *You need to train your instincts for that, too.* Don't just put a weapon in your saddlebag and call it a day.

I don't know about the US system, but in Australia there is a ""points system"" whereby points are given for certain physical actions that can no longer take place due to the disability. When the points go over a certain amount, a disability pension is awarded.

The thing is, the ""points system"" was never advertised. It's generally kept secret and only searching on the internet got me the information. Once armed with this information, I approached my doctor and got him to re-word his medical submission based upon the points system (but not mentioning it of course). It felt a little bit like cheating, but I wasn't lying about anything.

I suggest one course of action is to talk with people who have been awarded disability payments and ask them how the process went - what did they say, was there a points system, etc.

And of course the most important piece of information is medical documents outlining your condition. Ensure that they are all up to date and never apply for disability payments without having medical tests done first.

Got turned down the first time as was expected. Now I'm finally at the pre-hearing phase where my lawyer is gathering all my medical records before requesting the date.

I also have DDD, but mine is caused by Stiff Person Syndrome and hyper-laxity. I was first diagnosed with arthritis in the feet at 23, then throughout my spine at 25. At 27, just 4 days before my 28th birthday I got my diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome. 

There are plenty of lawyers that will give you a free consult; even those who take a profit can only receive up to 25% of the lump sum you get at the end of the case. They generally will only take your case if they are certain they will be able to win. So you may want to just get a free consult from a lawyer who operates this way. It may give you a better idea of how strong your case is. Just don't sign a contract.

There are also medical billers now that are hired by your insurance company to process your SSI case on your behalf if the HMO can tell you should qualify based on the treatment you receive.

&gt; It doesn&amp;#039;t show the more mundane issues which can arise when a person with a disability enters into a relationship with someone who has no disability.

&gt; What I AM judging, is the overuse of disabled characters as things to be pitied or shunned, or the trope that a life with a disability is somehow a fate worse than death.

&gt; More recently, in The Sea Inside, a quadriplegic man fights against a medical bureaucracy for his right to end his own life, and in doing so, simply further solidifies the idea that death is better than disability.

Just a quick fyi, I am a female with cerebral palsy and a severe speech disability.

My first tip is just to be open with your disability. It will honestly weed out all the people who you don't want to date anyways. Sure you might get some creepy messages (I had one guy wanting me to take pics of myself in my wheelchair, and quite a few instant marriage proposals) but everyone has to deal with those. Plus, being open saves from bringing up the whole ""sooo, yeah, I'm disabled"" topic.

As for the ""talking to people online"", just do what comes naturally. If things just aren't clicking, end it. Be respectful if the other person is, block them if they are not. Don't give any social media accounts until you are sure this is a person you would at least consider a friend.

As for meeting in person, safety is extremely important. You shouldn't be fearful, since 99% of people are not axe murders, but shit happens. If you are meeting someone in person for the first time, make sure someone you trust knows, and arrange a time, approximately when you think the date will end for someone you trust to expect contact from you. Arrange to meet somewhere public, preferably somewhere where you have gone so you know it is accessible  (and if you can meet somewhere where someone you know works, that adds a level of safety). Have your own transportation there and back.

Lastly, remind them that they have no obligation to anyone. If things aren't working for them, end it. I recently went on a date and the guy clearly had a better time than I did (I, however, got more words in with the waitress than with him) and I had to make it clear to him that I just did not want to date him.",3,,3,0,0,

To answer your question more directly it is probably because in reality many of these kids never lost their naivety.   Basically they don't recognize stranger danger that someone with a higher level of development would recognize which tends to make them exceedingly friendly (most of the time remember toddler developmental phase is also rife with tantrums).   

Case in point my child at the age of 6 crawled into a person's lap we had never met before and gave them a book.  All he wanted was to be held and read to.  Thankfully I was nearby and the person was kind about the situation but I was horrified. 

I don't know if you have 1 or 2 year old but imagine their social awareness being in a more developed teenager's body or even a young adult.   It is honestly very scary because it makes them easy victims and targets for abuse and bullying.   

Now I have met one kid in my son's self contained classroom who is very strong and has a tendency towards violent tantrums but it isn't intentional meaning he doesn't intend to strike out to hurt.   The best way I can describe it is again imagine a 1 or 2 year old throwing a physical tantrum in a teenager's body and that was pretty much the situation.   I actually had to wrestle the kid once because I was bringing medicine to my son at school and he decided to try and snatch the bottle right out of my hands  It took me and a classroom aide to physically wrestle the medicine away from him.   

I have also met a severely autistic teen at my son's school who was an arm flapper.  Once again no intention to hurt anyone but he was large and if they went on field trips the principle had to go with them because he was the only one strong enough to keep him from accidentally hurting someone with his stimming.  This kid was easily 6 feet and 200 plus pounds.

My son is nonverbal and has an IQ below 60 but his receptive language is quite good.    I have seen him get ashamed before over things I did not think he would even understand fully.

1b6d1d2d-56b7-4f3e-9c59-3b4b06713228,1465172756,"I'd say the answer is a pretty solid yes.

The only arguments I've seen against that is that, of course, disability as a subculture is divided by the many sub-cultures within it, usually defined by the disability a person has, but sometimes also by core beliefs (such as whether 'person first' language matters or the concept of differently-abled vs disabled).

The same however can be said for any subculture. All subcultures can be broken down into component parts. Taking comic book fan subculture as an example, Marvel or DC^1 ? Within Marvel comic fans X-Men or Iron Man or Thor or etc? Within X-Men fans modern X-Men or classic X-Men? And so on and on and on.

With that said, I think your sociology professor/teacher is barking up the wrong tree. Subcultures aren't defined by how their norms and values are different to dominant cultures, but in what criteria that subculture has implicitly agreed on to define themselves by. Most subcultures don't vary from dominant culture in norms and values in any significant way, or even have an implicitly agreed upon set of norms or values that they share and simply define themselves by a shared interest or trait. It'd be just as blurry a thing to ask for for comic fan subculture as it is for disabled subculture.

That said, you don't get marks for being right, you get marks for giving the marker what they want. So ask yourself, what norms and values do the majority of people within disabled subculture hold?

An example I can think of for each:


Norms (how people with disabilities expect/want others to act):

1. Language. Most disabled people have stronger opinions than dominant culture about terminology for and about disabled people.

Values (what people with disabilities want from the world):

1. Accessibility. Obviously accessibility means very different things to different disabled people (ramps, elevators, public transport, audio guides, etc), but it's something that's usually considered important. Even for people who don't have personal accessibility concerns it's often viewed as a positive sign of society acknowledging the existence and rights of the disabled.


Anyway, that's my two cents. Hopefully you'll be able to think of more norms and values that you think apply and other people will chime in with their thoughts as well.

Seriously? Get an attorney. Don't fuck around with this. Hit the phone book and find someone who can file for a continuance until they're ready to plead your case. 

40%-60% of people who make it to the hearing stage are denied there. The overwhelming majority of that percentage do not have a lawyer to fight for them. It's an almost guaranteed approval at the hearing stages of you have a lawyer. It's a crapshoot without.

It's harsh, but I don't understand why you let it get to this point. I went through it. I'm on disability. I know the process, and I know what it's like to be in so much pain and dislocate so easily that you can't work. Why would you gamble with your life and your ability to pay rent? 

If you insist on doing this (very stupid thing), answer every question like you're having your worst day. Be firm, and do not equivocate. Do not say ""maybe"" or ""sometimes."" If you can't do it on your worst day, you can't do it.  They will have a jobs expert who knows your skills looking at a list of jobs he thinks you should be able to do. You need to have reasons none of these will work. Some of his jobs will be imaginary work from home positions that don't really exist -- you need to explain why even if you were padded up in your bed with all your braces on you still can't work from home.

Overall, though, be ready for a rejection if you're doing it on your own. And it is not easy to come back from a rejection -- you have to show a change in circumstance, or that you've gotten markedly worse. The decision not to hire a lawyer for this could literally ruin your life. ",4,,4,0,0,

Sure you can live in a small house/apartment with several roommates but that type of lifestyle isn't for everyone. HUD apartments aren't going to be the greatest but, being capped at 30% of your income, it will always be affordable for you.   You mention buying a house but I would advise against that. While you may be able to get a low mortgage houses are notorious money-pits and, with such a low income, all it will take is one significant house repair and you could really be in some financial trouble. 

How long have you been on SSDI? Are you on medicare yet? Medicare will kick in after 24 months of being on disability; that is a federal program and so you can cross state lines without issue. Medicaid, however, is a state program so it will vary state-by-state. While most states (to my knowledge) will grant medicaid to SSI/SSDI recipients there are other non-medical qualifications that you may or may not meet. 

For you the biggest things are going to be the housing and medical which we've covered. Whatever state you end up in, make sure you also apply for SNAP, TANF, and any other state programs you may qualify for. The extra cash assistance and food stamps will really help make your SSDI stretch farther. If you do decide to move states make sure you do your research before hand. Since those programs are administered by the state some may have some residency requirements that you're unaware of. 

I know plenty of people who have been able to live independently on SSDI. Just make sure you do all your research before moving out and make sure you have all your ducks in a row. I think it is smart to move to a lower cost of living area but you may want to even consider moving to a smaller town (maybe just outside of Vegas or another major metro area) to make your money stretch even farther. Something that is 30 or 40 minutes outside of a major city can cost you 20-30% less. ",5,,5,0,0,

My advice would be to go to a psychologist for your depression and anxiety, because it could help you emotionally feel better. Also, try going somewhere for pain management for your pain.

It is at the state level. It's still federally illegal and since SS is a federal program that concerns me.

A doctor who's sole purpose is to be a MMJ card factory. She sees him once per year as required to keep the card up to date.

This has *got* to be the worst advice I've ever heard. I've never been a victim of violence in the way that you have, but I think that the absolutely last thing I would want to do is have a constant reminder of it. Its almost like your therapist wants you to ""stick around"" to punish your father but really it is hurting you. 

I think that you are having a hard time ""moving on"" and being independent because you are perpetually stuck in pre-teen mode. You are not independent because you were never forced to be. I think this therapist has put you in permanent ""victim"" mode. At some point in your life (and it might as well be now) you are going to have to become independent. Better to do it now in your 30s rather than in your 60s when your dad dies and you're left with no support. 

Are you currently in treatment? Do you have a case manager? The first thing you need to do is slowly work towards being independent. First step is money. Either apply for government support (SSI and/or state assistance) or get yourself a job. If you decide to go the job route look into your states voc rehab services to help with job training and employment support. But, rambleramble, I can hear you say, I'll never be able to work. Well, you won't know until you try, even if it is just a part-time job while your dad still supports you. And don't tell him you are working in case he decides to then fully cut you off. Get a separate bank account and stash the money in there. You already have an apartment and live alone, so really you're only issue is just figuring out how to financially support yourself. 

They way I see it you are at a vital impasse in your life. The longer you allow yourself to convince yourself that you are a perpetual victim the harder it will be to move past that. its tough love, but it is what you need to hear.

One of the biggest fraud problems with medicaid/SSI is with people mis-representing their living situations  in order to improperly receive benefits. People will say that they are divorced when they really aren't, they will say that they are separated and not living with their spouse when they really are, etc. 

The theory is that living together as a couple implies a higher level of ongoing support that is not found with non-partners. If I live with a roommate and don't have a way to pay rent *most likely* that roommate is going to kick me out for not paying my share. However, if I have a partner and I have no income they are not likely to kick me out due to our relationship status. Roommates implies that everyone pays their fair share whereas partners implies support. Drastic example: one partner is disabled with no income but lives with their partner who makes $150K per year. Should that individual be allowed to draw on benefits that are only supposed to be for those with less than a few thousand dollars in assets? Clearly, as a partnership household, that disabled individual could be supported. 

Personally, while I think there is some level of unfairness, it is something that the government needs to do. All of these programs are  under intense scrutiny by the political right and their funding levels are dangerously low. Sure, you could just say that your boyfriend is just a roommate and likely keep your services. I will never advocate for lying to the government about things like this (if caught you'll be in for a whole world of hurt) but it is something that a lot of people do. ",1,,1,0,0,

As long as you have a doctor willing to certify your condition as a disability (for work/ADA purposes) then you can consider yourself ""disabled"" for employment purposes. This will open you up for ADA accommodations, schedule A hiring with the government, etc.

From a practical standpoint, there are pros and cons to self-identifying as a person with a disability when you are looking for a job. From my experience, unless they specifically state that they are looking to hire people with a disability I wouldn't bring it up. In my experience it is more likely to hurt your application. While they can't discriminate in hiring it can, subconsciously, put off some employers. Accommodations can be time consuming and costly and they may fear that you'll need FMLA often which puts the work burden on the rest of the employees. ",1,,1,0,0,

As for not having a doctor: What SSA will do is send her to a Consultative Examination with an SSA-contracted doctor. While SSA does understand that some people with intractable mental illnesses go long periods of time without treatment SSA still has to have some sort of objective evidence in file to make the determination.

At this stage, you shouldn't be looking for resources to show her, unless she has mentioned she needs them. The fact you're looking for them shows you care though. So, the advice I will give you is to tell her you would like to learn the sort of impact her condition has on her day to day life, and what are things other people do (or could do) that are helpful, and what sorts of things make her fee worse.     
         
For example, with my condition, a good thing to know is I need my feet propped up, and places where there is nowhere to sit are miserable for me. Something people do that is helpful is offer their seat to me when they see I don't have one. My husband often casually pulls my legs onto his lap.        
         
Something people do that they think is helpful, but isn't, is ask me every 15 minutes if I am okay and list off all the ways they could help me. I don't get annoyed because obviously these people REALLY want me to be comfortable and it is is heartwarming how much they care, however it makes me feel weird after awhile and isn't helpful.

Even if you are not earning too much money, you working will be included as evidence of your daily functioning.

 Now, what u/asknanners12 said is not entirely accurate (but generally true). It is true that you are more likely to be denied if you are working; that is not always the case. It will boil down to how much you are working, what type of work you are doing, and what your alleged disabling conditions are. For example, if you claim you are disabled due to a bad back and you are working 15 hrs a week doing construction - that lessens the credibility of your allegations since, if your condition was truly disabling, you wouldn't be able to do construction work even part-time. And if you can manage 15 hours a week doing heavy labor then, in SSA's eyes, you should be able to do 40 hours per week of non-labor/light duty work.  

How much you are working will also come into play. If you are working just 3-4 hours per week SSA won't pay too much attention to that. But if you are working just under that SGA ($1130) amount then you'll likely be denied because the evidence is strong that you could work more. Its actually a common ""scheme"" that we see where people will ask to have their earnings/hours to be *just* under the SGA limit so that they can file for disability and get ""free"" money. 

If you do decide to work though, just make sure you tell SSA about it. SSA doesn't automatically get ""alerts"" or anything when people start working. We have access to all your earnings data but, unless we know to go in and look, we won't know. All the letters from SSA will have language about how its your responsibility to report any change in your situation (work activity, medical, living, etc) and willfully not reporting information that could be adverse to your claim can be considered fraudulent action. trust me, you don't want that.

So it's never really been an option. Since I've never confessed to being actively suicidal, I've never been forced into a facility such as this. And I don't even know that it would have any impact at this stage or not. At some point it's just a waiting game, unfortunately.

I did gather that my situation is somewhat to be expected, as far as it taking forever. I do find myself having suicidal thoughts quite often in the last few months, since my relapse. I have told my therapist. But I don't have a plan and I'm not even sure I could summon the energy to carry out a plan if I had one.

They first look at whether you have enough work credits to qualify for SSDI and then they look at your assets to see if you qualify for SSI. At that point if you qualify for one/both programs they will send your claim to the DDS for a medical decision. If you qualify for neither then your claim is denied.

It's fucking Hollywood, where everything is the most uncommon situation and it's all about tugging on the heartstrings. Can anyone say 'romcom'?

What everyone protesting this seems to skip over is that everyone's disabilities are different, and everyone copes with it in a different way. Yes, this is a trope, but aside from 'it's Hollywood',  this does happen. I keep seeing comments about how a life with disability can be just as awesome as anyone elses. Many people with disabilities adapt and go on to lead happy lives, but suicide is not uncommon. Of course life can be awesome with a disability...for the right person with the right support. 

The author has written several disabilty-stereotypes articles, but mentions nothing about the fact that sometimes, it really can suck, and there is no help. All my wheelie friends have confessed to having that day where you rage or cry because things *just don't work*, and no-one or nothing can reach you. It is frustrating and it is hard, even years after developing a disability, or if you have had one your whole life. Living in an unadapted world is always going to be hard mode. 

I am lucky enough to live in a country where I have financial and medical support, both mental and physical. And I still feel fucking awful some of the time. I can't even imagine how much harder life would be without that. Sometimes friends and family are not able to deal with your disability. Sometimes they try their hardest but just don't know how. The author is talking from the perspective of someone who has always had support, and respectfully, needs to open his mind a little and think of those who do not. Having a girlfriend and family does not automatically mean good solid support. And even if they do, we're right back at the 'everyone is different' rule again. 

I have motor neurone disease (Americans know it as ALS) and one day will be taking a happy little trip to Switzerland. I have made that decision being completely sane and having been cleared as no outstanding psychiatric problems. I will be leaving before strictly necessary according to some people, who would hang on until they are barely able to hold the glass. Everyone is very different. Some people might be cool with gradually losing their ability to do everything other than think and that's fine. I am not. Some people are cool with being a quad and needing full time care. Others are not. Deciding what an individual can deal with should be down to the individual. 

This author complains at the start of his article that the girlfriend Louisa wants to 'fix' her partner, but then complains that she doesn't push him enough to stay alive. So which is it? We are all responsible for our own life decisions and saying that it should be otherwise because someone has quadraplegia is just insulting. ",8,,8,0,0,

Forgive me, while most of the time it is an oral interview, either in person or over the phone, if you had an attorney from the start, they probably *did* have you complete a paper application, which they then forwarded to us. However, for at least the last 4 years, the financial permission question is also listed on the paper application ([page 13, top of the page](https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/Attachment%20for%20SSA%20Testimony%207_25_12%20Human%20Resources%20Sub%20Hearing.pdf))

If your approval took place more than 4 months after the application was taken, there is then another interview (which yes, can also conceivably be done on paper) to update all of the information, to determine what months during the period between the application and the allowance you are actually eligible for payment, and how much.

&gt; What if you (I) applied for SSDI by paper and they just gave you (me) the small SSI supplement to go along with it anyway 

You can't be paid a benefit that you never applied for. Since you used an attorney, isn't conceivable that in all the papers they had you sign, there was an application for SSI? 

I'm not trying to argue with you about the specifics of your application experience, I'm simply saying that according to the laws,  if a person receives SSI (not SSDI based on work - the needs-based, federal welfare payment), at some point, whether you recall it or not, this permission was obtained, otherwise the application would have been denied immediately.

In 2003, the Commissioner exercised this authority by promulgating regulations to make giving permission to contact financial institutions an eligibility requirement for Supplemental Security Income (SSI).](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500515001)

If you read further, you will see exactly what I said about denial based on failure to grant permission. 

Again, I've no beef with you or your experience, I just want people to get accurate information. ",1,,1,0,0,

I had one done to confirm that I have IC and the pain was extreme for almost a week- even with taking oxy, Uribel, and one of the other medicines similar to Uribel. Have you been referred to pain management and looked into the spinal cord stimulators? 

Going back to your initial question, IC can be a pretty difficult condition to be approved for with disability. There isn't an actual listing under the listing of impairments that covers IC. It doesn't help that IC isn't a disease that is as understood as others and the diagnostic criteria isn't as definitive as others either. The only thing that your examiner would be able to asses is your pain which, I'm sure you can imagine, can be a very difficult thing to asses. 

I'm not saying don't apply, just realize that a lot of people don't know what IC is or even understand what the pain and frequency is like. If you do apply, when they ask you for ADL information be as detailed  as you can. Don't be embarrassed to talk about where the pain is, symptoms, etc. List all of your urologists that you've been to as well as other doctors that you've been to recently. The only other thing I can say is that a lawyer doesn't necessarily do anything or need to do anything until later stages- for example, if you appealed your claim up to the judge level.

I would do everything in your power to find an attorney who will have the hearing delayed, even if you wind up calling one of those shady TV lawyers. I would simultaneously be on the line with the courts trying to get it delayed on your own. 

Depending on your state, the probability of being approved at your hearing is around 35% for those without a representation, but you're 50%-75% MORE likely to be approved with an attorney present. If you are denied at the hearing, your recourse is a court appeal. These essentially never overturn the verdict because they can only overturn the judge's decision if he made a legal error; it's a procedural appeal, not a claim appeal. So if you are denied, you have to start over from the beginning. The only problem is that they already have a file on you, showing that your complaint, listing all of the symptoms that you're still describing to them now, has already been denied. So the only way to get it to move forward on your second attempt is if you have proof that a doctor has diagnosed you &amp; is treating you for a NEW qualifying disorder following your hearing. This is pretty unlikely, so for most people who are denied at the hearing, that's the end of the line. This is why not doing absolutely everything possible during the first go-round is like playing Russian Roulette -- only you have bullets in 4 of the 6 chambers.

Your original post sounded to me like you hoped for a quick/easy solution. I understand that you were in a bad situation, but if you're truly bad enough that you can't work (and it sounds like you are) then proceeding with this hearing on Friday unaided has the potential to leave you in that same situation for the rest of your life. I know that's a scary thing to hear. There's nothing you can do now about having not kept up with your lawyer, but -- coming from someone who is currently on disability and who has watched friends struggle after being denied at their hearing who were never able to receive disability after that) -- I would be in that lawyer's office on my hands and knees, begging and crying, come 8 am. 

I really hope that you're able to get it worked out. It's a difficult thing to keep up with, especially given the situation you were/are in, but may very well be the one thing that has the most substantial impact on the rest of you life.

What the CR may have meant is that the first requirement to qualify for any benefits is that your condition has kept you from working at least a year or is expected to last a year in the future. The other possibility is that to be eligible for SSDI,(money you paid in FICA tax and that will become your retirement fund) is that you must apply for benefits within 5 years of your last day of work. If you wait too long, you loose the eligibly for benefits biased on your work history. SSI is usually less then SSDI, depending on how long you worked and how much you were paid.

Yes exactly (although I'm not sure how you would go about the latter). 

I recently moved house and as a result, doctors. I went to fill my prescription and lo and behold, I have to collect it weekly. Why? Because I recently asked to be referred back to psychiatry to deal with an ongoing mental health issue. It rears its head and gets ugly every now and again, and psych helps me keep it in check. It does not in any way involve suicide or self harm. The last time I was suicidal was eight years ago when I got hit and paralysed, and I'll give you a medal if you can find a new quad/para who hasn't thought about death at some point. 

My old doc recognised that I am a responsible adult who knows how to deal with my problems and when to ask for help. The new one is apparently an arsehole so I'm on fucking suicide rules until they get a goddamn grip. I have to take time off work every week to pick up my damn prescription as they're only open the hours I'm working. All that's doing is making me stressed as fuck and regretting asking for help in the first place. 

And what's really stupid is that even a week's worth of meds is plenty enough to kill me if I was suicidal. But if I pointed that out to them they'd no doubt have me coming in daily then.

At some point you will need to mention it anyway and it's easier if it's been said before you even start talking. People feel awkward about what they don't have experience with and teenagers even more so. It doesn't need to be anything epic or go into specifics, just a mention. It's also good to have a pic of you where you can see the chair or other aid in your profile, not all close up shots.

I'm a great date because not only will we get the best parking spaces, I will also roll us down the hill like a couple of lunatics after a few bevvies. Sitting down all day also means lots of energy saved for activities ;)

Basically saying I use a chair, I'm not awkward about it, and yes I can still have sex! Lots of people assume if you're in a chair sex is off the cards, so I sneakily slip it in. (heh) Another favourite is 'and yes, it all still works!'

Once I have started chatting to someone and I know they're actually interested, I'll say they're welcome to ask questions about said disability. This is going to vary a lot from person to person, some will prefer to wait until meeting in person, some will do it after a couple of convos, others will want to know each other better. Also depends on how long you chat online before meeting up. Other wheelie friends have said that the more aware the date is of the realities of their disability, the better the date goes. For example my hands are crap and I need difficult foods pre-cut. Don't mention it in advance, I'd ask the waiter to bring it pre-cut from the kitchen. Mention it in advance, get some flirting in, get date to promise to feed you romantically off their fork.

Warn them about the differing attitudes towards dating someone with a disability. Some people see disabilities as a fetish. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. The date however must be upfront and honest about it, both parties must understand and consent to that dynamic in the relationship and the date realises that you are a person *before your disability*. Often these people are neither honest or seeing you as a person. Look out for a lot of questions about your disability, including many about the origin of it and over-interest in how you manage mundane daily tasks. 

Along the same lines, some people want to be the hero who will do everything for you and magically make it all better. Sometimes tempting from this side of the fence, to have someone to swoop along and be the white knight (or knightess?). It's just waiting to crash and burn, no-one should enter a relationship trying to fix rescue someone else.

Some people will be assholes. Block and report them. Don't engage with someone taking potshots at your disability, it's never worth it. 

If their date suggests a place to meet, before dying of excitement remember to check it's accessible, including a bathroom. **Phone the venue,** as several times now I've gone to a nice pub for a relaxed dinner and the loo is used as storage. If it's not accessible, be proactive and suggest somewhere else. If it's an activity, same thing. If you have dietary requirements, remember and check. Your date doesn't know your options as well as you do, so don't be afraid to put your ideas forward.

Also think on the extra safety risks, in a chair you must still be able to bail if something goes wrong. Have the number of a couple of accessible taxi firms for the area you're going to, not just around home, and make sure your mobile is charged. If your chair is electric, remember and charge that well too! Have enough cash for your fare, I personally like to have an extra fare hidden in the pocket under my chair just in case. After that I think it's all just normal dating precautions. And tell them to have fun!",7,,7,0,0,

The first question SSA will ask is, has your condition lasted or is it expected to last at least a year. Sounds like you meet that requirement. Question two is, what is your disability and when did it start to limit your ability to find and hold a job. SSA is only interested in your medical history from the last two years. So you already have most of that information. One last step before you contact SSA, is to sign up with your state's Office of Vocational Rehabilitation Services. This free program helps folks with disabling conditions find ways to work despite their limits. The reason you need to sign up for this program is they will examine your skills and test your ability to find and keep a job. Because of your age and lack of work history this information will be essential to prove you have a disability. The test results will be your best proof that your disability is real! If you feel you need help to accomplish the above; seek out your states Independent Living Centers web: www.ncil.org Most states fund ILCs to assist folks understand, apply for and maximize benefits and social supports. The service is free. PS, If you want to try to get SSI based on your mental health problems, you would have to seek treatment ASAP and obtain a diagnosis and treatment plan, before prove your condition is so bad that you can't do any kind of work. Hope this helps, PM me if you want more details.

Working once a week with a CDI can help students a faculty learn signs the student is familiar with and bridge the communication gap.

As usual, communication is key, but communicating about communication can be tricky to begin with. I agree with /u/543a3951-e13f-4df2-a73f-c75e98b0f009 that the likely best path is to grant your girl the same kind of honesty you're sharing with us: allow her to see your vulnerability by admitting you can't solve this yourself, &amp; strength of character in inviting critique. I've been on the receiving end of this kind of ""how can I talk to you about X"" approach, &amp; it is beautiful. It says ""I care more about our relationship than I do about my anxiety &amp; fear of looking bad"". I've also been on the approaching end, &amp; while scary at first, it gets easier as you better learn how to speak each other's language.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I'm afraid that I'll cause her more stress by making her think that her disability is affecting both of us

This is a really valid concern, &amp; kudos for exercising the maturity &amp; empathy required to see it. I am a C5/6 Complete Quad, &amp; my disability has a profound effect on our relationship. I'm acutely aware of this every hour of every day. Every single compromise we make, every assistance I require, every plan we set is moderated by my disability. As such (assuming relevant similarities in our situations) there are 2 sides to the issue:

1. You are not telling her anything she doesn't already intimately understand. I promise you that if she is half as self-aware as you seem to be, she knows that her disability affects you, even the times you haven't seen it yourself. She may be scared that by bringing it up, naming the issue, she may catalyse conflict or cause you to resent her needs. She may be hoping to endure until circumstance improves, thereby sidestepping potential negativity. I've been there - it's a fairly natural tactic &amp; it *can* be useful if the issue is trivial: ""I don't like these dining room chairs, but I'll soon forget they even exist"". With an issue like disability, it can rot away confidence &amp; harmony. She may be ecstatic you speak first, as it's implicit ""permission"" for her to speak openly too.

2. Mindful of the toll it probably already takes on her mental &amp; emotional state, it is prudent to have a solution-focussed mindset going in. If the message is distilled to be ""your disability drains me/us"", it's understandable that she may come to see the topic as even more taboo (n.b: that's not to say this kind of conversation can't be had, there is certainly a place for venting, but in your context, /u/b9619313-71b7-49cc-a4f3-494d7c08a749, you need to establish robust communication channels first). Show her that the reason you need to talk about it is that you want to add tools to your toolkit or action some positive strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

Perhaps a personal example paints a better picture:

Within the context of my disability, I'm usually extremely active. I (as an ongoing or intermittent activity) drive, travel, work full time, start too many side projects, go to concerts, festivals, plays, movies, language classes, date nights/weekends, go on road trips, eat out (more than I should), &amp; otherwise socialise with family &amp; friends. This is who I am, &amp; what our relationship formed with. In the past year, however, a few health complications have rendered me pretty useless in contrast to normal life. The timing is terrible (between us: moving interstate, job promotion, job resignation, job seeking in new state, major surgery for father, niece with very rare syndrome undergoing record-breaking surgery, hospitalisation for anaphylaxis, tight financial situation, transition to new health providers (NDIS), etc), &amp; through no fault of either of us the load on my girl has increased dramatically. We have had many conversations about our circumstance &amp; the challenges in that scope. Our best discussions have usually included some key similarities:

* The issue has been identified explicitly &amp; clearly. Sometimes this takes time, especially when a root cause is easily lost in the noise of exhaustion, anxiety, ego, etc. Sometimes it takes a day or two of introspection to differentiate signal from noise. By being so specific we are able to keep our conversation focussed on the solution (e.g: ""I feel that [subject], while certainly something we should discuss, is out of scope for now"").

* Before trying to solve, we discuss the issue &amp; dissect it in detail. The point is to not just identify the root, but to also understand each other's motivation &amp; justification for their view. This includes lots of ""the reason I do that is..."", ""to me that comes across as..."", ""an analogous situation in context you're more familiar with might be..."", etc.

* We *explicitly* verbalise our gained perspective, our apologies, &amp; our praise, so that we both feel heard &amp; understood, &amp; can validate our solutions. This involves phrases like: ""I can see how by doing [*specific* action] I make you feel..."", ""I'm truly sorry that I unfairly chastised you, &amp; I now see how hypocritical I was for..."", ""I notice how much effort you put into [action], &amp; I'm extremely thankful to you for...""

* We take action, &amp; praise each other for it. ""I feel like [issue] is so much easier now, &amp; I'm incredibly grateful for your hard work in..."", etc.

I know this seems very general advice rather than disability specific, but hopefully it helps you in approaching the current conversation as well as future ones. With this shared attitude towards communication we have been able to discuss some challenges our current situation presents. I'm so proud of our relationship, &amp; it's a testament to my beautiful girl's dedication to our bond that we can have an overwhelmingly positive conversation about subjects that could so easily create conflict &amp; resentment. We have only recently had more exceptionally honest &amp; uncensored conversation with minefields like:

* ""I was overwhelmed caring for you without proper supports"" - after an emergency room visit &amp; admission to a hospital with poor understanding of SCI support. An extremely positive talk, with a solution reached with the preemptive inclusion of family support should the situation arise again.

* ""I know it seems like a selfish complaint when I'm not the one with poor health &amp; there's no fault on your behalf for being unable, but I struggle with not having the 'real you' around. I miss going on dates, having an active boyfriend"" - a time where I was bedridden without even a few hours here &amp; there out of bed. A difficult talk, as I felt guilty already. By discussing so honestly I came away feeling an enormous weight off my shoulders, as I was able to see how she compartmentalised her disappointment in our situation from her feelings about me/us. She allowed me to similarly disassociate one from the other.

* ""I crave the full return of our *very* active sex life, but I understand that your recovery takes precedence. Your long-term health is my priority, but I need you to know that my desire for you has not diminished *one iota*"" - when our usually voracious intimacy has been limited by my recovery. So important for my mental health in knowing her disappointment &amp; cravings mirror my own.

* ""I absolutely appreciate that your life includes some non-standard accessories, but some of the medical equipment in use makes our bedroom feel a bit clinical. If there are no alternatives I will never complain, as your mobility is the importance, not my aesthetic preferences. If there are alternatives however, perhaps we could explore the options?"" - when my clunky old hoist takes up a large footprint in our new apartment. Such a difficult thing to bring up, &amp; I know she felt guilty for doing so. The outcome was me concurring, &amp; a flush-mounted ceiling hoist explored. 

While disability is a very visible use case, the tools you use to communicate in this way will strengthen your whole relationship - from &amp; for both of you, &amp; regarding subjects from choosing dinner to establishing child discipline ideals. A good couple will feel free to say ""I love when you do X""; a great couple: ""I feel invalidated when you do Y"".

&amp;nbsp;

Your language is so wonderfully appropriate &amp; mature: ""I'm frustrated by/because of X"". The fact that you're asking important questions should give you confidence that you're capable of a great relationship. Well done, &amp; best of luck!

For example purposes lets say that there is an individual claiming benefits for agoraphobia and inability to leave the house: if that person is taking a full course load at a large, public university where they are regularly in classes of 100+ people that is something that would be *inconsistent* with their reported condition and it will lessen the credibility of their claims. However, that same person taking all online college classes creates a situation where their disabling claims are *consistent* with their actions. 

Generally though, SSA really does everything they can to encourage education and working. While it may not always seem like it, SSA tries to encourage these things because they are good for self-esteem and self-betterment. Yes there is the selfish reason as well since those who get an education are more likely to voluntarily return to work, but there is nothing wrong with this either. As an adjudicator, I would only really consider trying to use education to remove someone from benefits if it was crystal clear that their actions/education would translate to an ability to work.

tsarcasm is correct; someone's ability to go to college full time is taken into account when evaluating his or her mental functional capacity. It is not used as a decisional factor.

There are deafness listings, meaning if you have a certain level of hearing loss, you CAN be allowed for being deaf. They are not easy listings to meet, but being deaf, in and of itself, can prevent a person from working if it is severe enough.

Many people I talk to say they are disabled because they cannot do their  past work, but they can still do other work like desk jobs.

I'm sorry but it is completely absurd to suggest that someone that is severely disabled is better off defending themselves with a knife.

There's a saying among nurses and EMT's about knife fights: The loser dies at the scene, the winner dies in the hospital.

You don't need to precisely line up your sights for someone a pace or two away. For example, police train to shoot from the holster before they aim at someone so close. There are different ways to use a gun and I am confident in my ability to do so or I wouldn't carry one. I am *not* confident in my ability to stab or slash someone.

Guns aren't for everyone, or even most people. But they are a huge advantage for someone who cannot otherwise be effective physically.

As I said earlier, you should always try to just give them what they want, even if you have a gun.

You should ask the camp directors about getting your hands on your student's IEP/IHP/504 plan ASAP. Those documents will give you a lot of good information. I think it's important to remember that many (but not all) students with autism and developmental disabilities have difficulty transitioning to new environments. If you feel like this may be the case with your student after reading though his/her documents, you might anticipate him/her to take some time to fully participate in camp activities. Never force your student to do something that makes him/her uncomfortable. I just taught two weeks of summer school, and I had several students who did not transition well. It took me two hours to get one boy into the classroom after a lot of walking, talking, social stories, and just standing in the hallway to watch the class from the doorway. Obviously, this is not the case with every student, but my point is that yours will let you know what he/she is initially comfortable with and you can work from there. Other things you'll want to find out include allergies, communication needs, behaviors and their functions, and things like toileting and safety awareness. As long as you communicate with your student and let him/her know that you're there to help, you'll develop a good relationship and will have lots of fun!

You might talk with your kids about whether they would enjoy that. I would try to allow for students that may get turned on by someone who fetishizes their disability, while making sure that others know what to look for and how to turn down, report or block someone that is making them feel uncomfortable. I personally feel uncomfortable with people fetishizing my disability because I want them to see me rather than my disability. 

You might also allow your students who have already tried online dating to talk about their experiences. Do they present their disability on their profile or not? If they don't, when do they bring it up? How do they handle certain logistical aspects of their disability in terms of dating? How do they deal with creeps? How do they incorporate technology like skype or facetime? 

They should also know that it's perfectly fine to talk to someone on the phone before a first date, and that *67 (if they're in the US) will protect someone from seeing their phone number. It's a great way for the women especially to protect themselves. 

I'd also make sure that they knew that OK Cupid is very proactive about protecting their users. If the block feature isn't working, your students should know to reach out to them. I had a guy get mad that I didn't want to go out with him. Every time I blocked him, he'd create a new username there to write to me. I wrote to OK Cupid and within a day they had his IP address blocked. I don't know about any of the other sites as I haven't used them.

Before writing a long post like that, I like to have a quick look through the person's history, to see their mindset and if there are any details that might help me to give a better, more individual response. And you know what I saw in yours? Constant negativity. Admittance that you've given up on medication and therapy. A total fixation on getting a girlfriend when you *know* you are not in a good place mentally. And the overall impression that no matter what I said, you wouldn't listen to me anyway, because anyone who has tried to help you has gotten an angry, hopeless comment in response. 

I do not believe people cause their mental illness or bring it on themselves. But I do believe that once you have a mental illness, it is your responsibility to reach out for and accept help to control that illness. It's no different from a physical illness in that sense. And like a physical illness, there are ups and downs. Sometimes a treatment doesn't work. Sometimes the side effects are too much. Sometimes you don't get on with a doctor. It happens all the time, so you get up again and try something or someone else. It's not a reason to give up entirely. 

And in case you're thinking 'oh, you don't have it, you can't understand', I can assure you I do. I have been in ICU after a suicide attempt that very nearly killed me, and admitted against my will by force to psychiatric care more than once. And until I started admitting I was part of the problem and asked for help, I didn't get any better. I realised that the people I'd called nasty and unhelpful and emotionally negative were anything but, and my illness was the thing making them seem that way.

I guess my point is that while I thoroughly disagree with what that user said and think it's very unhelpful...having been through your post history I can see why they feel that way. I would also like to point out that the *vast majority* of people with a severe physical illness has some sort of psychiatric history, normally depression.

Obviously your psychiatrist is on your side so speak to him/her about getting all the relevant tests/scans done. Psychiatrists are doctors and can prescribe medication as well as refer you to specialists. Your psychiatrist can also direct you to a regular doctor.

I have chronic pain too. I use buprenorphine patches (Norspan/Butrans). These patches don't have the same problems as painkillers like Oxycodone.

I think: Have therapy, use it as a place to express all this frustration. There's no guide book as to what you should talk about. Therapy is simply a time slot that is 100% yours to do whatever you want with. You don't have to talk about what others expect you to talk about, talk about what *you* find difficult and frustrating. If you can find someone with experience in disability or who has worked in a healthcare setting that's usually helpful.

I also think it would help you to be honest about everything you've just said here with your friends and family. They may be trying really hard to be empathetic but simply not viewing it from your position. If you have the patience, try and say everything you've said here because I think you've articulated it very well here. Some people will start to get it, some people won't and it's up to you to decide what to do with them. If you don't have the patience to explain things then don't, you don't owe anyone an explanation of your life-view and that's ok too. Just sometimes people need to be told things straight up in order to get out of their heads and see the situation differently. I think you're entitled to judge whether you want to put energy into that or not.

And no I haven't. They've never really appealed to me as it seems a flimsy thing to start with in common - just because someone else is in a chair doesn't mean we'll have anything else to talk about. It's like that question we've all got at one time or another; 'Oh, my cousin's sister's auntie's pet goldfish is in a wheelchair, do you know him?' 'No I'm sorry. I'm afraid my wheelborg brain isn't connected to the giant network of all wheelchair users today.'


I can see why it appeals to people. It's a starting point and it's someone who will understand emotionally in a way an able bodied partner never truly will. (Thank goodness!) You're much less likely to have to compromise as accommodations will be similar if not identical. You are both likely to have more patience with each other and have to explain less things from the start.

However you're also shrinking your dating pool by a huge amount and I don't think that's worth it. The right able bodied partner can learn to empathise and you always have wheelie friends for those days when you need someone who 'gets it'. A wheelie partner would be a perk but not anywhere near an essential for me.

People with PW will literally eat themselves to death if they can, there have been some very sad cases of stomach rupture when their food intake was not controlled. 

It has a huge number of other symptoms; there are distinctive physical characteristics, normally some level of intellectual disability, sleep disorders, compulsive behaviour and of course obesity, with all the problems that come with that.

I used to work in a similar environment to OP and we had two little boys with PW. Lovely kids when distracted but any thought of food and the illness took over.

They had to eat separately from the other children or they would attack them and staff in order to steal their food. Hence OP's concern about the keys.

This one sounds like a tit who has his opinions set, which is a truly dodgy thing in any doc. The fact that he is discounting your PTSD is a huge issue, and that he is making you feel humiliated is worse. And accusing you of lying? Bloody hell.

Once you have a new doc lined up (so there is no risk of being without medication if it goes to shit) I would try the following, if you haven't already;

* Go to appointment. Say at the start you feel there has been some misunderstandings in your treatment that are making it unhelpful, and that you would like to explain your timeline from start to end, with no interruptions. Explain yo shit. Practice it beforehand so you don't get flustered - it will give him less chance to interrupt if you are confident and don't give him pauses to interject. 

* Go to appointment. Same thing but in writing. Make it clear and concise. 

If by some miracle he does a u-turn and becomes less of a bawbag, you can decide whether to stay with him or not. I personally would not considering the way he has treated you but it is your decision. If he remains a complete tit, you've got it off your chest, you have a new doc lined up, and you have everything nice and clear in your head for new doc.

Please do not let this one arsehole put you off seeking treatment. Most of us have had a bad doctor at some point, I'm having a similar problem right now as well. You deserve good treatment and that means being listened to and respected. If this doctor will not listen to you, find one that will.

I received one couple years ago after having been on disability for 10 years. Mine was  fairly simple because my problem is ones that you can't get better from. If I remember for some people depending on issue  they want more proof  that you still have the condition and then there is the possibility they might not accept your initial response that then makes things more complicated with having to prove things. I'm probably not completely accurate because it has been a couple years and I only had to deal with the simple version of forms they send.

Put it simply if I remember right there are two kind of review forms sent to people. a simple form for things they consider something that can't get better and then a more complicated form for things they think has a possibility of improving. Then if for some reason they reject your response  you have to go through a procedure to prove you still have the issue.  This is if I'm remembering things right.",1,,1,0,0,

I have nothing against kids or people with kids, but having kids shouldn't be a state/federal job.  Like you, I am not going to have kids I can't afford in order to get help with chronic pain.  Well, and it's kind of a moot point now that I am 50+, but it's so frustrating to hear that you're fine to work because you aren't in a wheelchair.  Yes, I look fine and I could perform normally on a job for one day, but I would need a week or two to recover from that.  But, it's time to apply again, even though it's terrifying. 

I have been going to pain management doctors for ten years now and my doctors have all believed me, and now, oh yay, I was just diagnosed with Lupus to add to everything else.  It's sick that I am almost happy about it because it's something that other people respect as a disease versus my measly constant pain. ",1,,1,0,0,

I have an appointment to see my primary doctor Thursday. I'll ask him to refer me out. At the moment, I cannot sit for long without my neck causing a dull increasing pain, but once/if I'm cured I'll definitely look into seeing if I can sit for long.

I honestly wish I can be healed. $733 is nothing to live on logically. Though it's better than being on the streets, I'd much rather get a job elsewhere.
