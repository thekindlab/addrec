Lawyers have a fiscal incentive to drag your case out as it increases their back pay.""

This is an individual who by his own admission ""is a general mess of a human being.""  

An attorney will make sure the Claimant includes information from any and all medical sources.  Many clients forget, or think particular sources aren't applicable without prodding from someone explaining the importance.  An attorney can recommend free and low cost clinics for clients with financial constraints.  An attorney at any stage of the process can contact the treating physician and request medical source statement forms or narrative opinion letters tailored to the Claimant's situation.

Following an initial denial, an attorney can request a copy of the Disability Determination Explanation and see if perhaps SSA mischaracterized Claimants PRW or wrongly discounted a medical opinion.  An approval at the reconsideration level, thereby avoiding the 20mn backlog is an incredible benefit to the client.

If by ""get in the way,"" you mean ""advocate for the interests of the client.""  DDS examiners call clients all the time and ask probing questions that the Claimant may not understand.  Claimant's often unknowingly mischaracterize their work history or daily activities to their detriment.  They'll regret not having had help with a work history report when it bites them in front of a VE at an administrative hearing.  

Finally, you insinuate that lawyers would act in an unethical manner in order to increase their fee.  As you may know, fees are capped in SSD/SSI claims at $6,000.  An average fee in most cases is ~$3000-$3300.  No attorney is getting rich off one disability claim.  To breach ethical standards for an extra thousand dollars would be ludicrous.  Dealing with a complaint to the State Bar b/c an attorney wilfully ""dragged out"" a claim wouldn't be fun.  I may be more wary of non-attorney advocate firms who are not held to the same strict ethical standards as licensed attorneys.  Furthermore, if a claim is resolved quickly, that client is going to be exceptionally pleased with the services and likely to refer friends and family members for months and years to come.  All infinitely more valuable than the little bit of money (and dozen hours of extra work) that would come along a claim going to hearing.

So, you should probably stop ""always telling people not to get a lawyer"" lest their trust in your misguided opinion prejudice their claim.

My advice to OP would be to open a phonebook, look for a small, local firm that specializes in Social Security Disability Claims.  Go in for a free consultation and decide his best course of action from there.",3,,3,0,0,

He asks to go back to school every single day during the holidays.    Honestly I think he loves school so much because it really is the only place he has a chance to be around other children he can interact with.    

He isn't mainstreamed due to severe cognitive, visual, medical and physical disabilities.  The worst experience I have had is the schools not pushing him harder which while maddening isn't exactly traumatic.   It is very easy to write kids like him off.   It takes lots of dedication and skill to push children with these levels of disability to achieve IEP goals and obtain life skills, unfortunately not all school staff are fit for the job.

I have had tons of problems with school nurses.   One nurse over dosed him on a drug that crosses the blood brain barrier, we were very fortunate he didn't suffer permanent neurological damage.   Another nurse bless her heart asked me in all seriousness if she could stand my son up at the toilet to empty his colostomy bag.  My son is in a wheelchair and has a tendency to lose his balance standing unless he is in a rigid standing frame.   I honestly don't know what she was thinking when she asked this question.   For a 2 year period he had chronic pain (since been surgically alleviated) and we had problems with the staff constantly sending him home even though I told them repeatedly all they needed to do was call me to come give his pain meds and he would be okay.   I have also had issues with staff not understanding autonomic dysfunction.  They kept sending him home with a ""fever"" when he was really overheated and just needed to be in an air conditioned room.  It got to the point where I would pick him up and tell them I was taking him straight to the ped.  After he got a clean bill of health after having a ""fever"" just a few hours earlier they finally stopped sending home needlessly.  ",1,,1,0,0,

&gt; has any experience in this matter.


You are probably thinking of a ""[medical listing"" vs. ""RFC](http://www.eastbaydisability.com/are-you-disabled.html)"".


A medical listing will automatically qualify you as disabled, otherwise you must prove that the ailments, which can be many, combined with treatment (e.g. medication side-effects) make you disabled.


&gt; What exactly is the process when it comes to SSI and not SSDI? 


SSI is a ""needs-based"" program, where SSDI is for employees who are no longer able to work.  To apply for SSI, you need to fill out the paper form (SSA's online application is only for SSDI).


&gt; Without medical records, is it better to apply now or wait until a diagnosis is 
&gt; made? When the diagnosis is made, it doesn't rule out the fact that I am 
&gt; un-able to work but I do have a work history with part time jobs that are 
&gt; isn't over the SGA limit. 

There's no downside to applying now, however, without proof it will be difficult to prove the onset date.  

&gt; Would a CE examination

Many believe, perhaps erroneously, that CE exams are meant to prove you're not disabled.  Best to have your own records.

&gt; I do have a work history with part time jobs that are isn't over the SGA limit. 

Lack of work doesn't prove you are disabled.  You can incorporate this into your argument, but it's weak evidence.


&gt; Am curious to know what I will be expecting. 

From the sound of it, most likely you'll be declined on the initial application.  Just appeal it, and keep building your case.  Getting on SSI isn't easy (there are also [income](http://www.eastbaydisability.com/ssi-income-eligibility.html) / [resource](http://www.eastbaydisability.com/ssi-resource-assets-requirements.html) limitations).

Since you used to be on disability and were ceased for work activity you do have a period of time (60 months) where you can apply for an Expedited Reinstatement (EXR) of your benefits as long as the reason you quit working was related to the reason you were allowed disability benefits to begin with.

First let me start by saying I am sorry about your husbands accident. 

My father was a diabetic and completely suffered and went through hell. He lost a few toes first and his new normal involved learning to balance all over again. A couple years later he lost his leg and his new normal involved showering, walking, driving, etc with only one leg until he got his prosthetic. He struggled but he adapted. He also never missed a day of work no matter how sick he was so I give him credit for making that normal work. A few months before he passed away he had a disease take over in his arm and he lost his arm. His normal changed again but he adapted. 

The reason I am sharing this with you is because things happen in life and we as humans learn to adapt. Your husbands normal may be different now, but he will gain another sense of normalcy and you guys will overcome these obstacles! It takes time and lots of support. Just keep fighting, things will get easier! ",8,,8,0,0,

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1457349928,"I was in the same position as you and went from elbow crutches to a chair. Initially I started using it only occasionally then more frequently as things progressed. I have to say I absolutely love my chair, it has given me so much freedom, and frankly I feel like a bit of an idiot for struggling along with crutches just because I didn't want to 'be in a chair'. As with anything, speak to your doctor before considering a major change like this, as they may want you to keep walking for whatever reason. You do sound like you are in a very similar position to me though and I transitioned well to using a chair.

That said, there are obviously always issues with any major change like this. The type of chair you get is important, and this depends on your budget (and/or insurance). Regarding manual chairs, there are two main types - standard manual chairs, that fold in the middle and normally look like [this](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Me01bbaaabe4c9982200156d320f72342H0%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1) and active user chairs, which normally only fold down at the back (although there exceptions) and look like [this](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mmsmedical.ie%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2FQuickie-Helium-Generation-2013-Product-no-logo.jpg&amp;f=1). Standard chairs are bought off the shelf, active user are custom made to fit.

Pros:

Standard chair: Much cheaper, easy to buy/replace/repair, good for short term use or beginners who aren't sure if a chair is right for them.

Active user: Holy shit, everything. Much easier to push so less tiring, made for you so less strain on arms and back, hopping up and down curbs much easier, easier to take apart and lift into cars. Some models (I'm thinking the Quickie Argon) are made so that the chair can be adapted as you find out what you like in a chair as everyone is different and you only find out some wants as you use it. 

Cons:

Standard chair: Normally heavy, harder to push/wheelie in, often not fitted correctly causing injury. Backrest is high which is an independent preference but many users prefer a much lower backrest. Doesn't look as good as an active user chair.

Active user: Expensive, made to fit so you must find a specialist shop, wait time while chair is made (my current chair was 6 weeks) generally more expensive to repair, don't fold, 'tippier' and more prone to falls (but anti-tip wheels are available and once you learn to balance, not necessary.) A good core will make a lot of difference to your use of an active user chair but is not necessary. Slightly steeper learning curve with things like balance to begin with.


I'll go through your post and give you my experiences. Bear in mind this is one person, without children. I am a youth leader and go away on trips with the kids (10-14) regularly to all sorts of events with no issues other than in the kitchen, because I can't reach anything in a kitchen that is not adapted. I have no idea what kind of issues you might have with a four-year-old but I can't immediately think of any you won't already have with your crutches, like lack of hands outdoors. If you have any specific concerns I can probably give you a solution for them - there are many great moms out there who use wheelchairs full or part time.

&gt; Do you feel like you can get around better on wheels, 

After the initial learning curve, yes. It does take a few weeks to build up the stamina and muscle to use a chair, but once you've done that it stays - unless you are in bed for seriously long periods. You would have exactly the same issue with crutches or any other mobility aid though. When I started using a chair from crutches I found I went out a lot more, because I didn't have to worry about always finding a seat or getting home if the pain got too bad.

&gt; faster 

Definitely. Again, after that initial learning curve, you're away like the wind.

&gt; and with your hands free or do you feel more limited? 

This depends on what you are doing currently. I could not initially carry as much on my chair as I could in a backpack with crutches. Now I can carry more. With things like using a phone or eating, you have to stop and focus on that one thing, but you will already have that problem I think, assuming you're always using two crutches. Chairs come with brakes so you just stop, put the brake on and do whatever you need to do. My brakes click on very quickly and I find it much quicker to *get* my hands free than I ever did with crutches. Because I'm already sitting down I can do whatever I need to do without having to find a place to rest and put my crutches down first. The nerve pain in my hands and wrists has been reduced since moving to a chair, because I'm no longer putting all my bodyweight on such a tiny part of my body.

Height for reaching shelves etc is not a big problem as you can either sit on the side of your chair to reach higher (I can take a picture if this doesn't make sense) or stand and hold onto your chair for support. 

&gt; I want to continue to own my cleaning business, I need to be able to meet with clients before I send them a crew (which I realize means I will still probably need to operate there with the crutches as most homes won't be handicap accessible).

As long as you can use your crutches for short periods you should be fine with this, just ask in advance where you can park that is closest to the clients' home. Perhaps a rolling walker for inside homes, so that you can be sure of having a seat in every room? I don't know the specifics of how you deal with your clients so can't give more specific suggestions I'm afraid!

&gt; What wheelchairs do you find to be the easiest to transport without assistance. I can still shuffle down the side of my van, so maybe something lightweight without arm rests? Something that can be unfolded with one hand, or do you have a better recommendation? 

This comes down to the type of chair you use as I talked about above. My chair does not fold, but it has no armrests, the wheels both come off with the press of a button and the backrest folds down. It fits in the trunk of most cars, and in cars with a smaller trunk it can actually sit on a seat like a person would. Folding chairs will obviously fold and fit depending on your trunk size, but do not fit sitting on a seat.

Regarding putting it in your car. Some people with leg function will sit of lean against their trunk, put the chair in the trunk, and shuffle down the side of the car to the drivers seat. People with lower or no leg function sit in the drivers seat, take the wheelchair apart, and lift each piece over themselves to put in the front passenger seat or back seat. The same goes in reverse, stay in the drivers seat or lean against the trunk and pop the wheels back on. 

My chair is 10kg including wheels but you will never lift that all at once. It's one wheel at a time then the frame, and when putting the wheels back on you don't hold the weight of the frame, just steady it with one hand and put the wheels on with the other. I can make or find a video if you want to get the idea.

&gt; requiring hand controls to drive. Just how expensive is that kind of instalation? 

This will depend on your car and the type of controls you use. There are home install kits that cost a few hundred dollars ([this](http://handicaphandcontrols.com/product/bmtech-push-pull-hand-controls) kind of idea) and more permanent solutions which are installed for you and can be anything up to a thousand.

Good news about your home being mostly adjusted. How are you in the kitchen at the moment? That is normally the biggest issue for wheelie homes and the most dangerous as your leg function changes. Do you need support getting out of the shower or are you okay with crutches going from bathroom to bedroom? There are solutions for that too. Getting around in public is just practice and getting to know your local area in a different way - where the curb drops are, what pavement areas to avoid, what shops are easiest to get around, what heights you can pop a wheelie over. All things that come with practice. 

Outside of wheelchairs...do you have any outside support for your oldest daughter? It is very difficult to deal with a child who has additional needs, even more so when you have your own pain to deal with. Even a few hours a week in a support program would give you a short while that is support for her outside of school and time for yourself that is less stressful.

I finished the application and admissions process to get my first guide dog in October of 2015 and I fly out to the school that will train me with my new guide dog in June of this year.  I can't speak for living and working with one, but I can tell you what I do know.  Obviously my dog will be task trained differently from yours since mine will only do guide work (which is all I need it to do).  The application process for me was pretty straight forward.  There were a lot of options in terms of schools for me at no cost to next to no cost.  I sent applications to two schools and was accepted to both, I just went with the one my instructors recommended to me.  I am not even paying airfare for the school I'm going to, it's all covered, it is super awesome and I feel immensely lucky to be in this position.

&amp;nbsp;

They don't just hand them out though.  You noted that you are very independent and that is an incredibly good thing in terms of filing applications.  I actually had to have my orientation and mobility instructor film a video of me independently traveling on a white cane for them to review through the application process.  These organizations want people who already know how to be independent and responsible for themselves, they are putting a lot of money into training the dogs and they want to know they are going to good use.  The dog won't give you independence, it will enhance the independence that you already have.  In addition to proof of independence I had to have my physician certify that I am physically able to handle a guide dog, I had to have my ophthalmologist certify that I am legally blind and would benefit from a dog, and I had to have my orientation and mobility specialist certify that I am able to maintain orientation.  This involved both written reports as well as releasing some medical records IIRC.  You can probably expect something similar in terms of requests.

&amp;nbsp;

My observation is that it seems to generally be easier for blind and visually impaired to acquire well trained service animals from established institutions.  I'm sure there are plenty of places that train service dogs and prospective handlers like yourself for the tasks that you require but there may be fees attached.  I would suggest doing your homework and finding a good place, be sure to read the experiences of people who went there and ask plenty of questions.  I'm trying to find an active service animal community right now, but if you can find one try to find someone else is in a similar situation, that might be valuable.  Best of luck to you!",3,,3,0,0,

The biggest thing your bro will need to adapt for is his arm/hand dysmotility. Again, check youtube for techniques. A good place to start is cooking techniques for upper extremity amputees.

I definitely see Game of Thrones having well defined disabled characters (I only watch the show, didn't read the books). The characters that are introduced having already lived long (or their whole lives) with a disability have learnt to live with the cards they've been dealt (Tyrion). 

In the show it's simply alluded to that Jamie has dyslexia and it's never made a big deal other than he doesn't read very well, but you can imagine how him becoming a kingsguard was a slightly easier decision with a learning difficulty like that. 

I also like that the characters that become disabled in the process of the show learn how to deal with it (and are shown actually making progress), but depending on their personality in different ways and different paces.

One of the things I've understood about being disabled, and you should too, is that convenience doesnt mean shit. It's mind blowing that you think being disabled entitles you to live life that adheres to what you believe is convenient and easy. Do you think your disability is going to accomodate your sense of what you find easy or convenient. Once you understand that you have to circumvent your disability and it is going to be hard to do so on a daily basis you're going to be much better off.

You're seeking help from a disabled forum but you dont care about those within our community that may not ever have the ability to go in nature and in the woods? that right there makes you 100% selfish.

Medicaid rules are, as long as your receiving one dollar from SSI, your entitled to Medicaid. The only other rule is you can't save more than $2000.00 dollars.

Likely you don't have enough work credits to qualify for SSDI but you might qualify for SSI. ~~The problem is that since you live with your parents the household is probably going to be considered ""over resources"" and your claim will be denied immediately.~~ edit: erroneous statement; as long as you are under asset resources you will be fine. the household stuff comes into play *after* you receive benefits. 

* Lets assume you do financially qualify for SSI, they can make a medical decision right now just with what little medical evidence you have and they will likely send you to see a SSA contracted doctor for an exam. If denied you can get a lawyer and appeal. that is your right. 

* Moving forward, yes the best thing that you can do for yourself (both disability wise and just health wise) is to get yourself into treatment. Your disability changes go up significantly if you have at least 12 months worth of consistent treatment records with psych providers (therapist, psychiatrist, etc) showing that you are struggling even with treatment. 

* Get insured. See if you qualify for Obamacare subsidies or even your state's Medicaid. 

* Find good doctors, specialists if you can. SSA looks more favorably on records from a psychologist/psychiatrist than just a PCP. Specialist medical records also tend to be more detailed. Most people who are denied disability is due to crappy medical records. 

*  Stay in treatment and be COMPLIANT with treatment. SSA is really cracking down on people who are non-compliant with treatment without good cause. Now, its one thing if you cannot afford medications or can't afford to see a therapist every week. But if you flat out refuse to try medications, etc then SSA will likely deny you. The whole point of the application is to prove that you can't work and part of that is *you* putting in the effort. 

* look into getting a job. seriously. even if it is just part time. This is two-fold. The disability process can take several years. if you can get some earnings in there is a chance you will earn enough work credits to then qualify for SSDI which is a higher payout than SSI. If you have work attempts that were unsuccessful that will help bolster your disability claim. It adds additional evidence supporting your assertion that you cannot work. 

* As for disability lawyers, that is within your rights. However, I always tell people NOT to get a lawyer until you've gone through the initial and reconsideration stage of the process. At those levels if you can fill out simple paperwork you can do it without a lawyer. Especially if your parents are willing to help you out with the process. YMMV depending on the lawyer but in my experience having a lawyer does not increase your changes of approval AT ALL during those first 2 levels; typically actually they get in the way. Lawyers have a fiscal incentive to drag your case out as it increases their back pay.

Also, he's still physically traumatized and more fragile than he may be later. My husband has been a wheelchair user his whole life, but his disability is progressive, and he's had other traumatic health problems as well, and each new stage was most difficult at first, then it eases up as you get things working.

If your husband has a power chair, that's great, and your next goal is finding a wheelchair accessible minivan or some other method of transport that allows him to stay in it. You saw today how inadequate a manual chair is for his needs. Depending where you live, buses or cab companies may be accessible, but having your own vehicle helps a lot. At this point it doesn't need to be driveable by him, which is a little cheaperc

The hospital's lack of access is appalling, and your rant is spot on. As they say in the movies, keep that anger, channel it, use it to push for change. As for bathrooms, I've seen the inside of more men's rooms than I've cared to. Just go in boldly, but pointedly *not* looking at anyone standing at the urinals. Head straight for the big stall and get in there together. It's clear you're there for a good reason, so no apologies.

If he's driving a power chair, you'll be able to carry things, and so will he, in a pack or on his lap. People will tend to move out of his way, but not yours, so tuck yourself in behind when it's tight. The phrase to remember for when they don't is ""Watch your back!"" It's much more effective than ""Excuse me"" though you can use both together if you're feeling polite.

Having spent so much time in the hospital, I'm sure you've observed nurses vary greatly. Learn all you can from the good ones. I won't talk about the others. You shouldn't have to be responsible for all the care, but being able to do things will give you more privacy and independence as a couple. 

And yes, you're going to have to rearrange the world, or at least the part of it you occupy, to fit a wheelchair. (I assume you're already working on your home, for when he gets out of the nursing home. ) Just go ahead and do it, and don't put it back. If a waiter sees you, and has to physically undo it after, he's just learned what to do for the next guy. If a building has deliberately and unnecessarily blocked access, it ain't blocked anymore!

Sometimes I do this with a cheerful smile, sometimes with an angry glower, occasionally I go ballistic if it's really egregious. And sometimes I cry, but not lately because we're in a ""used to this"" stage right now, thank goodness.  Your husband has a lot of healing and adjusting to do in the months ahead, but so do you, and you need to allow yourself that. And you'll find the ""new normal"" establishing itself in you, not all at once but in little ways. 

My warmest wishes to you both.

I just re-read your post, is she currently on SSI? If she is on SSI then she is already on disability. Was she allowed for SSI but denied for SSDI (due to non-insured status)?

When you are chronically ill you measure life with a different yardstick, and that's fine. It is difficult to watch people do things that you expected you'd have done by now, but you need to focus on the progress you *have* made. It might not be the typical 'got married, got a house, had a kid' progress but it will be there. My progress was learning how to deal with my life in a different way, accepting my situation was a little different, learning more empathy for others, learning to talk to people and listen better. Less tangible but still great things to do with my life. Just from your post, you are working, part time is fantastic when you are struggling with just making it through the day. You realise what your problem is and are reaching out for help to fix it. That's awesome too. And that's from a few short paragraphs.

It really sounds like before a girlfriend, you need friends. One woman will not fix your loneliness, and if you head into a relationship with the issues you've outlined here, you're likely to smother her. You have to be happy with yourself before you try to be happy with someone else, because when you're dependant on another person for your happiness there will be problems down the road.

So, friends. Are there any times that you can leave the house? Does your illness fluctuate, is it pain and/or proximity to a bathroom that you need? Is there anything your doc can give you the odd day so that you can go out (for example I have stronger painkillers for every now and again)? Just wondering if there are some accommodations that could be made for you to give you the chance to physically get out more.

If not, that's also fine. I spent several years inside 99% of the time and made my best friends that way. We talk every day. The internet is an incredible thing. What are your interests? Is there anything you've ever wanted to know more about? Find a subreddit or other site about it and jump in. Post on /r/Needafriend. Talk to people, send PM's, eventually you'll find someone who clicks with you. Don't be disheartened when you get knockbacks, you're never going to get on with everyone and it can take a bit of patience.

I'm into video games (Dragon Age, LOTRO, Binding of Isaac, Elder Scrolls, Tomb Raider, Left4Dead), my pet rabbits who are little shits, wheelchair sport, fantasy novels, hiking and camping, sleep, and a good whisky. If I sound like a vaguely interesting person, shoot me a PM. (I won't be offended if you don't haha.) And there you go, you're already started. 

I also agree with other commenters to see about getting disability payments.

&gt; In an implicit attack on George Osborne - and the biggest resignation since Cameron became prime minister - Duncan Smith said the disability cuts were defensible in narrow terms of deficit reduction but not &amp;quot;In the way they were placed in a budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers&amp;quot;.

It's irrelevant to disability, sure.

Pre-peeled oranges are great from an accessibility standpoint...but people got upset because it's wasteful.  It would be great if accessibility was part of the conversion - accessibility **should** be part of the conversation - but the wastefulness of this is not irrelevant.  

If you argue with people on the internet, you're going to run into assholes who say things like, ""You've survived this long without them you will continue to do so""

That's not news, that's just the internet.  It's a shitty opinion held by some asshole on twitter. 

&gt;The most common complaints about the sale of these oranges is either the wastefulness of the additional packaging (which is true but somewhat misdirected as I’ll discuss later) or that anyone who buys this must be incomprehensibly lazy.

Of those two, the only one that has any merit is the one about wastefulness.  It's not misdirected, it's just not related to accessibility.

The 'incomprehensibly lazy' one has no merit and should not be a part of the conversation.  It's a terrible reason to go up in arms over this.  **That** one is irrelevant and misdirected.",2,,2,0,0,

I spent a lot of time in hospitals when I was younger for cancer treatments and developed major PTSD from it. What helped for me was therapy, talking openly about it. And time: it took years for me to be comfy in a hospital again. At first even seeing a hospital on TV would send me reeling! I used to avoid appointments, to the detriment of my treatment even. It got so bad I'd collapse.

But therapy did help! It took a long time, but eventually I was able to become comfortable with it. I still hate to have to do all the tests and such, but no longer am I terrified. Now my medical avoidance is only for general anxiety reasons. :)

I would strongly suggest you don't use this as an option. It generally leads to overstretching yourself ('but I'm already standing and it's *right there*') which causes accidents. Unless he's stable standing, stay in the chair in the kitchen.

I agree with a bunch of the suggestions here. Without an adapted kitchen, I use a combination of microwave, food processor and soup maker, eventually I plan on adding a slow cooker to it. The processor is essential to me as like your brother my hands are limited and not great with knife skills. I like utensils with larger handles and basic assistive devices like someone else has listed below - can openers etc. I like a lot of the Oxo GoodGrips range. If he likes a beer, attach an opener to the fridge or other stable surface. Little things that make a difference.

I would start with some nice simple recipes like soup, chilli, rice, eggs (can be done in the microwave) and go through them step by step. Ideally you'd have a lowered worktop for him, if not, a table he can roll under is fine too. My prep table is currently in my living room. If you can also have the electrical equipment there, even better, but I managed fine going from the prep table to the equipment in the kitchen. A non-slip tray is great for this.

What would have helped me in the beginning is a focus on healthy foods as well as what's easiest to prepare. For a long time I lived on ready meals or other bung-in-the-microwave options which aren't a healthy diet. I love my soupmaker especially because with my processor, I can have a smooth or chunky soup ready in under half an hour. Add some beans, pasta etc to the chunky setting and it's more of a casserole. My soupmaker generally makes four portions, so I either eat over a couple of days or freeze. Portion control is also important, especially if he isn't used to cooking for himself.

Long-term, if you have the money, look into an adapted kitchen. It would be beneficial for him to have a worktop and stovetop at wheelchair height - but it is prohibitively expensive for some and there are always workarounds if it's not an option for you.",4,,4,0,0,

There are fewer places that train non-seeing eye service dogs, but they are out there! And there are places that will place you with a dog for free or a subsidized cost. My understanding is that the owner is responsible for all costs after adoption (many vets offer reduced rates for service dogs).



My family member is currently on the last step before getting a dog but the wait time for dogs is long, 1-2 years with the organization they are working with. So far they have had to fill out a personal application, get medical forms sent in, have 2 phone interviews, and have a support person fill out an application as well. The last step is an in person visit/interview where they chat and see the applicant interact with some of the dogs. The personal application included questions about prior experience with dogs, what your disability/needs are, what services you envision the dog performing for you, and your ability to care for the dog. The support person application is because they want someone to accompany the future service dog owner when they come meet their dog and start working with it (you spend about a week at their facilities getting to know your dog and how to work with it). The support person application also asks questions about your relationship (they want to see that you'll still be around to help if needed), experience working with dogs, and if the support person is willing to care for the dog if the owner becomes unable to do so. Basically it seems to boil down to them trying to asses 3 main issues: your needs/how a service dog could improve your quality of life, your ability to care for a dog (physically and emotionally, some people just aren't dog people even if the services they provide are useful), and if you have support. In the support category, the organization my family member is working with also wants assurance that there is a plan for the dog's care if my family member becomes unable to care for it/when the dog retires. That may not be universal though as I believe there are organizations out there that adopt out retired service dogs. 



[Here](http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/information/service-animals/about-service-animals) is a general page about the types of things a service dog could potentially do. Some general services that might be useful to you are: (as you noted, open/close doors,) retrieve household items/put them away (including groceries), stability assistance, send an alert for help (including using the phone), carry items for you when you are out and about.

97c43ab3-4f02-4947-b96f-aa58bff15209,1457099934,"Yes. The problem though in schools is that administrative politics presides over independence or what's best for the student, especially in NYC. If a parent of a 6 or 7 year old child was babying them (i.e. doing everything for them), than people would criticize the parent (i.e. ""let him do it himself""). But once people think you're disabled (whether it's true or not) this becomes acceptable. It's acceptable for a student to have a para sitting next to her all day, even if the student doesn't need it. Not to mention, the student may feel embarrassed by it.

In middle school my para would pick me up from related services, while my classmate who didn't have a para got to go back to class by himself. I was definitely capable of going back to class by myself. I should have been encouraged to be more independent. As I mentioned, wouldn't allow a ""normal"" kid to be babied. Also, paras hinder social interaction in some cases. In middle school it kind of did. A kid **IN SOME CASES** will be more inclined to talk to the para instead of other students. 

Here is my policy on paraprofessionals for schools.

1. Paraprofessionals should only be used when other alternatives are not feasible or appropriate (e.g. meeting with the guidance counselor once a week).
2. Students should not receive a full time paraprofessional unless they are significantly disabled.
3. The IEP should state clearly and IN DETAIL when the paraprofessional will see the student, what the paraprofessional will do, and when the paraprofessional will back off (i.e. if student starts doing X, paraprofessional will back off)
4. It should be SCHOOL POLICY for paraprofessionals to back off when needed. Paraprofessionals should be trained to back off when needed.
5. Student should be reevaluated YEARLY to make sure they actually need the paraprofessional. If necessary, the IEP can state that the student be reevaluated in a shorter period. For profoundly disabled students, the period can be extended with permission from higher authority (like the CSE).
6. Paraprofessionals should NOT be assigned to protect the student from bullying. All should have policies and procedures if bullying arises.
7. Sometimes having a paraprofessional can provoke behavioral outbursts. Make sure a paraprofessional will fix the problem, and not create new problems. The IEP should state how long the student will need a paraprofessional and when the student will be reevaluated (if less than a year).
8. A paraprofessional should NOT be assigned because of stereotypes related to the student's disability. For example, a school may assign a paraprofessional to a general ed student solely because s/he has Down syndrome, even though the student doesn't need a paraprofessional. The school is making assumptions based solely on the fact that the student has Down syndrome. If you know another kid with the same disability who benefitted from a paraprofessional, don't assume this kid will benefit from a paraprofessional.
8. Look for signs when paraprofessional support is causing problems for the student. Teachers, staff etc. should be trained to look for such signs.",1,,1,0,0,

884c42d5-75d4-4ee4-9f5c-c756aea8f985,1457721624,"First off. Thank you very much for the links. I will respond to them now. However, I do want to start with the following: NONE of what I’m about to say is dealing with a social model vs. medical model approach to disability, so this is going to be completely off-topic of the original post. We are going to be discussing causation and correlation of obesity, which anyway you cut it, we are going to be discussing positivist experimental trials, which is going to be completely separate from the qualitative research that I was requesting related to how we construct disability and obesity.
So, let’s look at the readings and links you provided:

&gt;Above all, it's never been proved. It's just a conjecture, like how stomach ulcers are caused by eating spicy foods or how you lose most of your body heat from your head -- both conjectures that turned out to be nonsense.

So, this first one. First, I’m going to state the obvious. This isn’t a scholarly peer-reviewed article. This is a one-page opinion piece without any references/citations whatsoever. However, I did follow the link to their website where they discuss the research (http://nusi.org/science-in-progress/boston-childrens-hospital/). A couple of notes. First, this isn’t actually research. It’s a research **proposal**. In addition, it’s not trying to debunk calories in=calories out. It’s trying to prove that the body doesn’t process calories from fats, proteins, and carbs in the same way, which makes the exact calculation of calorie in=calories out more complicated. I don’t disagree with their hypothesis at all, but that hardly is arguing that calories in=calories out doesn’t work. It’s simply arguing that we may not understand exactly HOW the body processes calories from various sources, and that people will process calories from different sources in different ways, making TDEE harder to pinpoint. But they certainly are not dispelling the idea that you need to use more energy than you are taking in to lose body mass.

&gt;It's scientifically full of holes. How do you determine ""calories in""? There have been books and websites telling you how much is in specific foods for ages, but they're well known to be wrong, for a variety of reasons, including that not everyone metabolizes food the same way.

I completely agree with this article. I think it goes along with what the research proposal above it trying to accomplish. “Calories in” is a messy process, which is why it requires trial and error for a lot of people.

&gt;A common rebuttal to this is the claim that ""fat people always underestimate how much they eat."" But studies show that ALL people underestimate how much they eat and **if underestimating calorie consumption was simply the problem, then everyone would be fat.**

I’ll challenge your conclusion. Let’s say someone’s TDEE is 1800 calories under the “calories in=Calories out” paradigm. Someone thinks they are only eating 1400, but are actually eating 1700. This person underestimated their calories consumption, but would still be in a deficit, so your conclusion is not accurate.

&gt;Same problem exists for ""calories out."" What people think they're expending - even with modern toys like fitbits - is still wildly inaccurate. 

True, but that’s more of a problem with the technology reporting calories and determining an individuals TDEE. That’s not debunking the idea of “calories in-calories out.”

&gt;And as I previously mentioned, multiple long-term studies have shown that exercise doesn't help with weight loss, unless it's extreme.

Exercise alone? Sure. If someone was not eating at a caloric deficit, but exercised, they would have to burn 500 calories a day to hit the usual 500 calorie deficit… and yes, that’s pretty extreme. But I don’t know of anyone that recommends JUST exercise for weight loss.

&gt;I already mentioned that metabolism changes due to food intake. If you start overeating, you do gain, but only so much. Then the metabolism speeds up to handle the extra calories. The same is true with deficit calories. You start to lose, but then it stops. Your metabolism slows down to compensate for missing calories.

But isn't that pretty well known though? That’s why weight loss programs reduce the TDEE as you lose weight. The more you weigh, the more calories you need to maintain that weight. The less you weigh, the less calories you need. So if you lose weight, you need to keep reducing your daily calories, or less you will just stall and stop losing weight. Your metabolism can be a bit wonky after weight loss, sure, but as you said, metabolism DOES change, and that just shows that regardless of what you weigh, some people just don't need as much food to maintain their weight, so eating 1800 calories one one 180lb person might be there TDEE, but for someone else who's metabolism might be different, 1800 might be overeating.

&gt;Even the New England Journal of Medicine says that they've known that calories in/calories out is bunk -- for at least a century:

That’s a bit of a jump. From the article:

&gt;Hirsch found that although obese subjects could shed a substantial amount of weight through drastic calorie restriction, their metabolic rates would dip in response to calorie reductions. This effect meant, for example, that if an obese woman dropped down from 200 lb to 130 lb, she would have to consume fewer calories to remain at 130 lb than would a 130-lb counterpart whose weight had always held steady.

As you said, we are all different… so even at the same weight, one woman doesn’t need as many calories. Her TDEE is lower. So, as I stated above, the measurements aren’t accurate, but that doesn’t mean Calories in=Calories out is bunk. It just shows we don’t know all there is to know about caloric measurement (as you stated) It just shows that everyone’s TDEE is different based on a variety of factors (including metabolism) and not just on weight/height.

&gt;Stress and depression can increase cortisol levels. The effects of cortisol are well documented to promote weight gain via an increase in fat storage.
 
Right, but once again, that’s not a **cause** of weight gain. The overeating is. From your link:

&gt;“Continual stress leads to a constant state of excess cortisol production, which stimulates glucose production. This excess glucose then typically is converted into fat, ending up as stored fat. According to Dr. Sapolsky, ""The net effect of this will be increased fat deposition in a certain part of the body."" Furthermore, according to the authors of the book The Cortisol Connection, stress and the resulting chronic overload of cortisol, make you feel tired and listless. So you overeat to renew your energy and comfort yourself, with the end result of accumulated extra inches around the middle.”

So, it’s all these things complicate determining TDEE… which I agree, is a problem, but once that TDEE is established, it really is just “calories in=calories out”

Now that I’ve said all this, I want to reiterate something. Fat oppression is real. It absolutely is. People act like people that don’t meet society’s ideal weight should be shunned, and that’s terrible. However, to say that caloric deficits don’t lead to weight loss is pretty extreme. Your beef shouldn’t be with “Calories in=Calories out”, your beef should be with people that think universal measures of TDEE work for everyone. Same reason why the BMI measure is so stupid.

Just how I see it.

Iain Duncan Smith (IDS) is hated by most of us disabled people in the UK for his numerous aggressive cuts to our welfare support. Obviously it's difficult to prove but there have been many reports of disabled people affected by his policies dying or killing themselves shortly after being sanctioned or losing their support. He is absolutely reviled by many of us.

A week or so ago, his department announced further cuts to PIP (this is a payment disabled people receive to help cover care costs and mobility costs). A few days later, the UK minister of finance (here called the Chancellor) announced the budget for the upcoming years. In the budget it says that about £1 billion of  £4 billion of total national budget cuts would be coming from disabled people. In parallel to this he announced tax cuts for the wealthy amongst other things. This parallel has not gone down very well.

IDS resigned stating exactly this and also saying that these latest disability cuts are a cut too far. I don't think anyone thinks he suddenly developed a moral conscience but we're glad to see him go and if he stabs the PM and the finance minister in the back on the way out we don't mind that either.

I'm a big fan of identity-first language myself for social model reasons, but the fact remains that there *are* a lot of folks who prefer person-first, and as recently as a couple years ago it was practically mandatory in US activist circles (by actual disabled people, not just parents/caregivers/allies). Lots of Autistic and Deaf people have expressed strong identity-first preference, and I'd say that for those communities, respecting that stated preference is stylistically correct. But identity-first vs person-first is a subject of open debate in many circles, and although I don't use it myself, I'd hesitate before totally writing off person-first as ableist. OP should look into more activists and blogs like DidIStutter to determine if there's a strong community preference one way or another.

/u/b2d7108b-4f73-46e0-8319-ceb0e9d80ce8 has given you a good introductory breakdown to differentiating between impairment and disability. To further clarify: disabled people are those whose impairments are disabled by society. You can be impaired without being disabled, like people who need glasses, because society fully accommodates that impairment and all of society is open and accessible with minimal discrimination against people who wear glasses.

It's worth noting that some people consider ""impairment"" itself to be a negative value judgment, and that their functioning is simply non-normative, rather than pathological. Speech disability could fall into this category, and many neuroatypical people feel this way, as well as some Deaf people who identify as linguistic minorities. Either way, because ableist social constructions consider these non-normative forms of function to be negative, these people are still *disabled*: disability is not a negative value judgment, but rather a product of societal oppression.

I understand that, I just found it a bit absurd that there's so many blogs about the same types of experiences, to the point where it's almost impossible to find things that deviate from that.

How would you suggest I do this? (Not trying to be snarky, legitimately asking.) I live in a small town, I don't know anybody with Downs, I don't think I have any friends-of-friends with Downs. I spend 95% of my time around the same 500 people, that's why my first instinct is to go to the internet to help me research different viewpoints. And even if I saw someone who had Downs, wouldn't it be super incredibly rude of me to walk up to them and say, ""Hello, would you mind telling me all about your condition?""

My eyes almost fell out of my head.

884c42d5-75d4-4ee4-9f5c-c756aea8f985,1457633561,"&gt; Obesity is also not a moral failing. 

Agree completely

&gt;Most commonly it is compared to smoking, which is a bad comparison. The argument of ""You must have gotten that way by eating too much"" goes against decades of research that show that most otherwise-health people who overeat -- even forced to eat thousands of extra calories -- only gain about 20% of their body weight and then the body speeds up metabolism, and weight gain stops. 

I feel like this might be getting off point, but I've never heard that. If you're eating at a caloric deficit, you are going to lose weight. If you eat at a caloric surplus, you gain weight. What is a ""deficit"" and what is a ""surplus"" varies person to person obviously, but it's not like they're breaking the laws of physics.

&gt;calories in = calories out. It's far, far more complex. Obesity is a complex mess of factors, ranging from socio-economic situation, genetics, other health issues, including mental health (stress and depression, for example, can cause weight gain independent of diet changes), hormones, gut bacteria, and much more.

That's true. All these things DO contribute to the problem. However, calories in = calories out DOES work. However, all these other factors contribute to what ""maintenance"" actually is. PCOS for example will likely lead to a higher maintenance level in which the body burns calories at a slower rate. Stress and Depression CORRELATE with weight gain. But to say it CAUSES... eh.... I think your skirting some dangerous assumptions. I think it's more likely that stress and depression correlates with reduced exercise and overeating. The /r/fatpeoplehate crowd choose to ignore these external factors, citing that they aren't relevant... which is bullshit. However, I do think it the science of weight loss is sound.

&gt;The idea of overeating and lack of exercise being a simple cause is especially galling to those who don't get to choose what, where, and when they can eat.

I will agree with this. It's silly to say it's a choice, when some people have other circumstances. Perhaps saying it's ""Treatable"" is better, but once again... that's a medical model term.

IDK... I guess I'm just talking. Maybe I am just being prejudice, and am hung up on this. Like... I don't get irked when the Deaf community refuse to ""treat"" their hearing issues with implants. Why does it bother me that obese people are in the same category? Why can't I look at them the same way? I understand that I'm contriuting to fat-shaming and oppression, but I'm really trying to confront my biases....

This law is abhorrent and completely unconstitutional. I know many people of various disabilities, including down syndrome. I understand the truly ugly fact that many fetuses are aborted due to disabilities. BUT this is not the way to prevent that fact. Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, the RIGHT of women to have an abortion was upheld by the supreme court. This bill tries to remove that right.


What's most disturbing to me about this is a number of things.

1)As with many disability groups advocating for laws of this nature, this only pertains one type of disability, in this case Down Syndrome. IF you are going to try to get a law like this passed, why would you not include other disabilities such as Spina Bifida? 

2)Some disability rights groups are praising this law's passage. We (people with disabilities) should NEVER be advocating to remove someone else's rights! There was a time just recently that we were fighting for our rights. We should have a greater appreciation for the rights of others. 

3)This law, in actuality, will do NOTHING to prevent abortions because a fetus was diagnosed with down syndrome. The law bans a doctor from KNOWINGLY aborting because of a genetic disability. So in essence, a woman gets the test, gets the result from her doctor, then goes to a clinic and omits or claims a different reason about why she's having an abortion. It prevents nothing, but will result in a costly legal fight for the state. 

4)For the women it may effect... Is the state prepared to increase it's commitment to disability services? Are they going to allocate more money? Time and again we've seen the first cuts in budgets being disability services, and this should re-emphasize that this isn't about disability rights, or fetus rights, or even about be pro-life. This is about being pro-BIRTH and chipping away at a woman's right to choose.


This law is unconstitutional, ill-conceived, and those disability groups that advocated for this and are cheering this should be ashamed.",22,,22,0,0,

That said, you first need to understand that accommodation does *not* mean you can ask for anything and they have to accomodate. 

The legal term is ""reasonable accommodation"", and NOLO has this to say about it (emphasis mine):

&gt;A reasonable accommodation is assistance or changes to a position or workplace that will enable an employee to do his or her job despite having a disability. Under the ADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees with disabilities, **unless doing so would pose an undue hardship.**

In layman's terms, the acommodation has to be reasonable *for the employer also*. You have to still be able to do the job tasks, and it cannot cause the employer undue cost. In all honesty, if you cannot complete the job tasks in a timely and satisfactory manner, that may not be a reasonable accomodation, and they might be within their rights to terminate.

There are situations where lawyers are helpful, but my opinion, in this case, is that it wouldn't be. OP likely is likely only eligible for SSI benefits which many lawyers will not take so all of this may be a moot argument. 

I have been working day in and day out with attorneys for years. My advice is based on adjudicating thousands upon thousands of disability claims. Are all lawyers like what I described? absolutely not, my statement was not meant to be generalized. Lawyers are in the business to make money. You say that ""nobody gets rich"" of doing disability claims but it is a very lucrative business for them. I absolutely advocate for getting a lawyer at the hearing level since THAT is when they show their value. Obtaining medical records and medical source statements and narratives won't help in OP's situation since he doesn't have treating sources. You mention an ""error"" in characterizing PRW or discounting a treating doctor's opinion. That is going to be an opinion (in 99% of cases) of the attorney and the attorney at the reconsideration saying ""you know, we disagree with that"" is not going to help the claim. 

A lot of disability attorney's stil require the claimant to complete and provide all the paperwork themselves at those first two levels. I can't tell you how many times I've called and get told ""I dont know, call the claimant"". Or I tell them that I am going to deny the claim if I don't get the information and then never hear back again. Some law firms refuse to let their claimants go to Consultative Exams which results in denials of their claims (and they know they will be denied). There are actually hundreds of lawyers under investigation by OIG at any given time for malpractice related to disability claims.  Sometimes they are relatively minor infractions like withholding information from SSA but I've seen attorney's that falsify documents and medical records. You say that I generalize all attorney's but you are doing the same thing painting attorney's as all altruistic individuals. 

You say that clt says that he is a mess, but if you read what I wrote when I was talking about the lawyers, I said that he needs to have his family help him. He may have some difficulty with the paperwork, but if he has a family member (or friend) that can help him with it then he should.

I appreciate you calling my opinion misguided. I give my opinion in this sub based on my experience working for SSA. There is no demonstrable, statistical difference in decision rates with attorney's at initial/reconsideration levels. As I said in my original post, it is only at a hearing level that attorney's can really make a difference.

Independent Living Center's were created to mentor and educate folks like yourself. People, who want to understand their rights and the rules so they can do the right thing and not get in trouble or cheated out of what is rightfully theirs. ILC's show you how to get all the benefits and supports your entitled to, so you can maximize the quality of your life. All their services are free. I highly recommend seeking out their help. 

Now for your questions. When a person is on SSI benefits they need to be clear how they manage their income and assets. Yes, you can live with your friend ,as long as your not combining your money. If your going to pay the full rent, you will need to tell SSI that she is a guest, and does not give you money for rent. This will prevent SSI from reducing your benefit. The same thing goes for food. SSI will take your word, that she is not giving you money for food, and she buys her own food. The good news is that you need not label which food is yours and which food is hers, their are no ""peanut butter police"" who will come to the house to make sure your food is separate:)  This separation does not mean you can't eat together, just that you buy your own food. 

Now the hard question,""why SSI seems so hard to get a leg up"". When social security designed, the SSI program, 60 plus years ago, the idea was that a person would die from the condition or would most likely end up in a nursing home. So, SSI is based on substance level support. SSI benefit are meant to provide only three things, food ,shelter and clothing. The maximum federal benefit is only $733.00 per month, and it doesn't really cover those three things. If you get money from any other source, SSI will reduce your benefit. Its like welfare for the disabled. The sad truth is, its was never meant to give anyone a leg up. 

Now for the best news, SSA has, over the last 25 years been creating a new set of rules called the Work Incentive Rules,  designed to encourage people like you, who don't want to live in poverty, who want to be productive to the best of their ability. The work incentives let you earn money and not loose your benefits. The work incentives allow you to earn enough money to double your income (replace your SSI) and still keep your Medicaid so you are well enough to work. Best of all, the work incentives allow you get your benefits back immediately if something happens to prevents you from continuing to work! 

As a Benefits Advisor, at a ILC, I help people understand and use the work incentives to better their lives. I also am a expert in all the other state and federal programs. that help people overcome the limits, that keep us from being successful.

First, there is a difference between a medical condition and a disability. Following a general theme of disability (a condition causing major life disruption/difficulties) the people that were mentioned were *not* disabled. Eric Garner had a heart condition but how did that prevent him from complying with police? Sandra Bland had a seizure disorder, and, while it is terrible that she allegedly did not get her medications in jail, that didn't make her kill herself.  I have a bad back but in no way will that prevent me from complying with any police commands. If I resist arrest and the police have to ""take me down"" and it exacerbates my back condition how is that the police's fault?

I think this article is a prime example of sensationalism and trying to make an ""ableism"" charge where there isn't one. The article itself notes the most disabilities (or in this article describes them medical conditions) are invisible. So how is it police ableism if they don't know everyone's medical conditions.

Also if your husband wants to work/go back to work at some point, keep vocational rehabilitation in mind. Your state will have a department of voc. rehab and they can really help with getting things he'll need like transportation.",3,,3,0,0,

But no, I don't believe my family has support services for her. My parents know about my sister's desire to become a mother and they do not approve. She lives under their roof, and they see the possibility of my sister having a child as further responsibility for them. Our mother is very strongly opposed to my sister having a child and would even go so far as to insist she have an abortion if she became pregnant.

My sister has never babysat since we don't know any young children, but we used to have a dog who she did a fairly decent job of caring for. However, there was a time where she tired of having to take the dog outside so frequently, and fed her bananas so she would become constipated. She did love the dog, but sometimes she was indolent in her care. But none of that means anything to my sister. She simply doesn't process information that way. To her caring for a baby, is caring for a baby, and nothing is analogous. As for who would care for the baby--she says she would. She has fantasies about holding and breastfeeding a baby. It's one of the things she most looks forward too according to her.

As for my sister's sex life, I really don't know much about it and I think that's the way it should be. My parents don't want her to have boyfriends, sex, or children. She is only allowed go to work during the week, and visit her friends house on the weekends. She isn't allowed to visit men at their homes. I do know she engaged in sex at work with a man who wasn't disabled on multiple occasions. He told her that he would get her pregnant but that she could raise the child by herself. After we found out, we never did anything but cross our fingers and hope she wasn't pregnant. She was also never been taken to an ob/gyn. It was irresponsible of us I suppose. 

The challenge here is that she wants to be an adult who makes adult decisions and raises children, but then she still needs people to look after her and give her condoms to have safe sex, and pregnancy tests after slip ups, and visits to doctors for STD tests, and I think it's all a bit much for my parents in their old age. My mother just had a battle with cancer and she's not up to child rearing anymore. My brother just started a new job. And I'm a struggling college student. If I do decide I want children, it won't be for many years. As of right now I don't want anything to do with kids. No one is really at a stage where they can help my sister raise a child (or children, since she says she wants three).

I am glad you shared with me that it is possible for mentally disabled people to be parents, as I wasn't sure. Do these people get married and move out on their own or do they stay with their families? Can they sustain themselves or do they, their spouses, and their children simply becomes wards of their caregivers?

Language *is* meaningful, but it shouldn't be used to score points for the Most Aware Person Ever contest, especially at the expense of non-activist disabled people.

Another driver of the discussion, though, is that our identity is often considered inherently negative, and as a result many terms used to describe us are quickly considered pejorative, so we end up on the euphemism treadmill. In that context, the language debate is not just about terms, but about using those terms to construct a more positive disability identity, particularly one that *isn't* defined by nondisabled people trying to make themselves feel less awkward (like differently-abled or handicapable). In the history of disabled people, seeing us as anything but pitiable wretches is incredibly novel, and in many ways, this discussion is a proxy for our attempts to decide how we want to define ourselves *instead* of pitiable wretches.

Ultimately, I agree that the language debate *can* act as a distraction from the substantive inequality and discrimination we face as a community, and sometimes I think we focus on it because it's something we *can* influence vs. engaging with the hard work of carving out a place for disabled people in a system that doesn't know what to make of us and doesn't like it. But at the same time, we can multitask as a community: some people take on building accessibility as their pet issue, some focus on integration in education, and some people are really into disability theory and language! It doesn't have to be your thing, but that doesn't mean it doesn't matter. It's a big Internet: there's plenty of room for people to talk about things that may seem pointless to you or me.

13ef9007-eed6-4cfd-b27b-2b96efe9a47c,1457193490,"I sort of avoided autism because autism specifically has a whoooolle bunch of other moral issues involved with the idea of a cure. My girlfriend, an autism activist, said: ""And honestly, the only reason I don't want to get rid of my autism is because I'm pretty sure doing so would substantially alter my personality. It has been and continues to be a royal pain in the ass about half the time.""

That's a pretty valid argument, and corresponds with yours. Another issue with the idea of a cure for autism specifically is that it would primarily be applied to people who wouldn't be able to consent: children, who, as adults, might well argue what you and my girlfriend have said. 

Essentially, I didn't want to step into that landmine. Which is why I talked about cure in the broadest terms, and you immediately shifted my position into the landmine. 

There are major subsets who define themselves with their disability, who have made communities with it, and that's more than fine. *Nobody should have a cure pushed onto them, either.* 

edit: also, the DSM has made it very clear that any diagnosis has to affect the person's life. That's a requirement for any diagnosis for at least 4 and 5, the two I've read bits and pieces out of. It's not a productivity thing. It's a life quality thing. 

Doing a second edit after I get out of work, now that I have more time to address this: you can see this most with the process of how homosexuality was no longer considered a mental illness, and this line shows up pretty standardly across the DSM diagnostic codes: ""The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning."" (Taken from a DSM-5 code on a personality disorder.) So yes, occupational is *included,* but things I'd like to note are ""clinically significant"" and that it isn't just occupational.

""Health"" stems from a medical model... not a social model. In the medical model there are ""good"" and ""bad"" conditions (i.e. Cancer is bad. AIDS is bad. Addiction is bad. Obesity is bad).

In the social model, there would be no ""value judgement"" on whether Obesity or any other disability for that matter is a good thing or bad thing.

Is there no way that Disability Studies differentiates between Impairments like ID, TBD, Deaf, Blindness, etc. and something like Drug Addiction and Obesity? (which one could argue are the same problem... addictive behavior)

- A lot of mobility-impaired people were afraid to try the blocks, even though they could totally handle it. The height is scary. Consider a lower starting block? Or a more welcoming one -- perhaps you climb up from the side, and there are grips on the back to help steady you on the way up?

- Some folks in my group had trouble balancing on a slanted surface (also that freaked me out a little before I tried). You probably want a flat top -- and a big one at that, so little stumbles don't take you over the edge.

- CONTROL THE SPLASH WATER! The blocks we used had slots built in to let the water run off (we were at the UNLV pool -- you can probably google up some pics). A perfectly flat surface will collect splashes, drips, etc. Have a plan to handle that.

- Make sure the backstroke start is accounted for. It's.... *reasonably* hard to propel myself out of the water for a good handhold, and other people probably have it worse.

Yes, it is easy 'demonizing' (as you say?) people like you because I can't relate to anything you have to say on a logical level. Looking at the big picture I hate all disabled people who live miserable lives and want the world to change for them, even going so far as to complain about the representation of disabled people in FICTIONAL writings. The fact is we are a very small minority and the world shouldn't have to cater to us beyond what's necessary. I've grown up with one really important analogy in mind that you should all take a long hard think about.

I have an autoimmune joint disorder that got really bad all of the sudden in my last year of college. Went from an active, normal, job-holding college student to not even able to get out of bed in a matter of months. I started using a chair, but not until after around 4 months of just being bedridden because it hurt too much to walk. I couldn't stand up without screaming. So because of that start, I see my wheelchair as an instrument of freedom. I can't go places and walk around, so being able to get places anyway, even if I'm squeezed into a corner or people keep bumping into me, at least I'm there! 

I have just gotten used to being able to tell places that will be good for me to go and those that aren't possible. Cute little record stores on the second story of a downtown shop? Adorable, but I'm never going to be able to go into one of those again. Malls are usually pretty good places to go, things tend to be accessible. I have a mental list of restaurants that are spacey enough that I don't feel weird wheeling myself into. 

It's definitely a huge transition, and there will be places that are near impossible to navigate but you just have to anyway. There will be kids and rude people who just stare. That's really hard to get used to. I normally just smile and wave now. It makes them feel weird, but I like that, haha.

My partner is able-bodied and has to push me around places a lot, and I know it's hard on him. But he's absolutely my rock. I know it's tough, but it's so good that he has you to rely on! It's okay to complain, you both will want to at times. Just try not to make him feel like it's his fault, which I know you wouldn't mean to, but things like that I can easily accidentally take personally.

(It's a ""silver lining"" that he has no sensation in the arm because he'd be in a lot more pain; he rarely needs any narcotics, which is pretty unbelievable!) So anyway, he needs it elevated on pillows and that's what causes the balance issues. However, we recently got some bungee cords so we will strap down the pillows!

His stump is extremely short; he has closer to a hip disarticulation than an AKA. The doctors seem pretty negative about the potential for a prosthesis.

I feel certain that wheelchairs will remain a part of our lives even after he has a prosthesis though - for longer trips, or when he's tired or sick or in pain. 

He cannot WAIT for rehab. Sitting in the nursing home, even though he can move around in his power chair, makes him feel extremely frustrated. He wants to work out and build his strength back up!

Still, not every person who steals a disabled parking spot is necessarily like the above. Plenty of people are simply thoughtless without being total assholes. Like ""Well, nobody ever parks here, anyway,"" for instance. That's where calling people out would work.

I am assuming since she is waiting on disability if i remember correctly (my memory is shot thanks to my injury...and I am on my phone so I can't reread at the moment) then the OP needs to call whoever is handling her case, she needs to explain what is going on, she needs to call her local resources and find a way to get what she needs if they won't help her. The reality is with a disability is you have to learn to do these things, because sometimes shit happens and it's just you. She complains these people are asshats, they are no disagreeing...she feels they are asshats then they are asshats..but taking care of someone also isn't easy and people lash out in weird ways, doesn't excuse behavior but it usually explains it..people usually don't even realize they are doing it.

I find it odd that you want comics to not focus on real world issues, but are also are seemingly upset about disability cures in comics. (I'm assuming that's your position as you've jumped on the bandwagon and are being critical) 

Look, I also want comics to stop healing disabilities. I also want characters to stay dead. I also want them to age and retire. What I really want is good storytelling with real hurdles, challenges, and consequences. I'm not getting that, but that's fine. I can still enjoy the stories for what they are! You, and others, seem to want sterilized storytelling where nothing is threatening or ""triggering"" while also requesting more true to life portrayals? The problem is the slippery slope. Barbara Gordon was paralyzed violently. That can be triggering to someone. So you would seem to want that sanitized. BUT you also want her to stay in the wheelchair? How do you justify that contradiction? 

The ""Women in refrigerators"" line was based off of 1 event in 1 comic! It was used by feminists to illustrate the issues hurting women as a plot device ACROSS COMICS. It wasn't a critique of DC Comics specifically and doesn't show them being classless. It was used to make a broader point.

What came to mind is the words my own father told me after I became disabled after a stroke. ""You have to come to terms with your condition."" Initially I thought it meant just not being in denial, but it meant so much more. It meant to be forward looking, to explore and learn about my condition, to know my limitations and capabilities, because I am the owner of this body, not my dad. You seem to be in the right direction there.

I'm not sure what exactly your dad is feeling or thinking, but allow me to share with you what again, my dad told me a few years down the line about my mum.

She fell into depression. Blaming herself for some reason on what happened to me. ""Bad genes!"", ""Bad karma?!"", plus the traditional Chinese superstition stuff, even when she was accompanying me to doctors and physiotherapy, she blamed herself inside. It's been years and I'm more independent, so I hope she's a bit better now. 

Maybe its denial, maybe its fear. Ignorance is 'bliss' (bullshit), maybe he just does not want to acknowledge it. Maybe it's a domain knowledge thing, ""I can't understand it so it must not be true."" Willpower &amp; ""it's all in the mind"" has its truths, but not necessarily in all cases (that's what you need to establish, yea?)

What I think will possibly help is to get as much information from the doctor (neurologists can only help so much, neurophysiotherapists reveal much more about the physical side in my experience) and establish where you're at and heading.

You'll want to project and live out especially to your father, that you're doing all this for yourself, in order to live, and not just to NOT live (i.e. laziness or escape work). It's not an easy road, especially if you're not having much support, but keep fighting.",4,,4,0,0,

I would have excruciating pain in the morning when I got up for about an hour and then the pain would go from a 10 (really unbearable) to a 5-6. By the time I would get to my doctors appointment, I would be better and it didn't seem as bad. 

So, I scheduled the first appt in the morning, waited until the last possible moment to get up and arrived at my appt within 30 min of waking up. I couldn't move without screaming and my blood pressure was 180/1110 due to the pain. The dr finally saw how bad it actually was and scheduled some tests. Long story short, I had a cyst pressing on my spine that would make life unbearable in the morning. Surgery was finally immediately scheduled.

The amount of time it takes to get a decision is *highly* dependent on a multitude of factors.

What you can do to speed up your claim is just stay on top of it. Make sure you return all paperwork and phone calls in a timely manner.

Our standard setup (but many options you can choose):

RAM-B-132U (cup holder)

RAM-B-238U (1"" ball diamond base - which attaches to the rail/track on chair)

RAM-B-201U-C (6"" double socket arm to attach base to cup)



This puts the mount back far enough that it isn't in the way or hitting her legs, but pushes the cup holder far enough forward to clear her armrests.  Arm and cupholder can be removed with the turn of the knob, but base is permanent until you want to remove the bolts from the wheelchair rail/track.  We've flown and had the wheelchair stored in cargo and the take the cup and arm in our carryon and the base has not been damaged at all.
 

Twisting knob by hand will make it plenty tight to hold any cup or beverage.  But it can still be adjusted without having to loosen...will still be able to rotate and adjust position with pressure.  Might have to tighten the knob once a week or two if changing position a lot...but I don't think I've touched it in a couple months.  We like the knob to quickly remove for when we are being photographed - no drink in the shot.  We never use the koozie that comes with the holder, as she usually has a big Tervis type insullated cup.


Umbrella holder is probably on our list to try soon also.",1,,1,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1459198940,"You cannot file for disability while you are currently working. You can file while you are still *employed* but you must be out on FMLA or another type of long-term leave. You can even still be earning money using sick/annual leave, private short/long term disability, pension, etc. As long as you aren't physically going to work every day you're fine. 

Does your company offer any type of short-term disability through a private company (aflac, liberty mutual, etc)? That is really going to be the only way you can maintain some sort of income while you are applying for disability. You can't (or at least aren't supposed to) collect unemployment while applying for disability since by filing for unemployment you are agreeing that you are willing and able to work (which is the opposite of SSDI/SSI). 

California actually has its own short-term disability system, and I'm not too familiar with it, but from what I've seen of the claims it is a bit easier to get approved for it as it is considered ""short-term"" so the medical requirements are more lax. You may want to look into that; its likely through the Department of Children/Families or Human Services. While it may be easier to obtain it will probably still take a while for the application process and you can't be working at the time. 

If STD disability through your employer or the State isn't an option then my only other advice would be to save as much money and as much annual/sick leave as you can through your work. The sick/annual time through work will help if you need to go out on FMLA for a while (and start the application process) or you should get paid out your annual/vacation time if you do get fired. Saving as much as you can from you paychecks to help with any gap as well. ",6,,6,0,0,

I'd encourage your sister to get connected with a social worker or case manager now, someone with an agency that helps folks with disabilities.  Although she is currently managing her affairs pretty well based on what you say, she's going to need support in advance before she has kids - because based on what you say, she's pretty determined to have them.  She's an adult, so she's free to decline services, but if she really wants kids, it'll help to get support now rather than later - and it may be an added voice to the conversation to address concerns about how ready she is for parenthood.

An added note: people with disabilities, in part because of their financial vulnerability, are at increased risk for abuse.  Some end up with abusive partners, then feel obligated to remain with them to support themselves/their children.  I'm not saying that will happen to your sister, but given your concern for the possibility she'll need to rely on family/a partner, I felt I should bring it up.  

I understand your/your family's concerns given what you describe.  Regardless of her decisions, try to be there to support her as best you can.  Parenthood is a major decision for anyone, and she'll need all the support she can get.  I'm not saying you need to do childcare or anything like that (and I would be firm with your boundaries sooner rather than later, which it sounds like your parents have tried doing) but emotional support and helping her get connected with services.

If they say it's accessible but no wheelchair section they likely just mean it's general admission to the floor and, unless the venue is ancient, being floor accessible is a given. How big is the venue? If it's a bigger venue they'll likely have an elevated spot sectioned off for wheelchairs. The person you talked to might not have known what they were talking about. But if it's a smaller place, that's not a given. To be honest, I'm not the best to vouch for the wheelchair section, I never use it. I prefer to be in the crowd. That's part of the experience.

If you're going to be in the crowd, my advice: Get there when doors open and get straight to the stage or barricade. Park your wheelchair sideways parallel to the stage or barricade. This is important because if you sit with your legs in front of you you're only going to be that much further back. And at the stage and barricade the fans are going to lean over or onto it and that seriously obstructs your view at a lower height level. So get up against the stage or barricade sideways.

Depending on the type of music it is, the crowd can vary. I used to listen to a lot of metal when I was younger and the crowds can get pretty intense. You really have nothing to worry about, but if you're in a chair the crowd will often feel like they have an obligation to protect you. It's not necessary, but they usually will, and it's a kind gesture. I went to two concerts this past weekend. One was an indie/rap show. Crowd was full of energy but pretty tame as far as physical goes. The other was a metal show with my old man and that brought me back to high school. Insane crowd. Watch overhead for any crowd surfers. Like I said, the crowd usually protects you. But we were all unprepared when the main act took the stage.

My mom seemed upset at first and then quickly commented that she hopes I don't ""blow up"" from the steroids. I told her that was mean and weird to comment on how I look when my health is in danger but she disagreed and hasn't said anything since. Oh well.",1,,1,0,0,

3ee5b77e-c82e-4228-85bd-92a5a9ca5224,1458234728,Ok so I'm a c6/c7 incomplete quadriplegic and I LOVE to cook! Now I do have good use of my left hand and some use of my right but standing is a complete impossibility. So sometimes I have trouble seeing down into very tall pots or lifting really heavy hot things. But i found a few tricks that help me make the other times when I can see and lift much easier.  The biggest advice I have is also the simplest *don't forget to bring a towel*  and not just because you're going to spill something. If it's a nice thick towel you can also fold it in half twice then lay it over your legs so now you can set a hot skillet in your lap for a minute without burning yourself which thanks to the angle really helps me stir.  It might sound super stupid and dangerous but I use it almost every time I cook. Honestly I do most of my cooking on my lap it's way easier then stretching up for a counter that's lvl with your chest.,2,,2,0,0,

13ef9007-eed6-4cfd-b27b-2b96efe9a47c,1457139776,"I'm honestly very angry with how special education is handled. My girlfriend doesn't speak about her experience in detail, but makes it very clear she feels the people she was under in special education are sadists. 

My sister wasn't very well handled, either. She and I just went to get a copy of all of her IEPs. We discovered that she had never been diagnosed with Autism, and she wants the diagnosis. Since it's a developmental disorder, any written record of her development would be helpful. I got to see goals drop off her IEP that were marked as concerns again years later, but in unofficial capacities. (Such as: it'd be a goal on her IEP for two years, and then four years later, her teacher would indicate that she still had a problem with it.) There were indicators of all the symptoms of Autism in her IEP goals. Right down the line. There shouldn't be a clearer case of diagnosis, right? Well, the year they terminated all special education services for her, such as speech therapy, they explicitly denied she had Autism. (My girlfriend tells me that this was definitely money related. They gave my sister components of the services she would have gotten, but they would have had to allocate more money to her if she was diagnosed with Autism.)


And then there was the guy who had Dyslexia, and tested out of services. He loudly got into a conversation with my chemistry teacher. It was no secret he was taking the class for the second time. That he had no IEP, no services, nothing. He said: ""Well, I can just test into services again"" and she said: ""Now that I know you're going to do that, I will have to report you."" Anyone could see he could use the help. She just hated him.

And all throughout school, I had absolutely horrific handwriting. (Probably the result of a traumatic brain injury, I find out after I get tested in June.) When I tried to get tested to see if my handwriting was bad enough to qualify for help, they literally stalled me for two years--until I graduated. 

It does get better, though. If you move onto college, I was super impressed with my college's disability services. I brought in documentation for everything. They accepted previous IEPs, medical documentation, and so on. Then they explained what they offered for my conditions, and we discussed what would work best. I send, over a web portal, my basic accomodation--computer in classroom--before the first day of class in case they ban computers. Then I meet with each teacher to discuss what else from my list would be useful. It's been a system that works really well, and only once has a teacher gotten kinda grumpy about it. Her tune changed though when she talked to the disability services office about it. I think they gave her quite a talking to! (Disability services CCed me on the email they sent her telling her I did indeed have the accommodation for a computer.) ",1,,1,0,0,

You didn't ask for your circumstances, they just happened.  *That's ok.*  You should never be ashamed of that.  Help will get you on your feet, help will get you stable, help can also hopefully put you to work in a job that is minimally impacted by your disability.

You did the right thing asking for help because your disability impacts your ability to work.  That, is what entitles you to monetary aid from the government.  It is a long road, and there is a possibility that you may never become 100% self-sufficient; but you should hold onto hope and don't let the negative rhetoric get you down.

Your first step is to apply for SSI.  Since you never worked, you are ineligible for SSDI, but you'll be ok.  They will likely deny the first application; this is accepted as a normal expectation.  When you get that denial, you're going to take it straight to a local SSI lawyer who will sort it out and the government will pay for that by paying a capped rate deducted from your retroactive check.

Immediately after you apply, go to your local social/economical services office and if your state offers it, apply for interim disability payments.  They will ask if you applied for SSI, too; this is expected.  These payments are smaller but will help you a bit while your case makes its way through the system.  They will only pay them if their doctor reviews the case and decides that you have a good chance of winning your case for SSI.  They are also usually paid back with a deduction from your retroactive check.

After that, fill out your application for an EBT card.

At this point, you have to ask yourself if you want to continue living at home or on your own.  If you want to move out, then you need to go to your local housing authority and put yourself on the waiting list for a subsidized apartment.  The rent on these apartments is capped at 30% of your gross adjusted income.

After all that is settled, and you feel stable, you should enroll in Vocational Rehabilitation.  These are the people that will help you figure out what work you can do and help you get that job.  Usually you have to try out the job for a few weeks to make sure it is a fit.
