Stop isolation

The charity porn thing is a bit different - it’s like the old Jerry Lewis Telethons  that fundraised for kids with disabilities.

I was able to win on that appeal without needing a lawyer.

So my advice is to expect them to deny your initial filing.  Keep gathering evidence and Dr visits.  Document them and have that info ready when they send you the paperwork for the appeal.  You should probably at least consult a disability attorney and get their opinion on what they know of the local SSA ""culture"" in your district.

I applied the first of the following month. I was frankly half assed about it bc I figured I’d find a job I could do. I’d always been the breadwinner except for a couple years. 

I filled out the application then signed the approvals letting them hassle with getting my medical records. I didn’t even tell my drs. 

Just about three months later I got an approval letter in the mail. I had to wait the rest of the five months for payments to start. 

I called to find out what I got approved for, bc I had several conditions which could’ve been enough. I was surprised to hear they approved me based on my peripheral neuropathy bc it interfered with my walking. 

Frankly that was the least of my problems - I never even missed a day for it. I fell a lot before so one dr recommended a wheelchair, especially in places where I had to walk a lot.

I help people with this exact question on a regular basis. Are you seeking state disability, federal disability (SSDI), private disability through an insurance company, or something type of disability benefit? 

In general, you should just be honest with your doctor. I'd have a face to face discussion with the doc who diagnosed those conditions, and tell him/her you don't think you are fit to work right now. Doctor will agree or disagree. If doctor agrees, a note should be very easy to obtain, as the doc has likely written similar notes before. If doctor disagrees, kindly ask why, and come back to this thread for assistance.

Please feel free to respond to this comment with any questions you may have- while sub rules (wisely) require that I remain anonymous and do absolutely nothing to solicit business, your question is a (very) familiar one, and I am more than happy to give you as much guidance as I can.

I will say that it is my professional opinion that 1) worrying about it won't accomplish anything, and will just make you unhappy, and 2) considering your conditions, it would be unusual for a doctor to give such diagnoses recently (and thus not yet treated) while simultaneously certifying you fit to work. So I really do think you have less to worry about than you probably think you do- but of course, that's just a guess.",,,3,0,0,

I've got a connective tissue disorder which affects every joint in my body; they're much looser, stretchier than they should be and it also affects my spine.

My joints burn and ache non-stop, they dislocate and pop out of place, I've got nerve damage and pain in my legs and hands.

I can still function and do things, but some at a slower pace and with pain and discomfort. I'll never be able to be athletic though lol. They're both genetic and have no cure.

But the thing is that it's something you have no control over. It's not like you chose for these things in your life. No one would, and I can't comprehend how anyone couldn't understand that. So don't feel guilt, there's no need and it's not warranted.

Here's some good things to know (in my opinion):  


1. A lot of people will tell you autism is a mostly a social disorder. Many autistic people I know disagree and argue that it's mostly a disability that has to do with your brain's interpretations of sensory information and your ability to process all information.
2. There are communities out there for you. I mentioned ASAN earlier. If you are in the US or some parts of Canada, they have affiliate groups all over. You can reach out and meet other autistic people. I know a lot of people find that community very helpful
3. There are also digital communities. You might want to look at the #ActuallyAutistic hashtag on various websites. /r/neurodiversity is a good place to check out. Twitter and Tumblr are both active, if you use either. No shame in digital community!
4. Some common experiences among autistic people: 
   1. Stimming. Looks very similar to 'fidgeting' and overlaps in some areas. Most commonly, people think of things like young kids flapping their hands or rocking back and forth. Often times, it also includes other things - twirling with your hair, chewing on pencils or pens, listening to songs on repeat, enjoying the feeling of heavy things on you. Think of soothing, usually repetitive behaviors that you might do to help you cope with overwhelming sensory input or to help cope with extreme emotions. Maybe even just doing it when you're bored! (P.S.: you can actually buy stim toys at [stimtastic.co](https://stimtastic.co)!)
   2. Special interests: Mostly what it sounds like. Interests that hold special weight or importance to you. Maybe you know a whole lot about certain video games or movies, really like cars, etc. Many autistic people have 'special interests' that are typically beyond the level of interest non-autistic people show in topics.
   3. Sensory differences: broad category here. You might find yourself overly sensitive to certain things (ex: specific textures, foods, loud sounds, etc), or undersensitive (harder to notice, but you might not be able to feel certain things as much). You probably have experienced 'sensory overload' before - when your sensory environment becomes too much and begins to become painful.
   4. Meltdown and shutdown: often more common in childhood, but many autistic adults deal with this too. ""Meltdown"" refers to an external breakdown, where you might lash out at people, feel unable to control yourself, or feel explosive. Unlike a tantrum, this isn't usually with the aim to get something - it's usually difficult to control and can only go away with proper time. ""Shutdown"" refers to an internal breakdown, where you close in on yourself and, well, shut down. You might find it harder to do things like talk to people, take care of yourself, or process things. Both are often (but not always) a reaction to sensory overload.

Hope this helps! The book might explain it better than me. It's seriously worth a read :)",,,17,0,0,

Actually, I can't remember the exact wording regarding the date but I agreed to change the date. I'll miss out on some back pay but I don't mind at this rate. I'm thinking if the Judge wanted to deny benefits, she wouldn't worry about nailing down a date. I'm thinking she decided on October because I did have a ton of doctors appointments that month.

ed1bd58b-edf1-4ce7-871b-1dd1cba4fbea,1537398401,"It completely depends. My rule of thumb is if I don’t look busy, you can always ask. My old service dog was 90% retired last he worked, and i mostly just brought him to pet therapy to keep him active. He adores pets, everyone who asked got to pet him.

Some people feel different. If they are in training, it can be distracting. If the handler gets asked a lot, it can irritate some people. Patches on vests can be helpful, a “do not distract” usually means don’t even ask. 

The big thing is respect. If you ask, they say no, then you don’t. I have had people ask, then argue or get upset when I say no. If you ask and they say yes, usual dog rules apply. Don’t pet a dog where they can’t see you, dont go for the face. 

That’s my opinion, but it really varies. I think as long as you stay respectful, and just avoid even asking dogs with vests saying “don’t pet” or the like, any negative reaction on the handlers part means they are having a bad day/things outside your control. ",,,13,0,0,

Hopefully some day I can put that drive, madness, and experience into something more than comments... but at least there was a question I could give back to.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was able to get my wait time for my hearing cut from, what multiple people tell me, is 8 years down to 3-4 years Not at all acceptable in my mind, but it is something. Though people I know with bipolar, like my grandmother, birth mother, and a LOT of that side of the family) are able to get it much quicker. What benefited is absolutely bugging your disability advocate (get one, a good one. There are some that'll legit just use you for money. Not well, learned from my first. They are also REALLY hard to cut like the cancer they are. Make certain the disability office has your papers, as I learned how terrible he was after callingm onths after sending him papers of proof and they didn't have it.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of my disorders is physical, so I could have pictures of the flair ups. I bugged them with that, I told them everytime I saw a doctor/shrink/whatever so they'd get those papers. I found this wasn't going well so I started emailing and ranting my lawyers and then my local congressman. That wasn't going well so I started writing up this seires of articles/me bitching about all of this thagt I call Plight of the disabled american. Since snappy titles might actual make people read it. I took to the internet and collected all the emails from my locals news centers, my local government buildings, my local govenrment officals, the national officals of the departments that I felt might be even a smidgen related (department of health and human services even sent me a letter telling me they knocked down the price for medical marijuanna from $150 a year to $50. Woo. Progress. Yay. Still paying for the privledge to be medicated, then I gotta pay for the medical marijuanna anyway, it is disconnected from my actual doctors and insurance, and generally still seems as shady as a 'TOTALLY ACCREDITED' doctor trying to sell you kidney surgery in a back alley. ), and ANYONE that struck me as possibly being relevant, but I still feel the 70 emails I got is a short amount. Even had the whitehouse emails on there. (Presidental and VP ones just resend for a month until the service says it failed to send. Shocking.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I shoved ALL of those emails into a little group on gmail and have since been spamming them with it. Now, these lengths probably aren't necessary, but the list of evidence my judge listed off was long enough I had to keep myself from laughing in maddened delight. Bug the FUCK out of them. I went at this with the hopes that I caused either frustrated groans, annoyed whimpers, or more hopefully, heart palpitations when they saw my emails. Even plastered them on a bunch of websites just in case they were ignoring me. Not viral, but I have it festering on the internet. (Also put it on a subreddit for ease of sharing. PotDA for the curious. Linking it got the comment autoremoved.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Point being, bug them. I consider this personally appaulling the shit I have had to go through to get medicated (not the pot, this is purely because they refuse to medicate my ADHD, PTSD, Depression, and most of all the blood disease Hereditary Angioedema) without the run around I have been doing for 10 years. As well a tiny TASTe of the medication that'd make my life 10x eaiser and 100x less AGONIZINGFLY painful. A taste. Then they took it away, in the middle of a series of HIGHLY NECESSARY tooth extractions. As a blood disease that makes your intestines swell sometimes and leaves you vomiting anything in your stmach for a week if you don't toke up kinda destroys your teeth. Infects them. Makes you experience more pain. This bullshit is unethical and unacceptable, especially as this is just scratching the surface of what I have experienced and what I have seen, heard, read, and consoled friends over.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have enough to fucking deal with with nature being a headache, we don't need a literal mountain of stress in our way. A nightmare of paperwork, poorly managed databases, and rolled eyes that have lead me to be able to 100% without exaggeration say the US health system has tormented me. It has driven me to madness. Is actively refusing medication I need so my blood disease doesn't kill me when I have all my infected teeth (and all the rest as they are crumbling) removed. So I can have my oh so wonderful goal of having all my teeth removed so they stop making my blood disease flair up around my throat. For years. They've insulted and belittled me all in my effort to purely be well. To not suffer. To possibly be able to rebuild myself where I can work as a creator.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the best of your ability, as you have enough to worry about, badger them. I don't wish to stress you out, but from my experience (still waiting too) it might be the different between 1, 4, and 8 years. As I only started intensely bugging them this year when I blacked out in a fit of madness and wrote everything in that subreddit. You have enough to worry about, please don't let them push you to the mountains of madness as well. They are only pretty in glancing visits.

He doesn't like to be called by his full name (example: He wants to be called Mike, he gets **extremely** angry if anyone, even someone meeting him for the first time, calls him Michael (neither is his real name)). 

He also gets **very** angry if people repeat stuff to him. I am sure he interprets that as them assuming he didn't understand the first time. But, it usually happens when he doesn't respond the first time (Do you need a bag today?) *or* ignores the first time because he doesn't like what was said (I can't talk now). I think his feelings are genuinely hurt in both cases. 

We do talk about what would get him kicked out of the store multiple times every day. These conversations are always initiated by him. I have yet to discover the itch they are meant to scratch. They always start ""No one can make fun of you here, right?"" But after that they oscillate between how people will get punished if they tease or are rude to him, and how he would get punished if he tried to break something or faked a heart attack. It's annoying and tantalizing. I keep getting the feeling that if I could just find the right thing to say, I could short-circuit the conversation, scratch his itch and then we could move on.

I am always honest and we talk about how people *can* make fun of people there, but shouldn't. And when he asks what will happen if customers are rude to me or my boss, I tell him that we are generally able to handle ourselves without resorting to kicking people out and that our emotional response will be minimal. When it is about him, I remind him that he can always come to us if someone is being rude to him. When it is about tantrums, I turn the questions around and remind him that he knows all the answers. He always does and seems more satisfied when he tells me the answer than when I tell him. If I do it right, he asks a few perfunctory questions about photography, if something is ""high or low tech"" and which of the two of us knows more about it. Then we fist bump, because he remembers that I don't hug, even if he whines, which he always reminds me of. And he asks the time and leaves. But, it is very time consuming and when I can't do the whole routine it can become an issue.

They are required by law to only charge a Max of 25% of backpay for disability, if you get it.  Back pay is basically the pay they owe you from the date they admit you became disabled, to the date the paperwork goes through, minus their grace period, I believe is 6 months.  Mine went through on the last day of the grace period, so they didn't have to pay me back pay, but they waited as long as they possibly could to approve me.  (What are the odds? It's almost like the paperwork was super fast, but they waited 6 months to intentionally avoid paying me for the disability they admit I have? I'm sure they don't do that to anyone else...)

So because no SSDI backpay, my lawyer was free, its just conjecture, but I feel that preemptively lawyering up is why my disability was approved the first time.  

As a reasonably smart dude before my brain started eating itself, things I'd wish I'd known before I needed to apply for disability.  

-if you aren't terminally ill, 6 months is the absolute fastest that you can be approved.

-consider moving to a cheaper area, lot of cool places to live that are lower cost because their aren't tons of high paying jobs their.  If you are on disability, it will never be enough (mine doesn't even cover my medical expenses) so that might be something to help you make ends meet.

-Their are free programs that can either retrain you, to do a job that would be easier for you to do with your disability, or will subsidize your employer, so they can afford to continue to employ you, even though you make more mistakes/take more sick time etc. compared to what is expected of a typical employee.  (This isn't saying that you are able, or should do these programs, only you can decide that, just some of the info I found in my own search, that I wish I'd had at the beginning.  If one of those do work for you, it could help you earn way more, at least for a while.

He definitely lives in his own little world. He's only comfortable around family. He's very aware that he'll probably never have a relationship. He talks about it and how he's sad about it.

As i am currently at the stage right after the disability hearing where I am waiting for my letter that tells me whether or not I am getting my money. I have been denied twice so far (for stupid reasons) and simply contested it or asked my defense attorney to contest it. So I can only really talk from experience about anything up to that point. 

Though that does remind me, should you get a denial letter, if you haven't already... First off don't fret TOO much. It is on the tip of everyone's tongue who I talk to about this that disability has a high tendency to deny those who apply on the first try to 'weed out the liars'. As this affects those who are actually disabled and actively suffering from it (like myself) I find this method horrible, regardless of its effectiveness at preventing fraud. Since it causes more suffering to people like me. When you appeal, make sure you push your representative/lawyer for an appeal and a hearing. Then pester them to make certain this happens. 

My first rep (the asshole I mentioned before) also told me he'd file everything and get my appeal underway. Month later when I had had enough (months of him not answering my call, and then a LONg series of me trying to change my rep that included me sending a hand written note wrapped around important documents, so that when they claimed the documents came but not the letter telling them to change my attorney as they requested I could call them on their bullshit. What do you know, the letter SUDDENLY appeared.) I was told by my Social Security Case Manager that the hearing had never been filed for, but somehow my appeal did. Essentially just kinda carting me along for longer in the hopes that repeating the process exactly the same would lead to new results. In reality, the rep gets paid by a percentage of your disability back pay. The longer you wait, the more they get. It is in their interests to string you along. Do not allow this.

If you worry about them thinking you annoying and getting annoyed, good. You want that. If you have to go through the shit the disabled has to, they can go through the trouble of doing their job representing you and speeding up the process. If they don't, annoying them is the most passive way I know of to get them to do something. Pester, rant, rage, rave. Whatever it takes, it is your health at stake after all. It isn't selfish to focus on your health above other matters, it is common fucking sense.",,,2,0,0,

While on SSDI, you can make up to a certain amount per month ($1180 for 2018) without issue.

The whole ""trial work period"" thing is, *I think*, for people who are trying to transition off of SSDI.  It gives you three months to see if you are able to work full time again, with no reduction in the SSDI payments.

If you stick to under $1180/month (or whatever the amount will be in 2019), you can both work part-time and get SSDI.

https://carolgraysocialstories.com/social-stories/what-is-it/

There are social stories for everything imaginable if you do some googling. Depending on the type of developmental issues, these can be a great way to show appropriate and inappropriate behavior. She used one on how to treat animals a lot since there was a therapy dog at her school and some kids struggled to understand that it was a living thing and not the same as say a chair or a book (living vs non living is a higher level concept most kids don't really get until they're like 7-8). She had to use one once on masturbation and when that was appropriate.

Many people who have developmental delays struggle with subtly, and do not pick up on social cues. They also tend to interact with the world via a strong sense, like smell, and that can lead to behavior others read as creepy like sniffing people they like. You may just have to say, sniffing other people is not allowed in this store. It makes others uncomfortable and that is not okay. It is against the rules. If you sniff people, you will have to leave. You may sniff the merchandise, or yourself, but not other people.

This will seem blunt and even rude but it's really just clear and gives a direct consequence to a specific action, and alternatives that are okay. Obviously this should be done away from others. Pull the customer aside immediately upon the behavior being reported so there is a fast response.

You may want to call the local special education co-op (it's related to the schools but generally separate and is in charge of special education services). I'm sure they could find a teacher who'd give you guys a training or some ideas on how to work with these customers on their level in a way that does not escalate the situation. You could also call the local organizations that provide services for developmentally disabled adults and see what they think. They may even know the customers and be able to give specific advice on what works best for them.

Remember, when people are developmentally delayed, they interact with the world the way someone who is much younger would, but with the physical body and urges of an adult. Imagine being 5 or 6 and having to act like a perfect adult, with all the things that come with it. It's hard and exhausting! Chances are, their response or actions would be normal and either acceptable or just mildly corrected if their emotional age and physical age matched up. That doesn't mean they should be creepy or harass others, but it does help you understand where they're coming from.",,,12,0,0,

Get in front of a legislative judge and explain that it was not your fault because it was their mistake. If no one told you about their mathematical error how could this be your fault?
Put together as much paperwork you can. If you can create reasonable doubt and show their mistake you can win and owe nothing if fact they have to pay back any money they collected.

We started volume expansion and I had a pre-syncope event that put me in the ER with a diagnosis of a mini-stroke at 26 years young and I think I nearly gave my cardiologist a heart attack. It was either that or the fact that I had a port. It actually felt like he kicked me out of his office he couldn't even look at me.

With a diabetic or seizure alert dog, their handlers have episodes weekly or daily - sometimes multiple times a day. Those dogs know their scent ranges like the back of their paw. With a stroke, unless you’re stroking out on a weekly basis (which I would hope you’re not!) there just wouldn’t be that upkeep or really a need for that kind of alert. But again, I don’t know much of anything about your illness, so definitely ask your doctor about your specific occurrences. Dogs that save their owners from stroke are usually a one-time thing, not really a regular or trained occurrence.

Pain crises definitely always have triggers like you’re mentioning. If you can pinpoint things a dog can help with - for example, leaning over to pick up items always causes dizziness and fatigue - you can make a task out of them if those symptoms build up to be disabling and prevent you from doing things - the dog gets items off the ground for you so you’re not sick from picking them up. 

All of those sites are scams. If you’re in the US, an ESA has no public access rights except air travel and housing. Your therapist or psychiatrist writes a letter saying your pet provides you emotional support for a mental health disability. It lives with you and you care for it, it’s still a pet, but it can live with you in no-pet housing and travel in airplanes with the letter from your doctor. A service dog performs tasks/work specifically to help with aspects of your disability, such as blocking you from crowds or retrieving items, etc.

Definitely have a conversation with your doctor(s) about what your limitations are, what you’re already doing to help, what works and what doesn’t, and what tasks a dog could do to make your life more equal to people without disabilities. They can help you make that determination. Think of a robot - would you take a robot around everywhere with you to do “x” “y” and “z” tasks? Take the cute fuzzy dog out of it and only focus on what help you need to become more independent/mobile/functional. You also might want to reach out to a few SD programs or see if anyone else with your condition has a service dog, if you haven’t already! They may have some ideas also.",,,3,0,0,

So, am I correct in thinking that to figure out what 1 credit is going to equal in terms of disability payments, I'm probably going to have to brave the SSA office? For example, if I got 2 credits it equals $75 increase in benefits? 

I'm just trying to ball park how long and often I need to try to work before I can finally risk losing the portion of my payments that come from my parents' work history because I went ahead and got married.

As for your question... Yes. I make under SGA and I'm very, very careful about that. Like you, I have to work because SSDI just isn't enough. Plus, honestly, it gets boring not working every single day.

I have a progressive illness with zero chance for improvement and I still get nervous that I'm going to lose my benefits. Like you, I try to stay at least $100 under SGA.

-It will take time, so don't rely on getting it fast. For me I was out of work 2 years before I got on. 1 year before I applied, then 1 year until I was accepted, and I didn't have to appeal. 

-Paper trails are the most important thing ever, and will really validate your claim. You need an official diagnosis for anything you have, the more the better. (I'll explain that later.) Having a cooperative PCP is a must. 

Especially helpful to see a physical therapist and have them do a write-up on what you are and aren't physically capable of doing. It's going to be miserable but make sure you are at your worst for this appointment. Skip meals, don't sleep the night before, do anything that triggers your health to ensure they see you and record you as bad as possible. 

This was very important to my application and they also prescribed me a wheelchair. (I recommend a folding chair with a Max Mobility Smart Drive if you have use of your hands/arms.)

-When you fill out the application, you need to fill it out based on your worst health day. The application and generally the whole process is not accommodating of the real life fact that people are better some days and worse others. You therefore have to just fill it out based on your worse day because you never have a guarantee that you'll be better than your worst on a given day. (And that is what keeps you from working anyhow.)

Also, add every single thing you've ever been diagnosed with. Gender dysphoria, depression, anxiety, PTSD, autism, skoliosis, literally everything. They have to evaluate you based on the combination of everything, so make sure you write everything down and have paperwork for it. Go to new doctors to get diagnosed if you can't get records. It's better than increasing chance of rejection and adding years onto the application process. 

-If you think you'll be able to work even 2 hours once per week, see if there's a service like Disability Rehabilitation Services. The one near me was actually willing to pay for me to be evaluated by a specialist because I wrote down I thought I had a thing but it wasn't confirmed. Apparently they are legally required to investigate everything you put down, and honestly they were all wonderfully kind people who helped me out a lot. 

-If you have issues with depression/anxiety and are not currently medicated, try desvenlafaxine/Pristiq. It is a new drug that for some reason has extremely high rates of helping energy/fatigue in CFS/ME and POTS patients. I am not kidding when I say it changed my life. While I am by no means cured, I went from 4 years bedridden to walking in less than a week. 50mg didn't work for me and caused me to stop eating for a week, but when they dropped me to 25mg to wean me off suddenly it worked and I felt a lot better. From 5% to 40% in just a few days. It may or may not work for you, but it is 100% worth a shot.

I wish you all the best, I hope the process goes smoothly for you!",,,4,0,0,

I have had quite a journey with this and although not due to the same condition, I also have another congenital disorder called primary Lymphedema in both of my legs so I get the ""this isn't an issue caused by something secondary or an injury""). This may not provide enough support for you either which I am sorry if that is the case. Perhaps you could use at night then? Not even sure you need a night brace either though lol. I have a tendency to sleep on my hands so I need to wear these to bed. I have very small wrists despite all of the swelling from R.A. which largely manifested in my hands. I also have ulnar nerve entrapment, wrist atrophy (which is getting better w/ OT at home exercises since I used up my allowable office visits for the plan year). I can see the tendon along the length of my left arm which is also way smaller than my right despite me using my left hand over my right since I've had R.A. My dad is left handed so maybe that inclination was already hidden there - I understand that this is probably not sound reasoning but merely a thought. Also, in regard to the other comment mentioning pediatric sizing; adult blood pressure cuffs are always too large for me as well if that gives you some perspective regarding my size. Anyway, back to the wrist brace!! I like the Futuro For Her Wrist Support. It is light blue in color and has fit me the best when it comes to OTC type things. Regarding materials for something custom; I also wear custom compression garments on both of my legs that consist of all sorts of different pieces. They're made by Circaid (Mediven) and seem to be sort of like a wet suit material. They are breathable and have SILVERtec™ added to prevent static, odor and propagation of bacteria in the garment. I know that this is comparing apples to oranges somewhat and get that you are not looking for compression but perhaps some research into their materials is what I am getting at.

If they say yes, then you can ask for that letter. If they say no, then you get to find a new doctor, spend all that time getting them current, and ask again.

Having an important/relevant doctor who doesn’t support your case will make things exceedingly difficult. They will have to turn over records, etc. and as the other person pointed out, how they have worded things in those records and communications is critical.

I also suspect that you may have a tough time with a MDD &lt;1yeah DX. PTSD will alter the equation, but mental health issues seem to have a higher bar, and something like MDD that has been normalized so far will likely be very high. At less than 1 year diagnosed, how your physician words things *and* how loudly they advocate for you will be critical, because I suspect there will be questions about whether every possible treatment has really been tried, and whether you may see improvement using another treatment. Of course, if you have a documented history of suicide attempts (*prior to this DX* — don’t try to pad your file #funnynotfunny (seriously though.) ) or hospitalizations for mental health issues that will also change things a bit.

Attorneys that do estate planning will still recommend this for high wealth individuals because you burn through a fortune in just a few years with 24/7 care.

Most long term care insurance is also a defined/limited benefit and usually runs out in 2 years or less. Disability insurance is different but that's just extra income.

3381bfde-9ef1-45fa-a335-62d9be6203bf,1537225486,"Autism is a development disorder that causes people to have trouble understanding social cues, reading the emotions of others, and causes delays in emotional development, meaning people may act younger than they are physically when exposed to stimuli. Many people with autism become successful and live ""normal"" lives without assistance of any kind. Others need help throughout their lives with daily activities. It's a very broad spectrum.

I worked with students with autism for a while. The kids I've worked with ranged from funny, smart, and easy to talk to, but struggling to make friends/deal with situations that overwhelmed them, to been years behind in learning and emotional development based on their physical age, which was incredibly frustrating for them. All of my students were cool kids with varying interests and different skills they could bring to a group. It's hard to pin down what autism looks like because it's just so varied. 

Many, many people (especially people 25+ who grew up when no one was looking for autism in kids) are so high functioning they're never diagnosed and they're just seen as odd or eccentric. It's a very common thing, and varies a lot in severity and how much accommodation a person needs. 

Things you might identify with:
hating change, to the point you always buy the same car or wear the same type of clothing.
Taking a long time to understand jokes, or missing them entirely
Not really getting fiction books despite understanding more difficult non fiction books no problem.
Struggling to pick up on subtle social clues, like not understanding if someone is flirting with you or if they're bored with what you're talking about.
Not having a very expressive face, or making the wrong facial movements for certain emotions. If someone told you to make a happy face, a sad face, a mad face, and a scared face, those would all look similar or not like the examples shown (like you smile when scared or sad).
Coming up with complex fantasy worlds or stories much easier than others
Needing weight or pressure on your body to feel safe or secure
Taking this literally when they aren't supposed to be (example: to you, many cartoons aren't funny because animals are being hurt. It's hard for you to see Wiley E. Coyote get hurt because to you, it's an animal being hurt, not a fake character).",,,9,0,0,

I have a different disability but I can so relate to where you are right now. When I was in my 20's I came home to my messy house from work and laid on the couch until I had to go back to work in two days. I remember sobbing because I couldn't even manage to fold some towels. I felt so helpless. But this too will pass. There will be another good day, even if it's nowhere in sight now. Try to enjoy the little victories and distract yourself as much as you can from the pain.  One of the problems of dealing with terrible pain is coping - it takes a great deal of your mental energy. If you can refresh your spirit you may find a little more energy to deal with other problems. Reading, going to church, trying to find a support group are some good ideas. If going out is too much, try looking on the internet for some good preachers, some good teachers and perhaps an online support group. I seek out positive TED talks when I need to change my perspective or just distract myself. If you would like some suggestions you can pm me. Doing Sit and Be Fit by Mary Ann Wilson or Classical Stretch by Miranda Esmonde-White classes (on PBS TV and youtube) can be done at home. The main reason I suggest this is that exercise changes your brain chemistry and can produce endorphins to help with your pain, but finding a level you can do without increasing your pain is the real secret.",,,2,0,0,

The definition of disability requires that the impairment last, or be expected to last, for a total of 12 consecutive months. The tricky thing with cancer is that, for some kinds, treatment is only 3-6 months and so, even if a person couldn't work during that time, it isn't considered disabling.  SSA does consider any post-cancer effects (lymphedema, surgical side effects, recovery from chemo, etc) in the decision, but a lot of those do improve over time. 

One thing that could be holding up your application is they are waiting to see how your cancer is reacting to the treatment. Even if it hasn't been 12 months since your diagnosis, if you are showing improvement/remission they can deny you *projecting* that you will be able to return to work within 12 months. 

Generally, to get disability for cancer it has to be terminal (or gradeIII/IV level), distant metastases, or be recurrent. The blood cancers are a bit different, some of those are disabling by diagnosis alone. ",,,1,0,0,

948f5be7-0b73-435b-950f-7397edd9b15b,1538149939," I enjoyed this article and agree with the stances therein.  Popular media is pretty damned tone deaf to what it is to live disabled, especially in an able society with abled perspectives.  Not that I'm arguing that abled society needs to bend to every whim of the disabled community.  That would be absurd.  It would be nice to see reality reflected in our media at least.  Not just movies, but shows, news, documentaries, etc all seem to miss the mark more often than not.  For instance, I stopped watching documentaries about disabled life, because too many just come off as inspiration porn that dont properly show the actual day to day struggles that have become mundane to us, but really open the eyes of abled folks whove never spent much time around disabled folks.  Hell, I could write a documentary just about the importance of sidewalk infrastructure as a chair user.

  There are bright spots though.  I've seen shows and movies where the character has a disability, and their struggles are shown, but their character is the main focus with the disability being something just a part of the greater whole.  I've also seen stuff that still places the disability front and center, but in service of showing the parts of disabled life no one really thinks about, and maybe should.

  If the person interviewed for this article reads this, I want to advise a film I think you might enjoy.  I'm actually considering doing a youtube review of it just because I was so impressed by it's handling of disability.  It's called ""kills on wheels"" it's a heartfelt dark comedy, and I promise that makes sense.  It's about a small group of assassins who use their disabilities as a cover when going about their lethal business.  
  To give you an idea of why I gush on this movie, the characters are all people with disabilities instead of the other way around like usual, and the frustrating little things we deal with are present where they should be and not forced.

Explain everything, including any known family history of migraines and triggers. If you can demonstrate a family history of migraines, this would also help. Migraine was one of the conditions I listed when I applied and while I have other disabilities that were my main issue and likely contributed more to my approval, this is what I did, as all of my issues were hard to conclusively prove.

I saw that SSA will do emergency presumptive payments for SSI (not for SSDI, I think?), but, while members of my treatment team are confident I will eventually be approved for SSDI, it’s not one of the clear-cut cases for the SSA. 

I do have SNAP benefits in the meantime, as well as Medicaid, both of which I’m rather thankful to have, especially with the extent of my medical bills over the past while. My GP endorsed me as being exempt from the SNAP work requirements, so, at least for now, I’m OK there. Otherwise, my state caps it at 3 months, I think. I don’t know how universal that cap is. 

I don’t do well in apartment dwelling, due to the nature of my disability, and this area is pretty bad when it comes to the housing vouchers anyway, especially since shelters have been closing and tent-dwellers have been forcibly removed so there have been a lot more people to accommodate.

Anyway, the first visit of the year, the teacher would allow me to take over the entire class for the session and tell the kids a g rated version of what happened to me, how to act around disabled people, and answer a few questions.  It helped teach them, as well as keep them out of my hair during future sessions with my assigned kids.

  I've also done live streams and the aforementioned YouTube video discussing my story, and living as a disabled person in society.  I figured out quick that the most common question after ""how did it happen"" was ""does your dick still work"" lol.

I would not suggest a rabbit to perform this service unless you are super confident and find the right one, but I have owned and cared for so many that it has become second nature for me. Rabbits, in the end, are prey animals, so they would have to get used to loud noises and many people without fleeing. This alone makes it hard to find a rabbit that can perform a service for you.

They also have to be highly trainable. In all my years of caring for rabbits, I have only found one that is at least as trainable as an average dog, and that is my lovely Honey Loaf. He is still under a year old, so he has a lot more upcoming potential to see, but as of now, I haven’t hit a “max trainability” point with him. I started very young with him (as you should), and it was very, very hard at first to teach him to sit/lay down, because they are naturally energetic, and many rabbits cannot reliably perform these commands. Now he lays and sits at my feet without me asking. Training him to respond to me was not so hard because he was always very concerned, even when I sneezed. I would reward him for these behaviours with love and affection, not so much treats. Rabbits are super emotional creatures, in my experience.

Rabbits also do need a lot of exercise, like dogs, but you do not need to walk them, per se. Unless they enjoy it. If I recall correctly, there is an app to schedule a walker for your dog? Might be worth looking into.

If I’m being honest, I really only came to the realization that I really am disabled very recently. I was unfortunately under the impression that because my disability wasn’t visible, It couldn’t be that bad, and because I could still walk there was no reason for me to need a wheelchair, etc. 
Thank you a lot for the ideas, though! I’ll look into disability-friendly jobs, buying a cheap wheelchair, and applying for minor disability (maybe not in that order). I knew the options were there I suppose, but it definitely feels good to know someone sympathizes and can give me a little push in the right direction. 

I also have to thank you so much for offering to talk about pain management! Already being on some hefty meds for my mental illnesses narcotics and things of the like make me pretty nervous, and I’d really like to explore options before going to a last resort.

My cousin has RA, among a host of other things, and your symptoms sound somewhat similar. It's really good you've had MRIs and X-rays, but have you had a rheumatologist run a battery of blood tests? If not, that would be my first stop if I were you.

you might want to try out an anti-inflammatory diet (pills alone aren't really great if your diet is counterproductive) and avoid smoking and drinking if possible. it's a shot in the dark, but certain chronic pain conditions respond well to reducing inflammation.

&gt;painkillers

I know you feel you need them for the pain, but if they're opioids (I'm not saying they are; just *if*), you should quit while you're ahead. Opioids are the single worst thing to prescribe a younger person with chronic pain. Believe me. I've had to sit at three people's bedsides now and watch the hell of withdrawal play out because the opioids were making their conditions worse.

You might also want to check into therapy if you already haven't. It's good for both chronic pain and PTSD.

97b1c3d6-eabe-44d5-a1ae-6cc080e6c7ea,1536772619,"Really the benefit can be summed up with 2 points. The first is purely a technical design reality that the level of detail our ratings will permeate down to a level that Google/Yelp and any other widespread rating application won't invest resources into because they are are not designing for a target market, they are designing for everyone. They have a simple binary rating, is it accessible Y/N. For us, we are starting with 4 ratings that focus on mobility as this is the problem our founder initially sought to solve and this rating will allow to individually rate the parking, entrance, seating and bathroom. In future versions we will expand to allow ratings that focus on other disabilities such as vision impairment and hearing impairment.

&amp;#x200B;

The second reason relates to user acquisition. Google is passively prompting users to rate location accessibility and they are targeting sub-sets of their ENTIRE base, many of whom have no vested interest in contributing this type of information and many of whom may not have a basic and fundamental understanding of the criteria that is necessary to decide somewhere is accessible. Once we raise our funding, we will have the luxury of targeting ALL of our marketing budget and brand partnerships toward a very segmented target market of people who understand this concept and who live with these impairments daily. The quality and detail of information we collect will hold infinitely more value as it can be placed in front of people with vested interest to collect this data from the get go.  ",,,5,0,0,

* it doesn't really get you a seat on our buses, the drivers won't say anything to people in the reserved seating unless they need everyone to move for a wheel chair, and there's only 2-3 seats (depending on the bus type) where the walker will store out of the isle. More often than not I end up sitting *on* the walker on one style because no one will give up a seat where the walker can be stored.

* It's a pain in the ass dragging it on and off the bus, and drivers and riders give you hell about it, and if you get on an already full bus, there's simply no way to store it in a way where anyone can get on or off. 

* They're expensive as hell. Medicaid covered it because I *need* it, if I didn't need it and wanted a chair, I'd buy a $9 folding camp stool that would fit out of the isle in any seat on the damn bus, not a $300+ walker.

  Out of all my interactions and observations in the years I've gone there, I've only seen one person freak out regarding PC stuff.  It was some dude getting loud with everyone that disabled people are too whiny and demand that everyone adopt all these new words by force, yadayada.  In fact, in my years as a double amp, he's the only person I've ever heard even talk about that shit outside the internet.

  Most visibly disabled people I've met or know don't talk about what they are called.  They dont really care.  What gets talked about is how society treats us in general.  Assuming we're incapable of doing anything, jumping in to ""help"" uninvited, bothering us when we're clearly busy because they just need to know what's up with our disability, etc.

  I don't think the disabled community cares nearly as much about the words people use, as they do towards how we're actually treated.  No one really calls disabled people cripples or retards anymore after all.  I do think a tiny amount of disabled folks are drama queens, like any group has.  They'll look for reasons to be upset and argue.  Reasons like what words people use, or saying that worrying about words is too much.

Schooling did not work out and I was without an income and lost my place to live as well as my truck.  Ended up moving in with my mother who could not afford me to live there or feed me.  With my remaining money I got for selling me truck I bought a lot of canned chili and ramen noodles.

I finally applied for disability in 2014.  I had no medical records though and had no diagnoses.  During this process I began going to a free clinic for appointments for a few months.  The thing though is they could not diagnose me as it was a training facility.  They did put in paperwork what they would have diagnosed me with if they could though.

After my denial I got me a lawyer and reapplied.  I have a little more paper work now, but I had to somehow see a real doctor for a real diagnoses before my hearing.

I am a veteran and discovered I could go to the VA clinic for free due to my circumstances.  I got an appointment and the VA doctor recommended I talk to a VSO (similar to a case worker).  I made an appointment and talked to the VSO to see if they could help my Social Security case.

Not understanding what the VSO was talking about I signed some paperwork and left hoping it would help my Social Security case.  During the next month I got more help at the Veteran clinic and a real doctor diagnosed me.

The VA sent me to a doctor for examination, which I thought was strange as I was only expecting them to help with social security.

In Feb 2015 I had my Judge hearing for Social Security and with my medical records the judge said during the hearing that I was basically approved.  It was like a heavy weight lifted off my shoulders.  I just now had to wait for disability to kick in.

While I was waiting I kept checking my bank account for my backpay.  One morning I looked and I saw an insane amount of money deposited into my account.  It was 3-4 times more than I expected in backpay.  I waited for the mail to come and I got a letter from VA.

Turned out the VSO and the VA examination was for VA disability.  I never even knew VA had there own disability so never thought to apply.  My disability started while I was in the Army and there was medical records with a diagnosis I never knew about.  I was medically discharged due to it

When my performance was affecting my team, and I felt like I was pulling them down with me, I decided to leave. It was going to kill me.

I can do some things. And I've done them. But thinking about going back to work doing the same things fills me with dread and likely spikes my bp.  Kinda sucks.

Keep a daily diary of all your systems and struggles. In addition, make a running list of all your symptoms.

Research Crohn's disease and symptoms. There are probably some symptoms that you forgot about and add them to your list, even if you have not had those symptoms in a while.

Research medical contacts, side effects, care, etc, and add that information to your list.

I don't think not having a therapist for over a year is a big deal. It is hard to find the right  therapist and going without is very common.

I would contact several attorneys' offices. It is a great free learning experience about the process and will help you refine your narrative.

It's me, my wife, and our daughter. My wife and I aren't disabled, but my daughter is. She's ten, and she can't walk. Outside of home, she needs a wheelchair. At home, she prefers to crawl. Our landlord hasn't done much for us, except replacing door knobs with handles so my daughter can reach them a little easier. Everything else we've had to do ourselves.

* I've removed her closet doors and built a shelving unit so she can put away her own clothes. Only the dressiest of clothes get hung up, for which she still needs my help.
* Using 3M tabs, I've attached a shower head near the bath faucet so she can take a shower by herself.
* Using a water dispenser and Tupperware container, I've made her a sink which sits just outside the bathroom. Soap, hand sanitizer, and all non-refrigerable medications live here.
* A similar dispenser sits on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator for milk.
* I bought an induction stove so she can sit on the floor to cook herself food.

There's more that she's grown out of too, like a collapsible ramp that she used to climb onto the couch. She's tall and strong enough now that she can climb onto chairs, on the toilet, into the tub, etc., without assistance.

ab176b02-8e70-498c-9f97-c6417271288e,1537809889,"My personal experience: 
I listed migraines as a condition on my initial application because I have three different medications for them, and I thought it would be odd if I didn’t explain why those meds were listed.  I was later told my migraines would be very difficult to use in my claim (I have 2 other chronic illnesses that I’m actually applying for- IC and RA). 

First, they are difficult to diagnose. There’s no concrete test for migraines, and SSA loves ‘proof’. Lab work, x-rays, scans, etc. only serve to rule out other things instead of proving with absolute certainty that it is migraines. 

Second, there are so many treatment options. From meds to Botox, there are so many different treatments that it’s hard for me to honestly say that I have no other choice but to deal with it. No, this shouldn’t be a factor, but apparently it is. I now rotate three different meds and injections to treat mine. 

Third, they are not a listed condition for SSA. That’s not a full stop, but it sure is helpful if the condition is recognized! 

After I received my initial denial I hired an attorney. She is the one who told me not to bother with additional documentation for my migraines. Again, this is just my experience. You may find an attorney that is much more knowledgeable on using migraines. 

Finally, I’m so sorry you are suffering! I too have had them since I was young and it’s absolutely miserable. Sending a million good vibes your way in hopes you get a little relief!!

948f5be7-0b73-435b-950f-7397edd9b15b,1536612819,"It's reasonable to be curious sure, but it's also reasonable to be left alone like everyone else when you wish to be.  I'm missing my entire left leg and most of my right.  My disability is very visible and unusual, I get that.  In order to have an active life outside of my home, I've already had to accept being gawked at constantly everywhere I go.  

  On top of that, I get interrupted or bothered when I dont want to talk to anyone at the moment.  It's almost always a request for why, which is a somewhat lengthy explanation due to everything that went into how I became a double amp.  It's an explanation I've told hundreds of times now, and even made a detailed youtube video about it so I can at least redirect curious internet folks.  If its not that, its people thanking me for military service when I was never in the military.  When I correct that one, I always speak a little loudly so they'll feel a bit of embarrassment and hopefully learn a lesson about assumptions.  I always correct it because I wont steal valor. 

 I also get a lot of religious people that try to pray for me, or lay on hands.  I'm always polite in turning them down, but as an atheist, that annoys the crap out of me.  Hell, I've had a couple young children freak out at the sight of me and run to their parents, without me saying or doing anything.

  This happens to me nearly every time I go anywhere people are gathered.  Restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, events, ect.  I've had folks like you say much the same thing.  Take it easy and accept its going to happen.  I always wonder though, why should I just accept it?  I already accept the never ending stares without complaint.  Why should I give up even more?  Why cant I expect to be left alone like anyone else the majority of the time I'm out and about?

  I dont get outraged or anything, but its frustrating being treated like a free freakshow.  I've been politely turning down explaining my disability lately, and most people I do that to act like I mildly insulted them.  

 I guess what I'm saying is that people with disabilities should have their boundaries respected to the same degree as anyone else.  I honestly dont think thats too much to ask, but so many people say I should just accept that treatment with a smile because of something that happened to me I had no choice or fault in.  I get people are going to stare, and thats natural considering how unusual I look when I basically end at my pelvis.  I dont think its natural to assume it's ok to bug me for a Q&amp;A or any of that other crap.  If it was rare, that'd be one thing, but it's extremely common.  On top of all that, I might want to vent my frustrations online with fellow disabled folks that get it, and instead I'm told that thats just how it is and I shouldn't complain.  I gotta say thats a damn bummer.",,,3,0,0,

The KiwiTech Startup program offers a 50/50 deal where our company will match each $1 provided in development with $1 cash.

Brandon and I are located in the Metro Atlanta area and we are looking to raise a seed round in order to cover V1 development, begin a soft launch/ beta roll-out plan for when the 13-week development phase ends. Ideally, we are looking to raise $300k - $500k at a $2.5M valuation or as a discounted convertible tied to series. As soon as we close on the first round of funding we will start development and hopefully have our beta app out by early 2019.

That's why my first lawyer told me. I have a seizure disorder which is apparently difficult to gain approval. After my second denial, my lawyer wrote up an appeal and my case went off to Virginia. Did yours get sent there?

My lawyer moved states and I had to find 2 other representatives after that. I can't recommend whether you should start over or not, but I will tell you at my last hearing, they told me if I was approved they wouldn't give me all my backpay and shrunk down the amount a lot. So sometimes I wonder if I should have started over and gotten approved sooner but a lawyer would know best.

Also, I don't think a lawyer not taking your case unless you withdraw your appeal is saying it's a weak case, so much as you have an appeal out there that they didn't have a hand in submitting all the right documents nor their own statement. I know from having to switch representatives more than once that they want to be sure everything is in order to their standards so they get paid of course. I had to do a lot of searching to find representatives who would help me mid-process Because it is so much less streamlined for them. 

It seems like you already do, but keep track of everything. Every day, note what your primary debilitating issue prevents you from doing. Make sure your doctor knows about it, and keep regular appointments with the same primary care doctor if you can, in addition to your specialists. 

I know how tough this process is, and I am wishing you the best. Here to help in any way I can!

c47d515f-d9f4-4a23-917d-abfe08777977,1536806391,"&gt;One is an older man, who has an obsession with rule-breaking and punishment. He comes in two or three times a day, and always wants to have the exact same conversation. He pushes that conversation on multiple people during each one of his multiple visits. If we tell him we cannot talk right now, he says okay and then continues with his questions. He sometimes becomes angry if he is informed that we cannot speak with him at that time. He threatens to try to break things or ""fake a heart attack"". And, if he is not indulged, sometimes he will begin huffing/grunting loudly and yelling ""I'm upset and it's all your fault! All your fault!"" The cashiers find this extremely embarrassing and somewhat frightening, depending on the cashier. He also takes pictures of women he finds attractive, sometimes following them around or out of the store. And, allegedly, he once stuck his camera into the ladies' room.

Regardless of disability, this is a threatening behavior. I'm surprised other customers haven't called the police or called corporate due to this.

He needs to be banned from the store. Taking pictures of women is a violation, especially in the ladies room, where it could be considered a crime. Ban him.

&gt;The other is a teenage boy, who also says he understands that we cannot talk, but also persists in attempting to engage. His situation is a bit more sympathetic, he comes to our store to avoid being at home. His father is not at all supportive of his inner life or (possible) gender identity and has little tolerance for his non-standard behaviors. He is usually more or less okay, unless he is happier or angrier than usual. If he wants our attention and we cannot entertain him, he will often approach customers and force his company on them or find open spaces and spin, force loud laughter, or talk angrily to himself, depending. Customers are not thrilled about it. And they tend to avoid the areas where he is, for lack of a better word, playing, so we also lose sales on items in those areas. 

If he is autistic, the spinning and laughter he does is called ""stimming."" It's a behaviour he uses in order to ground himself. And it sounds like the store is a safe place for him. The best thing you can do is to explain to him CLEARLY that the laughter, angry talking, and engaging with customers and staff (beyond purchasing items) is inappropriate, but he is welcome to walk the store as long as he wants, as long as he doesn't disturb anyone.

The way I would phrase it, is this:

[He enters]

""Hey [name], I need to talk to you for a second. Come with me."" (Pull him to the service desk, or near the entrance, if you have one. Don't embarrass him or take him to the office. All you will do is scare him and shut him down.)

""[Name], I know you understand when we say that we cannot talk, but it means exactly that. We cannot talk. When we are here, we are only able to talk to customers to help them buy and find things in the store, and not about anything else. 

Also, when you are in the store, feel free to walk the aisles as much as you want as long as we are open. But you may not disturb the customers by talking to them, spin, laugh loudly or talk angrily to yourself. If you do that, I will have to tell you to leave the store. I don't want to do that. I understand you feel safe and comfortable here, but remember that this is a shared space, and we all have to be courteous to each other. This means no spinning, loud laughter, disturbing the customers and not engaging the staff beyond ""okay"" and ""thank you"" when you check out, when they say that they cannot talk to you. Okay? If you break these rules, I will have to tell you to leave.""

Level of functioning/symptom severity and sensory processing are not related. 
There are many people with ASD who are sensory-seekers as well people who have no sensory processing differences, so I don’t really like grouping everyone with ASD together on the sensory aversion. The video would be more inclusive if it said “some people with Autism.” ",,,2,0,0,

8678158d-3ddc-4920-ac29-98f574855a46,1536804823,"It really depends. Scooters are typically seen as better for traveling (via self-owned car) and as ""more stable,"" along with being a bit cheaper and having less social stigma attached (you're not *as crippled* if you use a scooter, apparently). Power wheelchairs - in my opinion - are better for daily use as they are more comfortable and have more utility, but they can be harder to travel with if you get the ""[typical](https://permobilus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/M3-Website_NoBKG.png)"" (heavier) kind. It's been my experience that accessibility is built for wheelchairs, not for scooters -- but this may be different in your country, or even someone else's area in my own country. It's more the size of scooters that make them, again purely imo, less accessible; where a wheelchair can turn on a dime, a scooter has to make a four-point or wide turn. You can get up to a table in a chair, but you can't with a scooter. Otoh, you can take apart a lot of scooters and put them in a trunk of a car.

So mainly, the deciding factors are: cost (apparently not so much), utility needed, and pure personal preference. Do a google for ""lightweight power chair"" and some stuff should come up, and/or the same with a scooter. Google ""scooter vs powerchair"" for more articles/info.

We have a preliminary deal in place to have the V1 iOS and Android versions of the app built for us in a 13 week period by our partner, KiwiTech, in exchange for a stock warrant at a $2.5 million valuation. The KiwiTech Startup program offers a 50/50 deal where our company will match each $1 provided in development with $1 cash. 

Brandon and I are located in the Metro Atlanta area and we are looking to raise a seed round in order to cover V1 development, begin a soft launch/ beta roll-out plan for when the 13-week development phase ends. Ideally, we are looking to raise $300k - $500k at a $2.5M valuation or as a discounted convertible tied to series. As soon as we close on the first round of funding we will start development and hopefully have our beta app out by early 2019.

We have a plan to soft launch with strategic partners and organizations to seed initial users. We don’t have a specific budget allocated to this but based on the seed round we will definitely use some of our allocated marketing budget to fund this effort. We have plans to do targeted roll-outs in large cities and college campuses with incentive campaigns and contests to mobilize a specific market to canvas their city or campus in a designated time frame, build a leader board functionality for users to see where they stack up in the contests and provide prizes (potentially donated by brands that are interested in being involved) to the highest volume raters in each target market. Each canvasing contest will be supplemented with geo-located search ads and social media boosted posting to promote the contest a few weeks before it begins and while it is happening.

After our beta phase we will continue the same approach of targeted market roll-outs with crafted content for those markets being promoted across the major social media platforms and search engines via paid advertising. We also plan to start a “Vlog” type series of who iAccess is, what we’re doing and a call to action as we near our release date to drum up interest and to get people fired up as well as highlighting other accessibility first companies. We believe creating this unique content can lead to virality through social media that will drive up the number eyes that come across our targeted launches and will launch this content strategically and promote it strategically. We are already looking into ways of including gamification, into our platform to encourage users to get out and review. Our v1 of the app will include a push notification to a user’s phone 30 minutes after visiting a previously searched location, encouraging them to leave a review.

I even worked with a vocational rehabilitation counselor all throughout my college career and post to help me get a job. He had polio and knew the struggle. He didn’t candy coat stuff, and I appreciated his honesty. During one meeting where I was in tears from frustration, he said something that just stuck with me... he said “unfortunately, you could walk into an interview with a resume that’s far better than another non-disabled applicant, and they’ll still probably pick the other person.” 

He told me about his struggles having to work overtime after a natural disaster without power, the toll it took on his body, and not being able to use his powered wheelchair (he couldn’t charge it so he had to manage with a standard wheelchair). His job basically threatened to fire him if he couldn’t be at work. He suffered incredible pain for a month because he knew he wouldn’t be able to find another job if he was fired.

Taxes don’t really apply for SSI as it’s a welfare based program- unless you specifically ask them to withhold money. But if you do that you just get the money back that was withheld. I had a small (compared to others) backpay and didn’t owe taxes on it as I receive SSDI and had paid taxes when I was working. I don’t know what happens when you have a large backpay but I have yet to meet anyone that owed taxes. They will send you a w-2 type form in January but nothing is owed and you don’t need to file it unless she has other income. Like a job or dividends or whatever. 

The other insurance would be Medicaid if she’s on SSI, I would expect her to already have it if that’s the case? She would just have both. If she qualified for SSDI then she gets Medicare after 2 years starting from the date she was deemed disabled plus 6 months. If this is the case I would definitely keep the private insurance and use Medicare as the secondary (if possible) as Medicare costs $130/month (unless you qualify for help) and the coverage +number of doctors that accept it is TERRIBLE (at least where I live) 

In her acceptance letter they should have mentioned approximately how often she will be reviewed (1yr, 3yrs, 7yrs) but that’s not a guarantee it’s just a guideline. They can review however frequently they choose. 

I’m approved for mental health reasons as well. Just make sure she takes her meds as prescribed and keeps up with her psych/therapist appointments. 

If she’s under 18 disregard the tax stuff cause I have no clue. Probably not taxable but it might count towards your income. 

Congrats to her and good luck! ",,,2,0,0,

464a0b84-9cf6-468e-888a-994835cb3ab3,1537553153,"Annoyingly, this all depends on your doctor. Some will push other avenues to try and get you working (even if in many cases having the note now so you can collect yourself, especially with PTSD, and find where you'd best fit in can be helpful for many suffering) some will not believe you.

To me, the most important piece is that YOU are the only one who knows how you struggle. How you over think and stress (a common symptom of PTSD, more use becoming used to being a bit more on edge, or going through enough traumas to second guess every thought), how you suffer, and how that makes you feel. Do NOT sugar-coat it. Whether they like it or not, a doctor is in that office with you for YOUR benefit. YOUR health.

I have had some horrible doctors, but I don't consider it as much hard as finding the doctors that have your best intentions in mind, rather than a point, hidden motive, or bias. If what they say seems like a generalization that they have taken as fact while you have had a different experience, make certain that point is heard. I've had issues with that given I have a rare genetic disease that I often have to argue to get heard, instead of put on something that will worsen it.

It isn't being argumentative, I believe, that helps. Most people take on a different demeanor. Their shoulders raise like hackles, their voice grows stronger with their resolve for their side of the argument, and they do not give up. Make sure you are knowledgeable on the conditions you are explaining. Be polite, but assertive. If you doubt yourself your doctor may doubt you.

If the doctor judges you, then you need a new doctor. If your doctor will not LISTEN to you, purely nods to what you say but seems to stick to a plan that is actively hurting you regardless of complaints. You need a new doctor. You aren't being disruptive. You aren't looking for a fix. You aren't being a nuisance, and you aren't a burden on this society purely because the system at play doesn't mesh well with your conditions. I say this given I have been trying (saw the judge for my hearing, now waiting for my written response. The suspense annoys me.) for a bit now and these are the types of things I kept thinking about myself. Then they broke the last straw, refilled the jar with new straws, then looked me dead in the eye as the broke every. single. straw. with a customer service smile and a 'terribly sorry'. While breaking more straws.

&amp;#x200B;

No one should be forced to suffer, be it physically or mentally, because someone else BELIEVES they know better. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. You, personally, know when you are suffering and when you are not. Do not stress about letting yourself be heard by people whose literal job is to listen and fix those problems. If they say something that you feels endangers you, find a new doctor.

This includes (from experience) not only the doctors note but them phrasing the doctors note in a way that doesn't sound like a passive aggressive statement. ('This patient is perfectly fine when not experiencing a flair up' is not a doctors note. Since the note is supposed to be ABOUT the flair ups, not about my time between them with no mention how long a period that is. It isn't long. I am still bitter, clearly.) Complain to the management if you are so inclined, but if it is stressful, don't fret. The highest priority is following the path of getting help. Not following the annoying fetch quest that is getting disability. This experience makes the 'Big Goron Sword' zelda quest look like killing rats in a cellar.

Some other things (any medical or impairment related expenses that you need to pay in order to be able to work) reduce the amount that SSI counts, but you have to report the full amount and the deductions. The way the numbers work on your actual ssi payment is a bit confusing but I'll try to sum it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you get the full rate right now: $750

&amp;#x200B;

The first $20 in any kind of income you have will have no effect on your ssi payment.

&amp;#x200B;

The next $65 that you earn will also not have an effect.

&amp;#x200B;

After that it is a $1 reduction for every $2 that you earn. So if you earned $87 in a month your SSI will go down by $1, (and here comes the tricky part:) 2 months later. If you earn the money in September, you report it in October, and it affects your SSI payment that you receive in November. 

&amp;#x200B;

In your scenario, say you earned $350 gross in a month, and assuming you don't have any other countable income right now, your SSI would be reduced by $132.50 two months later. You come out ahead in overall income, but your SSI is reduced a bit.",,,5,0,0,

If someone who literally can't work to sustain themselves would not get on disability, then that is not because they ""aren't disabled enough"" but because the system is flawed and they fell through the cracks because of those flaws. 

The actual humans who work with said system every day recommend things like making sure to take physical therapy tests on days when you are wrecked because they know the system will fail people if they don't do that. 

There is nothing wrong with working the best you can under a flawed system to make sure it is actually helping the people it is intended to help. 

If you think it's better that people so sick they can't survive without aid should just die in poverty instead of getting on disability because people who don't know how the system works for chronic illness think they should, then I'd say that's a problem with you, not the sick people who are doing whatever they can to live.

However, I'm inclined to say that as a workplace, language is the least of your worries. You know what's really damaging disabled people? How they're hiddenly discriminated against. Whether it's conscious or subconscious, the chances that a disabled person will be hired over a nondisabled person is substantially lower. 

A wheelchair, to take one example, is seen as a huge liability and a risk that administrations tend to cop out of by simply refusing to interview/hire. 

Do you know what will actually be really impactful? Ask the administration that's in charge of staff to brainstorm what disabilities are appropriate (i.e. not completely hindering) for your staff. Do they think they can hire blind people? Do they think they can hire someone who uses a wheelchair? Do they think they can hire someone who can **only** work for 10 hours per week? Can someone with autism who is sensitive to loud noises or bright light be accommodated?

Add such a list to your hiring requirement, or something equally appropriate. You get the idea - be **active** in helping disabled people, don't just have the baseline mandatory staff lecture. Maybe put in your hiring ads: 

&gt;We encourage people with disabilities to apply

I have what's technically a chronic migraine condition, although my symptoms are mostly not headache-related. It was brought on by a minor car accident. Recently I've been having joint pain very similar to what you describe, although not as severe. My neurologist feels that it's an extension of my migraine condition, and described it as being akin to fibromyalgia.

If you haven't seen a neurologist, I'd strongly recommend trying to get a referral. In my case, I was disbelieved or told that my symptoms were ""highly unusual"" (which I assume is code for ""you're faking it or it's all in your head"") until I saw the neurologist, who told me he had dozens of patients with the same or similar symptoms, and that while rare, my condition is not irregular.

Ultimately, you know your body. I'm frankly dubious of the whole idea of ""conversion disorder"". You're not imagining your pain, and regardless of the cause, it's not something that can or should be waved away as all in your head.

I got denied and contacted a disability firm with representatives for my state (not lawyer). I decided to hire them to help me out. They filed an appeal on my behalf which also got denied.

Anyway, I believe the hearing was necessary because I didn't seem disabled enough on paper when my age (36 at time of application), work and education were taken into consideration. That's what social security previously claimed as a reason for rejection. The representative I hired came from a firm of previous social security workers and many people that have encountered these cases. I absolutely couldn't have done it all alone.

Some kind of brain imaging - MRI/CAT, blood work and then a lumbar puncture to check the pressure of your spinal cord fluid.  The condition is sometimes also called pseudotumor cerebri (fake brain tumor).  So the imaging is to rule out brain tumors and any malformations that would cause a back up of fluid (like stenosis).  The blood work is to look at possible infections like encephalitis and meningitis.  Once all of that is ruled out and you have increased pressure in your spinal cord fluid...then it's idiopathic (not having any obvious causes).  One of the other symptoms you often get is papilledema - swelling of the optic nerve.  Beyond the pain, the main concern is blindness since fluid build-up can cause your retinas to detach.

The problem we are having in the US is there are entitled jerks out there who have PETS and 1. claim they are ""Comfort Animals"" 2. Cheat and Lie by buying counterfeit vests and licenses. 3. just bring their little yappy nippy shit into places it does not belong potentially endangering real Service Animals and the public. There have been numerous incidents where a ""comfort"" dog has attacked a Service dog because the latter is trained not to fight back.

This undermines your Service dog and all the other Service animals. ANY pet that performs a duty: seeing eye, PTSD, seizure, diabetic, deaf/hard of hearing, autism spectrum etc. should be allowed anywhere at anytime.  

Right now, I think there is confusion of what defines a service animal. What we need to do in this country, is put all of the service animals under one roof. And strictly regulate what they can and cannot do. Maybe also get them a hologram ID that is hard to counterfeit. 

A former roommate had her doctor sign some form stating her psycho scratching, biting cat was a ""comfort animal"" so she could get out of the pet deposit. When I had to re-home MY kitty because no one would allow pets, I had 3 people tell me to just get my MD to sign paperwork I needed her. Sorry that is lying and unethical. Any doctor caught signing such paperwork needs to be fined and reprimanded.

I am on the Autism Spectrum, specifically Dx'ed with Persuasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified, or PDD-NOS.
 
PDD-NOS is a form of autism that is extremely high functioning during later parts of life, while experiencing markedly lengthy delays in obtaining life, personal care, and social skills, in a similar way to autism.

The disconnect caused by what I see in others, and what others see in me can be alarming. I tend to place my trust in people more easily, though I've slowly been rebuilding my defences against unscrupulous strangers. Lowering some of my medication has helped put a little edge back on me, and be able to defend myself verbally from threats, physically if another individual provokes an attack towards me that puts me in grave danger.

I was also the target of incessant bullying in high school, got called gay, and was the victim of fake sex rumours, as well as an atrocious girl that I fell for in high school. Turns out the gay thing was right, but not what the kid bargained for. Hehe

I've thought about being a woman when I was 15, and talked to my counsellor about it then. Those feelings never went away, Still had a feminine personality, walked like a girl, laughed like a girl, talked like a girl, related to girls more than guys, always sat down to use the toilet, hated my beard to this day, felt like a robot, and all the typical signs that something was different.

Only after losing a really good friend did I step back and look in the mirror, as one Canadian politician famously told his voters to do. I thought about it more and more, and eventually, it dawned on me. I was trans. Those feelings I tried to hide for years and years came back. They were stronger than ever. Even though I foresaw this becoming a reality, about 6 or 7 months before I came out to some of my friends. And possibly even before that. I even mulled over HRT before I officially came out.

I hope to start estrogen soon! I'm so excited to start on a new journey, even with the challenges, and the risks that come with being a woman. Mainly being the target of unwanted sex advances by men and trans fetishists, along with what I call ""groomers"", or people who try to take advantage of young, naive women with developmental disabilities.

They're set targets of how few people can be awarded the benefit, so the whole thing is skewed to try and not give you PIP if they can possibly avoid it.

I draw with colored pencil. I bought a big pack of prismacolor pencils on Amazon for about $80 a year ago. I have not replaced anything but the blender pencil. They were totally worth it, and I've improved quite a bit in the last year just drawing off and on. It's also excellent therapy. If I hate myself, I draw what I hate (my body, how I think others perceive me, etc) and the feeling... Just goes away. 

I recently borrowed my mom's sewing machine. I got a $2 pattern at Joann's (they have good sales on patterns) and bought some bedsheets at a thrift store for $4 for cheap fabric to start learning on. Cutting the fabric is a real pain so I'd recommend a ""splurge"" there on sewing scissors that are flat bottomed, or on a self healing board and the pizza cutter looking fabric cutter (I can't remember the name). Bam, learning a ""useful"" skill on the cheap. You can also attempt hand stitching a quilt. Slow, time consuming, and a great way to spend time. I personally love hand stitching and am good at it, so I enjoy making quilt squares. Plus, starting is pretty cheap since you just need a small needle, thread, and cheap fabric. 

I also read a lot, setting book goals for the year on Goodreads. Your local library probably has an app for ebooks and audiobooks! In fact, your local library is a great resource for all kinds of classes and meet ups. Best part: librarians have seen it all and most are very open-minded and sweet, and happy to accommodate you or help you. 

I also used to go to the zoo and workout a lot while on FMLA leave from a prior job/hellscape. I had a zoo membership, and knew the zoo very well. I loved to just chill with my favorite animals and sketch (don't sketch gorillas, they see the stare as a challenge and will ram the glass. Orangutans are chill tho. Super chill. I knew one that loved watching me draw). Best part: many of the keepers and staff are introverted but passionate about animals. They will tell you all about the animals they take care of but won't bother you if you want to be left alone.

Working out, either at home with YouTube videos or at the gym, makes me feel accomplished. I can see and feel improvement. And it also helps my medication work, making my mood better and reducing my pain.  I tend toward super angry depression and working out lets me funnel the rage into something useful.

Hope that helps. I'm not sure what triggers your PTSD so I tried to kind of include a range of things and places where I think you'd be safe if you were triggered. I have some very mild PTSD from my last job and I can't even imagine how shitty and disruptive moderate to severe PTSD is. I'm glad you were able to get disability. Never feel like you're less than anyone else because of it. Your value is inherent and equal to every other person's. It cannot be reduced or taken away. It is not linked to your productivity or ability to work; your value comes simply from you existing.",,,5,0,0,

Substantial gainful activity modification proposal

Thank you Mr. INSLER AND Hermann 

Hi, 

Seniors should not be on fixed income in their golden years.. thank you 

That's why I created a petition to The United States House of Representatives, The United States Senate, and President Donald Trump, which says:

""Substantial gain known as gainful activity work transition to SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY MONTHLY PAYMENTS SHOULD BE CHANGED to 18 MONTHS UNLIMITED WORK INCOME plus social security disability monthly payment till 100,000 in bank account. If you can not work should get an increase in social security disability monthly payment. Thank you contact your rep or senator. And change it! ""

In general, I have no problem asking for boundaries to be respected. However, in these two cases, I have asked both customers to respect our personal and professional boundaries and that has not resulting in success. Frankly, were they not disabled, we would have banned them both from the store for their behavior. But, we haven't because that would feel a lot like banning them for being disabled. We wouldn't ban someone with Tourette's because they had a disruptive tic. It's just sometimes very hard to know the line between unavoidable behaviors and behaviors that they could modify to suit the setting.

Here is a wall of text with my frustrations. Sorry in advance. 

I have two customers with several issues each. Both *do* try to converse with the cashiers while they are engaged with other customers or in other tasks. And neither one responds terribly well to being asked to let the worker focus on their task at hand. I think they come to our store at least in part to meet a need to socialize. But, retail isn't really set up to accommodate those needs.

One is an older man, who has an obsession with rule-breaking and punishment. He comes in two or three times a day, and always wants to have the exact same conversation. He pushes that conversation on multiple people during each one of his multiple visits. If we tell him we cannot talk right now, he says okay and then continues with his questions. He sometimes becomes angry if he is informed that we cannot speak with him at that time. He threatens to try to break things or ""fake a heart attack"". And, if he is not indulged, sometimes he will begin huffing/grunting loudly and yelling ""I'm upset and it's all your fault! All your fault!"" The cashiers find this extremely embarrassing and somewhat frightening, depending on the cashier. He also takes pictures of women he finds attractive, sometimes following them around or out of the store. And, allegedly, he once stuck his camera into the ladies' room.

The other is a teenage boy, who also says he understands that we cannot talk, but also persists in attempting to engage. His situation is a bit more sympathetic, he comes to our store to avoid being at home. His father is not at all supportive of his inner life or (possible) gender identity and has little tolerance for his non-standard behaviors. He is usually more or less okay, unless he is happier or angrier than usual. If he wants our attention and we cannot entertain him, he will often approach customers and force his company on them or find open spaces and spin, force loud laughter, or talk angrily to himself, depending. Customers are not thrilled about it. And they tend to avoid the areas where he is, for lack of a better word, playing, so we also lose sales on items in those areas. ",,,4,0,0,

I have been working steadily part time (10-20hrs/week) for about 3 years. About 3 years ago, I tried to go back to work full-time. I have a job that I can do from home and so I thought full-time might be manageable. Unfortunately, it made my health worse so I had to go back to part-time. It was about 3-4 months of full-time work before changing to part time. 

Last year there was a lull in work between April and June. But if it's 1 credit per $1000 earned, then I definitely earned some credits for 2017. This year I look set bring home 2x as much and have worked every month thus far.

1d6593ac-0047-47f0-8c64-207ff1301d56,1537816438,"It seems to me the most important part of claiming disability is having extensive medical records that say you are disabled and can't work, and probably won't get better. 

At the hearing you will be asked about your prior work, your current condition and how it keeps you from working. You will be asked how your condition affects your day to day life. 

My advice is to be HONEST about how this affects you. So many people are used to glossing over their suffering that they do this in the hearings. I was asked ""do you shower every day?"" and my first instinct was to say ""Of course I do!"" The reality is of course I don't, I really only shower a couple times a week and I have to make sure someone is home when I do it and more often than not I end up with a robe on because I don't have the energy to even dry off. Combing my hair can be exhausting so some days (like yesterday) I don't do it. 

Go over every part of your day and describe how you accommodate your disability to live life:

-woke up, had to lay in bed for 20 minutes until I felt well enough to get up  
-went to the bathroom, got dressed, had to lay down for 10 minutes until I felt well enough to make breakfast  
-too tired to make food, just grabbed a string cheese and an apple then ate them sitting reclined in the recliner  
-don't watch tv, can't really pay attention, sometimes I have the news on for background noise.  
-don't read much, can't really focus on the material  
-feed the dog; I keep the food and the bowl right by the door so it is easy to do  
-Take laundry from bedroom to washing machine, then lay down for 20 minutes until I feel well enough to get clothes from dryer
-make lunch, able to get a sandwich and chips together but hardly felt well enough to eat it by the time I'm done.

etc. etc.

Can you work out / read / meet friends / go grocery shopping / eat dinner before/after work so you're not commuting in the middle of rush hour? Is it quiet enough to talk to people and tell them you have a disability? Don't have too much advice here, but as someone who looks like a healthy, strong young  woman (and I am strong, actually, but I can also only stand for a pretty limited amount of time before fainting/etc.), I've had some experiences on public transit.

&amp;#x200B;

One time, a (visibly) disabled man came onto a crowded train with no seats available. There were 6+ disability seats--I was sitting in one--and the other people all looked (admittedly only visibly) healthy. When he came onto the car, one of the women in the disability seats turned to me, glared, and then super passive agressively said she'd get up since I wouldn't before launching into a whole verbal tirade. The disabled guy sat next to me, I explained (kind of shaken) that I had a disability, and he comforted me (not his job, but very thankful). We then continued to talk as the women and surrounding (likely able-bodied people) kept sending me angry looks with the initial woman muttering under her breath. Fun times. What's even funnier is that now, after this experience, I actually avoid the disability seats if others are open, while going into progressively more dangerous faint-inducing territory as I search for any seat as able-bodied people sit happily in disability seats.

&amp;#x200B;

As for asking others to get up? Maybe, if I was braver, or if I had a louder voice (literally, bronchitis and now voice issues for 6 months and public transit is hella loud). If you do have the opportunity to talk or respond, keep your response to 10 words or less and speak it bluntly and confidently. ""I faint if I stand too long"" ""I'm disabled"" (vs. longer medical explanation or diagnosis..) I have however found that a surprisingly large amount of people will stand or not bother sitting when a seat opens up, so if I'm aggressive enough in looking for and taking a seat I tend to get one, even during rush hour when 50+ people are standing in the aisles. I do however do my best to rearrange my work schedule / leaving times to make it easier to find a seat. It also requires me to completely, completely stop caring and embrace that the people around me are going to think I'm an asshole and glare. Frankly, I find it infuriating and much more asshole-ish to jump to judging prior to asking, but I also know it's not about me--everyone is stressed, tired, short on time, and they largely don't have the energy to care and would apologize if we ever sat down and talked. It means I don't get up to offer other people seats, that I'm going to race for seats in a seemingly asshole-ish way, etc. People can give all the dirty looks they want, but their days would be much more disrupted by me fainting on public transit and delaying multiple trains than them having to stand rather than sit an extra 10-15 minutes.

I had an accident 10 years ago and L4-L5 fusion surgery 8 years ago.  I also live in constant pain and take prescribed narcotics for relief along with gabapentin for nerve deadening, muscle relaxers, anti-seizure and anti-depressants.  I also have to take other meds to combat the effects of long term ingestion of morphine.  I can't stand for more than 5-10 minutes without feeling like I'm going to throw up from the pain and I use a cane and wheelchair to get around.  I don't drive because, if I were to get into an accident, it would be my fault due to the meds I take.

My biggest difference is I'm 46.  I applied for disability when I found out that I'd need surgery and be limited for the rest of my life.  I was denied but ended up becoming homeless and living in a shelter during the time that was allowed for an appeal, plus I was just getting ready to have the surgery by the time that process bore out anyway.  After surgery and the onset of recurring pain, I re-filed for disability and this time was living with my brother in another state, so I was able to appeal and won.  Disability was backdated to the date of surgery.

I say all this because, it sounds like you're in the same boat I was (aside from age) right after my surgery.  If you're in the US, I would definitely suggest filing for disability and fighting the inevitable denial.  I didn't have to go through too many hoops on my appeal.

If you need someone to talk to about managing pain, I am happy to lend an ear and mental/emotional support.  Pain is a very rough disability, because each person experiences pain at differing levels.  One person's pain is not the same as the next.  It's also emotionally crippling and very easy to get stuck in a negative feedback cycle that leads to clinical depression.

Also, if you are in the US, you can apply for Medicaid and foodstamps, if you are a minor and living on your own.  It's going to depend on your state's laws.  As far as making money goes, go for something you can tolerate with ease.  Do you have a wheelchair?  Can you stand sitting in it all day?  Some companies, like Wal-mart, will hire people with disabilities as greeters and such.  You'll probably need to be on disability or have a Dr's statement to that effect.",,,2,0,0,

Check out bulletjournal.com for a nice planning system, how to organize your day. (Ignore all the artsy bulletjournals on /r/bulletjournal for now, but you can have a peek there and look at some setups and tracker ideas. Try a few layouts, see what works for you).

 Check /r/ynab and sign up for their trial - this is the time to get really good at personal finance, set yourself a budget and stick to it, set savings goals for PT and college. Read/watch all of the tutorials on the youneedabudget.com website, take notes, then start using it. An envelope based budget system like this really works, it will make you spend less, save more, and their software/app makes it all easy once you get going (it takes a while to get used to, then it's all auto pilot. there are cheaper alternatives but I'm not sure if they're as good, i still use and old version of ynab,, but you  could even do the same in Excel for free if you want to take the time to set it up in Excel).

I do want to have such experiences, but it is very difficult to find suitable partners. I've got a 100% rejection record when it comes to dealing with females. I'm good looking, articulate, educated, and have a very good job at present. Instead of sulking about this, I turn my feelings inward and use it as motivation for further self improvement.

Understand that in today's western society, the woman holds all the power in the relationship. As recently as 20 years ago, rejection was something that was difficult, but could be coped with using some basic mental rationalization techniques. Now, rejection from females is always the ""GET AWAY FROM ME SATAN"" variety, that makes men afraid to approach women, especially when a man's reputation can be wholly destroyed by innuendo, third-person hearsay, and outright lies posted on social media.

If I do approach someone nowadays, I hold zero expectations of anything on their part because females can always ""do better"", based on pressure from their social circle or family.

My parents were medically negligent so I didn't have any written proof of my illness which was difficult for applying. Last month I was diagnosed with LGMD2A.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I applied was when I was 18. I was still able to get up from a chair, bend over, and a couple physical exertion tasks. But not for long. I also couldn't climb stairs anymore though. After applying I went to one of the doctors SSA assigns to you to determine my ""level"" of disability and they determined I was still able to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied again at 20 when I started losing the ability to stand up, walk for long periods of time, etc. I was also denied -- no medical evidence of my illness. I didn't have insurance either to see anyone for medical screenings. I didn't even make it to a disability screening for determination.

&amp;#x200B;

Third time, I was 22 - 23. I went to the county clinic, crying, because I was completely unable to stand by myself anymore and I was swinging my legs. I was in constant pain and couldn't handle it anymore. I couldn't do any physical tasks without assistance. Can't raise my arms anymore. The doctor did a physical and wrote a letter to the social security administration, I applied and was accepted within four months and got back-pay. As soon as I got insurance I started searching for answers. It took me a few years (I'm 26 now) for the official diagnosis.

&amp;#x200B;

They wanted all my medical paperwork from the beginning of any indication from any physicals that could have pointed to my illness -- I gave them what I could. They also asked if my parents were disabled and/or receiving SSI/SSDI. I didn't even have to see a doctor the third time -- they immediately accepted me with the one doctor who wrote them a letter. I remember them commenting on the phone about how I had applied previously and they didn't understand how I wasn't on disability already.

Have you had a look at r/leanfire and r/fatfire? They’re more where you’d find a “manual” for setting up that sort of thing in general.

However, with respect to eventually probably transitioning to SSDI/LTD and protecting your savings, that is really a question for a CPA/financial planner who has experience with that. Things like setting up trusts, etc., are things they can advise you on. 

Also, counting on any disability benefit to be present and consistent is...unrealistic planning. You’d do as well to plan for the worst, hope for the best, and set up as self-sustaining of a system as possible.

If this man interprets refusing to chat as ""making fun of him"" then that's just an unfortunate misunderstanding. If employees are actively making fun of him, then that's a problem.

Employees can be blunt, straightforward, and honest, but they don't have to be patronizing. ""George, I can't chat right now because I only have 30 minutes for lunch."" ""George, I need to finish with this customer before I can help you. You need to wait your turn."" ""George, I can't help you find [item] because I need to stay at the register. I'll have a manager come assist you."" are all appropriate things to say, same with, ""George, you need to be polite/follow the rules/leave the other customers alone or you will have to leave."" 

Employees don't have to allow 'George' to be destructive, invade personal space, or distract them while they're on break, but this also means that expectations need to be clearly communicated and managers need to be proactive and follow through, even if it means saying, ""George, you know you're not allowed to touch employees.

You have the ability to change it to yourself with a doctor's note regardless of what the rep says. 

You can convince the SSA to change your payee early or to you without a doctors note after they've screwed you over completely (girl I knew had an agency payee. They kept paying her rent a day late, after she got evicted because they kept being stupid and wouldn't be able to rent for 7 years and was being forced to move in with her abusive family, they refused to release funds to allow her to move because they needed ""to save it for future rent"" Again, it was *their* actions that made it so it would be impossible for her to rent for *7 years*, and they wanted to refuse to release funds until she was paying rent... The SSA made her her own payee the day before payout with no doctor's letter and gave her her check as an actual check with the next day's date on it so she could have the funds to move right on the first. 

There was initially some trouble with necessary documentation to make my carer my payee, and the rep kept pushing me to take an agency payee. I kept saying no. He was all like ""but you can't have your money without a payee"" and I laughed at him and said I didn't care, I'd gladly wait until we sorted things out, I wasn't having an agency payee. He seemed to think this was immaturity. No, I've just had enough of trusting agencies and bureaucracies and will not let them have certain types of control over me, no matter the cost or consequences. After all I've been through, only I get to choose who has the sorts of powers that allow for abuse.

Emotional support isn’t a task, so the dog just being there for you doesn’t count if it’s a service dog - if you have an anxiety disorder severe enough to be disabling, it would have to do something like pressure therapy or behavior interruption to be a task. I’ve never heard of alerting to a stroke, generally alert behaviors need to be something the person experiences weekly at a minimum. For example my dog alerts to migraines, but I get 2 or 3 a week and we scent trained it.

On a more personal level (and I don’t know much about your illness so I’m sorry if I offend you!) will the inconvenience of taking a dog with you everywhere be outweighed by its helpfulness? Do you need help only for a few weeks/months during the year, or is it more like most of the days in a month? How bad are your bad days, and how often are they? These are things you can be asking yourself and your doctors. Having a service dog can be terrible sometimes. People stare at you, talk to you when you’re feeling ill or just want to run an errand. They pet, distract, and harass you and your dog. In the grocery store on Sunday someone told me “poodles used to be hunting dogs until you women screwed them up!” and proceeded to get in my SD’s face with kissy noises until we walked away. We almost got denied access at a hotel at 1am during an emergency. It can be so hard and frustrating, and if it isn’t worth it - it just isn’t worth it. 

It’s a really tough decision, but if you need the help and feel like it’s your best option then it truly changes your life and independence. I recommend talking with your doctors and with some programs - try looking at the website for Assistance Dogs International. Good luck with everything!!

That being said, Medical Continuing Disability Reviews (CDRs) are becoming more standard. SSA really cut back on CDRs around 2008, and around 2014, Congress attached a mandate to do a lot more of them as a part of SSA’s funding.

Generally, a very small percentage of Medical CDRs find that an individual’s medical condition has improved sufficiently to terminate benefits. That very small percentage more than funds the costs associated with conducting the Medical CDR (at least that’s what SSA says, but I have my doubts). 

The important thing to do is get everything filled out, and respond to any follow-up letters quickly and completely. If you are having trouble getting things completed, there should be a name and phone number for the claims rep handling the CDR. Give him or her a call, and explain that it is taking you longer than you anticipated. You might get the voicemail. That’s pretty normal due to their workload. Generally, if you are making an effort, the representative will cut you an awful lot of slack.

Another thing to consider is that after 24 months of receiving disability, you become eligible for Medicare. If you were getting Medicaid, you may have already gotten your Medicare card in the mail. Many states have a program called Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB). This program pretty much just means that Medicare pays first, and then Medicaid acts like supplemental coverage. It might be easier to find a psychiatrist that accepts Medicare. This is important less for medical records and more important if you felt like your prior psychiatrist was helping you. 

And last but not least, try to not stress out too much about the Medical CDR. I know that’s easier said than done. They are fairly routine.",,,3,0,0,

Disability offices and examiners/hearing officers do not visit schools to get transcripts, nor do they go places and film or take pictures of claimants or beneficiaries. Only fraud units are allowed to do that. At my level, we cannot stalk a claimant or beneficiary on Facebook or any other social media and use that information in our decisions. We can use newspaper articles and letters written by others.

It is hard to speculate how things will go for you, without all your medical records and testimony to look at. I will say that sometimes people look good on paper, but we find out differently at hearings. I have continued a lot of beneficiaries because I can't see them sustaining a 40 hour work week on a continuing basis, when you take all their conditions into account. At the hearing level, I think it actually looks favorable to the beneficiaries when they have tried to do some work and had to stop, or work very part time because it's all they can handle.

I can't tell you what the DHO's decision will be, but we and the ALJs do have a lot more leeway with our decisions than regular examiners, mostly because we don't have to justify our decisions to anybody. We decide what we decide for our own reasons, and that is that. ",,,4,0,0,

My heart goes out to you I  know how tough it can be. Grocery shopping is the absolute worst for me without someone with me to help if everything falls apart. I've been on disability since June.

I use instacart express for fresh fruit and vegetables. They cover aldi in my area so it's pretty cost effective so far. For dry goods, I use Amazon (they have a discounted price for prime for disabled/low income people), target (target redcard debit eliminates shipping cost completely and gives a small immediate discount), and Walmart (free home delivery for orders over 35). Walmart also has a grocery service where they will shop for you and you can come pick it up but I have not tried it yet. I'm also looking into using a service that ships ugly fruit and vegetables to your home for a reduced cost. I'm really excited about that one the most!

Also, I had no idea I'd qualify, but I am recently approved for IHSS. Perhaps you can talk to your doctor about that? They come to you, do an assessment, and see what help you need. Then you have someone who will come help you around the house, to and from appointments, with grocery shopping etc.

Sorry this got so long and I hope this helps!

This isn't exactly true. There is a complete picture of health that is preventing OP from working. All of those issues are important contributors. 

The real issue is if OP's doctors feel that he is disabled. If that is the case and the medical records back it up then there is a good chance. The question is going to be that you have been working with these conditions and now you can't work. Is it because they are getting worse? If so, then maybe you are disabled. ",,,5,0,0,

I’ve had to go through the PIP process twice - once to initially apply and the second time to address a change in circumstance - and each time I’d be brought to tears from having to jump through so many awful, debilitating hoops.

The first time, after submitting a 17 page document, I was told I would receive absolutely nothing. I didn’t qualify, despite being completely unable to walk unaided and requiring assistance with almost all everyday tasks. The letter told me that because I *could* drive, because I *could* squeeze the assessors hands to some degree, and because I *could* walk into the building on crutches on *that particular day*, I evidently didn’t need the assistance that I stated in my application. I sobbed. I sobbed ugly tears, until my father brought me a cup of tea and a slice of cake that was so big I shouldn’t have eaten it all... but I did anyway.

Then I appealed, and I did it in anger. I was so *done* with having to prove myself. I responded to each of the points they listed in the letter, and told them to re-evaluate from my original statement and not from the word of a basic physiotherapist. I won, and got enhanced care and was a single point off of enhanced mobility. 

Two years later, I wanted to be honest with them and told them how my condition had changed. It was worse, by a considerable margin, and I told them about everything in extreme detail. I used the same 17 page document as before, but added in all of the new symptoms and information. They took my funding. I was entitled to nothing. I wasn’t sobbing anymore, I was just numb.

Because my father is an absolute angel, he persuaded me to appeal. So I did, using the same method as before, and within 4 weeks my funding was re-instated. I didn’t get any more than I was on originally, but that wasn’t why I told them of the changes. I just wanted to be honest. 

It’s awful. PIP is designed to help, not to make people feel as though they aren’t going through enough - whether that be emotionally, physically, or mentally.

If he has at least one parent who earned enough social security credits, he may be able to collect SSDI from that record. Depending on the parents income during their career, he may end up collecting more per month. It also eliminates the asset test. It also changes eligibility for government subsidized health insurance (Medicaid and Medicare), which may be better or worse for him. It's definitely worth looking into.

I used to be a pre-school teacher, so I have some pretty well-developed instincts for why people engage in socially unacceptable or disruptive behaviors.

I believe they are both lonely and lack appropriate venues to socialize. One is young with an unsupportive home life. I was informed by my previous boss that he has autism, but obviously that is just hearsay. The other is an older man who is in 2-3 times a day, but in two years I have never seen him with anyone else. I believe they both push past requests to leave the cashiers alone for the same reason hungry people ignore rules about stealing. Socializing is a basic human need, and neither one has the social skills to make friends ""in the wild"". And, while the teen is in an alternative school where he can meet people, the older man might not have anything like that in his life.

But, I have to prevent hungry people from stealing and I have to prevent these two from disrupting my department. I just want to find a way that works. Simple, basic requests have not worked so far. The older man has complained to our boss multiple times that various people was treating him unfairly, making fun of him, and/or talking down to him because they refused to chat with him while working with another customer or while eating lunch. So, I think he does understand, at least in part, that he has the ability to create situations where he can get his own way, because of the implicit power imbalance in a service worker/customer relationship. I just need him to have an understanding and motivation to not manipulate the customer role to enable him to push past appropriate boundaries.",,,2,0,0,

That allows him to do a lot of things he cannot do with his limited wrist function. My wrists are strong enough that I typically don't need those except for something like pull downs. as for dumbbells, you can get some nice foam coates ones with a velcro strap to strap it to the back of your hand. Unfortunately, those only go up to five pounds so I've had to double up on one hand to get the amount of weight that I wanted. Aside from those things, therabands bands are what I rely on the most.

You can also get a trial period in which to try to return to a full time job. It's nine months and if you are unable to continue or have to quit prior you retain your benefits.

T went from yelling as soon as he didn't understand something or getting angry when people wouldn't listen or understand him to maybe 80% of the time T was trying to say it in a different way or explain why he thought that way before he yelled meaning the conflicts T had because he thought differently to others and they didn't understand went from 10-20 times daily to maybe 2

1. Bathrooms. A. Sometimes the door is installed the wrong way. B. There is no room to maneuver. C.There is a trend here in the US to install Adult Changing Tables. D. I have seen motion detector auto-faucets but the paper towels are manual or reverse.

2. Gravel Sucks. Think your car getting stuck in mud.

3. Retailers (grocery, department stores): blocked aisles with widened End Caps, pallets of merchandise, clothing racks with no room to maneuver and lack of employees to assist.

4. Attitude and Behavior: When you are a Server, Cashier, Retailer IF THE PERSON WITH THE DISABILITY IS THE CUSTOMER TALK TO THEM NOT THEIR COMPANION, NOT THE CARE-GIVER. I lost count how many times I would redirect the conversation BACK. 

I have a friend who is blind, with card in hand and retailers STILL look at ME and ask ME how they can help. I literally have guided my friend to the counter and will walk away. OR I have had Serving Staff ASK ME what my c;ient wants to order. I DON'T KNOW ASK HER FOR CRIPES SAKE.

Then there is the way people talk or act towards people with disabilities. I have a friend with spina bifida. He is a grown man who has had strangers be flabbergasted that he GASP - DRIVES! He SHOPS - ON HIS OWN! He has had strangers PAT HIM ON TOP OF HIS HEAD! He has so much fodder, he started doing Stand Up Comedy. (yeh that is one of his jokes).

b6a13fef-aaa1-46ab-929f-f298a524c120,1536616073,"I get the military assumption too. I'm the right age (indeed, I tried to enlist just after 9/11.... and for the next several years, but was consistently turned down for my health). It's a frustrating assumption.

But I totally understand what you're saying; the ideal is that we are allowed to be just regular people, who happen to be disabled. I agree with that, full stop. No addendum. 

But, if a person can't do that, be it for curiosity, or bigotry, or fear, or worry that they'll offend by staring (or not looking), or whatever reason... then I'd rather have people openly ask me over ignoring me. But the ideal is to be just a regular person. It's why I like to do my shopping in the middle of the night - there's many fewer shoppers, and the store employees have often seen me before, and have gotten their stares or questions out of the way.

I think, when we turn people down (I do, sometimes, too - though I more often just say ""my body doesn't work like it should,"" if I'm not in the mood to discuss the various and increasing issues.... then again, I'm not missing limbs, so it's something that people can accept as enough... I would imagine for an amputee, that's  harder for people to swallow) I think when we turn people down, and they look offended, it's probably a couple of emotions: first, that they put themselves out of their comfort zone (to invade ours) in order to ask, and feel slightly affronted, having made themselves somewhat vulnerable; second, it's that they recognize that they may have crossed a line and feel a bit of embarrassment, or shame even.... and the combination of those emotions, no matter how small, can feel like a bucket of ice water for a moment. At least, that's my unqualified psychoanalysis.

I agree with you completely, even if it sounds like I disagree. I don't mean to say that you should just deal with it, at all. I think it's completely natural to be curious, and to want to know.... But I don't think it's natural to assume that *because* one is curious, they have a *right* to know... and I get that frustrating response frequently - almost.... *demands* to know why I need an handicapped sticker, or use a cane.... (""*Because* none of your damn business, that's why!"") I think that each of us needs to decide for ourselves what we are comfortable telling people (if anything), and do that. For me, I'm an exceptionally outgoing and charismatic introvert... :) people like me, and I talk to anyone... but being around people is totally draining. Anyway, that means that I don't have a problem talking with people, trying to help them be comfortable with disabled people to the extent that we can just be a normal part of the society... and I hope that, if enough people will do that, we can help those disabled people who *aren't* prepared or willing to, you know? 

I'm rambling. I agree with you totally, and I hope that my comments feel like a support, rather than a tear down... 'cause that's how they're meant.

Before I became disabled, I identified as a gay transmale with a little bit of panromantic-ness, but my fear of not being able to pass made me live as a female for a while, until I was more medically stable.

It took a while, and now because of the tendency toward conservative ideals and rampant homophobia and transphobia in the blind community, I'm very quiet about being nb. I'm incredibly uneasy around other disabled people when it comes to LGBT stuff because I just expect some of the vile shit I've heard while being stealth and just not correcting people on pronouns.

I started dating my boyfriend about a year and a half after being diagnosed, and I was still stealthing as cishet at the time, so disability and sexuality, at least for me, haven't been super comingled, with the exception of the askreddit thread that got made into multiple articles and used the wrong pronouns for me.

I've definitely felt like I had to choose between nb pan or access when dealing with the very conservative blind organizations and the random people I have to ask for help.

To explain why, I had an employee who got diagnosed with a condition that was probably temporary. This was an employee who was already having performance issues and was being coached by me and HR. This person decided on their own that they would start working from home due to their condition. They ghosted me for like 3 days. I could see they were clocked in but they weren't in the office. I gave them some leeway because, sure, maybe they had hemorrhoids and wanted to avoid embarrassment at work.

1. Don't do round doorknobs. Door handles that you can pull down are typically easier to use for people with poor fine motor control. Automatically opening doors are even better!
2. If the doors don't open automatically, regardless of the type of handle, include a button to open the door. These already exist and can be installed on doors. Include large buttons with the wheelchair symbol on them, near the door that won't be blocked by anything. If possible: one at foot level, one at arms level. Make sure buttons are on both sides of the door (so one can use them to open it from either end) (surprisingly, a lot of places with buttons don't do this at all...)
3. Easily accessible braille signage that won't be blocked if the door opens 
4. Clear visual signage explaining what the door is for (fires!). Make sure that no information is explained by color alone (like maps that use colors to show where things are), because this won't work for anyone who is color blind.
5. If possible in your design, make sure there aren't any steep slopes or ramps. These might make it harder for manual wheelchair users to get in and out.

I think this response is common by people who can’t experience or visually see stuff themselves. It’s the “it’s not effecting me personally, so it must not exist” thing.  And while not always, more often then not, the person doing the invalidation is either close or spot on to being a textbook narcissist. 

I’ve had “friends” in the past give me the same talk you are describing. And always glossed over any issue or suffer I was experiencing because they too got “sad” sometimes, or also “had troubles doing something, but just got over it and did it” or millions of other variations of what I’m trying to say (I’m sure a lot of people on this forum know what I mean, your description pretty much Nailed it as well) 

Oddly enough, and again back to the narcissist part, when ever these people so much as sneeze, it al of a sudden becomes all about them and how awful the sneeze was, and how everyone needs to understand how they almost died because it was such a awful sneeze.  And no one else in the world can compare to feeling so badly because thy have it worse and the world just doesn’t understand them. 

Granted I’m being a tad dramatic by saying sneeze, but in our individual basis’s you can replace sneeze with just about anything and again I’m sure you know a person or two like that, who’s also one of the most invalidating people you know. 

Maybe you are lucky and don’t, I personally wasn’t always assertive enough or supportive of myself even to cut these people off, instead of clinging to a “friendship” I already had vs the scary alternative of trying to make a new one who was more understanding.  


Sorry I’ve kinda rambled on.  Just want to say sorry again, and you are not alone in this invalidation. ",,,1,0,0,

Yes it did.

&gt;\&gt; My lawyer moved states and I had to find 2 other representatives after that. I can't recommend whether you should start over or not, but I will tell you at my last hearing, they told me if I was approved they wouldn't give me all my backpay and shrunk down the amount a lot. So sometimes I wonder if I should have started over and gotten approved sooner but a lawyer would know best.

I'm mulling this over. I'd be ok with them not going back 4 years. To get another lawyer, I'd have to start over. I've talked with one who I really liked. My former firm was ... not very helpful.

I keep going to the same gp. I think I'm having some problems (muscle issues in the shoulders) relating to the statins that my cardio doc insists I take because of high LDL. I've had new fun things come up since the surgery, like my foot going completely to sleep. I'm guessing I'm having  systemic vascular failures around my periphery. I was 'pre-diabetes' for years. So yea all kinds of crap. Might be better I start over and get a new judge. Honestly, though, I'm pretty bothered my her non-empathetic, machine like attitude :P

SSDI as an adult disabled child ends if you get married, and along with it, access to medicare. You still get SSI and medicaid unless your spouse earns too much (and then your just fucked for healthcare unless he earns a ton). Most of the people I know who aren't getting married due to disability, are doing so because their household income would drop from $1000-1200 down to the $736 and they'd have to transition to medicaid from medicare and all the shit that entails (possible disruption of treatment, possible loss of doctors, medicaid insisting on only covering certain meds or only covering certain meds after they've made you try several others, even if you tried them previously and you're doing well on what you're on, etc., etc.)

It's pretty messed up, I know a ton of people who simply can't afford the loss of income or would have major health consequences if they married.

 With an adult you already have someone that has had [30] years to practice being non-autistic so the signs can be somewhat muted. However here's some [info on autism](http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/what-is-autism/): 

&gt;An autistic child’s sensory experience of the world is more intense and chaotic than that of a non-autistic child, and the ongoing task of navigating and integrating that experience thus occupies more of the autistic child’s attention and energy. This means the autistic child has less attention and energy available to focus on the subtleties of social interaction. Difficulty meeting the social expectations of non-autistics often results in social rejection, which further compounds social difficulties and impedes social development.

&gt;Are they going to put me on more meds? 

If you have problems that can be helped with meds it is up to you and your doctor to decide if you want meds. There is no specific med/s for autism. On the other hand autism makes people more prone to PTSD so maybe you need meds for your PTSD?  

 Read more at [this link](http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/what-is-autism/) and know that there are millions of other adult autistics out there that want to know and support you and each other.
The movement to accept autism, ADHD, bipolar, etc. as normal neurological variants is called Neurodiversity. It **does not** mean that they think that people with problems related to those kinds of neurologies should not be helped, including with meds and therapy. It just means we are not diseases or medical problems just because we do not have the current dominant neurology in humans.  ",,,10,0,0,

Unfortunately, my carer pissed him off with the bad joke, and then I got defensive because I thought he was calling me stupid when supposedly he was just saying I seemed immature, and then got stubborn because there was absolutely no way I would agree to an agency as my payee. He saw this as even more immaturity, because he didn't understand that due to my experiences, I have radically different priorities than most people, and would not accept the control of someone I didn't trust, even if it meant death, let alone just a short delay in getting money. We'd been surviving off the $9 and foodstamps for almost a year, another couple days while we got the correct documentation was nothing. This led him to conclude that he couldn't release the funds to me because I was ""too immature"". 

We left without arranging a payee because I continued to refuse an agency, and returned the next day with the correct documentation. He was pissed about having to make my carer my payee, and seemed to doubt the authenticity of the documents, but they checked out and he couldn't refuse to make him my payee. We saw him gesturing and talking with two or three other employees for a VERY LONG time, and he disappeared long enough to have had the documents examined for authenticity by multiple methods before finally sending someone else to have me sign the papers to make my carer my payee while he made odd faces (I'm not going to attempt to guess what his expression meant, but he certainly wasn't *happy*) in the background.

Edit: to clarify my point about not already having a manual wheelchair and SmartDrive - while they do have an attachment to work with folding frame manual wheelchairs, I’ve gotten mixed reviews about how well it works.

Each airline has similar policies with some differences, when you book your flights there is usually a prompt asking if you require 'specific assistance' and asking for the pertinent information. There should also be an option to read their accessibility information which should give you details about whether you need to pre arrange to have a wheelchair available to and from the plane.
Over here its a case of selecting from a few diffent options depending on whether you require the wheelchair to get to the base of the steps to board the plane, are unable to climb/descend the steps (so you use a wheelchair lift thingy) or whether you need wheelchair assistance onto the plane and to your seat. Generally I've found staff to be really good with one or two individual exceptions. Like the woman to took offence to the fact that I wanted to take take my personal wheelchair through security rather than check it at the desk. She spent longer arguing with me about how long it would take to ask security if it was ok than it did for her to actually ask them. She didnt appreciate me telling her that if she took the chair then she'd have to find someone to push me around in an aisle chair because my legs dont work well.

 As far as your walker goes when you check in you can get a 'gate check' tag on it so that it will be brought to you at the plane door rather than having to go and collect in the main baggage area, this may or may not be useful if your using an airport wheelchair, but probably a good idea incase there isn't a chair available when you get off the plane.

Over here atleast you are also required to check in earlier than the 'regular' passengers, you board the plane first and exit last. If you have questions about specifics best bet is to contact the airline and ask them. I've also taken to keeping dated copies of any information you've provided them re your requirements in my carry on in case of a situation like the one above.

I think that's probably the best advice I can give.  Don't stop learning and find joy in the little things.  I, personally, find things to do on the internet, play video games, follow NFL football and play in a few fantasy leagues every year.  I enjoy watching videos on glassblowing and blacksmithing as well as machine shop kind of things.  I find those very interesting and like to see the creation process.  Idle games and incremental games are good for quick pick me ups.  They're something I can play for a little while until the pain gets to be too much and I lose concentration.  Then I can go back to them again sometime later and reap the earnings I gained while I was dealing with my issues.

Your life is worth it.  You are a unique and special person and mean something to everyone in your life.  Don't lose hope.

Remember, when Pandora opened the box and unleashed all the woes upon mankind, the last thing left at the very bottom of the box was hope.",,,7,0,0,

Then your earning potential is considered to be fixed at your benefit amount. They can't impute earnings because you have been found incapable of work by a court, so there's a res judicata issue in telling you to get a job.

b146d141-e209-4b54-bd30-2f70f6c4b0f1,1536468876,"My grandparents co-founded the Holocaust Museum Foundation.

What they did was start small.  Very small.  It was a 3000 sq foot building on a street corner in Skokie. 

They built up programming and started collecting artifacts.  They slowly discovered how to tell the story effectively.  It really started as a place for survivors to gather and document their stories.  

That turned out to be one of the biggest and most enduring missions of the Foundation, to document as many individual stories as possible while they were still here.  That could be one place to begin.  

Theoretically, wouldn't a virtual museum serve that purpose until there's enough momentum for a physical space for people to gather and for programming to take place? 

Another theoretical question; the Holocaust Museum started in Skokie, a quiet suburb of Chicago, because it had the greatest concentration of Survivors in America.  What would be an equivalent geographical location in the American disability community?",,,5,0,0,

I’m a bit fuzzy on specific numbers, but the way that SSI earned income reductions are calculated, the intent is to encourage working. 

For example, there’s a $20 exemption per month for any income and a $65 exemption per month for earned income. Your SSI benefit gets reduced by half of what is left. 

If you earn $400 in a month, the first $85 ($20 + $65) doesn’t have any effect. For the remaining $315, half of that would be deducted from your SSI benefit (about $158). This means that earning $400 in wages gets you an additional $242 per month. You then have to figure in all the other taxes. 

Maybe it is worth it, maybe not. The important thing is to contact you Title 16 Post Entitlement Representative to make sure you get all the correct information from the official source. It can be a pain to report the wages, but not reporting them means that you’ll have to repay any benefits that were overpaid. ",,,7,0,0,

Emotional support animals can be prescribed by your doctor or therapist, no training or registration or anything is required.

A service dog can be trained by you to perform a task that relates to your disability. Or you can purchase/be gifted one from a trainer. Trainers are going to have their own rules about who they will work with. Training a dog to sense a stroke (if even possible) is probably going to be very difficult and a rare find. Training a dog to assist during a ""pain crisis"" is probably more achievable, dogs have been trained to bring a phone, pull their owner into the recovery position, bring medications, get help from others, or other tasks. That level of training is probably best done by someone with experience and will probably be expensive.

96d24f44-58cc-4bb1-9887-b7d9d7f1b331,1537255275,"1) Autism isn't a mental illness, it's a neurological wiring difference. It isn't medicatable. Some comorbid conditions may be medicatable, but the wiring differences make medicating autistic people difficult and dangerous, because the medications may have completely unpredictable effects and side effects in our differently wired brains. If someone tries to medicate your autism, run. If someone tries to medicate a comorbid condition like anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, etc. keep in mind that the expected effects of a particular med on a nonautistic brain is NOT necessarily the effects that will have on you, and to be extra-extra cautious with medicating. In some cases, a combination of severe and unpredictable effects and sensory difficulties with interoception (the sense that tells you things going on with your body like hunger, thirst, temperature, pain, etc.) make medication a nonviable solution, even if medication would typically be used to successfully treat a particular comorbid. I have anxiety and PTSD, but it's not a viable or reasonable thing to pursue medications given the severity of my reactions, even if one might eventually prove helpful.  I was misdiagnosed as bipolar and mismedicated as a kid/teen and I've never fully recovered from a decade of mismedication (it's one of the two most common misdiagnosis for verbal girls. It is possible to have both bipolar and autism, but it's super common for underinformed psychiatrists to mistake autism in verbal girls for bipolar.)

2) Autism is a wiring difference and a neurodevelopmental disorder. During initial synapse growth in the womb, our synapses over grow even more than nonautistics', then during the 18-36 month synapse die off, ours die off randomly leaving a jumbled mess of criss crossed wiring. 

These wiring differences cause sensory and cognitive processing differences, all of how you think, and feel. This in turn can lead to the behaviors that people commonly refer to as ""autism"". Or not, because it's not a set of symptoms or behaviors, it's a different kind of brain, and like non-autistic humans, we autistic humans learn, grow, develop coping skills and don't always behave in the same ways we did at 3 years old. 

This makes diagnosing verbal autistics, female autistics, abuse-survivor autistics, adult autistics, etc. fairly difficult because the ""signs"" are all in *how* you think and process and *why* you do things how you do, not in what you do. The best professional for identifying autism is a neuropsych. Psychologists are sometimes ok, psychiatrists typically have a much harder time, because it's not a easy ""symptom checklist"" situation, the behaviors of an adult autistic with learned coping skills can be identical to the behavior of other disorders if only the behaviors are observed and not the why behind them. 

As for the rest of the information you need, other people have already made better comments. Good luck!",,,6,0,0,

* Fucking crazy
* That's retarded
* You're so stupid
* That's really autistic
* You're insane
* The economy has become crippled by debt
* Look at that spaz
* Are you blind??
* Only a moron would believe that
* Do you need help? (vs. Do you want help?)

Then I'd mention something about how 

* Ableist language is harmful over time. It's like ignoring a ""Please don't walk on the grass"" sign, a mostly harmless act, except you're walking on someone's soul. (Too dramatic?). 
* I was taught that spaz, retard and autistic are slurs, but I had to learn (and learn to understand) how the others harm. 
* The hardest part was to accept that my knee-jerk justification for their usage is ultimately bad because they don't hold water against the argument for how they are harmful. 

Approaching proper language as a philosophy, as opposed to a practice, is really working against it: 

A practice is something that you will occasionally screw up, but that's fine, because you're working on it every day. If you screw up a philosophy — like a religion — you have exhibited some form of moral failing. A slip-up becomes a sin.

News articles would often feature service dogs helping the blind or those in wheelchairs because that makes for visually-significant TV in the eyes of whoever decides what stories to run.

For Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), any other income that isn’t wages or net earnings from self employment doesn’t affect your eligibility. SSA won’t even know about it. 

Quick PSA, though: If you use a tax preparer that recommends declaring self-employment income in order to take advantage of the Earned Income Tax Credit, run away from that tax preparer. First, this is tax fraud. Second, that self-employment will be reported to SSA, and then you would have to explain why you declared that you worked for IRS purposes but not SSA Purposes.

I have heart disease and also can get severe panic attacks, and ended up training a rabbit on my own time to respond to these situations. If my heart rate increases significantly (or if there are irregularities), he will jump at my leg and get me to sit down to reduce my heart rate and my chance of falling down. He will also jump around in my lap and lick me endlessly for long periods of time to calm me. Even if I accidentally nudge him many times with my foot in a panic pacing around, he will adamantly keep jumping at me to sit. He can perform basic tasks that dogs do, like come, sit, lay down, and has impeccable litter training. He has demonstrated zero aggression towards humans.

Unfortunately, because he is not a dog, he cannot be licensed as a service animal, and thus I cannot bring him to many places as an ESA (I really wish these laws were changed to include more species, but unfortunately, disability rights are always a struggle). I have definitely heard of dogs doing the same task, which is what motivated me to train him this way. It has truly helped me return back to the everyday work in life.

The way I look at it, we were already autistic and now we have a word for it and a way to connect to people who run on the same operating system. I would recommend spending some time reading stuff from the ASAN like a lot of the other people mentioned and interacting with other autistic adults. It’s so much easier to connect to autistic people and so refreshing to realize there are other people who think in the same processes that you do and there are people just as excited about their hobbies as you are.

Also protip: look for the autistIC and not the autisM community. The autism community is parents of autistic kids and because of that focuses on it from an outside perspective and won’t be of much use if you want living tips or insight into something. The autistic community is for autistic people and has an inside perspective and will have better insight for you.

Edit: also not much changed in my mental health care or treatment after my diagnosis. It helped me make lifestyle changes so I could go from 7 different mental health meds down to two though!

The disability system is made for people who are too sick/incapacitated to work. To have a job, you need reliable health, so you can go to work each day and trust you are well enough to complete your tasks. 

Many conditions, like ME and POTS, are different from day to day. I spent 4 years bedridden, unable to even sit up in bed. I could not bathe, I got bedsores. I could not feed myself so I ate one meal per day when my spouse got home. I could not get to the bathroom, so I didn't drink all day until my spouse got home to help me. 

But through that, especially in the first two years, there were days when I could sit up. There were days I could walk. There were days I was almost normal. And my health degraded for three years before I even got to that point. I worked three years through degrading health, and only left because I literally collapsed at work and almost had an ambulance called. 

I saw a physical therapist when I was very ill. But our system of disability is very strict. POTS and CFS/ME are not conditions on the automatic approval list because they are very rare, and because they are not well known and there is not established treatment for them. Doctors are made uncomfortable by diseases that they can't understand, so they mostly just try not to think about them. 

It is very difficult to get on social security for a condition that no one knows about. The process is much harder than for a condition that is well known. And the disability review process is not built for people who are different day to day-- even though being unable to know if you can or cannot go to work guarantees you won't get a job or will lose one as soon as you do. 

Literally everyone who is experienced with the social security disability process understands that it is imperfect, and you have to work with it instead of against it. The advice I am giving is advice that I got from disability lawyers (such as NOLO), doctors who work with disabled people and have helped them.get approved before, and other disabled people with chronic illnesses who know how the system works and how it fails. 

If you are not disabled, skipping a meal or not sleeping well is not going to make you disabled. It is certainly not going to make you sick enough not to work. Only someone who is already extremely sick is going to have a substantial change in these circumstances. 

One of the biggest challenges for doctors treating symptoms is when a patient comes in and the symptoms aren't presenting that day. It is very common for doctors of chronically ill patients to ask then to get tests done on ""bad days"" to make sure the test is accurate. (For example, when testing for MCAS, often folks need to do the test multiple times because mast cells weren't acting up the first time and weren't releasing the inappropriate chemicals to show up on the test.)

Anyone who thinks that a disabled person who has to manage their symptoms to exist in this life and be taken seriously and get life-saving care is a faker is woefully uneducated on the real lives of disabled and chronically ill people, as well as the social frameworks that *should* support them without having to do all this extra work. 

Most people who are chronically ill do not have perfect television illnesses that are the same every day, easy to test for, with clearly visible symptoms. That is a fairy tale sold by the media and by ableist ""pull yourself up by your bootsraps"" cultural norms and does not reflect how things work in the real world. ",,,2,0,0,
