adf46e8d-fcdc-45f9-af4d-0a70170b8dd4,1516419367,"I recently got my 1st wheelchair so I’m looking at this more from an educator’s side as I taught 1st grade for 7 yrs. one yr I had a student with an aide. She has C.P. no wheelchair, but needed some help. The aide was just a part of our classroom and the kids all knew her and were allowed to ask her for help if she wasn’t needed by the student. She was there to make sure the student didn’t fall and also for bathroom time. 

During lunch our tables get full as well. The aide would sometimes sit at the table, but as the student had friends who could help her open things the aide started standing by the lunchroom monitor and just kept an eye on the student. As long as she kept an eye on the student she was ok to help other kids open things and excuse them from the table. This was something she asked the mom, the principal and our district 504 person about because those are the people directly involved with that. 

So, if the person who pointed it out is over you, I’d ask the parent what their thoughts were (in writing). This doesn’t sound like the case, and as with almost every school there are most people trying to tell others how to do their job better or looking for a reason to complain. So...I’d ask your supervisor their thoughts. Tell them the situation and ask them what they would like you to do. One thing that was so helpful for the aide &amp; my student was they had a notebook that went back and forth between home and school every day. It stayed in the backpack and it was a way for mom to communicate with the aide. Most of the time there were just a sentence or 2 w/any questions, something the aide saw (good/bad), and also how the child was socially fitting in. Not naming names if other kids, but saying if she had others playing w/her, etc.

It's like you said, when I get down to it eating this way isn't so bad and it's doable. 

Basically, I made a list of things I could eat at restaurants, quick prep things I had in my freezer (frozen food or prepared by me and frozen) to make it easy to eat safe, and then just ate the same things on rotation until it was eventually habit. The important thing is to make it really, really easy to eat safe or semi-safe. Try to avoid ""oh and I'll also cook elaborate meals constantly"" style planning. I still slip up a lot but I am usually eating within the framework of safe food with only occasional slip ups so I'm okay with it. 

Have a semi-safe treat food, too. Chocolate isn't great for me, but it's not as bad as if I caved and had cornbread, for instance. So having some chocolate on hand to satisfy cravings helps me. It's all about harm reduction and training the people around you so they don't make it harder on you too with their comments. And it's easier to replace a bad habit of caving with a different habit instead of trying to just do nothing and not eat it while you think about it still. 

Edit:
Oh and oddly enough adding in vitamin gummies helped me because it reduced my cravings. Often when we crave something it's because we need some nutrient, so I'll take a gummy when I have a craving too. Or if I'm craving something salty, I will (this is gross but it works) literally pour some salt into my mouth and wash it down. I need a lot of salt because I have POTS. ",,,3,0,0,

I semi-hopefully try the Next Thing that they have said might help my condition, fully aware it might do nothing for me or may make me feel worse for that day. Suddenly though, things are WAYYY BETTER. I am over the MOON. I tell the nearest person. Then I sit down and cry, suddenly sad and grieving how hard it was before, not knowing this treatment was available, and how hard it was now that I know how easy it is now. Eventually I bounce back to OVER THE MOON and try not to reassess my entire schedule but I'm usually planning in an extra hour of stuff in my head, hopeful I'll now get an extra hour of energy a day. This isn't always true but sometimes I do get to add more in and feel more full and rich in life again. I'm extremely grateful for three weeks, and then I go back to just living and trying to tackle the rest of my conditions. On to the next challenge, except every now and then I notice how good or easy something is now and point out how nice that thing is to someone else, which is people's favorite part about me. 

Examples: 
I had brain degeneration due to Lyme disease, mast cell problems, and lack of b12. Couldn't see colors anymore really, quite faded, little energy. I did 2 B12 shots and BAM. World is in full color and I have twice the energy as before. Giddy! Get home and cry. Giddy! I still point out how red or blue things are to people. How green the trees. How nice to frolic like a kid through the fields with the energy to move and the ability to see. 

I discovered I had mast cell activation syndrome and dubiously tried Gastrochrom to stabilize them. BAM. Start crying about how I'm finally able to taste how good cupcakes are again without being horribly ill and actually everything does taste better. More energy. More presence. Less dissociation. More meaning and food and taste in my life. I'm always feeding people good food and appreciating people's presence now I'm more aware of it. 

Suddenly realize I'm having emotional flashbacks while trying to explain my odd behavior to my boyfriend. Label it to him. Bam, understanding instead of fear. Oh, it's cptsd probably, bam, actual treatment tailored for me via Pete walkers book. Crying mainly over how shitty I feel about being out of control with my trauma reactions in the past but am hopeful I can now relate better to people and understand myself better.

Certainly Steven Hawking has some physical weakness, but it would be ridiculous to call him an invalid. The man is more capable than all of us on this thread together.

- eyegaze. Take a look at the Tobii range of cameras for developers. Now work in Windows 10 as mouse input devices. 
- head mouse. Google smartnav or orin headmouse nano. Theres also some software based tools which are free eg http://eviacam.crea-si.com

- rollerball. A rollerball is an upside down mouse (with ball rather than laser!). A big heavy ball can sometimes help. Logitech do some decent ones.

So, the major pushback he has mentioned is ""What if they need a scene where the actor does something  physical that a person with a disability can't do? Like before they were disabled or with the power of magic or something."" To that, I have to respond that A) if you are writing a disabled character that an actual disabled person can't play, you didn't write them very well!! And B) stunt doubles, practical effects, and CGI are all viable options to get around that issue. 

But there's a bigger issue that bugs me about this and it's that, like, imagine if we suddenly went back to men playing all the roles, like in Shakespearean times. Blackface for black characters. White people as Native Americans or ancient Egyptians. It's the same issue: people with disabilities don't have the same opportunities in film and TV, in the same way that women and minorities didn't for ages. 

Proper representation is important for the growth of culture and it influences the way the population perceives certain groups, not to mention the personal influence of young children seeing themselves represented in media. Think about how Whoopi Goldberg saw a black woman on TV in a respectable role (Uhura in Star Trek, I wish I could remember the actress' name) and it inspired her and influenced her entire career. On top of that, it's not fair or right to deny work in the film/TV industry to disabled people, who account for 1% of the actors playing the 1% of roles made for them. That means that out of every 100 roles created, 1 will be a disabled character. And our of 100 people who play disabled characters, 1 will be disabled. ",,,10,0,0,

Waking up with all your things still there in the morning is a good first step towards establishing self-sufficiency and avoiding homelessness.

Vocational rehabilitation departments are overall useless.  I had been a client of my city's for five long years.  Have taken the initiative with applications, resumes, and following up on interviews, whereas counselor did literally nothing other than send me wrong e-mails meant for other clients or irrelevant job postings that are completely out of my league of abilities.  When I collated our e-mail correspondence into a PDF and sent it to his supervisor along with a scathing deconstruction of my caseworker's inabilities, the supervisor filed a false police report claiming that I stated to commit suicide in an attempt to place me on a 72-hour involuntary hold.  Luckily, the responding officer arrived at the library from where I sent the PDF and immediately saw through the bullshit, compared the restraining attempt to his own experience of being DDOSed after posting something related to his job on his social media profile, and our interaction concluded in less than three minutes.

Free legal aide are similarly useless.  Not only would they not help with the scenario depicted in the previous paragraph, but they also were useless when I somehow managed to finally finagle a job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, where I experienced constructive dismissal and a hostile work environment.  Since there are no legal definitions to quantify these, I had no choice but to hang in there while desperately applying anywhere else until I was finally let go for not submitting an RMA form that I actually did.  Ended up homeless.

I've accompanied other homeless disabled people who had utilized remote learning programs from the library.  I sat with a blind man and helped him with his economics course so he could take his series 7 test and become a stockbroker.  He got his degree and aced the test, from which I understand is a Big Deal™, but as of this post he is still homeless and social security is garnishing his benefits for overpayment because how dare he use financial aid.  Department of voc rehab had failed him in the past as well.  He had a dream to enter a certain vocation, and literally no one wanted to help him achieve it.  Good news is, they did give him a free iPhone 4 so he could use the VoiceOver feature to help him navigate the web outside of the library.  Bad news is, no one had told him to ignore the iOS updates and his iPhone had lasted all of six months.

There are no advocacy groups in America that will help a disabled person keep their job or achieve affordable housing.  After experiencing a long wait list at every subsidized housing program, I myself have approached multiple Habitats for Humanity groups with propositions outlining how much I receive in disability benefits and how I would be able to afford to gladly repay them more than half of my monthly check for their kindness and effort in helping me achieve a safe, private place to live where I wouldn't have my stuff stolen or self molested and to have a home address that I can proudly put onto job applications and resumes.  They would always stammer out some excuse about how I had to apply elsewhere because they only did referrals, or there's a long wait list, or some other bureaucratic bullshit.  With regards to finding jobs, one would think that would be the whole point of the aforementioned departments of vocational rehabilitation...except in the cases of the other disabled homeless that I'd helped and myself, having a caseworker who would put in as much effort for me as I did for that homeless blind guy is as much of a Hollywood fantasy as ""the guy getting the girl after much creepy persistent stalking"".  The only resources available are some of the band-aid fixes you'd mentioned:  Food stamps, low-income cell phones, food banks...all good for people who are ""on the go"" because they don't have a place of their own to call their home.  Because how could one afford a place to live, with electricity and gas for heating and cooking, plus food and toiletries, wheelchair maintenance, along with public transportation to job interviews and keeping your suit pressed and dry-cleaned, and following the /r/personalfinance advice of accumulating an emergency savings fund, on just $910 a month?  Even the blind guy that I helped had to pay $50 out of his own pocket for a new folding white cane from Amazon because there were no local National Federation for the Blind offices that had any canes or tips to give out.

That being said, I will give props to Adult Protective Services.  I currently live in a group home with other disabled people, except it's really a woman's house that barely qualified for its nursing home license and since she has access to our disability checks, she could care less about policing our behavior and boundaries.  For all intents and purposes, she's a cat lady who just so happened to have cats that came with child support.  While Adult Protective Services workers cannot heroically stand between me and my housemates to prevent me from being pinched or felt up or stolen from, they were kind enough to throw a couple of $10 Food4Less certificates my way after they saw the horrible state that the kitchen was in.

If a person does not meet/equal a listing, then the evaluation continues to steps 4 and 5.

In my experience, step 5 grants are MUCH more common than step 3.

The speed to first payment depends on your local SSA office. Keep an eye on your mailbox for a ""Notice of Award"" which will break down backpay and monthly payments. From my experience, many of my clients received their backpay even prior to receiving the Notice of Award. If you still don't have a Notice of Award within 60 days, contact your representative. 

For the continuing disability review, it may happen in two years or may take even longer given SSA's budget issues. The review entails contacting you and possibly reviewing updated medical evidence to determine whether your conditions have changed at all - for example, if a person with spinal problems had a surgery which fixed their symptoms. They'll also review your earnings record to see if you've worked at all since the determination.

I realize I said ""state resources"" - it's been 11 years but I really do recall that being in there. That resources we're minimal and that at my age I would be paid for too long. I think it may have been that the state *office* decided that the payouts would be for too long. I remember being incredibly upset the first time and mentioning in my appeal that this was blatant discrimination but the appeal letter denial was very similar. 

It is... Incredibly, Overwhelmingly difficult... To not become physically sick with anger when I think about the denial letters. They basically just straight up told me 'you're not worth enough to bother"" but couched in financial and age terms. 

I do plan to get copies of both previous denials and use them when I finally get to a hearing (in three years, most likely) if for no other reason than to completely (politely) rip the state a new asshole over how they utterly dismissed me and an my obvious need in favor of money.

The hearing will most likely be in a glorified conference room. You won't be on a ""stand"" and it's going to be nothing like whatever courtroom drama you're imaging. You'll probably sit at the opposite end of a large-ish table facing the judge with your rep sitting next to you. There will usually be a vocational expert (job expert) in attendance but this person could appear via telephone. There may also be a medical expert (much less common). Most judges try to maintain a relaxed atmosphere because it helps the claimant (that's you) give better testimony. 

You'll usually start off answering some questions from the judge about your vitals (name, SSN, age, residence) and then go through your employment history (including possible ""off the books"" jobs like babysitting). After that, you'll start talking about what is preventing you from maintaining full-time work. Everyone involved has probably been doing this for a long time and has probably seen people much worse off than you so you shouldn't feel embarrassed giving honest testimony (I realize that may be difficult depending on the severity of your condition, nevertheless... ). 

The point of the hearing is for the judge to ascertain what you deal with on an everyday basis. Therefore, it's my opinion that you should follow your doctor's orders concerning medication. Most judges are very sensitive to claimants who seem to be exaggerating their symptoms. Again, the judge presiding over your case has probably seen hundreds of anxiety cases. You'll talk about everyday situations: going to the store, driving, interacting with people, how you spend your time, hobbies, etc.

Honesty is absolutely the most important policy. Again, this is probably no one's first rodeo (except you). The judge will most likely have read your medical files and will have an idea about what to expect concerning your behavior and symptoms. 

After you've talked about how your condition is affecting your daily life, your portion of the hearing is over. Your rep, the judge, and the vocational expert will talk about how certain limitations would affect a hypothetical person in various vocational capacities. The whole thing shouldn't last any longer than an hour.",,,5,0,0,

Mine was Liberty Mutual. They called my rheumatologist out of the blue and she responded to them - that I could return to work - without even looking at my chart.  I had only seen her once or twice at that point, just enough for her to diagnose my Chronic Fatigue syndrome - there was no physician-patient relationship at that point, so she had no idea who they were even asking about. They have her on tape saying this. When I asked her about it, she  denied even saying it.  By then, it is too late. There is no appeal, because they have her on tape. Of course, ""returning to work"" was a joke at that point, because the employee is terminated from the company at the end of Short Term Disability ( paid by the company) when Long Term Disability ( paid by Liberty Mutual) starts.  There is no job to go back to.  I was too sick to work, anyway, as demonstrated by the fact that I was awarded SSDI. The start date of my benefits was after Liberty Mutual stopped payments so, in my case, there was no overlap.  

Oh and one more thing - when they stop paying, there is no warning. You just get a letter in the mail and boom, no income.  With two preteen children and so very sick, I had to find a way to survive with no income. The rest of that year - from February to October - was a wasteland.

Thank you.  I feel like I would definitely feel very uncomfortable about having that sort of conversation, especially as a way of people first being introduced to me.

I typically answer that I do not want to disclose this information. I understand that it says they are looking to hire persons with disabilities but I guess I am afraid of having a conversation about depression/migraines/breathing -- of either not being taken seriously about it or of being taken too seriously and then being considered a liability. Do you know what happens if I press, ""Yes, I have or have had a disability?""

Should I just say yes and then, if anyone asks about it, just mention I was previously diagnosed with major depression but do not consider myself to be depressed any longer? And then just not mention that I have other chronic health problems unless it becomes a problem at work?

I found on YouTube trichjournal, an account run by an artist who also goes by BeckieJBrown on multiple accounts, who has trichotillomania. From some of her videos she has done interviews with other active social media users who are disabled so I found more through her. She has also tackled taboo subjects like sex and disability, and mental health and dating etc well.

You may find you have to actively search out candidates differently than those in humans of ny, as mental illness and invisible illness will obviously be harder to identify, and some people may be housebound etc. I found really interesting talks on disability by Maysoon Zayid and Stella Young, which started as Ted talks but then I found other work. The Last Leg is a great show that covers politics and sometimes covers disability, and two of the three comedian hosts are disabled, the stand up of one host (Adam Hills) recently has covered disability in more detail. 

For me, I found the most frank and open discussions, and generally found more people online in specific chat groups, e.g. for arthritis etc. And through volunteer initiatives such as EnableMe and RUILS, which are both awareness indicative in schools (I am in the UK but I am sure this happens in lots of places).

I first started using a wheelchair when I was in college, and there was one set of double doors on campus that was a pain in the butt to manage. They were heavy and narrow - I had to open *both* doors to fit my wheelchair through, and I could only open them by holding onto the handles of *both* doors at the same time (basically bracing myself against one while I opened the other, and vice versa).

So one day, I'm wheeling up to this building, and a nice young man decides to help me with the doors. He opens one door and motions for me to go through. But of course my wheelchair doesn't fit. And I can't open the second door myself, because he's holding the first one open, and there's nothing for me to brace myself against. 

So I just kind of sit there awkwardly, trying to figure out what to do. Meanwhile, this guy realizes the problem, and goes to open the second door. But there's only one way to hold open *both* halves of a double door at the same time... 

Basically, he ends up standing smack dab in the middle of the doorway, holding one door open with his right hand, and the other with his left. (Kind of like [this](https://thedisciplemaker.org/wp-content/uploads/lightstock_145449_medium_david.jpg).)

It took a second, because he looked absolutely hilarious and I was trying really hard not to laugh - but I eventually just thanked him for trying to help, had him move out of the way, and then opened the doors myself.

I've looked into my available options in regards to education,there isn't anything that appeals to me which would provide a degree that's useful in the job market,that and we work with a point system and I've exhausted half of mine with previous attempts (you can buy extra points but I don't have the funds for it) 

In regards to moving for education &amp; work, i'm in a bit of a catch 22 due to my lack of points,a state funded grant requires you to have full ""starting"" points,which I don't have. It's a bit of a complicated situation. Relocating just for work would be impossible with an entry level job due to rent pricing &amp; bills (the cities with the most work available have the highest rent)

There was a Coca-cola contest for torch bearers, and once you got past the first contest by entering a draw (there was a widget you could download to your desktop and enter daily), you were asked to make a commitment about athleticism, the community, the environment, etc. 

My own was to say that I would walk on my own, the 500 meters with the torch, without my cane. 

They called and asked me if I'd be okay to do it in Virden MB, not Winnipeg. I said sure, of course! and spent the next couple months practicing walking around my house holding one of my old crutches up - i mean, do you have a good torch substitute lying around your house? 

Now when I made this commitment, it was June or so. 

I did not think about the fact the torch relay was January. 

On the open prairie. 

In the early morning. 

In -30C. 

But I ended up managing the walk just fine, probably mostly on adrenaline and with the assistance of a very well snow plowed and sanded main street. They had a number of Indigenous youth follow the torch the whole torch relay, and the guy who was there in Virden carrying my cane in case I needed it. I didn't - but I did need one of the RCMP officers to warn me I was about to set my hair on fire...twice. (There was wind, okay!)

It was an amazing experience and the whole town came out. There was this pancake breakfast after the relay and there was a big line outside because the hall was packed to capacity. When they introduced us torchbearers, I got a standing ovation when they realized what I was dealing with, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome...and that this was the one time I'd managed to walk on my own in years. 

One of the highlights of the day wasn't something I did actually - it was the mother of someone else with CRPS coming up to my mom, saying she'd never met anyone else (related to someone) with CRPS, that she thought she and her son were all on her own, etc. I didn't get a chance to talk to her for more than a second because I was kind of mobbed with people wanting photos etc, but I know she and my mom had a really good talk.

Your story is really interesting to me because the diagnosis that makes the most sense, in my case, is “chronic pain syndrome,” which is exactly as specific as it sounds. �� Essentially I had an acute condition that went severely undertreated for nearly a year, and the pain damaged my central nervous system. It’s very similar to phantom pain, only I’ve never lost a limb. 

The waking up feeling is eerie. I recently did a trial for a spinal cord stimulator, and it took away maybe 80% of my pain. I’ll never forget waking up in the morning having actually slept well, and my first thought was not “Owww where are my pills?” I realized I haven’t slept well in literally 12 years, and I’ve been awoken by pain every morning during that time. To finally sleep well and not be in agony on waking.... I can’t really describe how amazing that felt. 

The validation thing is so important. I’m anxiously awaiting my permanent stimulator—16 days!!—and I’m hoping for some of that validation afterward too. 

I can also kind of relate to having faced down a challenge. I got myself out of a terribly abusive marriage 5 years ago. I’ve had to do a lot of healing, but that awesome feeling has definitely been around. Sometimes it’s overwhelmed by grief or regret but I try to stay focused on the positive, as much as I can.

This can mean a pretty large amount must be paid when you file your 2018 taxes.  If you do not file they will begin garnishing your disability check.

One way to get around this is to claim insolvency if you qualify.  Calculate your debt including student loans then minus your assets to determine if you are insolvent for some or all the amount.

An example:
Person A discharged 50k in student loans in 2018.  He then received a tax form for the 50k discharged loans in January 2019.  He must then file his taxes with the 50k counting as income for 2018.  If that was his only income then he would have to pay $9,057 to the IRS.  If he fails to pay or file his taxes the IRS will begin to garnish his disability payments until it is paid plus interest and fees.

Person A decides to claim insolvency.  They add all there debt including the $50k student loans as well as $5k in credit cards for a total of $55k in total debt.  They then add there assets.  Lets assume this is $10k in the bank and car worth $5k.

55k - 15k means Person A is insolvent by 40k.  This means instead of paying taxes on 50k they only pay taxes on 15k.

Because of what I was going through beforehand, losing the leg was easy. There was a reflex-nerve component to the pain (according to one doc anyway), which meant that there was a chance amputating the leg wouldn't have stopped the pain, and that woulda been pretty catastrophically horrible, so it was a very difficult call. When I woke up *without* pain, it's hard to describe how great that feeling was. Then, I mean, then the morphine wore off and there was some generic ""they just chopped your leg off"" ouchiness, but whatever, I was over the moon. 

Support was great. I live by myself on the opposite end of the country, and my folks took turns flying out to help. There was some uneasiness about the decision (because let's face it, there ought to be), but when for instance my mother saw the ""before"" and ""after,"" that pretty much settled any doubts. Also helped everyone appreciate what the ""before"" really was, which was I guess some level of validation for me, and that was probably nice.

If I had to summarize the emotional impact.... I mean I really haven't stopped feeling great ever since. Shit happens and all, I've had rough days/weeks/months, but it's hard to think of anything as a particularly big deal. Probably part of that is being surrounded by great people, but also, I think there's some perspective that comes from going through big challenges.... At the same time I definitely *didn't* have that perspective when I was actually hurting, so I dunno.

But it's possible - at least in some scenarios and assuming you're well enough to navigate all this garbage - to get by with the help of all of them:

* At $750/mo, subsidized housing will cost you max 30% of your income in rent, usually lower. That leaves you with $525/mo. 
* You'll probably get nearly nothing on SNAP and this will kill you, but receiving LIHEAP (which you're eligible for at SSI income) should bump you up to the higher end, $150-$195. If your grocery bill for food would be $200/mo, that means worst-case we're at $475. 
* I can't speak for the LIHEAP intersection when tenants must pay for heat (don't even know if this is allowable through HUD) but utilities (lights/internet) cost us around $110 (but we’re two people, so electricity is higher), so that leaves $365. 
* Student loans can be discharged with a doctor's certification or a 3-5 year review SSA award letter. Otherwise, you're going IBR ($0). 
* Because you receive SSI, you're eligible for Lifeline, so no phone bill, but it is otherwise possible to get basic prepaid cell service for $3-$15/mo. 
* You'll want renters insurance, so that's $10-$15/mo.
* Transportation is tricky. Medicaid will pay for most medical transport, but needed non-medical transport in an area with little public transportation is a nightmare. Social services organizations (in rural areas) and mass transit (in urban areas) may help here. 
* Factor in basic household expenditures (toiletries, etc) and - at least without a car or significant expenditures for medical devices Medicaid won't cover - you can still come out with around $175 - $275 in discretionary income, save half for an emergency fund and spend the rest. 

Overall, actually receiving SSI/SSDI allows you to avoid jumping through a lot of hoops people perceived as able-bodied need to go through. But you have to know what to do, who to call, and have a plan, and if you're in a bad situation already waiting years on a wait list for subsidized housing for example is often untenable. Backpay can help get you through this period, if applicable.",,,26,0,0,

My ankle deformities have caused knee problems that cause me to be in a wheelchair, but that didn't happen until I was 69 (two years ago)

For those reading this, CMT is a genetic disorder affecting the ability for the nerves to communicate with toes and fingers (motor neuropathy) and sometimes to feel sensations in the feet and toes. (sensory neuropathy) Due to atrophy of certain muscles in the feet, toes, and fingers, it sometimes causes deformities in those areas. 

Charcot-Marie-Tooth was once thought to be a form of muscular dystrophy but is now known to be different. Unlike MD, CMT is inherited. That is, you have to be born with it in order to have it -  like an exclusive private club.

The Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association (www.cmtausa.org) has a number of local branches where CMTers gather to exchange tips, socialize, and hear speakers.

EI (early intervention) should set you up with the local blind resources.    EI at least in Florida would refer out since it was covered under a different program.  The federal and Florida government jointly had a birth to 5 program for the blind and vision impaired, included in home vision therapy, sensory room access and other special equipment access as the child developed like light boxes and such.   I'm not sure if it is set up the same way in every state but EI should definitely be your starting point.     

CHIP at least in the 2 states I have been in do not cover children if they have access to private insurance unless you meet very specific circumstances (check your state's CHIP website for details).   Also, thanks to GOP and Democrats fighting and not putting citizens first, many states have their CHIP enrollment locked down.   Congress still hasn't come up with a long term funding solution and is only funding CHIP a few weeks at a time in a rob Peter to pay Paul scheme.   You can check into it but even if your daughter qualifies you may not get anything until congress stops infighting and properly funds the program.  

There are state specific charities and some national charities.   Post your state and some one might be able to give you more concise advice.    

Do you know how close to the SSI income cutoff you are?   Some families cut work hours because it is cheaper to get on SSI then pay for everything out of pocket.  We are generally talking about families that are toeing the income line.    Also check Medicaid waivers in your state. Again resources vary from state to state so when asking for referrals giving a general geographic area is best if you want relevant advice.

My son has been receiving his vision adaptions/intervention through his local school for the last decade but I know a few resources off hand, however, since we haven't personally used them recently I can't tell you how helpful they will be.   

[Sight Savers America](https://sightsaversamerica.org/)  - I know they have given away low vision aides to children and hold art contests.   My son won one of their art contests a few years back.    

The Lighthouse is the other major organization we interacted with but I can't find the national website for them.   You may have to type in Lighthouse and your state to see if they have a local chapter for you.

The other one that your daughter would probably qualify for is your state's program for Children with Special Healthcare Needs.   It is a federal program so every state has one and it goes by different names in each state.   Here is a list of each state's corresponding program.

You don't want to tell people about crapping yourself and bleeding from just walking, or how much it hurts to get up after you've sat down for 20 minutes.

One thing I did notice with Lucid dreaming though is when you finally lucid dream, you should try your best not to get to excited because when you realize ""hey I'm in a dream!"" you wake up from the excitement.     I remember when I first started lucid dreaming I was walking around doing things and said to my self, ""hey I can't walk, what's going on!"" and then woke up right away.

My on-call situation in the beginning of my employment was only supposed to be one day in a calendar month. Due to staff shortages it quickly became two days then more as the rotation got shorter and shorter and then there was this list called a forced on call so they would have a separate rotation of people they would fill in on days they suddenly needed to put it on call person. So it was causing too much stress and anxiety and other issues with my disabilities and I talked to my doctor and we went through the ADA process to remove all of my own calls for one year so that I could get acclimated to the new job and shifts that I was working overnight and 12 hours and battling through my health issues. The company came back and granted me three months. It has now been 4 months and into the 5th because they have not been able to put a new rotation schedule out. However my management has been talking to me saying confusing things to me about how they have a business to run, which I totally understand, and how they would like it if I could compromise with them, which I am also willing to do if my doctor will sign off on it under modified conditions. I believe that you are correct that I should find some sort of compromise. Changing my position is not an option because there are no other positions in the department that I am in. This company actually sucks quite a lot, but I am sticking it out because work is so scarce around here and I don't have that decent of a work history to feel confident enough to start looking again. I reached my 1 year anniversary with the company this month and that will also open up that I can qualify for FMLA. My only concern right now is that when I see my doctor on January 16th that she will still refuse to modify her original ADA signed form that I was not to do any on call. She said that it makes her look bad as a doctor 1 month signing that her patient should not have any on call and then 5 months later modifying it to add a little bit of on call. But I am going to explain to her that this could result in the loss of my job which would be even worse than what they would think of her. I am just really concerned that I don't know all of my rights and boundaries as this is completely new territory for me. I am not trying to get out of the on-call responsibilities. I am just not capable of handling working all of my normal hours and then giving them extra. Mostly because of sleeping and other disability reason, but also because there are supervisors that I work under that make my work life very difficult and add fuel to my anxiety and panic attacks, I know it's not a real medical reason person to have it, but it's a combination of everything.",,,2,0,0,

I would make a neurologist app, regardless of cost. It could be much worse, like MS or another sort of neurological disorder, or a lot easier to explain - like a compressed disk in the neck or back. Maybe, even something like depression and anxiety can cause nervous system issues.

If you haven't work in 2 years, you qualify for Medicaid, and it's little to no cost. And ezpz to file for just look online or call.

Start with Medicaid then get to a doctor. But, if your symptoms worsen then just go. Fuck the costs, it's medical debt.

Secondly, disability seems a weird go to, when you haven't tried to do anything about your condition. You must show medically, by professionals, that working isn't something that you can do. And you haven't done any of that.

You are missing a ton of steps before a disability claim can even be made, then you will more than likely need a lawyer due to your age.

The process is long, I'm 2 years now on the waiting list to be seen.  Also with only 2 years, you will probably not qualify for SSDI due to the amount of money you have put in. (Varies from state to state but I think I heard 10 years or something like that)

In the beginning I was extremely overwhelmed with the job itself that it was aggravating a lot of my medical conditions that hinder my performance. So I went to the extreme to have the on calls stopped. When I was hired I was told appx 1 on call per month because we rotated on our team every 11th working day and we only worked 15 days per month due to 12 hour shifts. I was 8pm to 8am and the on call window was 4pm to 4am so I had to slide backwards and lose sleep (which was already non existent due to insomnia). (To answer your first question, no I could not change departments. I applied for a diff position in October and did not get it). Now I was able to bid into a better shift and I now work 6am to 2pm 5 days per week. So the on call times would be 4am to 4pm. I am still responsible for 12 hours. The agreed to a negotiation if I could get my doctor on board. Doctor was not at all thrilled because she wrote for 1 year no on calls and my job is basically forcing her hand because my job is in jeopardy. Last night she finally agreed to write me the official signed note of my negotiation. Ionically as I was typing this, m manager came in the break room. I thought it was funny. She actually just came in so I am going to give her the letter and hope this appeases. I agreed to 1 on call day in a calendar month hours from 6am to 4pm so it doesn't hurt sleep too much. I don't want to be the person that looks like I'm trying to get out of duty, but my mental health is more important and I need to have a job.

It doesn't help that (imho) there's two kinds of stories they like to tell about is: 

* One where we triumph '''despite''' being disabled and we achieve all our dreams (Inspiration Porn)

or: **TW** 

* It's a story about our parent/carer/SO to whom we are a burden which in itself is a tragedy (for the loved ones; we're just foil), and it often also has an extra side of death, sometimes it's a '''mercy''' killing, or sometimes the loved one dies just to prove the point that our disabled lives are sad with no meaning without the one magical person on earth who died before they got sick enough of us to kill us or abandon us. 



That's kind of it. They'll dress it up as 'an exploration of the human psyche' either way - whether it's about 'sheer human will' or something about how hard it is to love a disabled person, it doesn't actually matter.

c4c6a003-cc26-4573-8be1-5282e9e1ee65,1515953802,"Well said.  I if I'm honest I get less upset with portrayals of people with invisible or nonphysical disabilities(that does put it in more of the traditional realm of casting imo), but it's still all a matter of representation and having a disabled voice representing their disability and bringing insights to the role that a nondisabled person simply can't.

I don't hate Freddie Highmore for example for playing an autistic person.  He does a pretty good job portraying *someone* who would be on the spectrum, even if it rings a bit hollow at points for me.  But there's just something gross about the fact that he's getting so much praise for pretending to be autistic, when an actual autistic like myself gets looked at like I'm crazy for rocking.

  I also can't get it out of my mind that some of the things that feel off about Shaun and are just excused by ""everyone on the spectrum is different, "" could be made more authentic to an extent by having an autistic actor who doesn't have to pretend to be autistic.  As an example, Highmore plays the character as *very* visibly autistic, disproportionate to his success in life(which usually goes along with solid masking skills).  Everyone on the spectrum is different, so his portrayal isn't *wrong,* but it feels almost like a caricature at points because it goes so strongly against what you'd expect.    A big part of this is also on writing/directing, but it would be easier for me to swallow if this was an actual autistic person drawing from their own background.


&gt; A) if you are writing a disabled character that an actual disabled person can't play, you didn't write them very well!! 

YES!  It *seems* to me that most of the time, if you can't have the disabled person play that role, then your script is probably either trafficking in stale tropes, using unnecessary flashbacks, or your director is too lazy to find a creative solution where some extra care(like composing shots to avoid a person's missing limb) could easily do the trick.

  This is an issue I see often with the related problem with casting cis people as transgender(especially when it's someone of the same assigned sex).  The go-to response other than ""it's just acting!"" is ""but what if there are pre-transition scenes?""  It's as if they either think that a trans actor couldn't emotionally handle that, or they've forgotten about how many movies recast the same role for different ages.  Worse than that, though, is if so much of your script takes place pre- or early transition that a trans actor can't play it, then you're probably not telling the sort of story most people in the trans community are interested in hearing.  Everyone's almost morbidly obsessed with stories about transition, but are far less interested in what happens aftwards and showing what it's really like after those awkward 2-5 years of your life.",,,3,0,0,

It can vary by the state you're in, and other factors related to your living situation and disabilities.

Generally, a person receiving SSI can work. The first $85 you earn in a month is ignored by SSI. If your income exceeds $85 in a month, then your cash benefit is decreased by 1/2 of the amount you earned. Here's a simple example:

SSI Cash Benefit: $735
Income From Work $1000
Subtract first $ 85 from Income = $915
Divide by 2 = $457.50
Subtract $457.50 from $735 = $277.50

So your total income for the month would be your income from work ($1000) plus your reduced SSI cash Benefit, for a total of $1277.50.

The other thing to clarify is how your increased benefits might effect any medical coverage you have through the federal govt. (Medicare / Medicaid) or a state public heath care system. 

Good luck!

You might want to ask around and see if you can locate one.    You can also go the used route and try craigslist &amp; Ebay but I suspect if you put your feelers out you might get lucky and snag a chair for free.  

Our Medicaid program says you have to be bed and/or chair confined AND a wheelchair will increase mobility and independence.   Fortunately, my son meets those conditions with ease but it is still a hassle getting them to pay for anything.   

If you need positioning, orthopedic supports and such then I would suggest you seek a physical therapist or Rehab doctor for further help.   Personally I always process DME through the Rehab doctor instead of a PCP because it is faster and the Rehab doctors office does this extensively so knows the ins and outs and which therapists are best for the eval and write up.

That's a fair point, but I have a feeling if his ""landlord"" was insisting on cash in the first place, the landlord wouldn't agree to change now.

What's helpful for me personally is to look at it...personally. Is my life better than it would have been without the effort? Undoubtedly. My docs have consistently emphasised that. It might not be as much progress as someone else but it's progress for me and that's important. It's good to measure against yourself.

I'm not trying to fix myself either but I am trying to keep my body in the best shape it can be, like anyone able bodied or otherwise. My baseline for healthy is just different than it used to be and when I keep that in mind, I find it does a lot for my motivation and overall mental health.

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1515853185,"Exactly. Don't write yourself off just because you haven't made as much progress as others - the progress you *have* made is down to grit and determination and hard work and you should absolutely congratulate yourself for that. Look back and remind yourself, regularly, and that helps with moving forward.

I hate when random strangers tell me I'm inspirational because they know nothing about me and it feels like pity. I have had a couple friends tell me that they admire and are inspired by the effort I put into things and I'll take that, because they know me and they know how much it takes. If a mate says to me 'I love how you got out to Tesco even when it was black ice out there' that's not a shite pity comment to me, because they know that takes a whole lot of effort and actually, that is something worth admiring and being inspired by. It's not inspirational for me to get to the shops under normal conditions just because I use a wheelchair, I do it every day. But for someone with less function that might be a monumental moment for them because of the increased effort it takes, and that is inspirational. 

It's not an empty compliment if someone sees the work you put in. People are inspired by Olympians who dedicate time and energy to being the best they can be. I can be inspired by someone with a disability who puts their time and energy into being the best they can be, *whatever that is*. The problem for me is when people claim to be 'inspired' by everyday acts, with no idea how difficult that act is for the individual. To me, it's all about context. ",,,4,0,0,

There are of course plenty of people out there who *could* put more effort into their health/recovery, but your friend has no idea if you're one of them. 

Speaking of inspiration porn generally I think it is down to the individual case, a lot of recovery *is* down to hard work and when everything is hard I can find it motivational to do my PT knowing it can make a difference. I don't expect it to make the same difference as anyone else and I would be pissed as fuck if anyone other than my doctor suggested 'if you just do x you'll get y result'. It also depends on the tone of the writer in general, someone like your friend I'm not going to listen to, someone who acknowledges that luck is as important as hard work I'll find a kindred spirit in.

Everyone is different and as you've said a large portion of it is luck. Some people who do all the right things, have a positive attitude and put in a lot of work get minimal improvement while others who are grumpy twats and sit around all day eating chips get great improvement. Life is unfair that way. 

If you want to be more diplomatic than fuck off I would sit him down and say that while you're happy for his progress, it is difficult for you when your own illness is so very different. Remind him that although his hard work was essential to his recovery, a lot of it is luck and rubbing that in the face of someone not so lucky is not going to inspire anyone. If he responds with anything other than 'sorry mate, I didn't realise how it came across' I'd rethink how much contact you have with him.  ",,,3,0,0,

You can do a Google search for something like “spousal deeming” for more info.  The SSA even says that if two people are living together without being married, but commingle their finances to the point that they function like a married couple, then deeming applies.  It sucks.  It happened to my wife and me when I got my first job out of college and they wanted six months of benefits repaid (like 8 months AFTER I informed them of my income change—thank God I saved the checks!).  

There’s two schools of thought about going to college while disabled.

Do you meet a listing? It's possible you do I don't know the listing for bipolar disorder. Is there any other thing that you have? What is your work history like? You're going to be looking at several years if you did not meet a listing.

The other thing you can do is equal a listing, which means you don't have the exact impairment but you functionally are impaired enough to meet it.

People without very very severe problems would essentially need to be without any work skills AND have less than a  high school education to have a shot at disability, by that I mean a case that doesn't take several years. 

I know a person in their thirties that's on disability for bipolar, and what they did is repeatedly check into mental institutions.

I know someone else that had bipolar that was under age 50, but they had many other problems in a mountain of documentation, and 13 hospitalizations.

Job history and what you have and how well it's document and are basically it

I wish you luck.

If you're serious about getting disability you're going to need a lawyer involved unless you have a mountain of long documentation, and very severe symptoms that happen even with treatment.

I got in at 29 for example, but I had 4 years of mental health documentation, permanent learning permits, extremely low birth weight, multiple eye diseases, and lots of documentation for everything, I also had never done a substantial job, I worked but it was never anything substantial, something called substantial gainful activity

I actually worked while my case was pending, it did not count against me since I was not doing substantial gainful activity for a blind claimant.

Most people get denied, unless they have something absolutely devastating, and maybe not even.

Once you get denied at the reconsideration stage, which statistically you probably will, go get a lawyer ASAP because you will need one after you appeal again, and wait out a court hearing.

I don't know what the wait is in Washington State, but you're likely looking at a year or more before you are able to go to court.

Wells people unless they have a good case give up after the second denial and go back to work, but if you choose to continue all the way to court, you will be in front of an administrative law judge, who has a lot more leeway, and if you are approved you will get back pay, potentially from the time you applied, and maybe even before as was my case.

1. The evidence establishes that the individual's impairment precludes engaging in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) or, in the case of a disabled widow(er) that the impairment meets or equals the Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1 of Regulations No. 4, Subpart P; and
2. The impairment has lasted or is expected to last for 12 continuous months from onset of disability or is expected to result in death; and

Very interesting, and I am glad that within the agency there is such a strong push to make the correct decision.  I have heard a number of first hand accounts of people seeing a SS doctor and the doctor behaving in a brusque, short, and challenging way.  I am glad this is not the norm.  (And I also believe that some of those people are partially to blame for their claim denial, via their own lack of effort in filling out the paperwork, and communicating poorly with the doctor.)

FYI, the background I brought to my response to OP’s post was based on my own experience having a “mystery illness” and getting no diagnosis, and feeling I was disbelieved by doctors, until I saw I neurologist who performed the nerve tests and found many badly injured nerves. Once I saw the neurologist, I had proof that my pain and symptoms had a real reason. I guess I projected my situation onto OP and jumped to the conclusion he would have the same result.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1515446574,"I'm not often in my own dreams. I'm usually watching a scene involving different people from a third perspective. Like watching TV. 

When I do feature in my own dream, I am disabled. I've had dreams that actually revolve around my disability (I once dreamed that I was sitting in a doctors waiting room for several hours. It was just me staring at a moving clock while experiencing bad pain and fidgeting in an uncomfortable chair and occasionally asking a receptionist how much longer... Most boring dream ever)

I think I'm disabled in my dreams for two reasons.

1) my disability and illness is congenital. I don't know what it feels like to not be disabled, my subconscious probably doesn't either.

2) my symptoms often contradict restful sleep. My dysautonomia means I can wake up in a feverous sweat, or wake up from dead sleep with a HR of 180bpm. My pain can wake me up, my joint Instability can wake me up, sometimes I wake up vomiting or having bile acid incontinence due to a delayed mast cell reaction. When I do finally get to sleep, I feel like my subconscious incorporates the symptoms into my dream to help keep me immersed in my dream. If I dream that my knee hurts, I'll be less likely to wake up to knee pain, because it's just part of the dream.

Eg: I once dreamed that  I was walking around town and pushing through the heart rate, asthma, and the pain of walking because it was such beautiful weather, when I woke up, I'd dislocated my ankle in my sleep and I was having a tachycardic and dyspnoeic mast cell reaction to the physical sress of the dislocation. I'd clearly been experiencing symptoms IRL for a long time, my foot was purple and my mast cell reaction was out of control and I had to wake my partner to help me get my meds. But I'd gotten an extra hour of sleep that night thanks to my immersive dream. ",,,1,0,0,

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1515483773,"To add to this, If you do bring your SD, be prepared to put your foot down on any behaviour your instructor exhibits that is inappropriate around a service dog. Prepare some statements such as ""Please do not pet the dog s/he is working"" or ""Please do not distract her/him, they need to stay focused on their task"". If you have a working dog vest for your dog, I would suggest fully kitting your dog out to take to the meeting with your instructor, not that you need to prove your dogs legitimacy, But mostly to reinforce to your instructor that this is a service dog, not a companion pet.

Does your institution have a student disability liaison office? If so, request that someone from the office attend the meeting to so there is someone there who can understand both your side and the instructors side of this issue.

A lot of people mistakenly think that therapy dogs or PTSD and GAD service dogs provide their support purely through companionship and their adorable cuteness, but as you attempted to point out in your email (something your instructor did not address in their reply) your service dog is trained to cope with crisis situations such as panic attacks and night terrors, and your dog is trained to provide medical support through tasking such as deep pressure. 

It's clear your instructor wants to stay in your good graces, but they are very ignorant on what a service dog does in the case of mental health, their language ""bring the *puppy*"" shows they have zero comprehension of the level of training and obedience your dog has.

Your professor needs to address two issues with their level of understanding 

* They were completely dismissive of the severity of GAD and PTSD  and how it can be a legitimate disability

* They were dismissive of the level of training of SDs in general, and specifically *your* SD.

They need to be willing to say ""I didn't know that about Service Dog laws, It's the first I'm hearing about it, I will have to do some research to be able to discuss it properly"" and they need to be willing to say ""I didn't understand how debilitating GAD can be and how different it is from the everyday, rational, anxiety experienced by people without a traumatic history or anxiety disorder""

If they can't accept that they have gaps in their understanding, I think you are within your right to request a way of avoiding them as an instructor. You need a teacher who can accept and accommodate your disability within reason, respecting your service dog is a perfectly reasonable accommodation and you deserve that.",,,10,0,0,

However, if you struggle with public transport and need a way to get from your house to the doctor, an electric bike can be easier to operate and qualify for compared to a car, and you can possibly use a collapsible cane once you park close to the entrance and leave your bike.

I used a bicycle and collapsible crutches for years when I was at uni. The bicycle allowed me to get across campus, the crutches allowed me to access buildings.

I had a self propelled wheelchair, I could easily get around buildings in that. But my arms were too sore and fatigued to push me all over campus, so I had to rely on the shuttle service that was shit. Obviously a power assist wheelchair could have been a good solution, but I suspect we're both in a similar position, you can only afford what you can afford.

I would push back with your doctor to explore other ways to prescribe a mobility aid, insurance should cover it or an alternative if it's prescribed properly.

My approach with cross-Atlantic (honed at a time when the onboard restrooms were less available, so perhaps less necessary now...) is to avoid a direct flight and instead scan many flights to find one with the farthest north east layover. New York and Iceland are common layovers. Iceland in particular is one of the best at dividing the length of the flight legs. This approach generally creates a much, much longer total flight time. Instead of, say, a 13 hour direct flight, I’ll pick two 7 hour flights with a 4 hour layover. Unlike most travelers, I try to get a *long* layover time—3-4 hours is my time preferred. This length of time is enough for me to hydrate a bit at the end of my first flight, pee that all out, then restart my dehydration. Tools like Kayak.com have extensive search filters that allow one to search for specific layover locations and layover lengths. Huge help!

The big issue with being a rep payee is being able to provide documentation to SSA where your money is going. Now, will SSA do a complete audit? Not unless there is a question/complaint about your mom. She is going to have to fill out an annual Rep Payee Form that just asks how much money was spent in specific categories (food, housing, medical, etc). 

Your mom is responsible for making sure that you are fed, clothed, housed, and medicated (well access to medical care). As long as she is taking care of those things, the money she gives you for spending doesn't need to be accounted for. If you wanted to spend all your spending money on lotto tickets and candy - that is your decision to make.  

When I was a payee I had my clients keep all their receipts for their spending money - but that was for cash and so wasn't auditable. If you are using your debit card for your spending money, the statements would be sufficient. 

Your mom being an accountant explains a lot. Frankly, the way you guys have it set up (payee accounts and your account) is a really smart system. And you already keep track of your expenses; probably more than you need to. 

Is her being your payee a new thing? It can be stressful for payees at first, because it is a legal responsibility for which they don't give you much direction. Conflicts between beneficiary and family rep-payees are very common. At its core it is a bit of a power struggle.

That your mom is willing to go to family therapy is a good thing, its showing she is willing to work through the issues. From your post, it sounds like she doesn't have an issue with *how* you're spending your money, just on *documenting* the spending. That is an easier conflict to resolve.

There are 2 ways that you can be granted benefits - your condition is severe enough to meet a blue book listing (conditions so severe that no age, education, work is taken into consideration) or be assessed to not be able to work even a sedentary job. 

The medical listing for CP is [here](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm#11_07) which you'd be evaluated under 11.07.

Since SSI has the asset restrictions, it does lend itself to needing more documentation and tracking. Because the combination of your 3 accounts would need to be under the asset limit at the end of the month. SSI also has the higher propensity for fraud - hiding assets, misrepresenting living situations, not reporting income, etc. 

SSDI is so much more lax. Since your assets don't matter, they will really only investigate if there is a complaint or work involved (a work investigation would actually involve both of you). 

If your goal is to eventually be your own payee, one thing you need to do is prove your fiscal responsibility with the money that you are given. If, down the road, you apply to be your own payee they will ask your mom for her opinion. Now, I'm not saying do whatever your mom says, but some compromise now might help in the long term.

*Original:*
 Sadly, affordable ones don’t really exist. I recently did a *huge* post about this for someone remodeling their basement. It’s going to be a few thousand dollars for the lift alone, and probably a few times that amount for the home modifications. And that’s for a lift that moves only a few feet up.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1515364119,"You know, I think you would be much better off doing one of two things: either having the stairs demolished and turned into a ramp (with a switchback), or to put in a [chair-rail lift](https://www.accessiblemed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Elan.jpg). If you don’t have a powerchair, I would say do the rail lift. If you can walk you’re golden, if not you can have a cheap manual wheelchair on each level. It will cost far less.

Another option would be to find a local contractor who can tear out your stairs, and turn it into a ramp with a movable platform lift. Think streetcar: there would be a gated platform that you get onto, hit the button and a chain pulls the platform up from a underneath the ramp. It’s non-standard, but here’s why it’s nice: it’s super simple. If it broke down, there are basically only three parts: the motor, the chain, and the gears. Almost any handyman could come in and repair it for you.

You also need to think about the value of the home. A chair rail lift can be easily removed. An elevator will add essentially zero monetary value to the home (unless the rest of the house is renovated to be wheelchair accessible).  The platform lift I described won’t add value, but it is also very easy to replace again with stairs since all the structure is still there. Hell, the ramp and platform could be built on top of the existing stairs if you have high enough ceilings.

With the elevator you also need to think about the ongoing maintenance costs. If you’re looking long-term, then you want to have a more standardized system installed so that if this company goes out of business, someone else could still service it for you. You don’t want to find out in 20 years that you have to tear the whole thing out and spend another $40k because no one can repair that proprietary system. 

If it were me, I would find a non-mechanical, or minimally mechanical, solution. I think it would involve tearing out the stairs. I’m worried that with the elevator you’re going to get screwed by a proprietary system with excruciating maintenance costs. ",,,1,0,0,

Is his wheelchair a manual chair or a power chair? Either way I don’t think what you did was offensive, but “disrespectful” I can sort of see *if it was a power chair*. 

The reason I say that is that manual chairs are pretty goddamn sturdy and you can do whatever you want to them assuming it’s not an ultralight. Power chairs, though, are generally built around someone’s weight and a fully grown adult sitting in a child’s power chair can cause damage that the parents then have to pay for — especially if tilt/recline/lift functions are left engaged.

You could also lie. Say something like...there is some other program or something that he is signed up for that looks at how much they pay for rent. All they need is a receipt and it should work. Then, have the receipt each month prepared and ask if they'd sign it. 



If it's an absolute no-go on any of those options...I'm kind of at a loss.

They say right there that there are no disabilities that make you gain weight. I was retaining 2 gallons of fluid when my heart failure was diagnosed. 16 pounds. How is it counterintuitive that a physical problem could make it hard to lose weight? I'm on steroids for the flu right now, which isn't helping my rage issue, but it's still garbage. 

Edit: They're also saying ""if someone doesn't eat."" So easy solution, just starve yourself. Pretty much the only way I get to 126 now is literally by starving myself, because you can't get everything you need from 600 calories a day.

I tend to consume about 1000-1200 calories/day, mostly protein dense stuff- veggies, chicken, and fish- don't drink soda, alcohol, or sweetened drinks, but I don't lose weight anymore, even when I'm well enough to exercise every day. I've been mostly bedridden for about a month now though, and I haven't gained or lost weight.

However, every county in Kentucky has a community mental health center, even if it's an hour away.  A case worker at a CMHC can provide some help.  Feel free to call them and explain the situation.  That's why they are there.  If they can't help you directly, they can direct you to other resources in the area.

Kentucky has regional transport systems that could pick her up and take her to the grocery store.  Meals on Wheels might also be an option to ensure she is fed and that people are laying eyes on her.

If she's been on disability for several years, she should be signed up with Medicare to cover the cost of prescription drugs.  I cannot fathom why she is paying for them.  That would be an appropriate task for Social Security - help her get signed up on Medicare.

She might also need a representative payee if she is not meeting her basic needs.  A representative payee is paid the disability money by Social Security on behalf of the beneficiary, but in a manner that the beneficiary does not have direct access.  A representative payee has the responsibility of ensuring her basic needs are met, and then can provide for other expenses for the beneficiary.  This could be a healthier option for her, and prevent excess expenditure on frivolous items that would not benefit her directly, or on self-medicating goods like cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, lottery tickets, etc.  

My mom is my representative payee for example, to ensure that I don't have access to a large amount of cash during a manic state, and end up blowing it all on foolish investments like cryptocurrency.

If you or a family member wants to become a representative payee, or have an organizational representative payee (third-party company) assigned to her, talk to Social Security about it.

&gt; I appealed and the appeal was denied with a letter that said basically the same thing - I was absolutely disabled but too young, the payouts would be for too long &amp; state resources were overburdened.

This sounds like something other than SSI - like a state specific program - state funding doesn't have anything to do with SSI as it is 100% federally funded. 

What an *awful* situation though - seriously. That really is the ultimate ""fuck you and die."" 

Someone else mentioned dire need - it can be helpful sometimes to bring this up, however since most people filing for SSI feel that they are in dire need, it's unfortunately not as straight forward as that. You might consider reaching out to your State senators office with your dire need situation - if you can convince them of the gravity of your situation, they can sometimes intervene and help expedite the process.

c994b5c6-8bbc-4f0c-8a88-385ea8922f08,1515945689,"&gt;I know that they will do a review in three years. Is that three years from when I was disabled or from when they made the decision? What does that review look like?

This would be your continuing disability review - they ask for your medical information for approximately the last 12 months, and review it to determine if you've improved or not. **Edit**: It would be 3 years from the decision date, but as I said before, it could very well be longer. 

If you're on a 3-year review cycle, the review isn't due in *less* than three years, but sometimes due to backlog it could take a lot longer, so don't stress if it doesn't happen at the 3-year mark. 

&gt;I started a teachers pay teachers store (it’s on a website that does all the work for you, I literally just type up lessons and activities and upload them), but haven’t done a whole lot with it in the last few months because I have been feeling horrible. 

As someone else mentioned, this is self-employment. If you haven't already, make sure you report that you are doing this on occasion. It will initiate a work review, but don't panic - they're just reviewing what you are doing to make sure it doesn't represent substantial gainful activity. They'll either call you and go over [this form](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-820.pdf) with you, or will send it to you in the mail. Look it over and get a feel for what kind of information they're asking. Self employment is looked at based on it's comparability to similar work for wages - if you're only working a few hours intermittently, you've got nothing to worry about. I would recommend keeping a log of your monthly hours and earnings just to be safe - you don't want them to ask for this information 2 years from now and you don't have it.  


&gt;I am also curious about whether my son would be able to get benefits (it was mentioned in my letter that he might qualify but it wasn’t clear). 

Again, as someone else mentioned, this is auxiliary child benefits - depending on how much you paid in, he is eligible for up to 50% of what you are currently receiving. (Up to because there is a maximum payable to the family, and if you didn't earn enough prior to becoming disabled, there may not be enough available for the full 50%.) Call and schedule an appointment to file for these benefits - as long as you do it within 6 months of the date on the letter where it said he might be eligible, they'll pay him all the way back to your date of entitlement.

If the non-custodial parent is receiving the payments, the custodial parent can apply to be representative payee (the one who receives payment for the child.) Visit the office with proof of custody. 

My least favorite is the court custody documents which award equal physical/legal custody 50/50 down the middle. If the parents can't agree on who should receive the payment, who am I to make that kind of decision?? We can require a third party, but then a lot of times other family members don't want to be in the middle like that. I've had to process kids into suspension (so they're approved, but all benefits are being held) because parents can't stop arguing long enough to agree on what to do for the child.

Of course, at that point, ""lack of funding"" (or similar phrasing) is nowhere listed as a cause of benefit termination. 

It does seem that if there was a situation during that timeframe where people were terminated due to lack of funding, [this table](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/OASDIbenies.html) (far right column - Disabled workers and dependents) should show a decline in disability beneficiaries around that time. What it *does* show is an increase in beneficiaries every single year between 1983 - 2015. 

Additionally, [these charts] (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/assets.html), and [this one](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/qop.html) in particular, comparing trust fund assets vs. outflow show only increases in asset reserves - nowhere is there a decline which would indicate a lack of funding. Additionally, detailed year views of these figures are available off of [this](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/ProgData/allOps.html) page. 

To date, Social Security [benefits payable have never been dictated by the national budget](https://www.ssa.gov/budget), as they are paid directly out of the Social Security trust fund vs the general fund. Only administrative costs are dictated by budget, meaning that while Congress can cut the operating budget, making it extremely difficult to administer the program, they cannot cut the amount of benefits available for payment, causing people to be terminated due to unavailability of funds. 

Furthermore, while this does not prove that it doesn't exist, I cannot locate any record of anything - ever - referencing termination of benefits due to budgetary issues/lack of funding.

An individual receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits only is not included in the definition of a “Social Security beneficiary.”

NOTE: Benefits to a CDB no longer terminate because the benefits of his or her spouse who is a CDB or disability beneficiary terminate.
