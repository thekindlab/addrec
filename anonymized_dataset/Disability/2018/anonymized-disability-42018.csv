90 days is probably about average, but it will take as long as it takes. The hearings division is grossly understaffed. 

What is going to take extra time, if she is approved for both SSI and SSDI, is calculating back pay amounts and benefit amounts. Once a person gets medical approval, they still have to finish checking non-medical [financial] qualifications. Her receiving a large amount of backpay will likely make her ineligible to receive her SSI payments for a while. Or her SSDI payment will be large enough that she will no longer qualify for the SSI portion of the program. 

I highly recommend you guys get separate accounts. It will just make the paperwork and documentation easier. And, honestly, you're an adult and you guys should have separate accounts. If you need to, keep the joint account for household expenses only and get two individual accounts.

In simplistic terms, last century the thinking was ""this person is disabled"", but more modern thinking is ""this person is disabled by society"", so how you handle your character's thoughts should be in relation to how the various societies in your world think about those who are less perfect than the ideal member of that society.

For example, if society naturally took into account how people in wheelchairs interact with the world, all pavements/sidewalks would have frequent dropped curbs, there would be ramps into EVERY building, stores/shops would present all goods at heights reachable by those sitting down, and so on and so on. It's not the wheelchair user who is disabled, it is that the world around them hasn't been designed and built with them in mind.

So you have the opportunity to have your character interact with different societies, those that are accepting of difference and those that reject anything less than perfection. If you were to base the societies on anything in the world before about 1945 then it would only be the rich, the cream of society who would be able to function with disabilities, the rest would die in their first year or be reduced to beggars in the street. And you are free to present the reactions to disability however you want, from enforced euthanasia being perfectly acceptable through to every creature has a right to live in harmony with the world.

Personally, I don't feel lesser than others just because I use a wheelchair, but I'm constantly struggling against a world that isn't designed with me in mind, to the point where I phone the police about cars frequently parked on the pavement/sidewalk, force the local government to put in a dropped curb, complain to large organisations about their lack of accessibility, only go to clothes shops that have accessible changing rooms, only buy items from the middle and lower shelves and order everything else online. (Thankfully in the 21st Century we have the internet, which alleviates a lot of issues.)

Every in the world in 2018, those who are less than perfect face a lot of discrimination, and that inevitably affects their mental state. Some shrink away to nothing, others fight back, most find some balance where they fight the battles that matter most to them and try to shrug off the other issues.",,,1,0,0,

You have a right to education employment and participation opportunities, your mother doesn’t get to deny you them because she is worried. You get the right to find things you are good at and explore and discover - even if you can’t travel yet. 

You are eligible for a very small payment from the government and there are organisations that can help with other things. 

Also look up the Khan Academy website, it has some courses you can take online in a few subjects for free - right from the beginning. Open textbooks Japan has books for free online that can help you understand things better, 

Education is your ticket to more opportunities and your mind isn’t disabled. 

If you do your best to learn and volunteer and pursue all the avenues those companies offer - and find a disabled persons group travel you would like to go on. Then I will help you start a kickstart campaign and other companies with funding to try and get enough money to pay for it. ",,,1,0,0,

The fact that you can't work isn't necessarily going to get you on the dole. It matters how severe it is. What your quality of life is. Social relationships, activity level, etc. You will have to go to the doctor frequently, provide ongoing proof of medical impairment that SUBSTANTIALLY limits your daily quality of life. If you can work even a bit, they will deny you. I have lived with severe chronic pain condition for over 30 years and it was only after 30 years working and struggling and trying to hold a job that I was finally able to go on disability. It wasn't something it just happened because I felt like I couldn't work anymore it I had to show a substantial decline in by quality of life and by that I mean I'm no longer going out and socializing I can't do simple things like exercise go shopping or even go out for more than an hour or two without having severe issues. My life consists of doctors appointments Physical Therapy tons of medication and very little anything else. So not being able to work occasionally or some days is not quite the same as being completely disabled where you are unable to do any kind of work at all and more than likely along with 90% of other people who apply for disability they get denied the first time. My suggestion is you start looking at going to your doctor and making sure that you have documentation to show that you have made a great effort to try and manage your issue and start establishing medical documentation regularly tried medications physical therapy and a whole lot of other things because without it you will never get disability.

If they don't ask ""any conditions that may effect your work?"" they certainly ask ""why the big career change?"" or ""why did a robot answer your phone?"" or even ""that's a cool pen"" when I bring out my arthritis friendly pen. and those questions are great segues into explaining that yes, I have a disability, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable or less capable than other candidates, and I come with some government grants that will help the company update their workplace if they want (they don't have to, because I'll usually accommodate myself) and that my wage will actually remain subsidised so they can hire me for cheaper and put me to the same work.

If they still don't hire me after that, I have to assume there really was someone better.

The way I see it. If a company is going to discriminate against me secretly after the interview, I will don't want to work for them anyway, if they're uncomfortable asking questions about accommodations in the interview how am I going to talk about accommodations in the workplace, if don't want to work for them.

I go into the interview bringing exactly what I would bring to the job, here's my skills and my abilities, here's how I intend to get this job done, here's why I'm different and therefore possibly a better choice than other candidates, here's why my disability shouldn't worry you and here's how comfortable it can be to talk about it even as professionals, here's why a diversity hire might benefit you, here's what I need from you as a company, now let's see where we stand after all that is out on the table.

I won't lie, I've been chronically unemployed, my doctor has only cleared me for 8 hours work per week and it's very hard to find employers with positions for those kinds of hours so I definitely have to address that when I I go to interviews because companies will obviously risk workerscomp lawsuits if I go over 8 hours and get injured, and when I injure myself just breathing, I'm think companies see me as a walking workerscomp claim, and I feel like I need to address right up front that I know I'm broken, and that's my burden to bear, I'm not trying to pass my struggles onto my company, I just want a sense of purpose in life, and income, because making rent is helpful to survival and shit.

Yeah, I get that, but I'm just not sure how to make it work, honestly. (And my being an adult (whose own health issues have made keeping employment outside the home impossible but can *technically* be expected to improve, despite the fact they have not -- just to cover the ""why doesn't adult daughter have more income"" potential question) doesn't change how our household works. Transferring money from her account to mine really wouldn't work when neither of us bring in the same amount every month. It'd be *constant* bank transfers back and forth -- does the trip to Meijer today come out of Mom's account or Daughter's? If we split it does Mom have enough to cover her end?) This really isn't as cut-and-dry as ""woman and adult daughter with separate incomes and expenses,"" however much it should be. (Mind I wasn't asking those questions of you specifically.)

We're just going to have to wait and see what the SSI says (if she gets approved, of course) about what's happened so far (which we can't change) and what should be done in the future for her. In the meantime we'll open an account for her and try to figure out how to separate finances if possible. Thanks so much for your help!",,,1,0,0,

I'm not positive about that in OP's case.  It seems in my observation that most young adults our age have the best chance of approval regardless w/autism spectrum disorders.  Some treatment history is probably still helpful, but they take developmental disorders much more seriously out of everything neuropsychiatric.

&gt; Trust me, if you go on disability, especially SSI, you will definitely never get on your feet.

There's no reason to be so dismissive and judgmental here.  That's the whole point--for a lot of us (I'm in a similar boat, also can't work due to mental illness), that *is* 'getting on our feet'--we need that safety net help, it's better than nothing, because well, we're disabled.  ",,,2,0,0,

You need to be getting consistent treatment for all of your disabling conditions and working with your doctors to follow a treatment regime.  This will help you build the medical evidence necessary for your case.  In most cases, a diagnosis isn’t enough by itself and requires your conditions to be disabling despite treatment.

What your landlord is doing is wrong.  He has a contract with the federal government and with you to rent your apartment for a certain price, of which Section 8 is a certain percentage and you pay the rest.  Requiring under the table cash isn’t right.  Since your neighbor sounds dangerous too, I’d be looking for another landlord that takes Section 8 vouchers and get out of there ASAP.  It’s a bad situation and it is harming your mental health.

Pay your rent with a check or money order and take a copy of that to the DCBS office when you apply for SNAP as proof of your rent expenses.  Tell your caseworker that he won’t fill out the paperwork for your case.  More than likely, he’s doing a lot under the table and is doing everything he can to hide his tracks.  KY is expanded Medicaid state, so apply for that as well.

This is the image almost every person thinks of when they're told to ""picture disability"" but no matter how much action and motion and empowerment you give the stick figure logo, it's never going to represent what disability really looks like. Yes, some people with disabilities will see a reflection of their disability in this logo, but it isn't what the majority of people with disabilities *look* like. 

The logo is only ever going to be representative, and the problem with trying to make it more representative is that it  fails to educate the public on the pictures if disability that this logo doesn't represent. 

If the general public thinks this is the best possible logo, will people with invisible disabilities be even more forgotten? 

Nobody says ""hey lady, you're wearing pants, this female bathroom is for skirts only, see the logo""  and yet  The number of people who don't use wheelchairs but use priority parking, seating, bathrooms, etc, who are accosted by strangers saying ""that's for people with disabilities in wheelchairs, see the sign!"" when it's not solely for wheelchair users, it's for people with disabilities who need that facility or service, whatever that disability may be.

Why has the disability logo become so representative, but other logos are understood to be merely symbolic? 

So yes, I love that the people who wanted this logo to be more reflective of the autonomy that people with disabilities posses have been able to make changes, but as someone who isn't a full time wheelchair user who's main issue with this logo is simply that it's not representative of what the majority of Disability looks like, this change won't effect me strongly.

I had two done, actually, one with contrast and one without, when I got a call saying they found something on my scan.

So here I was scared that I had brain cancer or MS, but my neurologist said I didn’t have anything “too serious” but I did have a “developmental peculiarity” called heterotopia. Apparently it’s rare, and most people who have it have epilepsy, which is why she called me in. I have two bundles of brain tissue that didn’t branch out to become part of the outer region of my brain, they just kind of looped back on each other and my brain filled in the gaps as I reached adulthood. 

The bundles are still active tissue with firing neural connections to nowhere, so they can cause electrical disturbances in the brain. The downside is I have horrific migraines, balance and coordination issues, vision problems, muscle spasms, and potentially epilepsy. Because of where the heterotopia is, it could also explain the mood swings I have that might have been misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, and my treatment resistant anxiety. 

Apparently it’s very rare, there’s a few different types and my type is linked to epilepsy and cerebral palsy. The other types can leave people with severe cognitive challenges. My type can even be misdiagnosed as brain cancer by inexperienced neurologists and some patients have been given rounds of chemo and radiation only to find out they don’t have cancer, they have heterotopia, leading to further health complications.

What do you mean by 'on disability'? Do you mean something like SSDI (USA) or a disability pension (Aus)?


**Please note:**
You appear to be using a throwaway account, and I'm a bit confused as to how you wouldn't know at least vaguely what qualifies you for disability or how to contact the service if you're on it. Not unheard of or totally impossible, but this is super suss to me.

**If you are trying to get information about somebody else without their consent, you're not only breaking the law, you are a garbage human being.** 


*Please* forgive me if this is not the case.



**If this is a genuine request:**


What organisation pays you or provides the services to you? Any communication from them (letters, emails, payslip-like documents) should have their contact information on it. You should have to provide the people with proof of identity before they give you any information so have it ready if you call. If the organisation has local offices, you could book an appointment with them or just go in. If you're not sure who to contact, the sidebar in this sub has loads of links to get you started.



Alternatively, you can go into your GP or any of your doctors/care team and ask them if they have any information or if they can help you find out.
 

If they know but won't tell you, you might be able to request your information through a 'freedom of information' request (AUS) or local equivalent. Please note, you can only access **your own** information through FoI.




**Note for people who are concerned about their privacy and safety:**


If anyone is reading this and you're worried someone is trying to get your personal information illegally, you can ask companies/providers of all kinds**&amp;#42;** if they offer any suitable multi-factor authentication methods or if they can put a 'password' or security question on your information or account as a last defence against people who know your birthday, SSN, or other identifying info.

Seriously, though. That sucks.

From a different perspective, I went from the other way; from being able bodied, to having invisible disabilities, to having visible disabilities... and because it was progressive, I feel horribly judge by everyone, everywhere I go; quite apart from being viewed as anything heroic, I feel like I'm seen as someone who's ""milking it,"" because ""I know a guy who's been in a wheelchair his whole life, and he gets along fine!"" or, in the case of my family; ""your dad was born disabled, and he doesn't let it limit him,"" (that one really hurts).

00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1524999168,"Hi,

I'm also on PIP and I'm now going through my second tribunal case against the DWP, so I know exactly what you're going through.

My first advice is to call or visit your local Citizens Advice Bureau. They're very good at helping people navigate the PIP application process.

It's tough to think that the DWP are on your side, and personally I don't think they are. It seems that they are doing everything they can to get people off PIP and ESA. So, when you are awarded PIP you're usually given the award for a fixed length of time, often 3 years. So what the DWP are doing is that they are arguing that they should re-assess your ""needs"" during the last year of your PIP award, so that you can continue to receive the ""correct"" award once your current PIP award runs out.

Yeah, no.

This re-assessment in the last year just gives the DWP an excuse to re-assess you early. It seems that everyone coming to the end of their PIP award are being told they are going to need a face to face interview with a ""medical professional"". In many cases the assessment goes against you and then you need to appeal, through a ""mandatory reconsideration"", which will almost certainly go against you and then you take the case to an independent tribunal. All of this is to put off as many people as possible from claiming PIP.

So what does this mean for you?

Well, you're right to be worried. It's going to be a huge struggle to hold on to your PIP, but if you take the process as far as the tribunal, currently 68% of tribunals go in favour of the person and against the DWP. It takes some effort, but stick with it so that you can say ""Fuck you"" to the government.

Although it's likely that you'll have your PIP award reduced or removed completely, if you have to go to a tribunal to get your PIP reinstated, you'll get all the money owed to you from the point at which they stopped/reduced your award, but surviving long enough to get that money will be a huge problem. Again, the CAB can help you there.

During the interview, be yourself as much as possible. If you can, write down everything you want to say about your daily struggles. Look on the internet for the criteria that PIP is measured against and describe how you struggle with each of those factors. Put it in writing if you can and have that added to your record. In my experience, the ""health professional"" knows nothing about your illnesses/conditions and they're just following a script. The stuff they wrote about me was full of lies, omissions, half-truths and distortions. If you can, write down what your life is like and get it into the written record. That is  then valuable evidence when the reconsideration and/or tribunal happens.

If you can't write everything down, create a list of all of the points you want to make during the interview and make sure you cover each point. Also, if possible, have someone else present during the interview, both as a witness and as a character reference. I don't have anyone to help me in that regard, but I'm quite happy to explain to strangers how my life is affected by my conditions, such as during my forthcoming tribunal hearing.

Are things getting stricter? Slightly, but this re-interview strategy is just the DWP being the mean cunts that they've always been.  It's not so much ""stricter"" as harder. It's a change of attitude to get us ""scroungers"" off benefits. For those of us who need and deserve the benefits, we just have to work harder to get the money. It has driven some to suicide and others into abject poverty, but it's worth the struggle to get the money that is rightfully yours. Please, stay strong.

I had my benefits slashed at Christmas - literally the day before Christmas - and I'm still waiting for a hearing date after 4 months. It's going to be at least another 2 months before I have my hearing, and last time it was a whole year before I got my award, with another 2 months before I got the money I was owed. This means that you'll be in for a long wait to get your money, and you have to survive both mentally and physically for at least a year. If you do get as far as the tribunal, you can ask for any award to have a longer duration than 3 years, such as 5 years or 10 years, but it's unlikely you'll get anything over 5 years. Still 5 is better than 3.

Oh, certainly.

&gt; Unless there was a bona fide load agreement in place detailing a repayment plan even if she was not approved for SSI, this is income. It can't be a true loan if it's only going to be paid back ""if.""

Oh, I never meant that it wasn't income; we know it'd be considered income, of course. I wasn't aware there was any conditions under which it *wouldn't* be.

&gt; It can complicate things - although the money may not be hers, she has access to it at any time, and it is therefore likely to be considered as a resource.

It doesn't concern me/us if they count what I bring in as her income (it's still *well* below $2,000/month), I just wasn't sure if it'd be a problem in terms of ""you must parse out what is yours and what is your daughter's"" -- especially when it comes to financial help from said relative, since it's given to *us* and not just *her*, if that makes sense.

&gt; From the date of filing to the date of the review.

That's part of my concern. We can prove bank statements, but as I mentioned our bank is not the only place we have/get money. If they want statements from PayPal as well, that's also fine (though it'd be *hundreds* of pages if going all the way back to 6/2016 as it'd include everything from payments/charges for postage labels to payments for seller fees). (Not to mention, there've been a number times where we've deposited money for an elderly relative and purchased things for her online since she doesn't have internet/a computer, but I'm not sure how to prove that wasn't income/our spending nor can I remember and pinpoint each time it happened. In addition, we used to have a relative on our then-cellphone plan, who paid monthly for her portion. Not sure how to prove *that* wasn't income, either, unless some sort of letter from her would suffice. Certainly all things we wouldn't have done had we *known* not to do them, but can't change what we've already done.)

Maybe I'm working myself into a tizzy without much reason, but the jumbled ball of string that is our combined finances is making me think the SSI portion is going to be a nightmare for them (and us) to sort through. Thank you for your help, though!",,,1,0,0,

For example ""difficulties with meal preparation, dressing and maintaining personal hygiene"" and ""difficulties with ADLs"" both mean basically the same thing, but if it's not a medical examiner going through the paperwork, they will have a better picture in their mind from the laymen's terms.

Unrelated to your boyfriend's case, but something I think you'll understand, my first two disability claims were rejected for insubstantial level of disability, which my doctor was shocked at and we immediately appealed both times.

The third time, I finally had a face to face appeal appointment, and during this appointment the examiner said ""I was going over your previous claims, the ones we rejected, it seems there was a misunderstanding, it says subluxation, and by that you mean you're partially dislocating your joints? Is that correct? The previous claims said subluxation and our internal medical documents only reference subluxation in terms of chiropractic treatment, but that's not what you have""

Basically the first two times I applied, the idiot reading my paperwork thought I wanted disability pension because my chriropractor said my spine was subluxed. The person compiling my paperwork completely failed to understand the medical terminology, that subluxation is a genuine term used for partial dislocation, it's not a made up word (subluxation is to chiropractors what toxins are to juice cleanse companies, I guess) and when they transcribed the report into the rigid cases system on the computer it reclassified my connective tissue disorder as a traumatic spinal injury and of course I was denied because none of my paperwork made sense after that.

It wasn't clear to me that the intake paperwork was being reviewed by social workers and the actual reviews would be attended by medical staff and that not everyone would be instructed to double check medical terminology, because it was just a cut and paste into the computer kind of deal. 


So I guess, if a medical professional is going to read the paperwork, feel free to use the most accurate terminology. (for example, I have written ""dysphagia due to achalasia"" on my latest appeal, because it's more accurate than ""swallowing difficulties"" because I feel like when a laymen reads that, they think of a stroke victim or someone with a sore throat, they don't actually picture the complete paralysis of your oesophagus.)

In uni I was totally invested in being “normal” and didn’t even tick the disabled box on my uni application (even though it was explicit about only relating to referral for follow up by centre for students with disabilities). People like me back then wouldn’t have seen the point of a group like this. My experience from running peer support groups for people with spinal cord injuries now is that people want to connect with others who share their experience, and disability is only a part of it. I’d start it with a social &amp; free food connected with your disabled student centre but make it social and not instructional. If you’re at a uni everyone is getting a lot of instruction already! Focus on the social meetup, schedule it at a good time, free food is always important, and make it fun. Once people know it’s not 100% about disability and make their own connections within the group, they are wayyyy more open to bring a part of a regular group with a name, etc.

I lived in Maryland my entire life and at 15 y/o (in 2007) contracted a rare movement disorder. They were able to diagnose it incredibly fast after so many failed attempts at other doctors around the state. I was able to be in their care through age 21. The specialists all know you by name and have a real interest in your health and wellbeing. The care I received at Children's was the best I have received in my life. 

Fast forward a decade and my healthcare experience with doctors has done a compete 180. After a year of mediocre doctors at best I was finally able to enter the Johns Hopkins system to diagnose 2 forms of Dysautonomia among a slew of other currently undiagnosed issues. I have had to leave the state I love to move in with my parents as I am no longer able to care for myself. In Upstate NY I have been unable to continue the treatment I need as recommended by the world renowned Johns Hopkins. And because of their reluctance to treat me here, the success I found in MD that was working has stoped and I am now the most debilitated I have been thus far.

My recommendation for you is to look at the school systems in Montgomery County. So many people who work in DC and live in Maryland choose this area because the school system is one of the leading school systems in the country. The only real issue is traffic. My dad worked at NIH right outside the DC boarder in Bethesda, still in MD and we lived in Germantown/Clarksburg. Unfortunately he awarded government contracts so I cannot speak to the PT or health related aspect of NIH in that regard as I just don't know. There were great special education programs at the schools I attended, but as you mentioned students were taught in separate classes, but they still interacted with the thousands of other students through electives and extracurricular activities, lunch etc. From my experience outside of the special education world, interacting with those students was always pleasant for myself and my friends and it always seemed pleasant for those students in the program as well. I know that several went on to community college and are doing great beyond graduation. If you are working for the government the family benefits are fantastic! Another area I might look at in MoCo is Rockville. If you are working in DC, the Metro stop there is honestly the best way to commute into the city. 

And of course, the one thing you need to know when moving to MD is you are going to have the best flag in the country. Reason alone to move!

I hope your son does well wherever you move and you get the care and education you need. ",,,1,0,0,

Nothing is guaranteed until it's in writing. 

&gt;She's applied for both SSDI and SSI (we didn't even know about the latter; the lawyer recommended applying for that as well), which I've read can complicate things and delay backpay.

It can slow down the back pay because there are more calculations involved, and those can't be done until the non-medical review going over everything from the date of filing to the present is completed. 

&gt;I read this morning that sharing a bank-account with someone else is a big ""no-no,"" which concerns me: my mom and I (we live together) have shared a bank account for years. 

It can complicate things - although the money may not *be* hers, she has access to it at any time, and it is therefore likely to be considered as a resource. 

&gt;Additionally, she's been getting $400 a month from a relative (not freely; half of each month is supposed to be paid back when she eventually gets backpay), 

Unless there was a bona fide load agreement in place detailing a repayment plan *even if she was not approved for SSI*, this is income. It can't be a true loan if it's only going to be paid back ""if."" 

&gt;I've read reports re: the SSI interview, that they need records of her bank account for several months to a year. 

From the date of filing to the date of the review. 

&gt;If the joint bank account is a problem, would opening up her own now help? Though bills for the both of us would still be paid jointly (for example, our DTE bill is for the household, not just her) somehow...

It won't undo what has taken place up to now, but it may help from this point forward.

During that time there is no shame in requiring help such as mobility aids and so on. Exercising can be a great tool in increasing positivity and boosting mobility, but there is no guarantee it will help with chronic pain. 

Just because obesity is stigmatised doesn’t make your pain any less valid. 

It’s real, and you deserve to have that acknowledged. 
 
If you do want to start exercising, start simply, and at home! Even just a 30 minutes walk can help you feel a little better though if your chronic pain is very bad, best to find a spot near home to do some laps of until you hit the goal so you can dash back inside if the pain is too much. 

Full water bottles and canned food can act as light weights! There are also a lot of simple stretches and exercises you can do yourself at home.

Obviously I’m not suggesting any of this is easy. But if you think losing weight will help with your pain, I thinks it’s well worth the effort. Please don’t be so hard on yourself.

I live in the UK and need to use a wheelchair when I leave my house. My GP decided that, as I could still walk (albeit in extreme pain), then I wasn't eligible to use the NHS wheelchair services. So I had to buy my chair privately. But, to get the money for the chair, I had to take the government to a tribunal hearing, which took over a year. And now, 2 years after I started the process of trying to get a chair, I'm now taking the government to another tribunal to keep getting the money/benefits I was awarded at the last tribunal hearing.

So it's not just you, it's everywhere.

I'd say, fight back. Use every method there is to make your case and to get those rejections reversed. There will be a way, but it'll take time and a lot of effort. However, being able to get out and about on your own is a cause worth fighting for.

4603dfc1-a6c6-441d-8f71-719f862c601d,1522949068,"On the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, activists are reviving the campaign for “justice for the poor” that he was there fighting for when he was killed. This is an attempt to bring together members of many different communities, including the disabled poor and their allies, to unite in the fight for justice.

From the article:

&gt;In Memphis, King called for a second phase of the freedom movement that would go beyond its first phase—the struggle for civil and voting rights—and begin a fight for “economic equality.” Phase two would demand that the nation shift its priorities away from war and military spending and toward housing, health care, education, decent unionized jobs, economic opportunity, and a sustainable income for all. He also proposed a new tactic: During his riveting speech, King called for a “general work stoppage in the city of Memphis.”

&gt;Memphis provided an alliance of the middle class and the working poor that could stop the city’s anti-union campaign and help fuel King’s national movement to end poverty. It brought together direct action in the streets and in the workplace in order to create a new and powerful direction for the movements of the 1960s: a general strike for freedom and economic justice.

You know 'at least vaguely' what could qualify you for disability. You would very likely have been in a position to contact your doctors for more information, *but you'd have to actually be you in order to do that.*




&gt;contact the service if you're on it

As the recipient/person on disability, you would have had access to information about your engagement the service. Again, *you'd have to have enough info to prove you're actually you to do this.*

I know where I live, social services doesn't actually give you any information about which parts of your application they have rejected or accepted, so I *totally* understand the question if it was legit. 


Like I said, I have no idea about my time on disability. That's why I had the little disclaimer there and then tried to give (limited) information about what OP could do to find out if they legitimately didn't know. I tried to point OP in the direction of going back to the provider or their doctors, because it's harder to impersonate someone to these services, and someone's safety could be at risk.


I admit I was initially very suspicious that they wanted to know why 'they' were on disability but turned to the internet (giving no information at all) instead of asking their doctors, social services, or anyone close to them (if they're dependant) about it.

* EEOC claims are kept private unless you go to trial. Retaliation is also prohibited by law. While a 'private conversation' between employers who, say, are friends who meet in a bar wouldn't be proveable nor necessarily preventable, there is no public record of the EEOC claim that employers would be able to find. And written records of communication during future reference checks are liable to be subpoenaed and checked for retaliation. The choice to go forward with a trial is up to you (which would go on a publicly accessible record), and would happen after months of mediation attempts and the wait period for the EEOC charge.
* Lawyer said that sometimes a letter prior to filing an EEOC charge can be effective and secure a severance package, guarantee a 'neutral' reference (limited only to HR confirming you worked for the company), etc.
* Most EEOC charges are resolved during mediation.
* You can find lawyers to work on a contingency basis.

...I wish I'd filed sooner and years ago. Highly recommend others who find themselves in this situation file.

The laws will also only begin being followed when those who break them are held accountable.

As for my other concerns, well, they're still valid but I do feel calmer about them now. I'll do everything I can to hide my disabilities (telling employers I want to try the newest trendy desk [horizontal] and maybe even offer to have its cost deducted from my check if they already have desks available or asking to WFH as an extra 'benefit' vs. telling them the real reason I'd need to) or find a job where I don't need to hide them (ie, fully remote). After and only after trying this strategy, and only if it doesn't work, I'd be ready to submit the accommodation request with help from JAN (in the US), potentially a lawyer ready, and all accompanying documentation. I'd be prepared for it go poorly, to fight any discrimination that arises, and to keep everything well-documented.",,,1,0,0,

It is legal to have the same expectations, with reasonable accommodation for disabilities, of all employees. It is also expected that when it comes to disabilities, you need to be able to perform the job competently. If with reasonable accommodation you are still not able to perform the job at the expected level of competency, you can be written up and terminated.

It is **not** legal to treat someone unfairly BECAUSE of their disability, nor to punish them specifically for their disability.

And yeah, the bathroom situation is usually pretty annoying, but hopefully you'll get lucky and the one where you are won't be so bad. If you do do side transfers onto the toilet, maybe you should bring an armless chair or stool. It might help if you put the stool in front of the toilet. That way you could side transfer to the stool then diagonal(?) transfer to the toilet. Or that might over complicate things. I really don't know, I always hated aside transfers, haha.",,,2,0,0,

It honestly isn't horrible to deal with as long as you have someone to help maneuver your chair over rough patches. You might want to find a place with a bathroom, but if you do, it'll be extremely hard to find one that comfortably accommodates your chair. If you're used to side-transfers, I don't think I've ever been in a campground bathroom that was big enough to fit my chair next the toilet. It's also rare to find bathrooms with the hand rails that are in the big stall in public restrooms. In my experience, it's not uncommon for me not to be able to close the door or even get my chair in there because it has a big step in front of it or has a door that's too narrow. Also, if you have limited mobility outside of your chair and find it hard to do floor-to-chair/chair-to-floor transfers, you should get a cot or a tall air mattress or something. Be sure to find a campsite that has a picnic table you can easily access or bring your own table, but if you don't find holding your food/plate in your lap a pain in the ass, then it isn't a huge deal.

Maybe it's my personal experience, having been subjected to things like people torturing animals in front of me as a child, as well as sexually tortured as a slightly older child. I can't say I've seen the worst of what humanity has to offer, but at least the middle range.

Whether she can apply for the program will depend on your (plus spouse if applicable) income and assets. If the family has a decent income it will likely disqualify her from the program. It’s a complex calculation (called deemed income) so you’d have to google it for details to see what would apply for you. 

Now, onto the disability part - did these issues just start? Or does she have a history of problems? Does she have an IEP/504? For childhood disability what they look at is whether the child is on-par with other children their own age.  Longevity and response to treatment also matters. So if it’s recent (or just got significantly worse) the chances of approval go down. 

What is important now is getting her the help she needs. Being on SSI will have no impact on her future. The program is designed to help her now.

You can begin by going to your local social security office or call social security’s 1-800 number.  You will get some forms to complete and fill out releases so Disability Determination Services can request her medical records. Don’t be surprised if she is denied.  Unfortunately, many applicants have to wait for a trial before an administrative law judge to be approved.

One thing about SSI is that it is an income and asset-based program and theSSA will count parents income.  Her benefit may be reduced, or if your income exceeds a certain level, can cause her benefit to stop.  In a lot of states, if you qualify for SSI, you also get Medicaid, which will help with the medical expenses.

f589729b-a56d-4072-aaef-829b216fc600,1522978817,"I'm really sorry for the slow reply. Reddit was acting peculiar and didn't even show me the notification until just now, let alone able to come and reply to it.

It is a bit stiff to push the rims when they are not turned on. Now, I use fairly low tread tires that inflate to 145 PSI and I usually keep them at 135 PSI. Anywhere level and smooth, like inside or in the slightly sloped garage or on our patio is not a problem. But I don't deny that to climb the ramp into the house or into my van I do turn them on. I think that my biggest personal challenge has been to use them only when necessary so that I don't become dependent upon them for things that used to be very easy. After a long winter, I know it's going to take a bit of self-control to leave them off when they don't need to be on so that I regain the strength lost from so much indoor activity this long snowy season.

Alternating between them and regular rims is as simple as pushing the release and pulling them off, except this time the rim doesn't weigh 2 pounds, it weighs about 35 pounds so I am grateful when my wife is willing to switch them because it is pretty physically demanding given that you need to hold on to them with very little to grab onto, push the button and pull them off without cutting your fingers on the spokes.

As for maintenance, I had a little bit of a rough go with them at one point and was aggressive on the rims trying to knock snow off. That cause me to break some of the springs that are attached to the sensors which detect how hard you are applying pressure in either pushing or breaking and they became less responsive. That's when I took them in and they commented about the broken springs and replaced some of them. I would say that was about 8 months ago and I would say that I have a few more broken in there that could stand to be repaired. Probably before a vacation this summer I will make sure they are looked at. Regarding sending them in, we have a dealer in our city and so it was just a matter of dropping them off for a day. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have and hope that my answers were helpful to you.

My one last complaint, and it was easily solved, was the default setting for the notification beeps when you turn them on her off was loud and unnecessary but easy to shut off with the remote included and the instruction manual. I should add that they were very nicely easy to customize to the amount of help and the sensitivity based on what you need. That is one thing this Smart Drive did not have and I really respected that about these. The final complaint was the LEDs on the side are enough to let you see 300 yards to either side. No way to shut those off, and they do indicate your battery level, but I just look at my remote for that, but nothing but a piece of black tape wouldn't solve. We are already conspicuous enough without adding nice bright lights shining out from either side. I thought I was done, the last thing I would like to add is that I charge them about every 10 days. They really do go a long distance between charges and when I do charge them I usually don't let them go below 50%.

I got it when my doctors were trying to recommend a full power chair to me because my insurance would not pay for a van or car lift to transport the chair, or for a ramp to our home, and we couldn't afford to pay out of pocket. A folding chair with a SmartDrive meant I could still go outside if my partner put the chair in the trunk. (We also lived outside the service range for the bus or Dial-A-Lift, so no other options for getting around.)

I live in WA, and one big bonus is that the SD doesn't short out in the rain. I've had other friends with 2 ton power chairs that can't handle an accidental puddle, and they would get stranded since no one could help lift the chair out of the way. 

One downside is that you need to be able to give your chair a few good pushes to get it started. I was usually able to do this, but it is harder to navigate hills. I'd have to go down the hill first and then turn around. 

Another issue is there is no turning mechanism, so you have to put friction on one wheel to turn. This doesn't seem so bad at first, but if you're going down the sidewalk and it isn't level, you have to clench one side for several miles, or however long you stay on the uneven road, to prevent the chair from going downhill into the road. 

If you roll over any large bumps, like dropping off a curb or rolling over train tracks on the street, the motor has a tendency to get flipped upside down. You have to detach the motor from the back wheels and put it back the right way, which is possible while seated for folks with good range of motion, but very difficult. Not something you want to be doing in the middle of the road, with cars going by, which is a problem I had. 

Also worth noting that while it works great on smooth ground, it is less than ideal for other floors. Brick or other textured flooring will cause bumps that are more pronounced than when using heavier chairs. Not great if you, like me, have stomach and nausea issues. Gravel and loose ground is serviceable, but loud and jittery, when it's a thin covering on hard ground. If it's too loose, you'll spin in place unless you manually push yourself out of the rough area. Don't try any loose ground on a hill, you'll slide back down. 

Also, very important to charge both the drive and your wristwatch after every use! The battery life is decent, but if you get into the habit of not charging it, it's easy to forget and end up stranded when it dies. You can't leave the drive plugged in too long after it finishes charging or it will mess up the transformer and you'll have to fix it. I sometimes had issues with the motor suddenly shorting out, but I think most of the time this was due to charging negligence, or overheating from too many hills. (Or trying to roll over grassy areas with harder ground. I shorted my motor from the strain, it's really not meant for it.)

All said and done, I don't regret getting it and it was exactly what I needed. I had most of the SD and my chair covered by insurance, but still had to pay out of pocket about $1000. If you already have a compatible chair (the wheels need to pop off) you might not need to pay as much. Good luck to you with whatever you choose!",,,6,0,0,

For health care, you maintain eligibility for Medicaid, but you are also enrolled in Medicare if you have SSDI (sometimes there's a waiting period). If you're making under $1,025/mo and have assets under $7,390 you qualify for QMB which will get rid of those $134 premium deductions and cover Medicare deductibles/co-pays, as well as Extra Help which will take care of premiums, deductables, and copays for prescription drugs. 


There also exist plans (SLMB, etc) that are significantly less generous but have higher asset/income limits. These together with QMB are collectively known as ""Medicare Savings Programs"" and to enroll you will need to contact your state's social services agency (not the federal Social Security Administration). You'll probably be enrolled in Extra Help automatically and be given a Medicare Part D (prescription drugs) provider, so you don't need to do anything on that front unless you're unhappy with that provider. 


You can get a refund of past Medicare premiums taken out while you were eligible for a savings program. Medicaid will be your secondary payer if Medicare doesn't cover something. It's an extremely ridiculous patchwork system but the end result is usually identical to state Medicaid coverage or better if you qualify for QMB.


Income-wise, if no-one is paying your expenses (rent/food/etc), SSI will usually be whatever the difference is between SSDI and the maximum SSI benefit of $750. So if $635 is what you're getting from SSDI, assuming you didn't include the Medicare deduction, your maximum SSI payment will be $115. 


If you're not paying all of your own expenses, SSI will be reduced due to [""in-kind support and maintenance""](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-living-ussi.htm), so in some cases it may be counter-intuitively advantageous to pay additional bills up to what SSA considers your share of the household expenses. There are also additional deductions which may or may not apply depending on individual circumstances and your caseworker can probably walk you through those.

 When discounts are warented:  
-pwd can't access the full experience due to accessibility issues.  
- business wants to attract  pwd customers.   
- business wants to do something nice.  
- helpers get in free.  
  

  
When discounts aren't warranted imo:  
  
-because pwd have it rough  
- fixed income (unless EVERYONE on a fixed income also gets discounts)   
- pity.    
- pwd's entitlement.  
  
  
I do agree that being disabled is freaking expensive,  and any savings helps.   But I don't think that's the business owner's problem if they don't want it to be.   I'm more appreciative of discounts than entitled to them.

The flip would be: aren't there other features of society actually causing your troubles?

It's almost an admission like ""*yeah, we can't fix your problems so here's a discount so you can do some things you'd otherwise not be able to do, you don't need anything else*"".  

However, having said that, I think it's also important to remember that whilst tackling systemic discrimination is super important, there is a segment of the disability community that will struggle financially no matter how much things improve - for those people, not being able to work and support themselves *is* a fundamental aspect of their disability. In a perfect world, where discrimination isn't an issue and disabled people have equal opportunities then I think it would be possible for a lot of us to work and get out of the cycle of poverty that we often get stuck in. But there are some disabled people for whom the opportunity for education and work would make little to no difference because their disability is so severe. I think it's important not to forget those people because for them tackling the root of the problem is likely not going to change their circumstances/life substantially. Of course, this is likely to be a very small percentage of the disability community (I'm guessing) but we shouldn't forget them.",,,5,0,0,

Assuming restoring the hands isn't an option, and they are profoundly deaf enough that a cochlear implant wouldn't help.. 

Sign language and braille depend on the hands... as do many other things, indirectly, using sign language and braille to help teach a deaf non oral (non speaking) person to speak.

Since I noticed the question was really about what kind of professionals should be called to take care of a person like this:

There would be an internal medicine specialist now and then to make sure she is okay. Especially until she is able to express pain, discomfort or other symptoms more clearly. When she can't tell us what's wrong or where it hurts, regularly monitoring her health would be important. 

There would be occasional visits from optometrists and audiologists to check on the health of her eyes and ears. 

But the most important part of this team is a kind, patient, understanding, and very talented special needs teacher, who will spend large parts of every day teaching the child ways to communicate with their available faculties.

After she has managed to teach the child to speak, if she can, a speech therapist will be added to the team to help her speak more understandably.

...Not TOO far into the future, that would be too easy. But I'll explore a few possibilities for technology assisted learning and communication that should be possible pretty soon.

The future doctors team will take her case, from scratch. They may be able to successfully transplant  (maybe partly) working eyes, or  bionic eyes, into her as well as an inner ear transplant from someone whose cilia (tiny inner ear hairs that absorb sound) are intact, or install bionic inner ears.

If both or one of those procedures works even partially, it will open the door to speeding up her learning with the help of the newly if partially gained sense. 

Before long, we may be able to create prosthetic hands that can allow complex finger movement through a more complex connection to signals coming from the patient's brain. We may also be able to relay tactile input from the hands back to the brain, so the patient can feel what his prosthetic fingers are touching. 

If patient is still completely blind but now had this type of prosthetic hands, that two way feedback between hands and brain now becomes central to the learning process; he will be able to learn sign language by feeling the teachers hands, now that he has deft control over how he moves his own hands, as well as the ability to actually feel what the teachers hands are signing. The prosthetic's ability to feel, if detailed enough, could also enable him to read braille.

As soon as I can learned this fact, I realised I had to drop my own internal ableism.

Just because my disability is invisible, doesn't mean I deserve to suffer in hidden silence when there are accommodations that will genuinely reduce the impact of my disability.

Yes people will stare, people will judge, people will ask me  where I get off using a disability service as someone who appears able bodied.

But society needs to learn that the majority of disabilities are invisible, and that while people with side ramps need more space for access, people with heart conditions etc need proximity, you can't treat all people with disabilities the same and try to accommodate every disability with one type of parking because ""disability"" is a catch of all term for many conditions that couldn't be more different and have more specific need.

There's also ""time extension"" but that doesn't entitle you to disability car spaces so that's irrelevant for this discussion. 

Generally when you visit a car park, they'll just have a duel purpose spot that fulfils both proximity or mobility needs.

But individual placard holders might only have one type of eligibility.

For example, my mobility aids all get stored in the boot of the car, I don't need a side ramp, I panky have a proximity permit.

Someone with a ramp will have a mobility permit, or a dual permit.

The idea is that stores offer disability parking with extra space for mobility aid access *and* they also offer additional disability parking at a standard width right up the front for people who need proximity. So people with disabilities without wheelchairs still get accommodated, but people in wheelchairs won't have to wait on other types of disabilities to vacate the ramp access spaces. 

Of course, majority of parking lots just make a ""one size fits all spot for the disabled"" and that's not really that helpful. 

Just because one customer needs the extra space for their ramp doesn't magically cure me of my syncope issues that require me to have proximity access.

I just say you have to be fully abled and functional to survive the intake process for benefits, to use them, to stop them from being taken away. The system is in desperate need of change. It is predatory against the disabled and I don't think its much of a stretch to say that all this is intentional.

I believe Americans are currently living through a passive genocide of disabled and chronic pain  patients. They want us to go away because we can't work and make money. They don't want to have to pay taxes for us to be allowed to live.

With that political current overhead, it is unsurprising to see an increase, not a decrease, in abuses directed toward the disabled, down to an individual basis of culture and media that makes these numbskulls blindly act as if we CHOSE to be disabled. Or claim we aren't disabled, we're just lazy so we deserved it. Or deserved it simply because we dared to live. ""One less useless eater to leech off my paychecks.""


I would love for the entire world to fully understand disability, what it's like and how important disability services are, what the disabled live through every day.

But my country is instead choosing to push us farther away, label us Other, label us Poor, and suddenly theyre cheering as we die off.

We are in a situation where hoping people will just understand is not enough.

We need to develop strategies for individual survival in various likely encounters. We need to be conscious of our own safety and health at all times. We are seen as easy targets by our financially predatory society, and must take measures to be prepared and equipped to defend yourself sufficiently. We must be relentless in getting doctors to medicate appropriately. We need emergency backup everything we can set up with anyone we know, so there is a fallback if the government tries to kill you through benefit cuts. - emergency backup homes (so you can move in with a friend if kicked out of disability housing), food sources like food banks and community meals (for when some asshole at SNAP randomly decides you can't have food anymore), etc.

A long term strategy to educate the world about disability issues does go hand in hand with a short term self defense strategy. But I think the best way to go is to do both.

Also, if you are on ACA(Affordable Care Act) then you are also on welfare. Almost all of these benefits are tied to income per family. Kids, give tons of weight though. Seeing that you have 2, if your Wife doesn't make a shit ton of money, you probably qualify for something.

Any disability, currently depending, cases should be referred to your lawyer. If you don't have representation, I would recommend it. NOT the ""Advice firm"", that guy was trying to peddle. But an actual legit lawyer specializing in disability cases. Do your research, first!

If you have SSI, or SSDI, then you shouldn't have to worry. Your original statement referred to tertiary benefits(like that Free parking pass), and your local Welfare Office will have all the information you need.

Most tertiary benefits, are through private companies that offer benefits to the disabled, Veterans, and the elderly. Denny's, Cracker Barrel, and Bob Evans like chain restaurants generally offer these discounts. These are called tertiary benefits.

There are local and state wide government benefit programs for people on disability, if you qualify. It's mostly income based, as it per family.

I'm saying this gently, go to your welfare office! They are seriously there to help, any and all people. Sometimes the workers seem blase, that's because they see some shit. A lot of unwashed masses of poor and the under educated. That refuse to help themselves in any way. Their frustration levels are high, because people really do try to game the system.

00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1523799494,"When my disabilities hit me I got very depressed, attempted suicide, and had to give up my past life. So here is my 2 cents worth:

You have to be willing to give up everything in your previous life. You have a new life now and that can be a wonderful thing. But giving up your life means going through a grieving process, periods of depression, bouts of anger and frustration. But the person you used to be is gone. You're a new person now.

If you can't walk a useful distance, get some assistance, whether it's a walker, crutches, manual chair or a power chair, just get what suits your new life. Don't struggle when you don't have to. And that's a whole other mental process you'll have to go through. Grieve for the person you were, and then struggle to be the best person you can be. You'll need to find ways to stop giving a fuck about things. And you'll need to grow a thicker skin so that the ignorant reactions you'll get from other people just bounce of your no fucks attitude.

You'll need to have a good hard look at yourself to find out who you are and who you want to be. Find out what really interests you, break it down to the essentials and then find a way to participate. For example, you might have a love of photography, but you can't handle a DSLR with long lens attached. So get a compact camera, or use your phone. I've seen some fantastic photographs created with compact cameras, a thousand times better than many professional images. It might then mean that you get more into image editing as you find that you can manage to alter the images on a computer to get the final result you were trying for.

I can no longer walk very far, so there are huge parts of the world I can't get to any more. Even in the city I live in, over 75% of the stores, pubs, clubs, bars, cinemas etc. are out of my reach. Instead of trying to get somewhere out of reach, I now focus on getting the best out what's in my reach. I've found a cinema I can get to fairly easily that's totally wheelchair accessible and that's helped a lot as it's somewhere outside my house to go and really like films. I know which food stores I can get to, which clothes stores cater for people in wheelchairs and I've figured out how to use public transport to get out and about. If I can't buy something in a store then there is Amazon for online shopping. It's taken time, and there have been setbacks, but I'm slowly constructing a new life. It takes years, it's not an overnight process.

It's going to be a huge mental upheaval and you really need to find people to support you, even if it's just a therapist to complain to about how shitty your life is that week. Drop anyone who's giving you a hard time, you don't have time for that shit now. It's hard to start again, but try to think of it as being different, not worse.",,,2,0,0,

I went from nursing, regularly biking 100 miles a week, yoga, running, skateboarding, softball, painting, drawing, etc., to being unable to get groceries if there wasn't a handicapped spot open, then crying in the car afterwards because it was so tiring and painful, much less being able to lift a patient or stand at an easel for hours. One time I took off a new pair of shoes and found them filled with blood because I couldn't feel them cutting into me feet. The nerves can heal, but it can take a long time. 

In your case would it be possible to do some pt/ot work? I've had to do it so many times and it has really helped. Having some guidance had always helped me. Sometimes it is hard to find the starting point and the proper exercises that can get you back where you want to be, or at least closer to it. They can be really creative problem solvers, too, when it comes to finding new ways to do things you want, or finding a similar alternative. I'm in therapy now for spinal fusion, I've done it for a prior back surgery that crippled me, lots of dislocations, and I had to do cardiac rehab after cancer tx left me with heart failure. It has made all the difference. Also, have you tried any meds that may help neuropathy? I was on neurontin for it for a couple years after treatment and it zonked me out a bit but it helped.

I’ve been a competitive athlete of some kind since I was a kid, so losing my ability to even walk in a straight line for more than 15 metres fucking sucked. 

You have to learn to leave your “old life” behind and start new.

5df7faea-ee94-41c1-9c23-62598e4f0ecf,1523651612,"First, know that you are not less of a person for having this disability. I felt like that for a long time after developing my disability because some people kept making me feel like I was less than or made me feel that I was not doing enough. When I finally ended up parting ways with them, I decided that I would never let anyone make me feel less than again. It was holding me back. You cope with this on your own schedule, and don't let anyone else bring you down. Many will not understand your disability. You aren't your disability. You are your personality, what makes you happy, your hopes, your dreams, your loves, your fears, and your passions. 

I felt unlovable and useless after my then-boyfriend at the time broke up with me, but my mother, even though she and I don't get along most of the time, insisted the whole time that I was going to be ok and supported me. I appreciated her helping to take care of me. Then, when I started to go out again and worked to remain positive, I found a wonderful man who doesn't care that I'm about as weak as a child and will have to manage this condition all my life. These people exist. He tells me that he is constantly amazed at how strong I am for carrying on every day and dealing with this like it's just another thing. I laugh and tell him he should've seen me in the ER in pain not caring if I lived or died. I contribute to the relationship in other ways. 

I was a contracted AFROTC cadet when I developed my physical disability, so I totally feel you on the ""I was so strong and able and now I'm as weak as a small child who needs help with damn near everything WTF do I do"" feeling. It took me months to come to terms with losing a future plan where I wanted to serve and could do anything to having to unwillingly accept that I have limitations that I have to consider. It takes time to adjust to a new normal, but it doesn't always have to stay that way. 

I also have trouble opening up containers... Especially stupid plastic bottles with their tight seals. Sometimes I have someone around to open it for me, and other times I struggle like a child for ten minutes then give up or manage it with a workaround. I get fatigue, I need to alternate between sitting and standing more than regular people, I can't make a complete fist with either hand, the arthritis in my body can be not so bad one day and crippling another. I almost lost all my hair. It's growing back now. My disability can change every day and over time. If it attacks my kidneys, then I might have to get chemotherapy. Chronic illness and pain sucks. I nearly died once when my blood got so thin that it was bleeding through my veins and had blood coming out of all sorts of places (nose, vagina and not in the normal period way, gums in mouth, eye, etc.). 
Fun times! But I lived.

And since I did, I figured: I'm still around for some reason, it isn't my time, my disability might be a pain, but it hasn't killed me yet, so I'll go live it up and make Death chase me. Because lying in the hospital bed made me realize that I still had many things I wanted to do. One of those things is talking to others with disabilities - others who have been through what I've been helped me when I was going through the toughest part of this, and I appreciated it. So I pay it forward. I try to help when I can in this subreddit and others. 
There should be support groups for cancer patients, if you are interested. Ask some of the nurses at your treatment center or the hospital if they know. I never went to any in person ones for my disease, but I did just fine with talking to others with my disability online. 

They told Stephen Hawking he had two years to live once. He didn't let it stop him and lived a long, full life that changed the lives of many. Know that you must not give up and that you can do it. It will hurt, you will have many days where you simply want to crawl into bed and sleep forever, but you have much still to do. Depression may come, and mine resurfaced last year as I developed this disease.

Now, I look forward. 
I want to go to France. I've had this dream since I was a child (I blame my French teachers starting with the one in elementary school), and I'm so close to getting to go. I haven't been out of country in years, and I'm afraid to go so far from my doc and support system, but I'm going to go. I won't let it stop me. I also joke that the Europeans and their healthcare is better, so they won't just leave me to die because I'm a foreigner.
One of the ways I cope is by remembering this dream. 

Never forget that you can still achieve dreams and reach your goals. It is hard, and right now you might have to take a break from actively pursuing them to focus on your health, but that's ok.

I live for the things that make me happy. Hanging out with my friends (at school this is anime club usually), helping others, spending time with my boyfriends, going to geeky cons. When I drive, my favorite way to do it is in the summer with the windows down and the music up.

I used to play volleyball. I miss it. Serious physical activity and sports are a hobby I can't really have again unless this goes into remission and all the joint pain disappears one day. I hope so, but I won't hold my breath. I do physical therapy twice a week now. They have special equipment at places for weaker than average people to exercise, manage pain, etc. Physical therapy is good. See if you can get your doctor to write a prescription for it and find a place nearby. Try going. They will ask you about your pain now and what you can/cannot do. Then they will help you set a goal and track working towards it as you go along. I can't really go to the gym much anymore, but I feel almost as good going to physical therapy.
I used to like writing a lot more. My hand can't handle writing as much as it used to. I type more now. Sometimes I write even though I know my hand will get stiff or hurt anyways. Sometimes my fingers can't type properly. 
I love reading, but staying still in one position to read usually means I get stiff and sore and hurt. But I still read.
I lost some of my ability to participate in hobbies as well. 
Be patient with yourself and your body. See if there is a way to do any of your hobbies with your disability by getting assistance. If not, then that's ok. You can find a new hobby or something else to enjoy. It's the little things. 

I'm very passionate about trying to support others with similar issues. We all need someone who believes we can do it, even if we think we cannot. My sister supported me last summer when I was going through a lot of the hard part. She's seen me at my worst, my best, and everything in between. She watched me struggle to cope, struggle to open things, struggle to lift heavy objects - all things I used to be able to do better than she could. She stayed with me overnight in the hospital. I love my sister :) Your parents help you now, so see if you can ask them to help you more while you go through this. Or a good friend. 

I realize that I kind of just threw a bunch of disorganized words at you, but your situation reminds me of mine in a way. Sorry if it was an unreadable mess! I don't have cancer, but my mother had breast cancer after my dad died. I was 11/12 when that happened, and I watched her go through it. I don't want anyone else to feel like I did when I was first going through my stuff. I'm here to listen/chat/talk if you ever want to PM me about it. And, see if you can find anyone on here with what you have.

Normally my wife helps me, but a few days each month she is out of town so I employ an aide through an agency. Since I need help very sporadically it is usually a different person each time. She (occasionally he) helps me get into and out of my shower, dried off, and into the wheelchair. That is the most important thing since I am prone to falls, and falls in a bathroom are particularly dangerous. She also helps with cooking and some light housekeeping that I cannot do myself.

The job does not require a CNA, and the agency I use does not offer care that would require a CNA or home health care certificate. However, many of the aides do have CNAs. Some work as CNAs full time but do home care part-time. A couple of them were RNs but did home care part-time a few hours per week.

If the job you have for the summer is work as a CNA that would provide better experience than a home care aide. And while in nursing school you would probably find a hospital CNA job. But home care like what I use will make a good part-time job if you want one in the future.

Of course, many disabled people need CNAs (or even RNs) for at least part of their care. There are far more agencies offering home care or companion care than offer CNA or nursing care. I am sure that there is a need.

Before I was physically disabled myself I actually did in home direct support work. Now that I'm physically disabled myself, I employ direct support workers in my home.

Depending on where you live, getting this type of employment will be different. In my state people can get approved for a waiver where medicaid will pay for in home services. Here, there are 3 waivers, physical disability, traumatic brain injury, and frail elderly. Depending on the individuals needs, they may be the ""boss"" or they may have agency directed services where a case worker or somebody similar would be the ""boss"" for the direct support workers.

Outside of waiver services, there are many agencies that offer in home health services where the clients pay themselves. You'd have to look for ones in your area and find out about their application processes.

One thing you should know about doing in-home stuff, they'll usually put you through a criminal background check, etc. This is to make sure you haven't been convicted of abusing elderly or disabled patients in the past.

&amp;nbsp;

When I applied for PIP the first time in 2015, I was awarded 2 points on basic living and nothing for mobility. I took it to appeal, which took a year for the tribunal hearing, so summer 2016. At the hearing I was awarded 8 points on living and 8 points of mobility. The DWP didn't appeal and all the money arrived about a month after the hearing - a big chunk of money that took me over the limits of allowed money in my bank account. Once I'd paid off my debts and bought my first proper wheelchair there was nothing left, but that was OK as my weekly benefits had increased as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Initially I was given the award for 3 years, but the DWP now re-assess you when there's a year left of the award, so I actually got the award for 2 years before the process started all over again, in summer 2017.

&amp;nbsp;

After the second assessment by a ""medical professional"" I was awarded 6 points for living and 8 points for mobility, so I lost the living component of PIP. And this meant that I lost other benefits. In effect, my benefits were cut in half at Christmas - literally the letter arrived by the last post before Christmas 2017. I've appealed the decision and I'm now waiting for the second tribunal hearing date.

&amp;nbsp;

Like you, I'm struggling with the effect this process has on my mental well-being. And like you, if this tribunal goes against me then I'll kill myself as I can't live on the benefits I currently get, and I'm not sure I can keep going through the process of being assessed as being OK when I'm not. Right now I'm only holding on long enough to be able to say fuck you to the government when I win my case.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment the success rate is close to 70% for tribunal hearings with very few being appealed by the DWP, so you've got a great chance of winning your case. Also, the people who make the decision in the tribunal have nothing to do with the DWP and are usually friendly and understanding of your issues.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, you have the option to ask the tribunal to alter the length of your award - 3 years is typical. Ask for 5 or 10 years if there's no chance of improvement. That way, with 5 years, you'll get a couple of years of peace.

&amp;nbsp;

As I said, mail me if you want to talk, or just need a supporting voice. Stay strong and fuck the DWP.",,,2,0,0,

There's those that want to specifically make any issues that don't seriously and severely limit your quality of life a seperate thing from a disability, like mental illnesses that are mild to moderate, some amputations, stuff like that.

Then, there's the people who believe that disability isn't a dirty word, and it's just, literally, that you cannot do certain things. I'm blind, I cannot see. No judgement, just a statement of facts.

But, that gets to the root of, are you disabled, or SSDI-level disabled?

Personally, I wish that it wasn't worded in such a way as to associate disability with only those who can't wor'k much if at all, and instead was, like, social security insurance for the severely disabled, like SSISD or something. But that's a rant for another day.

However, with most disabilities, they're not going to be considered legally a disability since the ones that really change things are the ability to travel independantly, walk, drive, sit and stand, or communicate effectively enough to live and shop on your own, being affected by whatever disability.

That's an excellent point and one that I worry about a lot. There's tons of absolute garbage designs out there and lots of poor construction as well, which is inexcusable e.g. utilities placing poles obstructing the path, push buttons that can't be reached, ramps to nowhere; I could go on and on. When I say a negligible difference I'm talking about a difference that can't be seen or felt.

For example, ramps are required to be sloped so that they don't exceed 1:12 slope, which is frequently stated as 8.33% slope. First off, a hundredth of a percent slope can't even be measured by field instruments, so we're focused on meeting an 8.3% slope. The best available tools for field measurements have an error of plus or minus 0.1% IIRC, which is two hundredths of an inch in height over a span of two feet. That's less than the thickness of a business card and it makes the difference between rejecting a ramp and it passing. 

I believe there are much bigger fish to fry for accessibility and that level of focus on tiny details is counter-productive for access in the broader scheme of things.",,,3,0,0,

The thing with the planes is that they wouldn't have to get rid of seats on every plane for every flight. They could have some seats which are removable and used only when someone has their own wheelchair they want to ride in. On larger planes there is quite a bit of free space already. I flew a 777 back from Hawaii and I felt like I could have rolled right on it and parked horizontally across 2 bulkhead seats and been fine (not that this would be a designated space, I'm just illustrating the amount of space).

So on large planes they may only have to yank one seat, if that. On smaller planes, they might have to take out 2. Since those are lower revenue flights anyway, they aren't going to lose a lot of money on a flight with a wheelchair user and that cost could be covered quite easily. I mean, pretend a $600 coach wheelchair ticket results in one $600 regular seat being lost. But on a plane with 300 people, that's $2 per ticket for that flight. Pretend 1 in 3 flights have a wheelchair user and that's .67 cents per ticket to make up.

Agencies and PWD would benefit immensely from working together more, but that won't happen unless the paranoia of a lawsuit cools off. It's gonna be a huge challenge because PWD have felt ignored for so long and that's just brewed further anger and discontent.",,,3,0,0,

I was wondering if it's typical for designers/builders to try to come so close to the 1:12 slope that going over it is way more likely than if they aimed for something less than that? Granted, more slope=more materials and time but with a guaranteed slope less than 1:12 wouldn't that be a safe way to approach ramps since less incline would never be less safe? At the end of the day, these items really end up being about safety, not just navigation or logistics. Having a degree in engineering (but never having worked in the field), I recall FoS being such an important concept when working with stresses/loads, do you think framing it as safety AND access would make a difference?

Advocates  and PWD have set the bar really high for accessibility and I thank them for doing that. However, it's imperative that the requirements be  technically achievable so that new construction for accessibility doesn't have to be reconstructed for a negligible difference. 

Costs for accessibility infrastructure have skyrocketed because of contractors fearing that they will have to redo their work and remobilize. Agencies don't feel entitled to accept marginally non-compliant work because they fear lawsuits, forcing contractors to re-do their work. So, as the costs for accessibility increase, less infrastructure can be improved and agencies will fail to meet their programmatic accessibility obligations.",,,12,0,0,

This can come from medical providers, mental health doctors, etc. or a combination of all.  Don't have them just fill out the paperwork sent by SSA, but also write a letter explaining how your disability affects your everyday living.  You can also have friends or family write a letter explaining how you are affected daily.  For example, you can have your significant other say that he needs to help you with grocery shopping because you have a difficult time around people in the grocery store.  
Another suggestion is to have a disability attorney help you with your appeal letter and case.  Most offer free consultations so you can meet with them and find out if they think you have a chance.

Having your medical providers support your application is helpful, but your medical evidence is what they use to decide your case.  However, you might consider getting a second opinion from another provider.  You also need to follow all of your doctor's treatment recommendations,  because for most diagnosis, you need to prove that your condition(s) are disabling despite consistent treatment.  If a medication doesn’t work or causes side effects, let your doctor know so they can try something else.  For mental illness, you can also try therapy or counseling as a treatment option.  Send all of your relevant medical records to DDS while your appeal is ongoing so they can consider the new information.

If you are disabled and need SSI, then continue fighting.  However, know that SSI traps you in poverty and limits how much money you can have in the bank.  Your benefit also will be affected by your parents or spouse's (or even significant other if you live together) income.

As a practical matter - you don't need a doctor's support to get on disability. Its not up to your psychiatrist. That being said, one thing that SSA looks at it what you've tried for treatment and your response. So if you aren't taking meds (have you tried them all?) that is going to hurt your case. 

If your psychiatrist thinks that there are other options, I think you should at least explore them. SSI should be the last resort, and it is not a long term solution. $750ish per month (and that is if you qualify for the max) is not enough to live on. What does your work history look like? We see if often with younger claimants that they've never even attempted work, under the assumption that they don't think they could do it.

So, if you want to start splitting hairs, a treating source *can* have influence over the decision *if* they make some sort of definitive statement regarding any sort of disabling limitations. 

A doctor can't say ""Steve is disabled"" or ""steve is not disabled"" - disabled is a legal definition, and so they are not qualified to make that assessment. 

However, a doctor can make statements about what they think a person can/can't do. They can say ""I don't think Steve will ever be able to work well with others"" or ""I think that Steve will do well in an office setting if properly medicated"". **Those** kinds of statements do carry weight. I will say that I cannot think of any case where I've had a doctor purposely say something that would torpedo a case.

If you feel lost during the Hearing look to them to help you answer. Answer everything as truthfully and honestly as you can. Don't hold back but try to answer as tactfully as possible. It's OK to cry. Some of the topics in the Hearing are really emotional. I'm not sure if your Lawyer has mentioned it, but there's usually only a few people in the room, Judge, you, Lawyer, court reporter, and someone hired by SS to see if you would be qualified to do any work, based on your previous employment/skills vs. your disabling conditions and if you could be considered a reliable employee. 
One thing I hadn't necessarily considered as part of my disability was having children. My lawyer brought up day of, during the meeting we had right before seeing the Judge. I was 31 at the time and she wanted to prepare me that the Judge would ask if I was planning on having children because of my age. During the Hearing I was asked and answered honestly stating that I did not think that with my disabling conditions I would be able to be a great mom, or even a good one. I said that I was unsure of my prognosis so I would never want raise another human being  with the uncertainty ahead of me. 
I remember being so nervous about the Hearing (before, during, and after). I questioned myself for a bit afterwards even though my Lawyer assured me that I did great. Waiting for the decision letter to come was a really hard time for me too, because it took around 3 weeks. Go in and do the best that you can. Advocate for yourself. 
Also, check out section 14.06 of the blue book ""Undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease"". While EDS may not be listed under the name I believe it is a qualifying condition under 14.06. My disabling conditions at the time of application and subsequent Hearing were Occipital Neuralgia, Chronic Migraines, Fibromyalgia, and depression/anxiety. Since then I have continued to figure out what's wrong and now have more disabling conditions that were added during my continuing disability review. I was approved for 3 years of disability in September 2014, and just finished my first continuing disability review in January 2018. I hope this info helps.

Would a mobility scooter be any different in the situation?

I know it sucks, and it's always expected that it's the burden of the oppressed to educate the oppressor (especially without upsetting them!) but what would it be like if you prepared for brief community education spiel then went out in a wheelchair and if anyone gives you a dirty look you smile and wave to them?

Tell me, are you experienced in working with conus medullaris syndrome?*""

...and wait for their blank stare.

""*You are a neurologist, aren't you? I mean, to be diagnosing people off the cuff like that you'd just have to be, right?*""

Of course, you're going to get called an asshole for putting someone in their place but to hell with busybodies. You'd better believe that one experience like that would make a person think twice before insinuating themselves in other people's disabilities.

A perfectly working hand and arm with a glove on is a poor simulation of just about any upper limb impairment I've ever seen (most of them in cases of CP, to be clear).

The first thing to know - make sure that the amount your working is under $800 gross per month. If you work too closely to the SGA amount, it is difficult for an examiner to argue for you being disabled and unable to work that SGA amount. We understand that people have bills to pay. 

The other thing to consider is what your medical conditions are, and *why* they prevent you from working. If your issues are physical its a little easier to argue that you can still work some. Sustainability (the ability to work a 40 hour work week) is part of the disability decision tree.

Complained at the airport, never received the follow up email. Had to call three times to get my complaint acknowledged. The worst part is Singapore has free wheelchairs in the terminal which DH could have pushed me on, but those with little power decided I could not use that because I had  requested assistance.  

Air france is almost as bad. I got dumped in a far corner of the airport with all other wheelchair users. Again, would not allow DH to push me. I was in tears when I got to the lounge, and the manager there came to me and begged me to complain, as I was not the first to arrive in tears with how they had been treated. Again nothing besides a email stating they were looking into it.

We have bought our own travel one for our next trip. We are hoping since it is my own they will let DH push me.

Shout out to Vietnam Airlines and SGN airport. Excellent service. You have your own attendant who will take you shopping, to eat, even to the smoking room, and they stay with you until you board.

Sweden's arlanda airport didn't even have one for me when I was checking in. They said it was a short walk and I was fine since I was standing. Sweden surprised me with how badly they treat those who need assistance. Such as a disabled hotel room which you had to either walk up or down stairs to get to the elevator, no ramp. 

Moscow makes you wait outside of customs for the chair, so no eating inside terminal or duty free shopping, but when they arrive with the chair you go straight to the plane. Had the coolest ride in a converted catering truck to get us up to the plane instead of using the steps.

Edit: India was also like Vietnam, awesome service and very respectful. Special customs for wheelchairs, and attendants who were wonderful. I had a male attendant, so at security, the women officers for the women's line came and pushed and helped me through. Everyone was super nice. ",,,14,0,0,

325d67c2-8eaa-4f0b-b88b-33346ad4c36f,1524270821,"I’ve been working on a story that includes a disabled character for a while now. In this character’s very earliest form he was comic book hero that was basically a disabled Iron Man. I came up with this character when I was in fifth grade. His wheelchair had rockets and his inventions helped him walk.

It probably reveals my mindset at the time that I was fantasizing about the idea of an inventor who would become great if only he were cured. But it’s not unusual that someone comes up with a character whose mild mannered secret identity is disabled. I can understand your intent with the character. 

It may be in your best interst and save you quite the headache to not include a disabled character at all, and Im sure you had good intentions. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t. You may have intended to show that a disabled hero can be heroic, charming, just like anybody else and the only way they’re different is their disability. That they’re not mindful of their disability so other people shouldn’t be mindful of their disability and the only way that their disability effected them was by making them strong and capable of facing any obstacle. 

That’s all generally well and good and acceptable, but the truth is that none of that is entirely true for every disabled person. I don’t think there is any disabled person who is totally unaffected psychologically by their disability. A lot of disabled people deal with pain, often chronic, sometimes excruciating. A lot of disabled people are insecure or depressed about their disability. Probably every disabled person has at least been teased, if not bullied, if not tormented as kids, in high school, as adults. Most disabled people were expected to have a ‘sense of humor about it’, to make fun of themselves, belittle themselves to show people they know their place. It’s why disabled people are so frequently singled out as “cringe” if they try to display talent or fit in like anybody else and aren’t flawless in their exicution. When a disabled person watches movies, TV, or listen to music they don’t see themselves represented. At all. Disabled characters are played by able bodied actors, are directed by able bodied directors, are written by able bodied writers. When you consider all of this it can be understandable that some disabled people can have social anxiety, can be socially awkward, or socially removed. Also, some disabled people have some trauma, have PTSD, and can suffer from unrelenting anxiety.

And some disabled people are not insecure and do not have anxiety. They can have a sense of humor for their own sake because they find the idea of themselves being pushed down a hill in their wheelchairs deeply, absurdly funny, and the only thing they really ask of anybody else is that they not cause anyone worry and aren’t in need of sympathy.  It depends on the person, their environment, upbringing, and what kind of disabilities they’ve been dealing with.

I think maybe the crucial difference between my disabled inventor hero and your character is that my character cured himself and became heroic through his abilities and his abilities alone. It sounds like your story, an outside source cured him and he became heroic, not through his or her own ability, but via an outside source. As you’ve said, you realize how problematic that is. 

With everything I’ve learned I think that if I were writing a disabled character today who was given a magic power to fight evil and have their disability cured, I’d probably decide to have the character opt not to be cured. I’d definitely avoid having their contribution to the team come from the disabled character displaying any physicality in any way because that also implies that the character’s disability diminishes their value to the team. 

I’ll give you a general sense of some of the ideas I’ve been working on because I think it’s important how a disabled character (Or any character) is represented. One idea involves a character’s disability making them uniquely qualified to wield a power. Another idea is that the power itself is what causes the character to become disabled. (This is the idea I’m currently working on). I suppose you could also go the way of a person with a disability wear a VR headset and control a robot. I’m sure there are other options. For video games, the best representation of a disabled character is probably Mass Effect. Incidentally, I have the same disease that Joker has.

Do you know a disabled person who can write or be a consultant?

Don’t give up hope for a better future!

Take it from a friend—try not to get hung up on comparisons. It will only harm YOU, not anyone else.

I decided to look at the LGBTQ history as a hopeful one. My sister is a lesbian, and we have found so much commonality in our experience of feeling unaccepted, and solidarity on our path toward self-acceptance.

The examiner will probably have reviewed your medical records prior to the exam. It's possible that there will be notes about your behavior before and after the exam (""patient observed arriving in a car driven by someone who did not accompany her to the exam""). You'll probably cover your social, medical, and mental history at the beginning. Then you'll be asked a series of questions designed to assess your cognitive function. 

I would wager that most people who make this sort of post ignore this advice, but nevertheless, I believe you should not do any prep work for this portion of the exam. Don't ask around about what sorts of cognitive functioning questions you'll be asked. There is no benefit. If you know what questions will be asked and prepare your answers, then you will appear to function better than you normally would. If you know the questions and intentionally sabotage your responses, then there is a likelihood that the examiner will determine that you are not giving a genuine effort and that could completely tank your claim. There are plenty of people trying to cheat the system and having ""did not give full effort"" in your case file is a great way to get lumped in with that group.

The significance of substance abuse issues is difficult to predict. It depends on the location, the judge, any medical experts, and the facts of the case. Discontinuing alcohol is a great point in your favor. Many people who have been diagnosed with depression will continue to drink alcohol and then whine about how the medication is ineffective. That's what happens when you mix an anti-depressant with a depressant (alcohol). Whether any other substances are interfering with your treatment is also something which may be influential in the judge's decision. Frankly, it's not that unusual for someone who has a problem with marijuana to appear ""spaced out"" or to ""remain blank"". 

The danger of relapse is something that should come across from the entirety of the treatment record. The CE examiner could handle this several different ways. If it's addressed, it will probably be in the context of your treatment history and not based on the short evaluation. ",,,2,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1524678202,"one reason they do CDR reviews on everyone (even those with permanent conditions) is because that is how they most often catch fraudulent activity. 

Once someone really starts digging into their case and asking questions is when things like hiding work activity, rep payee misuse, SSI asset hiding. The first CDR is also when most people who lied about their medical condition get caught. They will go through great length to scam their way onto the rolls but then don't keep it up afterwards. 

Can it be a waste of resources? I guess it depends on the definition of waste. For those annual/semi-annual questionnaires that go out (the 2-3 page ones) the total SSA manpower is maybe 2 hours + postage.

You could also find out from SSA what your estimated monthly benefit would be and compare it to what you’re making working. That would help inform your decision.

SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) is for those who have earned sufficient SS work credits. To qualify SSA must determine you are disabled from working any occupation and have sufficient SS work credits. You can check your eligibility at www.ssa.gov/myaccount

SSI (Supplemental Security Income) us for those who have NOT earned sufficient SS credits. It's more of a welfare type benefit. To qualify SSA must find you are disabled from working any occupation and meet strict household income and asset limitations.

Pursuing SSDI/SSI is a long arduous process.

The best recommendation I can provide here would be to have your brother become a member at a MMJ only dispensary. When entering their care, they will help determine the best strains, dosing, and useful information on how to consume the medicine.

My personal treatment plan involves using a vaporizer and small \(like a couple millimeters across\) of wax concentrate. They grow the specific strain I use for me in their own grow houses. Also saves me about 50&amp;#37; over the cost of recreational.

The dose produces enough vapor for a single hit, and a single hit is not enough to make me feel ""stoned"", but it is enough to bring my anxiety level to a lower baseline \- which in turn increases the threshold for my triggers. This low dose also means that I can work without being high. I don't drive after consumption though. I take the light rail to work.

One thing I’ve added as a kind of “technology age” question to ask myself, especially on internet forums, is *do I have enough information about this person and their situation to be able to consider my response “right speech,” no matter how many of those boxes I can check off on that list.* In most cases, I’m realizing that the answer is usually “no.” In that case, I either ask more questions to try to understand better, or just humbly exit the conversation.

In the case of the person we are both replying to, I replied because I have a brother with PTSD from war, and so I think I have a deeper understanding that might allow me to approach the situation with kindness and good will. I can really recognize how far that person has come, and how much improvement they’ve had, and that they are getting support. Combat PTSD is not the kind of thing that goes away with a change in meds, and may always have some kind of residual reactivity associated with it. It can take a lot of time to retrain the new reactive set point, which may never totally return to its original point. Of course, suggesting someone might be in need of additional support can be kind, but it can help to establish a connection first before assuming one might have something useful to contribute.

In this case, I try to think of what would be most helpful for me in my own times of increased reactivity. I’ve had ME/CFS for 14 years, and it took me a long time to discover Metta, but it has truly been a saving grace for me. The greatest gift I can offer someone in their state of reactivity, is my lovingkindness and compassion. I hope that others can do the same for me when I am most defensive/reactive. If not, I can have Metta for myself in those times. Practicing Metta meditation has been much more helpful to me when it comes to “right speech,” than referring back to the rules. Of course, they are a good guideline to check in with, but I’ve found that all of the wisdom I need is right there in my own heart, if I can only pay attention to it and cultivate it through meditation.

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1524675596,"I think you’re not entirely clear on what PRN means. It’s the self-scheduled dosing of a prescribed medication, or “as needed” dosing. Once a prescription is issued, you are left to self-medicate in order to get your illness under control. It stands in contrast to a physician directing “two puffs of Platinum Og per hour”, which leaves no room for adjustments.

Perhaps you’re right, and I should have said “You came in *hostile*, then got angry and tried to take someone’s head off, then got nice, and then got angry again.” That might have been more clear, as my intent was to highlight that you came in looking for a fight, and then exploded when you got one, before vacillating wildly between two extreme points of affect. 

I’m just trying to point out that it seems like you need some additional help. Maybe it’s therapy you need and not an increased dosage of medication as I originally suggested. Perhaps that assumption was callous. 

Either way, I stand by my original point that you need to re-evaluate your behavior and the mood swings that precede it because: 

&gt; If you attack me, expect the same in return. If you are nice to me, expect the same in return. The person that got cut down, started by cutting me down.

is not the way to live a productive and happy life. Which is what I hope you can get to.

Your assertion that I am the one who is somehow out of the loop and incorrect, rather than giving any consideration to the idea that the several people who have pointed out your inappropriate reactions could be correct sort of solidifies my point. You’re out of touch both with the true nature of the way you’re responding, and with what would be considered a normal response by society,

I can’t make you do anything, obviously. My hope was that you had already thought about a (medicinal or therapeutic) adjustment, and that my comment would solidify your urge to pursue that. Since this doesn’t seem to be the case, then maybe what I’ve said is something you’ll remember and think about later, before you fall asleep or after the next time you explode at your wife. The patience of our caregivers is not inexhaustible. 

I honestly hope you get to a better place than you are now.

Edit: This post was originally written in all sincerity, but after a bit of research it seems even more important now. I was curious to know whether you were just concern trolling, and I found [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/8dxefj/comment/dxr7gwy?st=JGFEKBHF&amp;sh=26b24101) comment you made 3 days ago, bragging about having to be restrained by police. When another veteran pointed out the same things I’ve said here, you responded by telling them to “go eat a bullet and make America a better place.” 

So many of your comments are like that, and it’s heart breaking that you live such an anger-driven life. I saw earlier that you commented on how your wife has stayed with you through this. I hope you’re well enough to see what an amazing and wonderful thing that is, but also how close to the end of that you could be. No one deserves the type of abuse you’re throwing around on Reddit, and if it is indeed a reflection of your home life then I would bet you’re on a ticking clock, whether you know it or not.

I wish someone could reach out and help you. I know the VA situation isn’t great. Maybe you’re lucky and have access to private care, or have a contact at the VA who can get the help you need. If not, you should consider reaching out to a local congressman and explaining your situation. The VA doesn’t want any more attention on them, so elected representatives can sometimes work miracles to get people like you into programs at the VA.

I don’t know what it will take to get you evened-out, but I hope you can find it before you lose what you have left.",,,1,0,0,
e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1524686637,"Thanks for that. It’s a good perspective to consider.

My sister deals with substantial PTSD, and I’ve dealt with suicide attempts among close friends with PTSD and a family member with Vietnam-era PTSD.  Which is all just to say that, even though most of my experience is not coming from a combat perspective, I can tell when something isn’t going properly. His original explosion made me suggest that he needed more meds (*help* is what I should have suggested, rather than specifically calling out meds. I acknowledged that in a later reply to him). 

After a minute I started thinking he might be a troll. I checked his comment history, which includes a recent comment where he brags about it taking three cops to restrain him when he got upset. When another veteran pointed out that he might need more help than he was getting, his response was 


&gt; go eat a bullet and make America a better place.


So many of his comments are like that, with explosive anger, threats, and references to suicide. Other soldiers — ones well familiar with combat PTSD — have been telling him that he is a danger to himself and to others, and that he needs more treatment than he’s getting. We may all be wrong, and his personality here doesn’t leak over into his personal life, and his outbursts here have no correlation to the violence he brags about in other posts, but I don’t know if the chance of being wrong about that outweighs potentially motivating him to get help. 

Veteran + PTSD + open discussion of violent behavior + frequent references to suicide is a combination that makes me genuinely concerned for him.

However, I understand what you’re saying, and I appreciate you laying the smack down on me kindly. I also really, really appreciate the perspective you brought to it.

I don’t know that it would change the fact that I commented, though. I wish I had worded my initial comment a bit differently, but I also wouldn’t want to stay silent when I’m surrounded by these red flags. I didn’t expect him to respond favorably, but as I said elsewhere I hope he thinks about it later. Perhaps with the comments that everyone else has made to him, he will look into different treatment options and what could be done differently.",,,2,0,0,

So, I live with his triggers as well, and he lives with mine from having my own chronic illness for so long. He’s helped by MMJ as well, but unfortunately, it’s not an option for me. I have turned to meditation, and it really brought me down off of a ledge. My husband does it too, in conjunction with his MMJ and therapy, and it has been another source of help for him. I recommend it if your own therapist thinks it might be helpful for you.

I used to get out my frustrations here on reddit a lot, but I think I’ve gotten better over time, though we’re all human. I started practicing a kind of meditation called Tonglen, where I breathe in the suffering of others, and breathe out love and compassion toward them. It has the dual benefit of making me feel more kind toward others and also more skillful at transforming my own suffering into compassion for myself.
By letting people know that I’m including them in my meditation, I hope it helps them feel that love and compassion coming from a stranger out in the world toward them. There are thousands of people across the world practicing Tonglen right now at this moment for whomever needs it, whenever they need it. I think of it when I am in need of some love and compassion, and hope you might benefit from knowing it’s happening whenever you need it too.

In my original comment here I linked to [this page](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-vaca/) on Right Speech, which collects various writings on it. The pillars being: is it true, is it said with kindness, is it beneficial, is it necessary for them to hear it, and is this the right time for them to be receptive to hearing it. 

There are a lot of good writings, but it all really boils down to the fact that if your statement honestly passes those five gates, you are acting with right speech. In a situation like this, you can say something that someone does not want to hear so long as it is true, said with kindness, what you’re saying is beneficial to them, they need to hear it (for example, in order to correct a behavior), and you say it at a time when they will be the most receptive to it. 

There wasn’t much of a choice for me on the last part. Maybe I should have said it over PM, but to guard myself I don’t want to open myself to PM’s from him.

What you’ve said about knowing when to speak is  the crux of right speech, with the teaching that you should of course err on the side of not speaking, rather than speaking and causing a problem.

PRN self-medication with MMJ is great, but you need to be able to lay a baseline with extended release options like medibles or tinctures. I don’t know if you’re also on traditional medications to lay that baseline, but if you are they may need to be tweaked. You came in angry, then you swing for the fences, then you calm down, and now you’re back at it. You need to tweak the system you are using, not just for us but for those in your real life who deal with these mood swings over similarly petty issues.

You also need to keep an eye on the way you try to cut people down when you’re angry. It’s not how you should treat other people, and if if you’re practicing it here it is almost certainly seeping through into your personal life.

I have really severe asthma (bad enough that I was approved for SSDI before 30.)  The only cough suppressant that works for me is one with hydrocodone in it.  It wouldn't even be a good med for selling or abuse - it's relatively expensive, there is another ingredient that would make things unpleasant, and it is time-released.  But because it has hydrocodone in it, and I'm not a pain patient, I can only get 7 days worth at a time.  I often need it for several months in the winter.  This isn't really a 'sort of' need or a need to be more comfortable.  Without it, I will cough until I throw up (and I have some other meds that I really, really have to be able to keep down), sometimes my throat will bleed, I've burst blood vessels in my eyes and sleeping is out of the question.

What this means is that I have to go out to my doctor's office and the pharmacy when I am really sick and shouldn't be around other people - one of my meds is an immunosuppressant.

I'm not trying to come across as arguing with you - I agree that there are a lot of situations where people end up with more painkillers than really needed for acute issues.  And I am really glad that the laws have provisions for chronic pain patients to make things a bit easier on them.  But I can't be the only one out there that is falling through the cracks here.

I am happy that the story you tell has a good ending but telling it like everyone is going to have a breakthrough is just not reality. Laws like this have to include some kind of exception process.

There are several ways that a person can be found disabled with blindness. For starters, the definition ""legally blind"" has different connotations with SSA. What matters for you is whether you are just considered 'disabled' or 'statutorily blind'. 

[Here are the requirements](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/2.00-SpecialSensesandSpeech-Adult.htm) for blindness for disability. What you are going to be looking for is part 2.02 (although the 2.00 second paragraph has some information as well). If you meet the criteria for 2.02 or 2.03A you are considered stat blind. If you do not meet 2.02 or you fall under the additional 2.03 criteria you are not stat blind, but can still be considered disabled. 

If you are considered stat-blind your monthly benefit amount will be higher, and also the amount that you can earn each month and still keep your check (SGA) will also be higher. [This](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html) is a chart showing the difference between [stat]blind and non-blind SGA amounts. So if you're stat blind you can earn almost $2k per month and still keep your benefits, whereas non-blind individuals can only make $1200. 

One thing with stat-blind is that they have to be able to determine a cause for the blindness. You mention that you had the series of tests, but do they know what exactly is caused the vision loss?",,,3,0,0,

A couple of questions, if you don't mind?

How many times have you seen this therapist? 
The way it's worded, seem this was your first time.

Do you have a lawyer?

Therapists jobs are to heal you. It's tantamount to failure that a client without a serious physical disability, gets disability. It means, therapy can't help you and they can't help you. It's not in their best interests to tell you, you qualify. Especially if you don't have rapport with said Therapist. Not only does it put them on the hook, YOU SAID I WOULD GET IT! It might be grounds for losing their license. 

A Psychologist/Therapist is no lawyer. Lawyers are the people you want to talk to about disability cases. Though, most lawyers want to see you active in treatment for awhile without success or remedy. Before they take mental disability cases.

You need to have a case, much like a Detective needs to have to arrest someone. You need to prove that treatment isn't working and there is no remedy, first and foremost.

I'd also go to a General Practitioner, and start the ball rolling in that direction also. Are you on hormones? Are they working? Side effects and all that needs to be documented by professionals. That's part of your case too, and needs attention.

You say that there is no treatment for it, but hormones and SRS are considered treatments. 

I've read all your comments, and I think what is going to hurt you the most is the lack of treatment and your continued drug use. You say you've tried SSRIs and therapy and claim they don't work. You don't want to transition (which is a personal choice for everyone, I'm just saying for disability's sake) to your dysmorphic gender. The only thing you are doing is self-medicating with drugs.

Can only empathize with the depression, substance abuse, and incurable mind set. Like feeling isolated because of how I felt about a lot of things.

My father was an abusive asshole. One of my earliest memories is him choking me and throwing me through a table, was about 6-7 at the time. He would regularly beat me because of something I did or might even do. He would yell and scream at the top of his lungs all the time. He called me a faggot and pussy quite a bit. One of this favorite things was to tell me, he was going to smash my head in and watch my brains leak out. I'd be pulled out of bed in the middle of the night and slapped around. Almost movie worthy abuse.

Though he was methodical in his approaches. He'd wait until my mother wasn't home or won't leave bruises much. Was told to lie the bruises, and could never have friends around much. Not only that he was a Marine and then in the Air force, so we moved around about every 3 years. I never had anyone to confide in, and mom loved me but was ultimately self-centered and didn't really care that her sons were being abused. I had no backing, ever, no one seemed to care.

Of course, I'm sugar coating most of this shit. It was bad, and those experiences turned me into a terrible person. I went on to do much worse than my father did to me. I didn't break the cycle at all, and it's not from a lack of trying. 

I didn't even know I was in a cycle. It wasn't until I started psychosomatic symptoms of extreme anxiety that I sought help. Then it became clear I was a very troubled person with little to no moral compass.

You might be confused about your gender, and I get that. I'm confused if I'm even human. I don't have normal feelings, or they are very reserved. 

I had to seek out a specialized Forensic Psychologist to get me off the list as considered a psychopath.

All of that considered, it wasn't until I sought continual therapy(over 6 months) and taking medication, before a lawyer would even see me. I've been on the waiting list for 2 years now, and still haven't seen a court appointed doctor for anything.

I believe we started the application process online and received a paper packet we had to fill out, and did the in person interview as well. I may be misremembering some of it though.

As for your last paragraph - It's a question we pondered many times in the process. My father was fairly healthy after his stroke but could not read or drive; he would not have been able to go through that process on his own. He was lucky to have me to do it with him / for him. I have often wondered how those worse off can even apply.",,,1,0,0,

So the Disability Report is the follow up to  the social security application, right? And then the SSI application he can do over the phone, and I can drop off necessary documents.

Do you know of any resources or advocates who would be able to help make sure his Disability Report is bulletproof before we file it? The social workers at the VA mean well, but they somehow don’t seem well-informed.",,,1,0,0,
c994b5c6-8bbc-4f0c-8a88-385ea8922f08,1524957517,"&gt;If he qualifies for SSI, he may automatically get Medi-Cal (what are the criteria for this? Anyone know?) 

I can't speak to this one, but it is true that often qualifying for SSI will automatically qualify a person for State health insurance. 

&gt; Individuals who qualify for SSI may also qualify for certain domestic and personal care services -- this is very important, as he'll need someone to check up on him once he's discharged. 

These are likely also programs through the individual State.

&gt;Since he's been married before, he cannot apply online for SSI/Social security together. Does this mean he can apply online for these services separately? I'm confused by this one.

He can file the Social Security application online, but due to the marriage, you're correct - the SSI cannot be done online. (the answer to the second part of this question is below)

&gt;How can he get SSI if he is too sick to visit an office in person? 

You can help him by going through the internet application with him - not FOR him, that's different. (There are 3 options when beginning the application: Filing for myself, helping someone file who is here with me, and filing for someone else.) The application itself is basic information - when did you become disabled (an estimated date of when the conditions starting affecting his ability to work,) marriage information, address, direct deposit, etc. 

After you submit the application, you *must* continue on to the internet Disability Report - the application alone is only one piece of the puzzle. The Disability Report asks questions about education, work history, medical conditions and doctors. A lot of people submit the application and then never submit this, and end up being denied based on insufficient evidence. 

Once that is done, I'd recommend scheduling a telephone appointment for him to file for SSI. Appointments are done by phone every day. The process is 100% the same as an in-person interview, only if any documents need to change hands, they can be sent through the mail, or dropped by the office later.

I know if you are married that they will only provide you with like a tiny portion of what you would get if you are not currently single. I'm also in California.  You can go to your local social security offices and get forms to fill out and probably talk to someone there id you don't want to fill it out online.  My friend did that (also in Cali) and she was approved immediately,  it took me 4 years to get approved and because my work history was so short (its been over 10 years since iv been well enough to work) I didn't get approved for ssdi.

I feel what you’re describing makes so much sense, teaching someone to use an accessibility skill so they realize what it’s like using that skill to navigate the world, rather than just dropping someone in the deep end without teaching them to swim. So validating when people realize the specific problems we’re dealing with every day. 

In my disability group at school, we’re planning on doing a dotted chalk line with occasional duct tape around campus to show where someone in our group who uses accessibility entrances has to go (hint, very out of the way) and mark with red tape all the broken elevators, broken door openers, or places that are inaccessible in winter (hint, half of them). Come to think of it we should probably make an overall map too and post that somewhere people can see the extent of it. ",,,2,0,0,

Although there are interesting lab studies where they ask people to simulate being blind for a day. The participants quickly decided it was practically impossible and extremely difficult to get around, which was partially inaccurate. When you actually have trouble seeing, you’ve had time to adjust and build up skills for navigating. The problems people experience in the acute phase of having a disability are different than the chronic problems. For instance I’m sure a lot of the people in the study were grateful when strangers or lab staff helped them, but many people who are blind cite strangers grabbing them to lead them around as highly annoying when they’ve figured it out for themselves already. So people with disabilities are more competent than abled people assume after only a day of trying it out. ",,,2,0,0,

Once they tried the challenge and started picking up lipreading themselves they realised that it’s not as helpful as they first thought. 

You still have to figure out who is speaking and turn to them quickly enough to catch what they said, you don’t always know when somebody has started talking to you (say if they come up on you from behind and start talking without first getting your attention). 

Lipreading won’t help if there’s a non-verbal sound (such as your phone beeping or a smoke alarm going off). It’s still a useful skill but it doesn’t 100% make up for not being able to hear.

I love what you’re doing at school. I use a powered wheelchair so I totally get how much farther disabled folks have to travel to get where they need to go. Having to know where all the accessible routes are and which options are currently broken, forcing disabled people to go an even longer route.

The people that do them (badly) should be forced to wear noise cancelling headphones for a week and then made to continue living their daily life, trying to converse with their colleagues or watch something that is absolutely critical for them to know.

I’m pretty sure the transcripts and subtitles would improve tenfold if hearing folks knew firsthand what it’s like to be deaf.

When I’ve had hearing friends try out my little “challenge” they were surprised how quickly they began picking up lip-reading skills. It was still extremely hard for them to follow a conversation, especially in a group setting where multiple people take turns to speak, but the longer they did it for, the better they understood what it’s really like.

They also had more time to experience a range of situations and how frustrating things can be when you can’t hear (like the amount of people who refuse to repeat themselves and just say “it doesn’t matter”. *Spoiler: Yes it does!*)",,,2,0,0,
