Disability is going to look at your medical condition, its impact on your functioning (despite treatment) and what vocational options would be available.

You say that you're on medication and it doesn't help - but what kinds of medications? pain meds only? what about muscle relaxers, SSRIs, gabapentin derivatives (nerve pain)? Have you had surgery or any other procedures (epidural injections, nerve blocks, etc)? SSA has to look at your condition *despite treatment* and one thing that you need to be considered disabled is be able to show that you've tried **everything** and it hasn't helped. 

Are you currently working? What kinds of jobs have you had in the past? Where they full or part time? How long did you last at each? You mention finding low impact employment - but what does that look like? Have you tried sedentary jobs? Did you go to college?

At your age, you likely haven't worked enough to qualify for SSDI (and if you have, its gonna be a real low amount). That means you can only qualify for SSI - which is the means tested program and pays, max $730ish per month. Not really enough to support yourself or have a good quality of life. Obviously if its an issue of homelessness vs SSI, do what you need to do to pay your bills.

As a fellow back pain sufferer, reasonable accommodations can be your best friend if you can find a flexible employer. Especially in an office type setting. Being able to switch from sitting to standing as needed, or getting up and walking around the building for a few minutes can really help.   ",,,3,0,0,

696717a8-27eb-413e-bbe2-857a77428d5e,1525737108,"About a year ago I was in a similar boat, but UHRS/Perk/etc instead of mturk - there was really nothing else I could do for income but even that stuff burned me out. From what I hear getting approved for purely mental health issues can be difficult, but given your early diagnoses, having to change schools, consistently going to therapists, and having tried multiple times to work and failed, now resorting to what I'm guessing is [sub-SGA](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html) income, IMO you have a solid case. I would apply online, by phone, or by visiting an SSA office. If approved, backpay will partially be based on the application date, so you should try to apply ASAP or at least notify SSA you're planning on applying soon to establish a [protected filing date](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204010). 


After that step you'll be waiting a while, so in the meantime obtain all records from your therapists. Documentation is the key. Ideally, get statements about your impairments from your case manager, from someone else who can attest to your history (job/school/daily life), and a doctor or therapist - [something like this form may make it easier](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/disability/disability-and-social-security/mental-residual). *Don't* minimize or play down your diagnoses (this is an extremely powerful instinct) - focus on how they impact you on both a daily basis and how they kept you from school &amp; continuing substantial work. *Don't* rely on SSA to get all your paperwork together - try to get it all compiled yourself and send it off to whoever will handle your case.


&gt;A big part of me feels like doing so would make me a lazy mooch because technically I *can* work...but only for a few months at a time and my quality of life is shit. 

First, eligibility guidelines are there for a reason - let SSA determine your case. Disability isn't just for those that can't work, it is also intended for those that can't work enough because of medical concerns - the ""substantial"" in ""substantial gainful income"". Read up on [unsuccessful work attempts](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0411010145). Tons of people on SSI/SSDI work part time or for a few months at a time - the key is that they are not successfully working over SGA. 


Second, don't get caught up in stigma - *everyone* deserves food, shelter, good health, and a decent quality of life. I'm glad you're on SNAP/in income-based housing and the food/shelter concern probably isn't as bad as it normally would be, but if work attempts are damaging your mental health and going nowhere, it's very helpful to have a ""safe"" income so you can figure out what's best for you. 


If you're fine with how things are, you certainly don't have to apply, but it's a fairly precarious existence otherwise and even being certified as disabled by SSA gives you much more protection in case anything changes (e.g. mturk dries up, or you lose housing and having access to housing for people with disabilities rather than general low-income housing would reduce wait list time).",,,2,0,0,

f606554c-8c15-4d0c-b484-a2b9136cf84f,1527366726,"I recently, or relatively recently, opened a ABLE account for myself. I had heard about them, when legislation first came about. I am currently using the Ohio based program. This is because I will be moving soon for grad school – and Ohio does not have a residency requirement. The downside of course is that come tax time – there is no additional benefit for someone like me.

The point however is that you don't necessarily need to be a resident of a particular state program in order to take advantage of it. At this point, I have been placing money into it so that my reportable income level is lower. As I'm currently dealing with SSDI. It is correct that any money placed into it must be used for what is called Qualified Disability Expenses – or QDEs. However, the qualifications for what a QDE is is being kept deliberately vague. Because disability affects each individual differently.

Per the SSA website:

a QDE includes, but is not limited to, an expense for:

* Education;
* Housing;
* Transportation;
* Employment training and support;
* Assistive technology and related services;
* Personal support services;
* Health;
* Prevention and wellness;
* Financial management and administrative services;
* Legal fees;
* Expenses for ABLE account oversight and monitoring;
* Funeral and burial; and,
* Basic living expenses.
* The ABLE national resource center also list food expenditures as qualifying expenses.

As to the yearly contribution limit – that is supposedly adjusted year to year as the cost\-of\-living changes. Currently, in the Ohio program, I believe the year limit is $15,000.

As I have said, I have not withdrawn much money at this point. The small amount that I have used was used to pay for a replacement hard drive in my main laptop. Because I use the computer so extensively as a direct result of my disability – it counts as a technology related QDE.

I was traveling with my brother, and between the two of us we had no problems getting up any stairs. The first hostel to kick me out was in London. My bro and I got all settled into our room, then came a knock on the door the following morning telling us we couldn’t stay because we were an “insurance liability.” That hostel at least had a barrier—we had gone up a flight of stairs. The second one, in Paris, was even more ridiculous. Just a single step to get in, easy peasy.

The mentality behind these kind of things is incredibly messed up, in my opinion. It’s one thing to say, “we don’t have the infrastructure you need.” As in, sorry no we don’t have an elevator in the case where you do need an elevator. That sucks, but at least it’s concrete and just about infrastructural barriers. In these cases though it’s much worse—it’s not that they don’t meet your infrastructure needs...it’s that they don’t like how you use the infrastructure. You can get to and use your room just fine...but they don’t approve of how you did it. To me, it’s the essence of discrimination. ",,,5,0,0,

The first thing you need is medical records supporting that despite treatment, your condition is still disabling.  Diagnostic testing like MRIs are valuable parts of your evidence.  Hopefully, you’ll find a primary care and specialists who will support your application and help document your progress.  Make sure you follow all of the treatments you are prescribed and make sure if something isn’t working or is causing side effects, tell your provider so it can be documented in your records.  My other suggestion is to stay in contact with your DDS examiner periodically to make sure they have all of your records.  ",,,1,0,0,

Given your situation, please follow the advice on this sub, and apply as soon as possible and wait it out

I think you have a good case, there's nothing wrong with living on disability.

Not everyone can be so fortunate to work a full-time competitive job

Using the tire bars, when you have two of them in under the bead, you can use one of them like a zipper and slide it around the rest of the rim. Like she said in the video, this should be easier than removing it and reinserting it every few inches.

If you can, try and take the tire off the rim completely. I didn't catch why she didn't in the video so your rim/tire may differ. But taking it off completely allows you to inspect both sides of tire's beads (the metal ring that gives shape and reinforcement to the tire against rim).

When you have the tire completely off, slightly inflate the new tube (or repaired one) just enough that it maintains shape without kinks. Then you can insert the tube into the tire make sure it doesn't bunch. Often if you insert it flat, it can bunch which will lead to tearing the tube. After that, find the stem, insert that first and make sure it is straight through before doing the reverse of step 1 (seating the tire back onto the rim.)

Bike pumps can be cumbersome and not offer the right amount of leverage. If money permits, you can purchase a handheld device that uses CO2 cartridges that require no pumping. If you want to use an electric pump, just make sure to slowly inflate the tub so that it allows itself to naturally conform between tire and rim.

Finally, like she said, it is often easier to take it to a bike shop. If you'd still like to try it yourself, watch some youtube videos on how to change bike tires and see if they can offer any relevant tips and tricks.

169bfc3f-0481-43ee-9aab-216353570f00,1525229222,"I second the idea of Voc Rehab, they have the best connections to training and employment. There are also many other work-from jobs. Most are writing jobs, some customer service. If you know are willing to learn to code, web development can be a good source of income. HTML5 isn't that hard to learn. There are plenty of free resources online. Your local library may also have some free classes that teach you job skills. Some even have volunteers to help you get a job. Community college is also not a bad idea to start getting some credits towards a degree. Even an associates degree, in the long run, will be better than a high school diploma or GED. Additionally, a lot of 4-year schools will accept most courses as transfer credit if you decide you want to go further with your education. 

Beyond trying to find a job, getting on the right treatment is very important. Medication can be helpful if you are on the right ones. Look around for the right psychiatrist. You want to be on medication that can help you, but not on those who impair your function further. Therapy is also an important part of the equation. I found DBT the most helpful. Exposure therapy is also very useful for managing OCD symptoms as well as social anxiety. I don't know your treatment history, but if you haven't had CBT from someone who is trained, that is the place to start. Other types of therapy can augment CBT, but in many ways the skills you learn there are needed for the other therapies to be successful. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with and who has experience. If the first one you go to doesn't work out, try another one. Telling the therapist that the relationship isn't working is hard, but you have to get effective treatment. My one warning is that talk therapy by itself will not help you. Because of the chronic nature and the severity of your conditions that you described, it won't help you. 

You also need to build a support system. Having people to rely on helps with managing stress. Also, as you build relationships people around you can begin to tell when your conditions are getting worse. This feedback can help you get treatment before they get too out of control. ",,,1,0,0,

The motor skills CP impacts can be diffrent for every single patient.

Do you mean can children who's CP manifests in a way that prevents them walking in childhood- can they develop the ability to walk later in life?

It depends, there is some room for motor skills to improve with correct symptom management, but not always, and perhaps not enough to help every child with CP learn to walk. Every case is different and it's up to each individual medical team to decide what goals are realistic for each unique CP patient.

Before I give some info regarding ABLE, I figured I'd give you a rundown on SSI rules. I'm also assuming that the money isn't going to a special needs trust, which is a whole other thing I don't know much about. In the month you get the inheritance, you will not be eligible for SSI for that given month and you will owe back SSI money you received for that month. Then, if you still have money in any account after that month is up, any left over money will be countable assets. The straight asset limit for SSI is 2k, so you could only keep up to 2k in regular checking or savings account.

With an ABLE account, the yearly contribution limit is 14k. The max overall amount you could have in an ABLE account without it in any way effecting SSI benefits is 100k. ABLE accounts are run by states along with probably other private companies they partner with to administer the program. Most states allow out of staters to open an ABLE account. This will give you an opportunity to shop around for the program with the best investment options and the lowest costs \(some of them have a yearly fee\). The website I provided below will give you more info regarding ABLE in general, and has a tool where you could compare different state programs.

c4aa97ad-1177-424d-a41a-f5c1e0fde028,1525717310,"I got my disability (OH) a decade ago so I can’t speak to exactly how things are now but I can tell you about my experiences. 

I had been seeing doctors and therapists for a couple years since my disability (I lost my job after I was hospitalized) so I had a large paper trail that helped immensely. I applied and was told I would probably be denied for the first time. If I was I should get a lawyer who handles disability claims she told me. 

I did get denied, I did get a lawyer, I had an interview with him over the phone, signed some releases and was told it would take 2 years to get a hearing. 9 months later to my surprise I got a call that I had a court date. I went down to the courthouse, spoke with him for a couple minutes, then went in a small room overstuffed with a table, a judge, my lawyer, and 4 old guys who apparently were all experts who were to assess my case (psychiatrist, doctor, workers comp guy, and a 4th I can’t remember.) I’d felt like the lawyer was going to do a little to help but when I got there I found that everyone had a 2-inch binder completely full of all my medical records and everything else under the sun (not literally but you get the idea.)

I talked to them, answered questions for about 10-20 minutes, then we all agreed on the date when I was ‘officially’ disabled (it was a couple years) to establish how far back my backpay went. The gavel was hit, everything was put through, the lawyer was paid his percentage of the backpay for his services (I think it was 20% but I could be wrong) and things have been ok since then.

I’ll add a caveat to this because I was getting paid well at my last job and the determination was based on my pay from that job so I can’t speak to how much you’d get in the end. I can say that I was enrolled in Medicare after put on disability (I think I had to provide some personal information and sign a few forms but it wasn’t hard) and was made eligible for public assistance programs which I was mostly able to get with some visits to job and family services.

Look up info on how it all works in PA and see what the initial denial rate is right now (I think it was like 75% at the time) and find someone to help you navigate the paperwork. I had a social worker at the time and she helped me but I think disability lawyers can do it and I’m sure there’s others. I’m not sure if you can do it online now but it was not really as hard as I thought the application would be. I had a friend I was staying with at the time and he understood that I was at least working on getting disability (it took me a year or so to apply) so I was at least sheltered and relatively comfortable while I waited for my court date.

I can’t say your experience will be exactly the same but hopefully it will be. If you look up what specifically you can expect from applying in PA at this point in time and have someone help you prepare the application I think you'll be able to get this worked out. Also, make sure your roommate understands what is happening so they can be supportive on one level or another. You can do this. Take care. 

Edit-I just reread your post. I’m still waking up so I misunderstood what you were asking. It will definitely not hurt to see if you can get the back pay, and they may grant you partial disability. Just have representation with you and try to keep calm and see what happens. Hope the court date goes well!",,,2,0,0,

(http://dralegal.org/press/amc-theaters-agrees-improve-services-blind-movie-goers/) There are a few potentially relevant contacts on that page. 

AMC theaters also has a contact link on their ""assistive moviegoing"" site: https://www.amctheatres.com/assistive-moviegoing/guest-guide They are supposed to have a designated ""ADA coordinator"" to resolve these complaints, and complaints received by the ""ADA coordinator"" are supposed to be reported for monitoring as part of the settlement. 

You're also supposed to get both a voucher and a refund if the AD doesn't work. Ask for it every time it doesn't work.

I'd say that this is a problem more and more people are going to face. this notion that a persons value etc is defined by their job is pretty absurd. (I'm not saying its you... its society, its ""old-fashioned"")

If you think a Walmart cashier that works 40 hours a week and just gets constantly bitched at has it any better I'd urge you to reconsider.

Perhaps the issue is more or less that you are frustrated that you don't have that freedom that is bothering you. Chances are pretty good if you won the lottery etc you would be perfectly happy voluntarily not working, but you would find something to do that you enjoy.

In today's corporate landscape most people are replaceable cogs because thats what its all about. Nothing good or special. Ask yourself whats the difference between a great cashier and a mediocre one? A ""great"" one may smash fewer loaves of bread and be slightly faster and more pleasant, but at the end of the day I'd submit unless something truly egregious is going on, the average person don't give a shit and don't pay enough attention to even notice the difference.

This is all to say that trying  find value/meaning/fulfillment/self worth through employment is a bad idea.

People seem to find those things in part through their interactions/connections with other people, and even as a fairly antisocial person thats what I miss about work, but if I hit the lottery don't for a minute think that I'd even give one second of thought to wishing I had a job. so even if you do manage to find a job you can get some small bit of enjoyment out of, its quite small.

I've had jobs I was quite good at and did significantly better than others, but at the end of the day it didn't matter much when I left, because most situations are not life of death, the machine keeps on running.

A place for people to share products they've used and review them so others can benefit. Anyways we appreciate you taking the time to write this comment and joining the AAL community :),,,2,0,0,

If I could make a recommendation though, it'd be nice if your autism section had more things for autistic adults too. It's a struggle to find things that help us, but I know there are things out there. Including autistic owned businesses that are more focused on adults would be a good step. I can help with a list if you'd like :)

Also puzzle pieces are not well liked in the autism community. It gives the idea that we are incomplete or missing pieces. Most of us prefer things like the neurodiversity symbol or Autisticat(there's others too).
Atypical is a controversial thing too. This ones more up for debate in the community on whether the show hurts us or not. I figure its worth mentioning.

I hope this doesn't come off as super negative or anything. This is a cool resource!

I look forward to checking out the website when I have more time.  I did sign up to be a member.  An online forum that people can use to share technology that worked or didn't work for them is much needed.  For example, I recently purchased a GPS tracking device for a person who was developing dementia but really, really wanted to live in their own apartment for as long as possible.  That person and their family were willing to accept some risk and we thought a GPS device would be a great safety net in case he was ever missing.  We tried 5 different devices before we found one that worked well.  It was so hard to find independent feedback from people who were using these items the same way we were.  It would be nice to provide a format for people to use on your forum when they share technology.  What is it?  What do you use if for? Where did you buy it?  Cost? What did you like about it?  What don't you like about it? 

Anyway...very cool idea.  I attended a technology conference put on by ANCOR a few years ago and while there were great ideas and information shared the biggest thing that people like me were asking for was a nationwide platform to share independent information and reviews.  They talked about making that happen but it never did...

If you’ve been to psychotherapy it was probably with a psychologist at the least but they’ve really gone the way of the dodo. Almost all therapists I know of now are LISWs and liscenced therapists (they have the degrees but hadn’t necessarily kept on a strict psychology track and specialize in related fields.)

Mine hold degrees and focused on child development but she’s whip smart and a huge LGBTQ advocate who also focuses on mental health care for non-heteros too. She is continually taking professional classes to help better her therapeutic toolkit. I’m basically getting very grounded and non-judgemental therapy from a pretty awesome human.

It's not OK that you and I have to feel that way, or that anyone has to feel such pain and isolation. But I found some comfort in accepting that I have a chronic illness. The hardest part for me was having people throw around toxic positivity and put a carrot on a string, tricking me into thinking that I just wasn't trying hard enough, that it was my bad attitude, etc.

I'm not happy but I can find comfort in the fact that I've accepted this will be forever. I may not be able to do anything that's remotely respectable or hold any meaningful relationships but I can do small things here and there to reduce my suffering. That is my ONLY goal and it's an attainable. There are small, tiny things you can do. That doesn't take away the unbearable pain. That doesn't make life worth living. But it's a goal you can reach, and an attainable one, and suddenly you don't feel overburdened because you've accepted where you're at, and you're not set up to fail.

I look at life as a boring, terrible, miserable car or plane ride. What can you really make of that? You can read skymall, you can play a stupid punch buggy game. In the end it's all a distraction, and while it's ridiculously alienating watching other people on the plane getting way into the scenery and in flight movie while you can't, you can at least distract yourself to help the time go by faster until the end :) For me, I'm now OK if that's what my life is all about. For a lot of people who aren't depressed, they often think that there is something more but then fall into a midlife crisis because they never thought or questioned these things. We are one step ahead.

It's also OK to shut people out who perpetuate stigma and bring you down. Find communities of people who have been through trauma, mental health issues, disability, autism. You may feel less alienated (although as an aspie myself I ALWAYS feel alienated) in these groups, and that can make a lot of difference.

Absolutely, couldn't have put it better.

&gt;what do you, or anyone reading this, think the common goals of the disability community should be?

To be honest, this is something I've been thinking about for a while and I have not come to a solid list of goals but what I do keep coming back to over and over again (it seems to underpin so many other issues) is financial empowerment. In my personal experience, money has bought me opportunities. My intellectual ability has mattered and my work experience has mattered in getting those opportunities but the biggest determinant of whether or not I could get a really good education or a job (aside from discrimination, possibly)? Money. Money to cover the extra cost of having a disability. And it's not just about accessing education or the workplace because we also have to think about those for whom accessing those things is impossible due to the nature or type of disability they have. I think financial power is important across the disability spectrum - it's one of the biggest barriers in accessing good quality healthcare, one of the biggest barriers in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the biggest barrier in maintaining dignity and independence, the biggest barrier in affording a decent quality of life, the biggest barrier in being able to fight for yourself when you *are* discriminated against or your rights are being violated etc. We need spending power in order to become visible in society, in order to have power in how the communities we live in are shaped.

I'm not saying anything new, I think every disabled person knows that money is important. But I do think that the community is not pushing hard enough or thinking big enough. We're so focused on keeping the little that we get through government programs, so focused on surviving the day to day financially. It's not enough. We're being reactive to issues and cuts as they come rather than trying to scope out what we need and fighting for it. I'm hugely thankful for what the disabled people who came before us fought for and the independence and inclusion they've passed down to us but times have changed and we need to think about what we need now and what the upcoming generations are going to need going forward. The fight before us was about getting us into the community and now I think the focus has to be on lifting us out of poverty so that we can be true members of society. I think that's something we can do in partnership with other minorities who also face similar issues.

Honestly, if you want to refer to yourself as a cripple or something like that, do it. 

My issue would be if someone uses a term like cripple to refer to *all* people with physical disabilities or to other people who don't personally identify as cripples because, wait for it, it's a subtle form of social violence to force someone else to accept or repress an identity. That cuts both ways though; just as it's wrong and unethical, imo, to force the label ""cripple"" on others so too is it wrong and unethical to try and force a person to *stop* self-identifying as a cripple.

Over the years I've seen these other terms come in and out of fashion, handicapped, disabled, physically challenged, and the like, and the only consistent thing I can see is that no matter what the new term is, eventually ""society"" decides even that term is too offensive, and we need a new one. It seems like every few years disabled people get a new euphemism.

This is when I realized that the problem people have with these terms is not that they are inherently offensive in any way. What makes people uncomfortable is that you are talking about disability in the first place. 

A lot of able-bodied people just get uncomfortable with discussing disability. I've seen firsthand when young children out in the world get curious about my wheelchair, and then their parents shoo them away, tell them not to bother me, and then the parents apologize to me for their nosy kid.

This is the kind of attitude that produces adults who are uncomfortable with disabled people, and who now have this weird uncomfy feeling with talking about disability. So they think, well this must be an offensive topic, or word. And when they try to replace the word, inevitably that word becomes ""offensive"" too, because the underlying topic is the same, and its the underlying topic that they can't handle.

So cripple becomes handicapped, which becomes disabled, which becomes physically challenged, and the parade of euphemisms goes on and on because no matter what the term, its the topic that makes people uncomfortable.

Which is why I prefer to use the term cripple. There is nothing inherently offensive about the word. My joke is that ""its in the bible.""  But the real reason I use it is to make people come to realize that its the topic of disability that is really making them uncomfortable, not the word I choose to describe it.",,,14,0,0,

On a completely different, broader note:

&gt;I understand from other people in the disability community, although no one seems to be able to quantify what exactly that means, that the term ""special needs"" is out and ""disabled"" is in.

The thing that I loathe about this, on a social and political level, is that *everybody* has different or ""special"" needs, at least in certain areas of their life.

I have mild dyslexia. I have different reading needs than a ""normal"" person. One time I broke my leg. I have asthma and I need to be kept away from cigarette smoke. I'm deathly allergic to cats. I suffer migraines occasionally.

All of these conditions require special needs. Except they are ""normal"" as well. ""Special needs"" is a term which is used in society, intentionally or not, to define which exceptional needs are acceptable and which are ""*Ugh, I suppose we have to do things differently for this person because they are disabled...*""

I've had security and cops called before. Plenty of people get snarky and shitty about it. One woman stood at my car while I was shopping, called the store manager and wanted my car towed because I wasn't *really* handicapped.

I've been yelled/screamed at, had the cops called on me, had people make some really hurtful comments, etc. I have a disability bus pass, too, and I've had a few people raise their voice at me for being a ""selfish asshole"" if I don't surrender my seat to someone else. Fortunately, the bus drivers have never given me any issues or side eyes or anything and they seem to be quick to shut down the obnoxious assholes so that's nice.


It really sucks, though, just trying to get through the day and having to deal with people who've decided their mission in life is policing handicapped spots/the disabled in general. On particularly bad days it's almost too much to bear with the stress of everything else and the pain and fatigue. 

I don't bother explaining to people, either, when they're rude. If someone has what seem to be genuine questions or if a child asks why I have a cane then I have no problem chatting about it but I don't owe answers to anyone and certainly not when they're being jackasses about it.

There was a botched clinical trial (now used in universities as examples of how not to do trials) meaning they prescribed graded exercise as a cure, whereas it actually makes the majority of patients worse. Doctors told me it was in my head and to keep going. I ended up a lot worse. 

I read your blog. I get that the world doesn't owe us anything, but what's the harm in asking if we are suffering? I didn't like 'Live stoically, don’t show the world your heartache because it doesn’t care', as that's why we didn't get funding to find a cure or even a biomarker in the blood in the first place. Somebody who was a regular on an ME forum was sectioned and incarcerated just this year and died because nobody believed him and gave him the care he needed. They thought he was depressed; he couldn't physically get up.

We are only just beginning to see funding and revised clinical trials now, and that's because we stopped living stoically and started campaigning. I don't want to be cranky and whiney so I am grateful for my friends and keep any gripes to myself, but campaigning for change is worth doing.

Because she is on SSI (I'm assuming not SSDI due to low monthly amount) she can qualify for HUD housing assistance, which caps rent at 30% of income. Is she on Medicaid? If a group home is medically necessary, they will pay for it. 

I would start by looking for any sort of community mental health center or independent living center. They should have resources to help. Or contact whatever state agency administers the Medicaid program, they can help explain options. 

It sounds like a group home, or a 24-7 residential habilitation program (where she lives in an apartment with a few people and they have a staff 24hrs/day) is going to be what she needs. You could also try looking for those programs in your area (google or try 2-1-1). 

Some people are going to tell you that its best to try to keep her at home. Or they will try to guilt your mom about it. From my experience doing social work (doing this exact thing, before I turned to government work), keeping her at home is only going to hurt both parties. Her mother is going to continue to get burnt out as she gets older, and her daughter needs to be somewhere more equipped to handle her needs. Mom isn't going to live forever, and its better to make the transition now than when mom dies and nobody can take in her daughter.

There is a list of conditions (called the blue book listings) that will automatically qualify a person for SSI/SSDI, which negates the issues with your age and work experience. There is no specific list for migraines, *however* they are evaluated using the epilepsy listing. You can review the listings [here](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/11.00-Neurological-Adult.htm#11_02)

If you truly are having migraines at the severity and rate that you describe, that would satisfy the criteria of the listing and you would be allowed. However, it can be difficult to prove because obviously you don't seek out medical help each time you have a migraine. But, if you have neurologist notes saying how often you have them **and** you have a journal/calendar that will go a long way. Typically we will accept a self-reported timeline of frequency as long as there is some medical information backing it up (like, we won't accept it if your neurologist notes say you aren't having migraines)

And this goes for practically everyone who may ever have to interact with you regarding your disability. I've had occupational therapists ask the wrong kind of questions for the type of information they actually require. It's a communication issue that stems from able bodied people not understanding the reality of life with a disability but understanding it can be a private and personal topic. So they stumble around their questions, they try to beat around the bush and make assumptions thinking it's more respectful than asking direct questions, or they ask direct questions that are the wrong questions. Sometimes it's because our disability defies expectations. Someone who's only ever met wheelchair users who are full time users or experience permanent paralysis, they might not expect a customer to be a part time user for fatigue or pain or orthostatic intolerance, they might miss important questions like ""do you require additional fluid during the flight?"" because they've assumed they know enough about disability. 

I've had doctors assume I'm fully continent since I haven't directly mentioned my continence issues since childhood because I manage well enough. My doctor will ask questions like ""can you perform toileting task independently?"" which at the moment I can. But he doesn't ask if I need specific equipment or tools or reminders, I've now learned that I need to tell him directly regardless of the specific questions he asks. Otherwise I arrive at hospital for surgery and sneak a peak at my care plan and say"" oh, I'm not continent, I have alarms on my phone to remind me because the sensation is dull""

It can be difficult if there is a rigid paperwork system that doesn't really allow for custom answers, and the questions on the paperwork are wrong and miss vital information. 

It took me a lot of negative experiences to learn what sort of information people need in each situation, and I've had to learn to just explain rather than directly answer questions. If someone asks if I need assistance getting seated I can't just say ""no"" and assume there will be more questions, I have to say ""no but I need extra time and to move slowly and carefully"".

It shouldn't be my responsibility to know what information other people need. But that's the reality and It's what I must do to have a comfortable experience in the world. The only other thing I can do is help explain to people why their questions are inappropriate for the information they're seeking and try to improve the experience for the next person. ",,,2,0,0,

Each airline comes up with their own way of figuring this out. For example, if you fly Southwest, they will ask ""Do you need our assistance getting on or off the aircraft/getting down the jetbridge?"" and if you answer, no, the second question they ask to establish medical priority is ""Do you require a specific seat on the aircraft?"" Personally, I've talked with my sig. other about this, and I don't like these questions. For me personally, I don't need assistance walking or boarding the plane, and I don't require a ""specific seat"" but I do need extra time to get on the plane (I'm a slow walker, I have to stow my bag and make sure all my meds are accessible to me during flight, I put cushions/padding on the seat to make it modified/tolerable for me to sit in). Again, if I'm answering ""by the book"" then I don't qualify for medical priority according to Southwest, but I think I do. So I just say I need a certain seat.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1526104936,"Maybe they misspoke and meant ""Nature of your disability"" which they are allowed to ask, the answer is simply ""Mobility/Sensory/ Neurological/Adaptive"" or whatever umbrella term you feel comfortable with.

However it's illegal for most places in UK, Aus and US to ask ""what is your condition?"" or ""what is your diagnosis"" or anything allong those lines. It's a private medical quesyion and they have no right to that information.

The information an airlines needs:

* What tasks might you need help with
* How can they help you 

So the best questions to ask is ""what is the nature of your disability, do you have any equipment? and what services will you require?"" ""I have a mobility issue, I have a cane in carry-on, But I require a wheelchair and wheelchair assistance for the terminal"" or ""I have a sensory impairment, I don't have equipment, I need a visual guide whilst I'm in the airport"" or whatever it is you need.

Of course, people can get tongue tied and intimidated and just blurt out ""what's your disability?"" or ""What's wrong with you?"" when what they really mean is ""what generic umbrella term should I put on the paperwork to make the computer happy so I can order the wheelchair you've requested""

It's important they do ask, because it avoids miscommunications. I remember booking a wheelchair with a shopping centre, spent 10 quick minutes on the phone going through a standard booking service, I was looking at the website where they had divided the services into ""wheelchair"" or ""mobility scooter"" and had two pictures, one of a standard self propel wheelchair, and one of a honda rascal. I booked a wheelchair, and arrived an hour later to find that i'd booked a transfer chair, because that's all they had, the picture on the website was just a random stock image if you wanted to independently get around the store you were expected to get a scooter. I didn't know this, and the poor clerek who was helping me at the information desk didn't understand the difference between a transfer chair and a self propel (she'd only ever seen transfer chairs) and couldn't understand why I booked the wrong thing, like i'm the only idiot. I wasn't asked any questions beyond ""what time are you coming ton the desk?"" when I booked, but a few follow up questions like ""would you like to nominate someone to pick up and drop off the wheelchair so you can wait in the car?"" would have clued me in that it was a transfer chair.

Artie was as included in that as any of the characters, he got plenty of the usual high school drama storylines later on about teen relationships etc. which had nothing to do with his disability.

I enjoyed the distinctions they made between some awesome (imo) characters, like Walt Jr in Breaking Bad and Tyrion in Game of Thrones (both awesome) vs the inspiration porn characters, or the lame-duck ones like the boy in Glee played by a dancer. I don’t feel like it’s a coincidence that the awesome characters tend to be played by actors who actually have the portrayed condition.

I’m not opposed to non-disabled actors playing disabilities per se. For example, I’ve been watching the 3% lately, and I think Fernando is one of the best wheelchair using characters I’ve seen in television. Was genuinely surprised to find out that the actor wasn’t actually disabled. And I’m ok with that.

But I do find the phenomenon heavily correlated with poorer story telling and, yes, poorer acting. When nobody writing or acting the part has any first hand experience, what is displayed is almost always lacking in realism and depth. And in the worst case, it can lead to seriously damaging media. Take the insulting dumpster fire of Me Before You. Not only were no disabled people involved in that one, the writer in describing her research didn’t even consult disabled people...she consulted with care takers only! I don’t often use the word, but that is some ableist bullshit right there. The result...a film about how even if you’re super rich, handsome, and have the love of Emilia Clark...killing yourself if you’re a quad is probably best. I wonder how they would have felt writing that if the main actor was actually a quad?

They ""see"", anticipate, and react to these things much better than a human driver.

&gt;If there's any viruses or issues with the code, then have no option for manual override since you don't know what's in front of you, beside you, ahead of you, etc

I guess you can say the same about commercial airlines, flying under IFR conditions.

&gt;How do you park? Finding the car could be solved with a customizable clicker, but shit.

This is solved.  Really, the cars parking themselves is really pretty easy.  And, one option (really the first that will come to market, and is already being tested in AZ) is ride sharing.  You won't own the car.  It won't need to park.  It'll just pick up another passenger.

&gt;What if your tires blow, or you have damage that's obvious to sighted people, but you miss it? Like, if someone rear-ended you and said it was just a little scuff on your bumper, you might let them go. Or, if a cart slams into your car on a windy day, you might not know right then.

Again, under the ride share option, much of this is moot.  There is already an option to push a ""help"" button, which connects you to the dispatcher.  There is also a ""pull over"" button.  And, if an accident is detected (and the cars CAN'T miss, ANY kind of contact with another object), the police could be called to the scene.

8a579de6-81fa-4d12-bbed-fa9ef518cf70,1526411242,"Okay, I'm going to give you the unvarnished truth here. It is not at all clear that you have a permanent inability to live independently as a self-supporting adult. At 22 years of age you are barely out of childhood and are not even close to being qualified for SSDI. In order to qualify, you would have to have a lot more work history. [Explanation here.](https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/glossary/fully-insured-status) 

There is another program, SSI, which might possibly help you in the short term but again, based on the information you've provided, I don't think you would be approved. Here's why: 

You were a straight-A student in high school so that tells me that even though college didn't work out, you probably have the IQ points to do many, many different kids of jobs. Would a college degree open up the possibilities even more? Probably, but that is no reason not to even try.

I understand that you didn't do well in customer service type jobs (go carts, food service) but there is customer service, and there is everything else, and that ""everything else"" is practically infinite. **Please, please do not base your self-image regarding your ability to hold down a job on this very minimal work experience.**

You have not had a lot of treatment, and you're not in treatment at all right now. That is a problem. It's an especially big problem because you have conditions which by their very nature make adulting more difficult. So until you find the right psychiatrist, get on the right meds (if that's something they recommend), and get some therapy under your belt, all this is going to look like an insurmountable obstacle, and you will have no idea what you're capable of. So I 100% understand that this advice might be hard to take. But you are just going to have to trust me when I tell you that getting the right help WILL make all these things easier.

Let me be clear, and yes I'm aware I'm repeating myself. **Both psychiatric treatment and counseling are a must for you.** You dismiss the idea of meds because you are afraid of ""Big Pharma,"" but what's scarier: medication side effects or the permanent inability to become a functioning adult? You dismiss the idea of counseling, saying that it's a ""waste of time,"" because of the focus on coping skills, but **your entire response to my questions is a testament to your need for help with coping skills.** Coping with a lack of transportation. Coping with co-workers you don't like. Coping with managers who don't like you and give you all the shit work. Coping with work that is boring and shitty. Dealing with all these things without throwing your hands up and saying, ""I can't do it! Fuck this! I'm going back to bed!""

Yes, therapy is painful, and it is a lot of work. And yes, you might go into a therapy session in a good mood and leave in a bad mood because it's bringing up stuff you'd rather not think about. *This means that the therapy is working.* If you do not learn to recognize and process the shit that therapy brings up, and that is bumming you out (which is one of the most important coping skills they teach you in therapy by the way), your treatment will not help. In therapy, you make progress, and you have setbacks. You will feel invincible some days and depressed and hopeless on other days. That's a completely normal part of the process. So is trying a medication and having it make you feel worse. Or having it work, but only for a couple months. That's no reason to abandon treatment; it's just an indication that you haven't found the right treatment *yet.* So you try again. And again. And again. Because this is your LIFE we're talking about, and the effort and pain and discouragement is worth the end result of figuring out what works and helps you be functional.

You mention that you are currently self-medicating with weed. This is a very bad idea. At age 22 your brain development is still ongoing, and using weed can hinder that development. Now, I am VERY pro-medicinal weed when it's appropriate. But don't fool yourself: habitual weed use before the age of 25 is not medication. It's self-sabotage.

Now, about your home environment: It's reasonable as an adult man (or at any age really) to expect that your living space include a private area where you can close the door and meditate or read a book or even a titty magazine, as long as it's legal and you don't disturb other members of the household. I 100% believe you that you need this, and if you can't get it at your parents' house, you should be looking at other options.

Speaking of which, you haven't gone into a lot of detail about your living situation -- I understand about the layout of your living space and the lack of door but you don't talk about your father or other family members living there. If your parents are abusive in some way, talk about it with a counselor. There are resources for vulnerable young adults who are trapped in abusive environments, whether that's due to financial or other reasons. If that's the case, consider contacting Adult Protective Services or a Domestic Abuse Hotline in your state.

Regarding your debts: Your financial situation sucks but it is not insurmountable. Yes, you will probably be required to pay back the loans, and if you are, it will take a bite out of your budget for quite awhile. This is not a reason not to try to get a job -- quite the opposite. My cousin, who went a little crazy in her 20s and incurred about $50,000 in credit card debt, is fond of this riddle: How do you eat an elephant? Answer: One bite at a time.

So what's next? If you are uninsured, you need health insurance, because IMO treatment should be priority one with you right now, and you will not be able to get good treatment without insurance. If you have a parent who works in a place that offers group insurance, you can get on their plan until age 26. If that is not an option for you, and you live in a state that opted in to the Obamacare Medicaid Expansion, get signed up *immediately* and get yourself back into treatment. If your state does not have the Medicaid Expansion, try to sign up for public assistance which should qualify you for Medicaid. 

Once you're insured, you will need a psychiatrist to evaluate your need for meds if any, and a therapist to help you with coping skills. Once you're back in treatment, you can re-start Vocational Rehab and get some help determining what would be the right job or training program for you based on your particular abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Vocational Rehab is also an area where a trained professional is going to tell you to do shit you don't necessarily want to do. *Do it anyway.*

Above all, do not give up hope. For every problem you've talked about, there is help. All you have to do is accept that help and that's going to mean doing shit that you don't want to do. Get used to that: it's practically the definition of being an adult.

TL;DR: The sooner you accept the fact that trained professionals CAN and WILL help you *if you follow their advice,* the sooner you can get control of your own life.",,,7,0,0,

I also look at what has that person done to attempt to work, and to deal with their symptoms. We see it more with younger folks, but sometimes a person will just throw up their arms and say “there is no way I can do it!” Now, that is on them to work with shift their perception, and if that is how they want to continue to view their life, that is their choice. However, one cannot expect the government to set up lifetime payments for it. 

In your situation? It sounds like you have a good support system and people around you looking out for you. I would listen to what they are telling you. You’re doing everything you can, and you are still falling short, then it may be time to adjust your plan.

It can be real difficult to understand, but disability is based on someone's complete inability to work and function. A lot of people struggle with work, but that doesn't mean they are disabled. 

&gt; I don't want my life to be 8 hours work, 1 hour commute, 7 hours mental-illness suffering, 1 hour eating/showering, 7 hours sleep.  That leaves time for nothing (not even friends, family, hobbies, exercise, pets, shopping, errands) and isn't even enough sleep for me (I only do well at 8.5 hours.  It used to be 10 in high school).

To be real blunt - that is being an adult. Nobody likes working for 8 hours a day and not having time for things they would much rather be doing. 

You seem to have a history of customer service or customer facing jobs - which is probably the worst thing for someone with your spectrum of mental illness. You'd be better off focusing on something more suited to your symptoms. 

The other big red flag for you is your lack of any sort of treatment. Anxiety and depression typically respond well to treatment, including therapy and medications. SSA can tell if you just get into treatment to try to bolster your disability claim (and it is not looked upon favorably).

 ***What is your age?*** ~22.7 y/o.

***What kinds of treatments have you had?*** 3 years of counseling as a child. Then,  2 more years of counseling.  After another break, 3 more years of counseling. (I stopped because they were helping me learn to cope, not help with solutions, and it wasted time, they'd get me into  bad moods on good days, and not be available when I really needed them, and a whole plethora of other reasons)

***What kind of treatment are you undergoing right now?*** None right now, but because I'm literally fallen under a pile of bullshit.  Im like stuck.  Willing to get more help on my own.  Not only that, even if I wasn't for my own benefit, I'd enroll in counseling again to help my case for getting disability

***Are you following your doctor's advice/taking all prescribed meds? If not, why not?*** I tried the meds, none worked.  they only worked for the first 2 months.  i am scared AF by big pharma and dont want to try more.  between you and me, marijuana has helped me more than anything, but i wont mention that to the feds.  i legit mean it is a medical *miracle* for me. idec about the recreational effects.  It cures like half of the issues within me.  Even like 12 hours after smoking. i smoked for a year, quit for 9 months, then resumed for 2 more months.  the 9 months i *wasn't* smoking i could actually notice my life was worse and less healthy.  i'd like to get a medical card and try and not smoke but take pills or eat it someday down the line.

***What jobs have you had, and for how long?*** I had a job for  4 months at a go kart place.  mgmt was horrible.  they had lead in the water supply, made ppl stand in sun 4 hours, 15 min break, 5 more hours; no devices, no umbrellas, *no talking*, 9 hour shifts. i got fired for getting a flat tire on my way biking to work on a 45mph road/freeway of sorts.  he said the flat + being 10 min late twice before was enough, lol.  this was over 4 months.  but yeah my dad might have aspergers too, but he wont look into it.  one symptom of aspergers is tardiness, believe it or not, since time mgmt is so difficult, even perception of time might be different at times. he drove me to school in elementary school. i was tardy 55/180 days and almost got truancy court on me. they didn't care since i was getting straight a's i think. they even said ""if ur late more, ur going to court"" and I was late like 15 more times. so, late 55 times in one school year and absent like 12.  this was the most severe year, but my lateness for school extended throughout all years. when i started bussing in high school, the tardiness was cut by like 70%, but between my dad getting me into bad habits, our conditions, and just struggling with time mgmt in general, i was still late like 25 times  a year in hs.

then i worked at a sandwich shop which was severely understaffed.  i had it for 3 years.  they started lowering my hours from like 25 hour to 13 hour to 6 hour a week.  i had various meetings with them and HR and they were an evil work place.  even the coworkers would gossip about me and my aspergers and gang up on me, even assigning me over quintuple amount of tasks, LOL.  they'd have the shift leaders do one 10 min task and hand me a list with 5 half-hour tasks at close. i struggled every day, i began falling apart when my life was work 6-7 hr, commute, document their mistreatment, talk with dad about taking legal action, bed, repeat.............. miserable every day.  like my life started actually falling apart, got far behind on bills, payments, debts, collections, hygiene, sleep, everything. like *everything*. haven't worked in the last 9 months.  My best friend was a 21 year old cyclist. A car hit him on his street and he died 9 months ago.  He was the closest creature to me in the world, surpassing all animals and family and friends.  I called out for his funeral and got fired the day after I called out. Not even kidding.  Didn't even bother with it after that and couldn't afford legal action. And my mother who offered to help me with the legal action procedure is too unstable herself. Been trying to sort legal and health stuff out ever since, and also did community service.

***Educational background:*** finished HS.  Went to a state uni for one semester. long story short, they dispatched a loan 2 weeks late :DDDDDDDDD So i was on campus for 3 days waiting for my schedule.  got billed $6000 for the 3 days since i was using their housing.  never fought it because of the shit i was behind from listed above. overwhelming.  you dont know you're truly overwhelmed until the overwhelming aspects make you say ""fuck it, i can't handle this' and instantly cose you 6,000$. now it's in collection.  so 3 days cost me 6 grand.  then, because i cant finish university, i now owe for the first semester - in cash - now - WITHOUT A DEGREE.  *id have no trouble paying it off with a degree*, but now? no fucking way

Hell, I need some time just to straighten this out. gonna be a lot of calls and a lawyer. before the taxes add up orw whatever its called.  it gets more expensive the more you wait.

So yeah, owe $13,000 for 1 semester + 3 days.  And no chance to return to school to get a degree to pay that off.  I know disability doesnt forgive loans btw, but you asked about my schooling history, so there.  i was straight a's up till 12th grade and semester 1 in uni where i got b's and c's.  mostly c's semster 1 in college, but thats because i was just learning study patterns / how it works blah blha blha. like seriously i didnt know that the whole concept was that study time should like, double class time. ha. i rly didnt know till after that semester. but then it was too late.

also, even if i was 100% healthy and not disabled, my life would be: work 40 hours, but only get paid for 30 after garnishment.  at 40 hour workweeks most americans cant even rent a house, so 30 is pretty nifty.

also, 3 out of 4 ppl that enroll in college aren't able to complete it in america, from an old statistic video I watched 5 years ago.


***Have you had any vocational evaluation or training?*** Yes, worked with something called ORS (Office of Rehabilitation Services / Vocational Rehabilitation Office).  I spend like $40 in gas, getting lost without a gps (never ever owned a smartphone), etc, made it on time, got my flu shots, did the training, did my first 'shift', then got a flat tire.  had to miss 3 consecutive shifts in a row for my flat tire since it was on a weekend and i 'worked' on weekends for this internship.  it was such a far drive and busses wouldn't work. day 4, i got the tire fixed on the sonnest day i could, ASAP, and the lady canceled the whole thing, no warning.  i think she was mad i texted her too late at one point, even tho i said id never text her at 10pm ever again.  she was buggin.  so she canceled it for me. i lost like so much gas and time from this.  went back to my ors counselor, she said it's a 2 month wait.  2 months passed and i got sick and missed an appointment with her, then just never followed up. didnt check my email for 2 months and when i did found out it was canceled.  i also have about a million unread emails across various sites right now from the stuff i got set back on.  i dont even feel human anymore.  i feel like a pawn in an impossible time crunch, day after day. i'd re-enroll right now but ive been handling kidney stones, and family issues,  aLOT, lately.  im being swallowed time-wise from my illnesses too, remember that.  anxiety can manifest WITH OCD to make a small task seem daunting, and you grow more anxious/fearful form it.

***Why don't you have a bedroom door?*** **tl;dr version at bottom.** I don't have a bedroom door. Partially parental reasons, partially limited room.  But mostly parental.  Here's the bedroom door response.  I'll include a **tl;dr** version of this bedroom door segment at the bottom. 

What does it really mean to not have a door? Most people in threads just say ""Oh, that sucks"". I want people here to discuss as many reasons why it sucks as possible and extrapolate. Also, coping methods are desirable, and hopefully we can huddle together for some possible solutions and mindsets that explain how we can turn this into a good thing or something somehow.   
 What does it mean to me, in brief, on a whim?  It means you can't be who you are. Your personality is set back, constantly open to judgement. Can't speak too critically or impolitely; showing excitement around friends but un-excitement around parents = you hate them in some twisted minds? You can't be sexually open. Sexuality is one of the aspects of life that makes humans human. It also elicits lots of happiness and people have sexual thoughts on average 6 times a minute IIRC. To have that hindered is cruel. You can't express yourself in front of friends properly. (this is REALLY bad in my case because I have asperger's syndrome, so fleshing myself out socially is something dear to me...) You have to be saying the right things. You cannot concentrate or have silence due to no sound barrier. There is always the chance for daily interruptions of people just walking by. No true meditation. Lessened peace. By the way, I said ""no concentration"". Do you know how massive that is? I have suffered 500+ individual times form frustration due to lack of concentration, totaling hours and hours and hours. 

**tl;dr version of the bedroom door segment:** PS: I don't have a door because my bedroom is a loft attached to a staircase (and bathroom), not because it was removed. My dad's master bedroom has a door and is empty 99.9% of the time he is awake. No, for once, that is not a fake number! He's actually never in it besides to sleep, which makes this more infuriating.

Your exact experience might not be relevant as I am not american, But you have touched on something I need to better understand as I come to yet another crisis at yet another job and once again think about applying for disability in my country.

&gt;Nobody likes working for 8 hours a day and not having time for things they would much rather be doing.

How do you draw the line between ""don't want to"" and ""can't""

Right now, I'm managing 10 hours a fortnight at work, I am able to shower every 3 days, and I'm managing to cook dinner 4/7 days. laundry is a problem, My partner and I both had to buy more clothes so I can do it fortnightly instead of weekly.

I'm surviving. But I would much rather shower daily and cook daily and wear clean clothes every week like I used to back when I wasn't working at all. I was able to really stay on top of my personal hygiene (I can't remember the last time I shaved my legs) and nutrition, I was able to keep up with my prescribed physical therapy (it's been a few weeks since I did a full routine)

On the one hand, Life is about compromises, No one gets to have things go perfectly their way. You can't have yoiur cake and eat it too, On the other hand, sometimes it feels like work is the reason I can't manage to cook or clean, and part of me thinks ""If i'm only healthy enough to do one, I want to take care of myself and my house, not work"" 

But right now I'm in an awkward middle ground. My partner is worried that if my condition deteriorates or if i need to pick up more hours to be financially secure, I'll need actual help around the home. As it is, I can only get away with showering every other day and cooking every other day because I have days off work where I can be gross and sweaty, and I'm overweight so having days where I don't really eat is basically just like lazy intermittent fasting.

But I don't feel like it's sustainable, My Disability Emmployment consultant agrees, and has suggested I ask my doctor about getting on the roster for a district nurse and meal delivery so that I can have someone help me shower and clean so that I am prepared and ready for work.

But I just can't wrap my head around hiring a carer 3 days a week to help me shower so that I have enough energy to go to work for 5 hours a week. How is that more resource efficient than me just using my energy to shower every single day and then not working at all?


What would you suggest, Do I need to just get my head around the idea that contributing to society is my responsibility and a carer is just another tool yp help me so I should embrace that?

Or should I really be asking people if they would support yet another claim for partial disability payments (I would still like to try and work 2 shifts a month, but 4 is too much right now, and even pusging myself as I am, I can't afford to live - My housemate pays my utilities)",,,1,0,0,

I was able to get into an apartment in less than two months of time on the waiting list, I was able to get into the vocational rehabilitation office and get help with filling out applications for jobs I've not received any response yet but I'm limited in where I can find work because I don't have a car and public transportation isn't the best here they only run from 8am to 6pm and only cover a small portion of the town.  In Illinois they didn't have money to fund any of the offices that are supposed to assist disabled people so definitely avoid there. 

Edit: I was able to get Medicaid and snap benefits pretty much the first week I was here with help applying from the upper Des Moines opportunity. They also provided me with information about food banks in the area and a schedule for them. I've not needed much support from many agencies as I am pretty independent and able to live by myself and most things I need are close by within a mile or two from my apartment.

2) Because off subluxations and dislocations we need room to pop our joints that have just come out of place back in something almost impossible without hitting your neighbor in economy. We also need room too fidget and change into something of a comfortable position, business seats can recline so I am not in extreme pain
3) Sleep - we are in constant pain, which leads to fatigue, there is no way around it, if I want a chance of enjoying my vacation, I need to stick to my schedule as best as I can, including sleep
4) Food - I can get nauseous from buttered toast, magnify the smell of airplane food, and then you can't even get up out of your seat until they are done and collected, business will always find something for me to eat with my meds but in economy I am out of luck. Now imagine being that girl in the middle seat puking during meal time, and no one can move to let you out. In business when I inevitably do get sick, I have space and an attendant there to help.

 Personally it has helped my depression out so much and don't think I would've made it without her help.    There are other sites like this as well, and most should offer a one on one video session \(which I highly recommend\) because they offer texting back and forth as well but that face to face is where it's at.

We live in a system that keeps people with disabilities from being able to work, so we should take advantage of the system in place to help us (disability).

Don't mater what they have to say. There is actual diagnostic testing involved. You don't need family involvement if they don't want to be involved \(mine were not\). The only input came from my fiancee \- nobody from my blood relatives wanted to be involved. Open Google and do a search for Autism testing in your area. From the results, look for a doc that has experience with diagnosing adult autism and make an appointment.

The process took me about a month, but I was indeed diagnosed with HF Autism \(aspergers is not a term used in medical literature anymore\). It is just called High Functioning autism now.

The process looks like this:

1. Initial consult. Will ask you a series of high level questions about your concerns, family life, mental health history, etc.
2. Second consult. Testing will begin. You will be tested on a wide array of psychological and personality based topics. You will have your IQ tested. You will have your memory tested. You will be asked some really bizarre questions at time. You will be shown photos/slides of various people making facial expressions and you will have to identify the mood they are expressing \(I failed this miserably\). You will be asked to try to make up stories on the fly using various props provided by the person administrating the testing \(man, I failed that one miserably too...\). This all took me about 3 \- 4 hours.
3. Final Consult. Based on the testing, an assessment will be made by the test administrator if you meet the conditions to be considered on the autism spectrum. Getting diagnosed as an adult is a weird thing and brings on lots of emotions \- especially if you have been struggling undiagnosed your entire life. Alternately, you may be found to not be on the spectrum and referred to continue meeting with a licensed mental health provider to continue your diagnosis and possible treatment.
4. Note: Insurance wont typically pay for Autism testing as an adult. In my case, the whole process cost me about $600.",,,2,0,0,

Great. Stress the importance of remaining in treatment. It cannot be overstated. A 6 month medication gap isn't great if it was against medical advise, but it isn't the end of the world. A 3 month doctor gap isn't either depending on the nature of her limitations and which doctor that 3 month gap was for. 3 month gap for a primary, who cares. Three month gap for a therapist, more significant if that is the primary reason she is disabled. Your father's opinion will not really be taken into account. A much better strategy would be to get the therapist or psychiatrist to write a statement that attributes her failure to treat during the gap to her mental health condition, and that this type of behavior is expected of someone with her diagnoses.

You'll see something along the lines of ""during the period at issue, the claimant did not seek pain management or mental health therapy. This implies that the symptoms were not problematic enough to warrant treatment. Accordingly, the condition has improved."" While this is technically an appealable issue, it is not a sympathetic case. Adjudicators and ALJs understandably get grumpy when people seek disability for untreated issues.

Our company openly does nothing for disabilities and most requests get denied, but as you're probably already well aware that doesn't mean the people stop existing or their problems go away.

The most important topic / issue to deal with is open acceptance that just because someone does a job differently that doesn't make it inherently wrong as long as the outcome is the same (or within acceptable parameters). Limiting a person's avenues to succeed is by far the fastest way to stop anyone with a disability, and likewise making sure there are enough options openly available without requiring requests is equally critical.

Small example is open work rooms. We have little cubbies that anyone in the office can work in. They can dim the lights, put on music without headphones, lay down and work, etc without putting in any kind of request. 

Most people, myself included, will not openly admit to having a disability because of the stigma and high probability of being fired in at-will states. It is very common.

I always try to 1 on 1 as many of my team as possible and write down all their pain points. Honestly disability or not just working with your team is smart. If someone is very poor at communication don't make them point person for emailing out important information. It doesn't matter if its because they're on the spectrum and suck at communicating or just someone that genuinely sucks at communicating. The outcome just won't be good. Sometimes it can't be avoided but putting someone on the spot to speak in front of a group with social anxiety is a great way to shoot down their confidence and guarantee they never perform at their best. It could be as simple as being forced to talk at a stand up when they aren't prepared. Try to remember this for daily stand ups / scrum master roles / activities and education. 

Now on the largest of teams this is nearly impossible and instead I rely on their immediate managers to do this, which means it won't get done right. I'll usually have to have some kind of follow up or SOP written to make sure it gets done correctly - I can hold them accountable then. The bigger the team, the harder it gets to make sure immediate managers are accommodating their employees.

Which brings us to the hardest thing to overcome - office culture. In the end, good office culture enables employees more than anything else. A positive and supportive environment will take ""ok"" employees and make them great, ""great"" employees become amazing, and ""amazing"" employees become rock stars. Unfortunately this isn't something you can just change. Often it starts at hiring the right people in the first place and having rules designed to reward good behaviors and dissuade bad ones. Making it clear that ""just joking"" is never an excuse to make fun of how someone is doing something, and that being supportive is always better.

You can use ice packs, take anti-inflamatories, try and massage the muscles then stretch out the joint to relocate it, that's all well and good, but if this is your first time experiencing this exact type of injury, don't risk it, you could cause nerve entrapment or vascular dissection. Call your doctor, or call your physio, tell them what has happened, ask if they can see you today or if they are comfortable for you to go to the ER. If it's outside hours, just go straight to the ER.

If you go to the doctors, ask your doctor for patient transport - someone to come get you since you can't weight bear. 

If you go to the ER, it would not be inappropriate to use an ambulance service for a hip injury. Please use one if it's an option to you. 

If you are experiencing numbness, you should go to the ER.

Even though with EDS, numbness and subluxation are common and usually harmless, ER staff will take numbness seriously, they will help relocate the joint, you can then learn how to do it properly if it happens again in the future. You can guarantee you won't accidentally injure yourself more by playing with the hip, you can get better pain management, maybe even some tape or instructions on how to perform certain tasks while you heal.

You can get it documented so if it happens again your doctor understands your history, if you're working or studying the paperwork will help you with any accommodations you will need like time off or a better chair.

Call your doctor or go to the ER. It doesn't matter that this isn't uncommon for EDS, this is a new symptom for you, and ""new injury followed by unusual sensation of numbness = ER""

Please trust me on this - I know that as EDS patients we have far to many experiences visiting the ER for a partial dislocation that can't be detected on xray, we're treated poorly and sent home, still dislocated and still in pain, only to have it finally pop back in on its own after a nap at home. The ER is historically a complete waste of time when you have EDS and a dislocation. It's the reason I talk myself out of going to hospital almost every time.

""I'll be more comfortable in bed with an ice pack just waiting than I will in a stiff hospital waiting room constantly explaining myself, I'll just wait, it usually fixes itself""

But I have regretted doing that almost every time. I have almost no documentation for many of my most problematic joints, and now I need more comprehensive treatment but were starting with zero information on my exact injuries. I wish I'd gone to the ER all the times I knew I'd fully dislocated something, at least just so they'd believe me when I tell them how often it happens when I'm home alone. ",,,2,0,0,

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1526795934,"7 seizures in 7 days is enough for some assessors to agree you are experiencing levels of disability that make it difficult or impossible to work.

However once they agree you are currently disabled, the real questions they ask to determine if you're eligible for disability welfare or benefits are: 

* how long have you experienced this level of disability? 

* for how much longer can you forsee experiencing this level of disability?


Your epilepsy used to have less impact, 1 seizure every 6 months. Historically, you did not have a disability.

You've had an increase in seizures this last week, you're trying a new med regime. It might take a few weeks to level out, but there's a chance this is just a rare bad week, and you'll go back to having more infrequent and manageable seizures and you won't be considered disabled.

Get as much information on your condition as you can. If you're going to experience 7 seizures a week for the foreseeable future, you may have a case for disability (depending on your exact location)

But if this is just a rare flare up, there may be temporary support, so you can always ask your local welfare office what services they have for temporary severe illness, otherwise you may just have to tough it out until it passes and you go back to your old baseline health. ",,,3,0,0,

that's sort of the double edge sword of being disabled. if you 'look disabled' it draws attention to you and people treat you negatively (talking down, trying to make decisions for the person, etc). if you 'don't look disabled' then people will try to make you push past what's good for your health and downplay the issues you have to deal with. since you lose either way, i would just do what helps you the most. people who aren't disabled use tools and technology to make their lives more comfortable all the time and it only becomes controversial when something is associated with disabled people. 

if you told someone it was unethical for them to use a washing machine when they could do it by hand they would think you were nuts. or like if you told them not to wear shoes since they will eventually develop calluses and be fine except for when they need to step on glass/debris which they should just suck up when it happens. no one would actually listen to you if you told them that. it doesn't hurt anyone for you to use the cane and it does hurt someone for you to not use it, that is you if you're dealing with unnecessary pain as a result.

I had a ton of pain primarily in my abdomen on my left side (seriously when it started I was like okay I know the appendix is on the right and also that I had mine removed several months ago but this feels exactly like appendicitis) that cropped up seemingly out of nowhere that nobody could figure out what was going on (and referrals to places like the Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic didn't go anywhere because neither place thought I was sick enough for them to help me).  A NP in the observation unit that I wound up in after being unable to walk referred me to my pelvic pain specialist and...yeah, it took her a whopping 30 seconds of exam time to diagnose pelvic floor dysfunction and then get into how all the muscles in that area are spasming and causing pain and in some cases entrapping some nerves causing nerve pain.  Nothing showed up on any tests because it's...basically ""just"" muscle spasms (though due to my medical history she thinks it's also likely that I have endometriosis which is a common cause of pelvic floor dysfunction and also pain but is also notorious for not showing up in anything except surgery to look for it) so...yeah it's *not* gonna show anything on bloodwork or an MRI or CT because they're not looking at what muscles are doing there.  

I see a pelvic floor PT and get trigger point injections and take meds and...still have pain, but it's much more manageable most of the time now.  And also unfamiliar docs don't start suggesting that I'm crazy or a hypochondriac because of having pain that has no cause they can find.

It won't show up on an X-ray, but it can be measured in an exam. Your legs will end up different lengths due the rotation. That, in turn, throws the whole spine out of joint, which can trigger the migraines.

The kicker is: ice works better on this injury, heat will make it worse. So if you've noticed that occurring, it may be something to look into.

Otherwise, know that it takes an average of 7 years to be properly diagnosed. At this point, you've been bedridden so long that's a health condition warranting physical therapy in itself. You may want to try that route with your doctors.

&gt;The income limit is more complicated. The way Social Security counts income is different than the way we usually think of income. Countable income includes wages or any other kind of money you earn from working, plus money you get from other sources like unemployment, Social Security retirement, or **gifts from friends**, but also, free food or shelter.

You MUST be found disabled prior to your date-last-insured to be eligible for Social Security Disability benefits.

Your VA disability and medical care would certainly still be important factors on a new application. The new application would be focused on medical treatment dated after the previous hearing denial letter. From my experience (which may not be everybody's experience), SSA is more likely to consider a VA disability rating decision when the rated conditions are still being treated and continue to cause documented symptoms. For example, I've seen several cases where someone was rated 50% or more for PTSD, but there was almost no mental health treatment to back it up, so the judges were pretty dismissive of it. When SSA/judges don't see a lot of treatment for a condition, a common reaction is ""well, then it must not be that bad.""

Also, no shame in using disposable plates/bowls/plasticware. If the ability to just toss dishes after a meal instead of washing/drying/putting away gives you back the energy to shower, that’s worth it.

Casserole is great. Look for recipes that have rice or noodles (though gf noodles can cook differently) as a base, there’ll probably be soup and water, and then dump in all the frozen veg you want. Prep should just be pouring a few cans and bags of stuff in the pan and then letting it bake. Bonus, should have tons of leftovers for one baking effort. Just watch the sodium in the soup. Also, easy to add tuna for protien.

Bean-based casseroles are also a possibility. Use canned beans for no bean prep. 

Having a batch of hard boiled eggs in the fridge is a good backup. That requires minimal cleanup and is a good quick protien shot. They can also be crumbled over precut salad greens. Or just peel the egg and takes bites of it while you’re eating the salad.

For flavor, even a few bottles of seasoning and a jar of low-sodium veggie bullion can make things so much more palatable. Something too bland? Sprinkle with your favorite seasonings and heat. It magically tastes better!

Oh, and I’m not a slow cooker person, but a friend of mine loves his and uses these liner things? I guess they’re by the foil and plastic in the grocery store, and they just lift out after cooking leaving the cooker totally clean. You’d still have to package and fridge/freeze the leftovers.

If you do have the energy occasionally for storing a few leftovers, make your own frozen dinners. A scoop of casserole, some frozen veg. Bank them in the freezer for a healthier alternative to pre-made processed stuff.

The key is finding what is palatable to you that is an easy preparation, then make it as streamlined as possible. Good luck!",,,3,0,0,

And some of them taste surprisingly decent and have vegetarian options. Easy to pour in some frozen veg while reheating for more veg content!

Also in the international section, you may find individual microwavable dishes of rice. They look very dubious, but the ones I’ve tried are way way better than minute rice. Look with the Chinese/Japanese stuff.

Oh, and for microwaving straight frozen veg, cover the plate with plastic wrap to keep the steam in. If they’re still weird, try adding a small piece of butter or a bit of oil. That can help. Along with some bottled herbs.

If you are going to get only $550/month of SSDI, there may only be a few dollars left for minor children.  Since he is entitled to more off of his father's record, he will receive that instead of the smaller benefits from your record.  Though he will be listed on your record, just in case his father's benefit stops, he will then be entitled on your record, though it will be the smaller amount at that time.  

Half of your wages after the first $65 will be deducted from the total allowable SSI benefit (check with SSA for what that is in your area).     So if you make $465 a month in wages, SSA will reduce your SSI by $200 (465-65/2=200) so if you are receiving $550 from SSDI, wages of $465, and SSI maximum potential payment of $780, then your SSI payment will actually be, after all reductions for earned and unearned income, $50.  (780-(550-20)-(465-65/2)=50)
  Your ex-husbands income will count only during the times he was living in your household.  Since you did not file a concurrent claim (SSDI and SSI) back when you became disabled, the SSI will only go back to when you filed the SSI application.  If he was out of your household before you filed for SSI then his income will not affect your SSI at any time.
If you used an attorney service and they did not have you file a concurrent claim, then they have caused you harm in your application process, and you may be able to file a claim against their malpractice insurance for all lost income due to their error.

Swiffers for everything! Mop/sweeper, duster, dusting cloths, etc. They're really efficient and disposable so I don't have to deal with things like mop buckets, dirty mop heads, cleaning feather dusters, anything like that.

One of those [extendable pincher things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O47NWE6/) to help pick stuff up off the floor. 

[An extendable scrubber](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L9X4WCE) for the bathroom. The shape makes it really easy to get into corners.

A [clothes folder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019KGCT9E) makes it really easy to fold your clothes, and I can use this on my lap while sitting down in bed.

A [walker with a seat](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NFJX0PU/) makes it really easy to get around to do things and has a seat for when I need to sit down. The basket that most come with helps to carry supplies from one room to the next.

[Stick vaccums](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075P7J8BB) are super lightweight and easy to maneuver even from a couch or bed.

A [scrubbing attachment that goes on a power drill](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075C9W4RM) is *so* helpful when you don't have the strength or stamina to scrub by hand.

I swear by all of the Kaboom products. All of them are no-effort cleaning supplies. They have [toilet cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LPEO64G), [mold and mildew cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KS18UY8/), and, of course, [the famous shower foam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J5HCRI2/).

An automatic vacuum like a roomba is great for most people, but I've never had one so I can't comment myself.

Soak your dishes. There are special products that help get dried on food off your dishes, but I've found that just soaking them in hot water for 20-30 minutes before trying to wash them gets most stuck on food off. For really tough, baked on gunk, add a dryer sheet to the water. Sounds weird, but it helps soften up the crusty blackened burnt on food and it comes off easily.

For food that's stuck on the inside of the microwave, take a cup of water, add some lemon juice, and microwave it on full power for 6 minutes. The food will wipe right off.

I might think of more things later. If I do I'll come back and edit this post.

Tbh, we all go through self-hatred at your age, and for disabled people that's a bit more personal and acute. Partly because we look back and realise that we were treated differently because we are disabled. All I can say is you do come out the other side and start to accept yourself for who you are.

They provide some basic function for people who don't have anything (ex.: if you were missing a hand and part of an arm), but you probably can do as much with your hand (even if it's just to hold something still) as you would do with a mechanical arm. 

Technically, the few labs experiments I have seen were done one people who were missing an arm, at least below the elbow. One of the reasons is that they basically use the forearm to hide all the batteries and equipment needed for the 2 or 3 fingers that move independently.

My wife has a disability – a different one that involve her legs – and she tells me that avoidance is the ""best"" way to get lots of stares while confrontation often remediates the issue. Likewise, if you hide your hand, some people will stare and wonder what's wrong with her hands, how will she drink her coffee, etc. but otherwise they will look for a few seconds and will see ""Oh, she has a crooked hand"" and will go on with their life.",,,2,0,0,

I cant think of many things the average person can do that you cant. So maybe you wont be a concert pianist, but neither will most people.

IMO think of the list of things you think will give your life meaning and see how many things on that list require two hands. Likely not many. You probably do a shitty job of bagging groceries though!

I've adopted the matrix philosophy on things... ""There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.""

Telling you that its probably not going to matter much in the grand scheme of things is unsatisfying and belittling, telling you to be thankful for what you have sounds like some hallmark card bullshit, Instead I'll ask can you find moments of joy in your life? sure with both hands it might be easier or greater in variety, but as long as you can find things you enjoy things will be ok. Yeah its kind of a make your own meaning cliche sort of thing, but everyone struggles with that IMO.

as far as not interacting with other people, I'd say don't hide it. easy for me to say, but I think most people wont really care. People can be really self conscious about canes, but that's mostly in their head. In general people don't give a shit about others or what they are going through. Use that apathy to your advantage. the self conscious aspect is self sustaining, so let it go. Maybe little bits at a time. People are going to relate to you based on what you can do for them more than anything else.

Short of having something like tentacles for fingers you probably wont attract too much attention.

I'm not, nor ever have been in your position. However, I work in a School where many people are in the same, similar, or worse off in terms of physical disabilities.   
   
Some are ashamed. Some don't care at all. That's life, different people feel differently. You can't control how you currently feel, but you can work on how you feel in the future.   
   
Your body is one tiny part of what makes you you. Your hand is a small part of that body. Some people can't spell. Some can't read. Some can't use their hands. Some can't use their legs. None of them are less people than anyone else. You may have some restrictions in life, but everyone does, just to different extents.   
   
My recommendation would be find a group of people, especially other young ones, who are in similar positions to you. Meet them, realise that they can be cool, awesome, intelligent, funny, and all sorts of other things. Your hand may be a focus for you right now than makes you feel bad. So focus on other things. Learn a skill, get good at one hand typing and write a book. Get really into learning about science. Teach yourself a magic trick. Life is a million small things that come to make existence. Focus on the ones that make you happy. I promise, most people (especially once you're out of high school, and especially the people worth knowing) won't care at all about your hand except when it comes to passing you the snacks as you watch a sunset together :)

This letter, established when you first inquired about SSI, states that she are not eligible because the letter was sent out before the application was completed. If you have completed all requirements for the application, and SSA has sent your claim to DDS, then you can disregard that letter.

Here’s my armchair diagnosis: when you started the application online, it opened a window called a protective filing. This means that the date that you started the application is the filing date whether the claim is completed next week or ten years from now, unless the protective filing is closed out.

When the application was taken in your office, that closed out the protective filing. However, in the computer system, you still have one open from either the appointment or the online application. In order to tell the system that this application has been taken, a close out notice (it probably says L991 on one of the corners), gets automatically generated. 

The key takeaway here is you want to directly call the claims representative who took your claim (phone number and extension on the application). This person can give you a definitive answer of, “Don’t worry about it, our system is wack,” or “Yes worry about it, here’s how you file an appeal.” Don’t bother with the national number, they probably won’t understand the issue. 

When you call the claims rep, you will probably go to voice mail because that person is taking claims all day. When the office isn’t open to the public, that’s when they can get started on their mountain of voice mails. 

TLDR: Contact the claims rep who took your claim. It might take him or her a day or two to return your call. Chances are the letter (L991) is just clearing out a part of SSA’s totally wack system, and the claim is continuing as it should. ",,,3,0,0,

Having a disability and being disabled are the same thing.

The problem is that the pension provided to people who have a disability that impacts them to the point they can't work is called ""the disability pension"" in most countries, so colloquially, general society starts using phrases like ""he's on disability"" to explain that someone is disabled to the point they can't work. Over time, that gets shortened to ""he's disabled"" 

Likewise, when someone asks what you you do for a living, a person who has a disability and can't work because of it might say ""oh, I have a disability""/""I'm disabled"" as a way of explaining quickly why they are not working.

So the definition gets blurred. 


Picture ""disability"" as a spectrum. On one end, you have (to use your example) Daredevil, who has a disability and is disabled when it comes to to sight, if you ask him to read you a standard print book, he's always going to be disabled in that task. On the other end of the spectrum, you have people who can not work at all and rely on a pension for basic survival.


I'd love to give you another example that might help show you how broad this spectrum can be. [Paul Alexander](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4414081) is one of the [last remaining polio survives using an iron lung](https://youtu.be/gplA6pq9cOs)

He became paralysed at the age of 6 and has spent the rest of his life primarily inside the iron lung.

He attended law school. He sat for the bar, he practises law, he's writing his memoirs, all independently from inside his iron lung.

He has a disability, he is disabled, (he self identifies as ""crippled"") but on the spectrum, his mind still works, and he's a creative problem solver, so he uses his abilities and in his case, his abilities allow him to maintain gainful employment.",,,3,0,0,

My mother and I both have EDS, she attempted to breastfeed me as an infant and we ran into 3 major issues.

* skin fragility - all nursing mothers will eventually experience chapped nipples, irritation and pain. But with how EDS effects my mother's skin, just a few minutes of nursing had her nipples bleeding raw.

* Gastrointestinal dysfunction - my mother has a large number of unspecified and idiopathic GI symptoms as do many people with EDS. Between the stress of a new mum, having no time to relax and eat, and having malabsorption issues, She struggled to main enough of a calorie surpluss to keep up with milk supply.

* infant with a disability - my EDS was also a factor. My jaw wasn't stable enough for me to latch correctly, and my chiari malformation altered my suckling reflex. In addition to this, I had dysphagia and would frequently inhale milk. 

The end result was thats mum hand expressed when she could (as pumps were also damaging to her skin) and used formula to make up the difference in what I needed.

My grandmother, an old school midwife, suggested mixing cornflour (I think it's called cornstarch in America, it's like arrowroot powder) with my milk and formula to make it drinking custard consistency to compensate for my swallowing issues. This was then fed to me via a dropper/pippet, eventually moving up to a large syringe.

My brother, who also has EDS, avoided the jaw and suckling issues, so he was bottle fed, but again, with a mixture of formula and breast milk, with a added cornflour because he had reflux/GERD, mum says it was probably a ratio of 80:20 for both us kids.",,,2,0,0,

Nan was Scottish (Dundee), I'm not sure where she studied nursing, but she came to Australia after WWII because we had a nursing shortage. She got her midwifery practitioners licence, she worked in rural clinics before becoming a DON at a major rural hospital. She was always about holistic, sustainable healthcare, and I guess being a rural nurse, she learned the think outside the box for ways to treat people with complex conditions. 

She didn't want to put an infant on all the prokinetic and antispasmodic drugs the doctors prescribed if simple cornflour would manage the symptoms. 

(to this day, I'm supposed to take domperidone tablets for my achalasia, but I just eat a puree diet instead because it works and I'm comfortable) 

My mum is actually quite fortunate, while she has hyperelastic and fragile skin, the only joints she really has issues with are her ankles, cervical spine and symphysis pubis. So positioning for breastfeeding didn't pose as many issues for her as it might have done if I had chosen to have kids/breastfeed. In my case almost all my joints experience some level of dysfunction, especially my hands, hand expression is quite painful. (I haven't breastfed, but it's lactate due to my chiari malformation - I notice my gastroparesis and the resulting fasting definitely affects my supply, it will never ever dry up, but it will swing from 5ml to 100ml per day) there are many days when I can't physically sit up because my spine is so unstable, and being quite busty, side lying to breastfeed would probably smoosh baby.

We have a disability, but we're not completely incapable of autonomy. I know I need a straw, so I take a reusable straw everywhere I go, I have a shorter, spare one threaded through the chain of my medical alert lanyard. My water bottle has a built in straw, as long as I remember it, I will never get dehydrated.

I don't understand why other people with disabilities (the ones who support articles like this) suddenly expect the able-bodied world to provide everything we could ever need when they never have before.

Public toilets don't have free pads and tampons even though some women need them. Women have always had a responsibility to bring them.

If I expect a bar or restaurant to serve me a drink that's 100% accessible when I know I need a speciality tool (straw) should I also expect them to provide me arthritis friendly cutlery and a hip precaution chair? No, restaurants have always had whatever cutlery and the world's most uncomfortable stools.

I plan ahead, I bring my straw, I bring my cutlery, I bring my walking frame to sit on.

Having a disability means taking care of yourself. That means bringing a straw if you can't possibly go without a straw.

It's harsh but it's life. ""disability"" covers such a wide range, we all have incredibly varying, sometimes contraindicated needs (eg: low sensory spaces for people with ASD, bright well lit spaces for people with mild visual impairments). It's simply not practical for the world to always cater to our needs. 


#ALTERNATIVELY

Bars and restaurants can have a stash of reusable straws (silicone, pyrex, metal, there's a lots of options - they can be cleaned and sterilised in industrial dish washers just like cutlery, or washed out out with a pipe cleaner in the the sink.) keep them behind the counter until someone says ""do you have straws? I need one"" et viola, they use the straw and return it to the bar along with the glassware to be washed for next time.

If that's too much effort, paper straws will do in an emergency for a single drink, they're cheap and compostable (depending on the wax used). Bars and restaurants can use them the way they currently use plastic straws. ",,,15,0,0,

Paper towels, like tissues, are specifically manufactured to *not* crumble when wet. That's the whole purpose of them; to hold together and absorb moisture. Toilet paper is manufactured in a different way, specifically so that they disintegrate when wet in order to avoid causing clogs.

Second, I’m very purposeful about gas station choices. I only go to larger gas stations, because the smaller ones have the issue of only one employee. This limits me from many stations in my area, and I had to actively scope out options to find the bigger ones. But after research, I’ve found enough larger ones locally for this to not be a big deal. When I travel on longer trips, I just try to keep an eye out for good-looking larger stations. Big stops off the interstate are good. If I’m in a town, I’ll look up a couple stations beforehand and find one that is bigger. A little premeditation goes a long way. I always scope out options, and I try not to get myself low enough on gas that I’d have to try a bad station.

My third strategy is that I don’t honk for help like the signs all say (the exception to this is Costco, where that really does work fine). Those signs mostly seem like bullshit to me. No one inside the gas station is going to respond to a honk...plus no one likes honking. So I just pull up the gas station on my phone and call and ask for help when I’m there. If for some reason I can’t call, or I know I’m going inside anyway, I’ll ask in person.

Overall this has worked great for me! Very few stressful situations. The worst that has happened is guessing the size wrong, only one employee, then having to drive down the road to a different station. But in general, I’ve found people happy to help.",,,6,0,0,

I don't use anything for assistance but my gait is very noticeable.

If not, no biggie..I just pay full price.

I know the inconsistencies can suck. Back home I was able to get a disabled bus pass by just showing up and filling out an application at  local transportation HQ. No questions asked. A few years later I moved to a major city. And in order for me to get a discounted transportation card, l had to get my doctor to fill out some paperwork. Just walking into the transportation agency and telling them I have cp wasn't enough even though physically it's very obvious.  They needed it documented.  I've also had another organization tell me I had to be on SSI or have some kind of medical card in order to use their services(none of which I had). I very quickly learned that there is huge difference between being disabled and being disabled with documentation. 

Even with paperwork, not all disablilities are covered. For example, I think alcoholism can be considered a disability in CA but I highly doubt it's a covered conditon under most disabled discount policies that businesses chose to  provide. However, since they can't ask just carry some kind of proof with you(paperwork for your dog?Medicaid card?). Otherwise they have no way of knowing if people are just taking advantage of them.
