You can always frame the conversation that you read about this program and just want more information in case your situation changes.  They were actually very helpful which I found surprising, but in a good way. Don’t be afraid to call them. They have your info already from SSA. 

Many people want to try to work but worry about insurance since you cannot love without it in the US with a chronic medical condition. There are processes meant to ensure continuation of medical coverage while you attempt to work.  As long as you are documenting your attempts with SSA and staying above board with the IRS/taxes and such, they will help you extend your healthcare for quite a long time while you continue to try to work. 

If it doesn’t work out, they can even fast track your reapplication.

Unfortunately more states are putting in prescription restrictions for both opiates and benzos, since doctors are starting to realize that about a third of opiate overdoses also include benzos, which greatly increases the risk of overdose.  There have been pharmacies who flat out refused to refill scripts for patients who had been legally prescribed high doses for years due to backlash about benzos/opiates.

Is there any chance she will let you go back up on the klonopin if you are willing to cut the pain medication?  I know some of the people who were on both ended up going back to their doctor and reinstating the klonopin and cold turkeying their pain meds.  While the withdrawal from pain meds sucked, for people who were very sensitive to benzo withdrawal, it was usually much better than dealing with long term benzo withdrawal.  That being said, be careful, because other doctors have just cut patients off benzos completely with no time to taper.  If she's already cut you down to 2, she could be planning on cutting you down again next month.

SSI is for the very, very poor, with no other means of support. Other than the able account for those declared disabled by the SSA before 26 and limited in use, and a few possible ticket-to-work type things I'm not very familiar with, there's nothing.

There is a HARD asset limit of $2000. If at any time you go above $2000 in assets, they will cut you off, go after you for overpay, and I've heard many stories about how long it takes to get them to turn it back on once you've done so. They say save,  but they do not mean it. Do not save. 

The program is not for those with a good family of even moderate income. It's intended for nothing more than just barely surviving, for those with no other means of survival or assistance. You don't ""thrive"" on $750/month, but you may not die. 

As to how, it's not easy but is doable. You go someplace with decent EBT and medicaid rules and a low cost of living. You save (in cash) each month for $100-$900 items that will last the years and make surviving on so little possible. You learn to buy in parts and assemble yourself, make from scratch, repair, and make good use of good will and yard sales. My husband, two cats, and I live entrely off my $736 SSI as our sole income. It's doable, and we have a decent and relatively comfortable life, better than many of our working poor and/or SSDI-receiving neighbors, by using a bit of planning and forethought. You can have a really nice computer, if you buy it one part at a time during the times of the year when each part goes on sale, over the course of 2 years or so. You can make 2 loaves of bread for $0.17 instead of the stores $1 for one, and a good stand mixer or breadmaker from goodwill or a yard sale makes it as easy as and sometimes faster than riding the bus out to go buy some. We pay $50 extra rent a month until we get a 3 month surplus. Then if a big expense comes up, or something goes wrong with distribution or the bank or anything, or we're too sick to make it to the bank and the money order store, we're good, we go collect our receipt and use the extra $425 we didn't spend on rent to fix the problem. 

 Yes it sucks. No it's not fair. It is, however, significantly better than being dead, which is the other alternative for those who absolutely can not work and truly have no other means of support or assistance, no family, friends, or others who are able or willing to help.

If you are sensitive to the drop, please look over this manual, as it talks about how to safely decrease your benzo use if you are dependent through the use of a slow taper.  The Ashton Manual was written by a doctor who helped hundreds of patients off of their prescribed benzo through a slow taper.  (not everyone has to go this slow, but some have to go even slower if withdrawal symptoms are severe.  She also recommends crossing over to valium, but this is not required from klonopin since it has a long half life.)  https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/

That being said, it may be in your interest to start tapering one or the other.  Some states are starting to put in regulations about prescribing the two together, and many patients are being cold turkeyed off of their benzos.

Here’s the key thing: the system where your name is updated with your SSN is a different system than the one that pays your benefits. When you get your name changed and order a new card, explicitly tell the individual that you are receiving Title 2 (Social Security Disability), Title 16 (Supplemental Security Income), or a combination of both.

Generally, most folks getting a name change are not receiving benefits, and the person doing the name change doesn’t think to check the MBR (Master Beneficiary Record, for Title 2) or the SSID (I don’t remember what that stands for, but it is the Title 16 payment record). 

Another consideration is when you get your bank account updated with the new name and when you receive your benefit payment. There are a lot of moving parts, and I recommend getting your name updated with SSA on the day (or a few days after) that you receive your benefit. You will probably need to wait at least a day before you can get a new state issued license from MVD or DMV.

Then, head to the bank as soon as possible to get that information updated. It might make sense to check with your bank ahead of time to figure out what they require from you.

I am doing board and train for the first few months, until the dog is potty trained, obedience trained, and ready to start public access in places that aren’t pet friendly. Tasks would be started but not finished. The dog would then live with me, but I would meet with my trainer on a weekly basis for about 12 months after the dog moves in with me, but she normally gets her dogs public access trained by the time they’re 6-7 months old, and then it’s just finishing task training. If the dog needs more work than once a week, she’s offered to meet me twice a week at no extra charge.

So yeah, it’s confusing, but I can’t have the dog in my home until it is potty trained and obedience trained, so she’s going to work on everything (potty training, obedience, tasks, and public access) with the pup during the first few months with the board and train (I have planned visits twice a week to train with the pup during that time so we can bond), and once the dog is obedience and potty trained, I will then house the dog and she’ll meet me to train instead of me meeting with her.

She trains her pups (the ones she’s boarding and training) every day, and she’s a very experienced trainer, so I trust her process. I know several people she’s worked with and their dogs are amazing.",,,1,0,0,

17db397e-46b0-4639-965f-46cb78549dc6,1544579620,"I am so sorry that you seem to be struggling with this. I personally do not have similar issues, but I know someone who was in a similar position. He had so many surgeries, and eventually had a surgery that was bunged and he woke up with an amputated leg to just below the knee. Sidenote: he got a massive payout from the hospital.

But I have been told by friends who knew him before the surgery, and apparently he is much happier now. And it truly seems his quality of life has increased.

Not saying amputation is the answer, I couldn't imagine how hard that choice would be and I'm sure you've heard similar before anyway.

I guess something to consider is how to improve your life in little ways. Any kind of gait issues could make your hips and muscles hurt, so it could be worth looking into having crutches on hand for particularly bad days, to give you a bit of a break. 

Have you spoken to physiotherapists? They can really help you out. Or look into Hydrotherapy, working out in hydrotherapy pools are truly God's gift (I used to do my physio in them. And usually they use bromine instead of chlorine). 

If you feel that your Dr is assuring you that you're going to be fine/it isn't that bad, I would personally find a different doctor. You are the one experiencing it, if they keeps pushing back your worries, maybe it's worth getting a second opinion (even if it's to get some peice of mind). I find that younger and newer general practitioners are more open and take things more serious.

It is incredibly important to have a good support network, psychologically and physically. You might have to be blunt with your parents too, and explain that false assurances are not helpful and to be realistic and open. 

Depending on what country you are in. I would suggest looking into chronic pain programs. I have attended one 9 week program, and one of the better parts was just being around people who have these issues and comparing types of pain and experiences. A place that doesn't tell you it's not a big deal. Also I found nice support groups on Facebook for my personal situation (as like you, there's a depressing lack of info on Google). You could also look into charities surrounding your situation and maybe they could point you in direction to support groups.

Of course I would also suggest looking into psychologists or counselling. But of course it depends on your healthcare and situation. 

Sorry if you're already on-top of most of this, but it's just so easy to let yourself fall between the cracks. 

Sorry also that I couldn't give you specific outlooks, but I hope this at least helps a little. Goodluck and I hope you find what you're looking for.

The cushion pouch contains a flashlight/USB battery bank, phone cable and 4AA batteries (photography purposes such as flash or transmitter losing power unexpectedly.

I've tried hanging the pouch on the outside of my leg, instead of between my legs, but it cut off to much circulation. Pain, edema and potential blood clots, I do not need.

The average SSDI payment is roughly $1,200/mo, or about $14,400 year. Some states will have state disability programs too, but that still won't get you to where you probably are. 

Aside from the payments not being enough, the chances that you would qualify for disability are slim; making the assumption that you are under 50 years old. If you are capable of doing any other work (regardless of whether you are trained for it or how much it pays), then you don't qualify for disability. 

As another person with back issues - I totally feel for your situation. But, as a word of advice - your back health needs to be your #1 priority. Long term, you are better off starting from the bottom in a different job, and working your way up to a better salary. If you keep doing what you're doing, it will eventually get to a point where you won't be able to work at all, not to mention your condition will just get more debilitating.

4da103c0-2793-43d2-aa7d-1260ea32e6d4,1545867088,I found a dentist that sees Medicaid patients. Unfortunately Medicaid does not cover root canals or crowns so all I have been able to get done is filling my teeth which I started doing a couple years ago. Now most of those fillings have cracked and all that's left to be done is to have the teeth yanked. Now at 39 years old I am missing half my molars. On the plus side I did not have to pay for the extractions and I am no longer in pain on that side of my mouth. On the downside it is very hard to eat and painful to eat and I now have TMJ in the side of my jaw that I eat on. There are certain foods I can not eat any more such as raw vegetables or anything crunchy. When I do I usually end up losing a filling and risking those teeth having to come out as well. Also these teeth that I have left are very painful and I would rather just get them pulled out so I can get partial dentures and actually be able to eat regular food again.

Don't believe everything you hear. Also EBT/foodstamps can vary a lot state to state, but in many, this would not be unusual. 

In some states the person who doesn't own the house can get a letter saying they rent a room in return for chores but are responsible for purchasing, storing, and prepping their food separately, but they still wouldn't get much.

My husband and I live entirely off just my $736 SSI, no other income, subsidies,or other assistance aside from EBT and we only get $163. He's deathly allergic to chicken and I have severe sensory issues that make most foods extremely painful and unswallowable. I have to make all our bread products myself to afford to feed us even at least once a day.

Some places are surprisingly accessible, for example, Rocamadour in the Dordogne is an perched cliff village on 3 levels. There is a lift that that goes to each level as well as a nicely paved path.

Trains in Spain are easy as they have the Attendo service which will provide a person and a small lift to help you on an off the train. You can book on their website or there's an app for that.  France is getting there, but their service is a bit more sporadic.

I was able to get my local SSA contact to get me in contact (via email) with someone at the federal level. This is relevant text of that email.

""A 401k or 403b (in your case) is not a resource as far as supplemental security for your kids is concerned because you can't cash it. You can only cash the balance out if you turn 59 1/2 years old or you end employment at &lt;redacted&gt;.""

I had to provide documentation of the retirement plan before the lady would state that - proving that I can't just cash it out - apparently some 401k providers will allow it. Most don't, including mine.

I later had a phone conversation with my local contact and he said that in the event that I do switch jobs, I have to roll it over immediately or they will count it as a resource.

But basically, SSI for kids doesn't care about tax deferred retirement accounts as long as they can't be directly withdrawn for cash.

&gt; Example: A 24"" rise requires a minimum ramp length of 24’ (288"") (24 divided by 1).

a3b2548a-e815-45f2-a782-2484f4324f64,1543905459,"Not stupid abd can definitely happen. Few ideas:

Ask the pool when they've got a slot available for a weekly training session.
Figure out cost. Figure out cost of a trainer that's disability friendly (not competitive, knows how to spot someone who's doing more than they should. A PT looking for a second job would be great! They can read up on water polo while you get a group together)

Calculate cost per person to not get into debt. If you want to make it truly disability friendly maybe consider variable/adjustable fees, the more people join, the lower the fees will get. (Cheap is a good incentive!)

Then put up a flyer at the pool.

Disabled? Old? Fed up with the same old laps?
Join our slow, relaxed and friendly waterpolo team! 
First 2 times are free! (If there are already enough people to afford a trainer, otherwise say you're establishing a group and it's free until fees are determined, or mention the variable fees plan, more people means a lower fee per person )

Add a website that has more info, add a QR code, add tear off strips at the bottom.

Start a Facebook group for your area.

In the beginning if it's a (too) small group it's probably too expensive to pay for pool space and a trainer, so just DIY agree on a time where most people can come, and throw a ball around until you've got more people. Or only pay for the trainer and use a small/empty corner of the pool until someone stars complaining.


Looks like as soon as you've got 14 you can play a proper game. (Much) More is better so you'll always have enough players, and they can take a break when needed, that way everyone can play how much they can.

If you've got enough people, start a point system like wheelchair rugby has. The more disabled you are the higher you score. Two teams need to have roughly equal total scores. This way you can have people with little/no leg mobility join with some floaties to keep them from drowning. Put on flyer wheelchair users are welcome.

It's easier to keep team total point counts even if you don't see it as two separate teams, someone on the sidelines can swap places with someone on either team.

Contact local physical therapy/doctors/rehab for people interested in training you, and put up some flyers there too.

Maybe see if trainer (and pool) is willing to volunteer for free until you have enough people where everyone can pay/chip in.

A lot of people assume that there's help available if you really truly need it, and are shocked to learn that isn't necessarily true. 

Beyond the need based and work based disability programs the SSA runs, there aren't any federal programs or assistance available nationwide. Different states vary radically on how much and what sort of help they provide. Some will provide a monthly disability, that may or may not be a pittance, and sometimes is taken back out of your backpay once you get SSI. Non-governmental help from United Way or other similar help may help with electricity or rent, or may not. 

If you aren't opposed to religious help, some churches go above and beyond in support of those needy who are willing to attend regularly, and may provide temporary help to nonattendees in desperate need.  The Mormons provide a fuckton of help to attendees and members. The Catholics are also pretty decent at help and are more likely to offer the same assistance whether you attend or not.

I would recommend getting that Dx. asap. Without a dx, you're gonna have a real hard time with the SSA regardless of symptoms. If your Dx is serious enough, it could even be on the SSA's auto-approve list, making this a month sorta thing instead of a years sorta thing.

Most I knew (including myself) traded home chores and sometimes food for a place to stay, getting the letters saying you prep and buy your food separately for EBT and saying you owe $350/month passdue rent upon approval for SSI, and barely survived the years it took. Many relocated to where friends were or more favorable states, often losing everything they owned in an attempt to hang on long enough.

Eeo (aka equal employment opportunity)  is not the same as requesting a reasonable accommodation  under ADAAA. 

Now most EEO companies have their shit together because they do business with the government  and get money from the government. They are randomly audited by the department of labor Requirements therefore EEO (aka: federal contractors)  will tend to do better at following US and Global laws; as a result of the additional  requirements they must meet. 

Any company whether or not they are considered federal contractors (see note above) and has more employees than the federal government (federal threshold is 15) or state threshold (if lower than 15 employee and determined by the state you work in)  .... should be attempting to accommodate any physical medical disability  

Note: I am a Director of Human resources legal compliance.  

This statement just answers your main question is it worth applying and working for an EEO company..,,, absolutely. 

If there is something else specific you would love to discuss or need info on. Let Me know.

The difference between how I handle each of them is vastly different from the others. My congenital eye condition? No big deal, it's been a part of my life since day one, though it did keep me from pursuing the career I had hoped for. It impacts my daily life, but it's a part of me I can never remove. My chronic pain, IBS, and ptsd? Major stressors that cause considerable emotional pain and grief. I feel like these impact my life more as well, but that's purely circumstantial. I grieved very quickly over my eye condition, because it was easier to accept since it's all I'd ever known. But know life without pain and without ptsd, for example, makes existing with it that much harder. I know what I'm losing. I used to be able to do so many things I can't now.

My guess, since you ask, is that your point is something like the following:

&gt;The people on this sub have no misconceptions about having a disability. They live with disabilities every day, and we are the victims of those misconceptions, not the perpetrators. Therefore, /u/71050a81-ce44-4734-a383-5c1ba6c454b8 , your post does not belong here. It belongs in a different forum, such as /r/TodayILearned or /r/videos, where the small-minded able-bodied people who make our lives more difficult -- and close us into capsules of oppression with their assumptions -- would gain enlightenment and understanding.

If that's inaccurate in any way, please let me know. (Again, I don't like having to guess or assume these things.) If this hypothesis of mine is correct, however, allow me to provide the following rejoinder. Let me preface it, however, by saying that I don't want to drag this exchange out any longer, so this could very well be the last thing I post in this thread.

Everybody, everywhere -- regardless of background or situation -- has the potential to misconceive things. I am a teacher, but I have misconceptions about the nature of education. I live in Wisconsin, but I have misconceptions about what life in my state is like. I am a guy, but I have misconceptions about guys. I am an American, but I don't know everything there is to know about this country. 

Even about myself, as an individual, there are things I don't recognize or understand in the deep recesses of my mind. The human brain -- at least my own -- is an infinite labyrinth of mystery and confusion. One of the most important revelations any person can achieve (I speak mostly of my own experience, and the experiences I've observed in my students) is the awareness of how little we truly understand. As Socrates said: ""The more I learn, the more I know I know nothing.""

The most difficult thing for me about this lack of understanding is the way it holds me back. I hesitate to try new things, because I am afraid of what those attempts might mean. I am reluctant to think of myself in certain ways, because I have not seen those things lived by others. I am loath to experiment with art forms, because I don't understand how they could exist. 

But when I see someone do a thing about which I have a misconception, it opens a fragment of possibility for me. When I had a really great English teacher in high school, it convinced me that there were other possibilities for how a person might approach the profession. This understanding grew when I read Paulo Freire's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*. It grew more when I did my student teaching.

All of this is to say, to the one and only person who appears to have even seen or noticed this post: I thought maybe this video might be useful or helpful to anyone who felt trapped by a disability. I do not suffer from any disabilities myself (aside from minor chronic leg pains and a slightly mutilated thumb inflicted by a dog fight one year ago). Therefore I confess to an attempted humility when I post in this /r/. Nevertheless I thought I might take a chance and post this, on the off chance that it could be useful to anyone looking in.

Obviously I was wrong. I am not wounded by the downvotes. It happens. 

My whole life is a series of similar chances. I put books in front of my students on the off chance that they might read them. Usually they don't. I share music with my students, in the hope that the lyrics might inspire some deep conversations. Usually they don't. I write stories and books, on the off chance that people might be interested or helped by them. Usually they are met with silence. 

Even in this moment, I am obviously babbling with my usual logorrhea, in the hope that explaining myself might build some kind of bridge between you, /u/7773248b-3484-4be2-9f72-f54a7958c0b3 , and myself. I will not be surprised or wounded if you reply with ""TLDR"" or ""yeah whatever go away dude"" or some similar truncated response. It's par for the course. 

I would hope, however, that we could have some other conversation. Maybe you could share something personal -- as I have done -- and explain why the video has caused such a negative reaction. The more honest and specific you can be, the more I can learn about the nature of my misstep. 

I don't get that kind of feedback from my students, so I'm hoping I can find it somewhere else. But even if you choose not to go down that path, I appreciate your time, and I hope you have a good weekend.",,,2,0,0,

3381bfde-9ef1-45fa-a335-62d9be6203bf,1544581969,"I don't have club foot, but I have an arthritic left foot that's had a couple surgeries, and I've had arthritis in my foot since I was 21 (broke it very badly at age 18, all metatarsals were broken or displaced, it didn't heal right for a variety of reasons). It has some obvious scarring, is kinda lumpy looking (really lumpy when it's swollen) and generally disqualifies me from ever dating a foot fetishist lol. I'm now 28, nearly 29. I do have chronic pain. I have to wear special shoes, either expensive neutral running shoes or expensive comfort shoes. I do work full time, but it's a desk job. However some days the pain is just really bad. I'm allergic to opioid painkillers and have a bad reaction to NSAIDs if I take strong ones more than one or two days in a row. Tylenol is not helpful. So I'm frequently SOL on pain relief.

The biggest helpers for me have been water aerobics and regular massage. Both are kinda pricey (aerobics through a higher end gym, massage out of pocket) and of course not covered by insurance or anything. Massage helps me release my IT band, which I expect you may also have issues with (outside of leg, especially the outer thigh) since any kind of gate issue can mess it up. The massage is uh... Not fun. It's frequently painful, but it makes a huge difference. I think people think of massage as relaxing and chill but therapeutic massage is frequently painful and my therapist will have me give movie synopses or tell a story while he works my IT band so I remember to breathe. Take a rolling pin and push it up and down your outer leg, hard, like you're rolling out dough. That will give you an idea of how tight your IT band is. My therapist puts his elbow against mine to help work it loose and uuuuugh it hurts but it's so helpful in the long run.

 Water aerobics has been a life changer. Just being in the water, not having weight on my foot is such a relief. I had no idea it would help this much. And truly water aerobics helps more than just swimming or sitting in a hot tub. No idea why. I will say that my knee frequently gets water on it due to the foot causing me to walk incorrectly, so water aerobics helps that too. I'm the only person under 40 in the class but I don't even care. The ladies are all very nice though lol.

I will say, I was quite athletic until the arthritis, running 5-10K mostly days and lifting, and I remain as active as I can, working out 3-4 days a week lifting and doing low impact activities. I think that has helped. Having stronger bones and muscles helps support my joints. But I do get tired easier and have to be more careful.

Being young with a mobility problem that will never go away fucking sucks. Like, I cried when I was diagnosed. I just sat in my car and cried. And I still cry sometimes because I'm in pain and I hate it and I did everything ""right"" and I'm still in pain. I have to wear an ugly brace at night (sexy I know) and have inserts which I can't really afford so I buy cheap versions. I own a cane but if I'm going to water aerobics I rarely need it. I get depressed when I'm in pain. But, ultimately, I think my life isn't that much different than other people's. Mainly my medical/medical related expenses are higher. Occasionally I have really good days where I will out-walk my friends with ease. Other days I'm leaning nearly all my body weight on a grocery cart and limping through the produce section. Other days I don't even make it that far and just don't eat or order food because the idea of shopping or cooking is too much. 

But, most of the time, if I'm going to water aerobics, wearing good shoes, getting massages, stretching, and wearing my brace, I do fine. I'm lucky to make enough money to have all those supports in place, though I can't afford to see an orthopedist (and they just always recommend surgery because they're greedy af honestly). I hope someone with an actual club foot sees this and can give you more on point info!",,,9,0,0,

The answer for questions like this is always maybe. Does he have Medicaid? Is he also on disability? Then it depends on his limitations and what he needs help with. 

If he isn’t already declared disabled then it’s unlikely that Medicaid (if he even has Medicaid) would pay for a caregiver. 

It happens but if it were that easy then everyone’s mom or dad or friend or sibling or roommate would get paid to be their caregiver. Sorry, probably not what you wanted to hear :(

5ab4acb4-e4a9-4b4c-9094-04cae42cf90f,1544392341,"First off, it costs nothing to file so there is nothing to lose.

Next, I've seen enough people (even young people like you) get approved due to anxiety to know that it's absolutely possible with the right set of facts.

The problem (as I see it) with depression/anxiety (they invariably go together) is that pretty much anyone can get a diagnosis. I've never put this to the test, but I would bet that any sufficiently-motivated person could get a diagnosis and rx for depression/anxiety within 24hrs. I don't say that to downplay the severity of those conditions. I say it so that you'll stop thinking that you're noteworthy because you have a stack of papers with ""recurrent severe major depressive disorder"" and/or ""severe anxiety"". In my experience with these conditions, the diagnosis is a formality and the treatment records in the aggregate make the case.

Too often I've seen people claiming severe depression and every record indicates alcohol use. This tends to erode their credibility because alcohol counteracts anti-depressants. Or the patient will go through alternating periods of consistent and inconsistent treatment. It's understandable that you wouldn't adhere as strictly to a treatment regime when things start to turn around, but mental health issues tend to have an ebb and flow and so if you stop treatment when things are good, they tend to get worse later on. Or, as I suspect to be the case with you, they hardly have any treatment history. Millions of people are diagnosed with depression/anxiety. The vast vast majority of them get treated and are able to engage in substantially gainful activity. If you want to prevail on a claim of depression/anxiety, you need to show that you have put in the time to get appropriate treatment and that you've put forth a good faith effort to comply with the treatment and that, despite your best efforts, you haven't seen any improvement. A ""few months"" of treatment records is nothing even if your symptoms were to go back two decades.

There's nothing wrong with filing now. You probably won't prevail on the initial or reconsideration reviews because of a lack of treatment records. Appeal up to the hearing level and use the time between now and your hearing to pursue treatment. It'll probably be 2 years before you get in front of a judge so you should have plenty of time to show how serious you are about doing everything you can to treat your conditions. Two years of treatment isn't that much, but it might be enough. Might be smart to get treatment for at least a year before filing. No way to know what's best.

Also, keep in mind that the standard is whether or not you can perform a job. You're ability to get a job doesn't matter. A subtle, and perhaps unfair, distinction, but something you need to keep in mind.

Also, you'd probably do yourself a huge favor to check out a vocational rehabilitation service. Just do an online search for ""\[your state\] vocational rehabilitation"". I've never been involved with a case where someone had done this, but I would expect it to go a long way towards showing that you've tried to find suitable work and that an expert has failed to find any suitable employment for you. I can think of no better evidence for a disability hearing than a report from a vocational expert saying that she performed an evaluation and determined that you were not suitable for any position.

Plus, if you do all this, it might work. You might get better and then you can support yourself. Again, nothing to lose.",,,6,0,0,

Most veterans programs have surpluses every year of money that doesn't get spent, because money is almost endless between VA and non-profits. VA benefits give out wheelchairs like bandaids ( I've had veterans tell me they can keep getting chairs, while occasionally someone has trouble getting one; inverse of the world everyone else lives in) and cover many devices not covered by programs like Medicaid. Veterans programs have accessible vehicles that sit around unused for segregated service. Meanwhile housing programs for everyone else have like 5 year waiting lists. Veterans hiring programs are a part of every corporation and government. Disability hiring for everyone else is a lower tier if it's considered at all. Veterans disability benefits aren't below poverty level. It's not just shooting victims. It's a national crisis and the government only wants to assist veterans because everyone else with a disability is seen as an undeserving leech. That's the real story, but they don't give a damn with their gun fetish and comfortable limousine liberal narratives. Do some research before saying it's just like the experience of veterans.

&amp;#x200B;

I dislike the use of any and all mental health slurs (crazy, insane, nutcase, lunatic, schizo, mental case, etc etc). I reserve a particular dislike for the use of the word ""disorder"" , and have utter disdain for clinicians who feel the need to use this sort of language with clients, especially when speaking to them about their experience of mental distress.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tolerate the words, ""mental health"" and ""mental illness"" but I know a lot of people who disregard these terms entirely because they resent the medical metaphor. Personally, I can live with it, but I think we need to educate people that it is a metaphor and not an objective fact.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure for the sake of consistency, I should guard my well-established tendencies to use other ablist slurs, although I find myself strangely ill equipped to meter out insults now that I stop myself from saying things like ""moron"" or ""retard"". Im working on it, and I guess making progress. I probably lack creativity :)

&amp;#x200B;

I was having an argument the other day on reddit about the use of the phrase, ""physically deformed"". Seemed to me this was a very insulting term, and contained a bunch of judgements about the rightness or otherwise of other peoples bodies (who's to judge, anyways). Problem was, the term was being quoted from a person who had used it to describe themselves. (I was in discussion with a third party who had quoted them). Sort of left me with nowhere to go.

As for the CoL, they won't give you shit if someone else will help support you. You have to have no support (including your parents or anyone else letting you live with them  or feeding you without a written agreement to pay them back past due rent and expenses of at least $350/month upon approval) because it's 100% need based not work credit based or anything else.

The SSA itself will deny you and tell you to move if there is a job anywhere in the US you can possibly do, and they expect you to do so to survive off SSI if necessary as well (yes it sucks, but that's reality for us) 

If moving isn't an option, most states where rent is $1500 give additional state disability funds to SSI recipients because of the high CoL, but I don't know the specifics on that.

SSI absolutely,  positively DOES NOT require work. Anywhere. In fact, while you can work a low wage, ultralow hours part time job once approved, you CANNOT get approved if you are working or they believe you to be capable of working. 

NO state has ANY say in who can or cannot get SSI. They can give you more money, if they want to, once you are pn SSI, but that's it. They cannot exclude anyone, because the play absoutely no part in determining eligibility requirements, and have zero say in this FEDERALLY RUN, NATIONWIDE program where ALL US CITIZENS have EXACTLY THE SAME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. 

As for protective services,  yeah, they are useless. If it's bad enough you had bones broken, I strongly recommend you just leave, homeless or not. I left at 18 years and 5 days with $30. Go to a church, a shelter, a DV advocacy group, or just apply for SSI and be grateful you're living in a state where most places the temperatures rarely get fatally cold while you wait for a decision. I know Phoenix has youth shelters if you're under 21, and that most places south of Tucson you can *easily* get by on $750/month. As shitty as it is, sometimes you just need to do what you need to do if you're in an abusive situation rather than waiting for rescue. If you're over 18, then it's (again, unfortunately) ultimately up to you to get out if it's that bad. I know exactly how awful and scary that sounds, but there comes a point where you must do what's necessary to keep yourself safe.

SSI is not SSDI. SSDI is ""disability."" SSI is for people who are disabled but do  not have the work credits for SSDI.  SSI pays less and has stricter rules, but getting in can also help you get into state-based programs like Medicaid and SNAP and Section 8 or subsidized housing.

You can apply for SSI online (ssa.gov) or go to the local Social Security office and ask for help.

Before you apply, gather together lists of every doctor who has treated issues related to your disability, their names and contact information, any hospitals you have been in, any testing that's been done and where, etc.  The  more info you can put into your application the better.

We have four levels from wheelchair bound (level 4) to most able (level 1). With Parkinson's our nerves and muscles work, but we forget how to walk. Hence shuffling, but I've gone from shuffle to full stride walk. Not easy and frustrating at times, but recently learned how to run (I would walk 100', run 100', walk 100' until I got the rhythm of moving my legs).

RAMPS:  For just pushing an hand propelled wheel chair into the van, about 12"" of length for every 1"" of rise.   So if there is a 6"" rise, you need a 6' ramp.   Motorized wheel chair would be longer, 18"" of length for every 1"" or rise, so that 6"" rise is a 9' ramp.   You can soon see why a lift makes more sense for space.

I seat on the passenger side and it's a side entry van.  I've had many vans in the past.  Full side Ford with a Ricon lift, to a Dodge Caravan from Braun conversion.   They have been all size entry vans because I like to park my chair next to the driver.  I don't like seating in the back because there is no way for my staff to help me while we are driving.  For example, giving me a drink.  My staffs says a rear entry vans are awful because there is no way to help me while we are on the road and it's just strange to be in the back.  If you are considering a minivan, side entry is the best way to go because there are so much space compare to rear entry.  With a side entry, you have a back seats where other passengers can use unlike a rear entry.  There is no room in a rear entry van.  Plus, for a wheelchair user, you are parking your chair over the hump on the drive train.   It's pretty awful.",,,2,0,0,

I'm sure other posters will tell you this as well. My qualification is a B.A. in Psychology, with plenty of education in developmental psychology. I also work/worked in the field of developmental disabilities.

One of the reasons that we've moved away from the ""mental age"" concept is because an adult with learning and developmental disabilities still has more life experiences and learning than your average three year-old.

We do still use education levels as some kind of benchmark, but, again, it suffers from similar problems to mental age. There are many forms of intelligence, and someone can function quite well in one area while not doing so well in others. And, no, I'm not referring to savants. Savants are rare, but people that have learning/developmental disabilities who have skills that function at the average or just below average level aren't rare.

I wouldn't worry about the IQ test much. It can help if you need extra resources and supports to remain independent, but it's not going, or shouldn't be a barrier of access for most things. If you do run into those walls, you can often bring up discrimination. So long as whatever you're looking to do isn't something that requires ***unreasonable*** amounts of accommodations to do, you let them know what you need and the ball is in their court.",,,16,0,0,

Unlike most tests, IQ tests are heavily weighted on how many you get right. Not on how many you get wrong, nor on how many you provide answers for. They compensate for slow readers, and slow answerers. Anxiety will not produce wrong answers. Anxiety will result in less answer production.

3381bfde-9ef1-45fa-a335-62d9be6203bf,1543977568,"IQ tests aren't reliable. I'll give you an example: my mom teaches special education, and has had students who scored weirdly low on a couple areas of the test, bringing down their overall score. At first she thought maybe they did just struggle to comprehend information, but then she spoke to speech pathologist. The areas of low scoring indicated that the students had a language processing issue, meaning they would hear things in their native language and then their brain just jumbled it, almost like aural dyslexia. After intensive speech therapy, a few students were retested. They jumped up 30 points to ""normal"" IQ range. Their speech processing issue had so drastically affected their comprehension in a timed, oddly structured environment that their score came out totally different. Having worked with a kid with an issue like this, I can tell you he was 100% capable of doing the same things as everyone else, but it took him longer to catch on. That's it. He just needed more time and practice.

Second, IQ tests are timed and based on the idea that processing information quickly shows someone's ability to learn, which... Isn't really true or accurate. Some people just process things slower or need more practice. We accept that in basically every other area of life, and praise hard work and dedication, then turn around and pretend speed and a sort of natural ability is magically better when it comes to ""intelligence."" But it's not. You see all the time the hard working student out classing the ""smart"" kid who doesn't put in the effort. So really all that score says, especially if you know you have a learning disability, is that you need more time to do things. There were kids in law school with me who had learning disabilities and therefore got extra time on tests. They graduated same as me. Some did better than me! 

Finally IQ tests are like, notoriously racist so you know, screw them anyway lol. Seriously people of color always score lower on them, they're a very flawed test. But they're easy to administer and give people a number, so they're used anyway, just like BMI is still used to indicate health even though there's tons of information about how inaccurate it is.",,,13,0,0,

For this reason i've always found myself in intraabled relationships because there does tend to be a burden on my partner to travel to me and hang out in my spaces because I can't always get out into the community. But i've recently been able to get back to 'work' (5 hours a week volunteering at a community house) and i've remembered how much that enabled me to be in a better position for my relationships. 

I know it's cliche, But finding ways to access community spaces and becoming more well rounded is an important foundation for forming a romantic relationship because many relationships fail when one person has little interests and hobbies to bring to the partnership.

Given Chapman is into rap music, maybe something like slam poetry could be a good hobby, there might not be anything in your area but bookstores and community centres are usually open to suggestions, depending on how much energy you have to dedicate to new hobbies you could even start a facebook group for people with social barriers who want to listen to music together or even write their own rap lyrics to share, you can keep it very low cost by meeting online via sharing posts or faceyime/skype.

My current partner (been together 4 years, monogamish, so we constined to use dating apps) was on tinder for 4 months and I was the first person he matched with, so he will often joke that he was both unluky and lucky with tinder.

I like that there was no up-front judgement on tinder, You don't know who has said ""no"" and you don't really have that awkwardness when you send a cold message (Like on OKC) and they say ""thanks but no thanks"". I also liked that I could set the distance more accurately and that meant I could keep the dating pool within the area i can physically travel (I also can't drive, and by far this is one of the biggest barriers in my life, I imagine Wyoming is similar to Australia in how spread out and car-dependant the landscape is).

Is there still a way to receive disability when you get a third denial “after” the hearing level?

After having such crazy health problems, I’ve become so much more understanding of the reasons behind peoples persistent problems. It’s complete and utter bull. Unfortunately I have a lot of experience with Medicaid specifically but I do have several suggestions that will hopefully at least lead you towards some help.

First- ask your insurance about a patient care advocate- someone they can provide to get you the services you need and avoid all the headaches you are going through on your end. Hopefully they will find doctors and make appointments for you as well as provide other services that you should be receiving. 

If you find this person to also be unhelpful, consider hiring a private patient/health advocate- ask them how they think they can help you off the bat and what the fees will be. It may be something you can bill to your insurance.

Second- if needed, consider taking some FMLA time off from your job. It will likely be unpaid, however it could give you some time to focus on gathering your health team and getting things set so that you aren’t juggling so many things at once. During this time, even considering finding help with housework and meal prep could be hugely beneficial to the quality of your life.  Looking for services and working out a system is all it takes and once you get your team in place, it becomes so much less chaotic. It can really feel like an overwhelming mountain climb until then. 

You sound like the kind of person who isn’t willing to let your health problems defeat you. You’ve made an amazing life, so I think it’s all about finding people to do the legwork when it comes to your healthcare. Trust me, if you try to tackle it alone, it can quickly become a second full time job.

In case you don’t already, I would highly suggest making sure you have disability insurance through your work as a backup plan. Worst case scenario, it will be an income stream for the dreaded waiting period of government disability benefits.",,,6,0,0,
c89d8b55-ee70-4e80-81b2-f2bfc4ccb3b9,1544143352,"Before you get too panicked, you may actually have some wiggle room here. Medicaid (I think) is for people with disabilities as well as those with low income. Medicare is usually for older people or retired folks. You may qualify for Medicaid if you can get documentation that you have a disability. 

Other than that, I'd start looking for another PCP in your network, if at all possible. Surely somebody in a 20-mile radius will take your insurance and be decent. Don't feel locked into specialists that the doctor recommends either: do your own research to find someone in your network and ask for a referral to them specifically. 

If you need anything to ensure you can still work, try your local vocational rehabilitation office. You'll probably need a month or two to get evaluated and in their system, but they should be able to help some, especially for medical equipment. My office is in the process of getting me a wheelchair now, and they've helped me pay for school so I can get a job in my desired field.

It's likely that the University has already selected their health plan for 2019, but it's open enrollment right now (until December 15th) and discussing some of these pitfalls might help encourage them to get a more comprehensive plan and network for 2020.

Talking to a broker can help you find more options. They'll know more about local network coverage, coinsurance and copays, and how responsive customer service is for the different insurance provider in your area. They'll also be able to make sure that specific necessary items are covered. It would suck to sign up for an insurance plan that doesn't cover catheters or physical therapy.

An FSA or HSA may also help by giving you lower premiums and helping you save more money for later. My husband is in a power wheelchair and I'll be maxing out our HSA and limited purpose FSA next year because I have a pretty good idea of what our insurance will cover next year and what our expenses will be. I also know that we may be paying for some physical therapy sessions on our own since insuranse will cover a third of the number of sessions my husband needs (but I'm still hoping we'll qualify for a grant.)

Another option may be, unfortunately, for you to look for work at a different University.

Many in the chronic illness community with rare diseases are forced to pay out of pocket in order to get care. The few docs that specialize are swamped, have a small staff, and do not accept insurance which adds the financial burden of additional staff and forces them to accept reduced fees. We paid out of pocket almost $2k USD to see my specialist the first time, about $200 of that was travel expenses. That was on a $28k salary. Was it easy? No. Was it worth it? Yes. I am not a huge fan of insurance companies in the same way I do not like home warranties or extended vehicle warranties. They create an added burden for the providers in the form of excess paperwork and force them to work for reduced fees. Also, they limit the scope of services covered by their policy and the consumer often does not realize the limitations up front. Insurance companies are in business to make a profit, not to be our caretakers.

(The threshold is for this year and tends to go up over time.) Learn about [SSI work incentives](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-work-ussi.htm). They gradually phase out cash aid as you earn more but let you keep Medicaid until your income reaches the threshold (and there can be exceptions even then). You will have to stay within the $2000 resource limit, but if you became disabled before age 26, you can set up an [ABLE account](http://ablenrc.org/) to take care of that nicely. Money in such an account doesn't count toward resource limits until $400,000 for Medicaid. Otherwise, buy durable, useful stuff.

Don't deal with Medicaid directly. Talk to your SSI caseworker and make sure that your Medicaid is set up in such a way that it depends on your SSI eligibility, not just your income. Quite likely, it already is, but make sure.

At festivals, they abuse the disability accommodations, they have service vests on animals who clearly aren't trained service animals (jumping on passerby, pulling at the leash, eating from the ground, etc) and they give me funny looks with my mobility aids. It really breaks my heart when I see one minortity I'm a part of turning it's back on another.

In addition to this, I've noticed that I get a lot more attitude from service people when I'm asking for accommodation the ""gayer"" I look. I favor androgyny in my fashion; my hair is very short (I'm a cis woman) and I wear a lot of clothing from the men's department, and I don't wear make up. 

If I'm conforming to gender norms in my appearance (like if my mother is in town) then people are happy to help me. I'm a friendly person, I'm used to having a good time with the people I interact with. But the minute I'm ""visibly queer"" people are sneering down their nose at me, questioning my need for accommodation. 

Maybe people think you can't be queer and disabled, that we only get to pick one or something (I know which one I would pick if that were the case lol). I don't have advice, basically the cards are stacked against us. I'm sure disabled people of color face many of the same problems, we're just a double minority.

The biggest issue I see is actually not accessibility, employment, or relationships etc.

I see a HUGE part of Enabling. Parents are doing things for their kids instead of teaching them. Parents are allowing behaviors to continue because they do not want a fight. Teachers not following through with a behavior plan. Teachers who teach busywork instead of academics. Teachers who baby their students.

Let me give you some examples. ALL of these are people who were perfectly able to do the tasks at hand because WE taught or trained them.

1. Potty trained 2 1st graders 2. taught 2nd grader to put his own shoes on 3. taught 2nd grader how to put his jacket on 4. taught 3rd grader to use a fork and spoon on her own 5. taught a kid to push his own wheelchair -he was 6th grade 5. taught an 45yo adult to walk short distances 6. to drink out of a cup other than a sippy cup - he was in 3rd grade. 7.

3. A waitress asking someone else at the table what ""She wants""? The ""she"" is a woman in a wheelchair perfectly capable of answering herself.
4. A perfect stranger patting my very adult friend in a wheelchair on the head while he waits in line at the grocery store. Further GUSHES ""It's SO inspirational you can go out in public and shop on your own"" (It really happened).
5. Another stranger stares agape at same friend as above as he puts himself in his truck, uses his hydraulics to put his wheelchair in the back.... OKAY that part is pretty cool -  but then says YOU CAN DRIVE? BUT HOW?

a1079f7d-c9b0-4480-9c05-3cd73973f531,1544460555,"Accessibility is one thing that's already been talked about but it's a problem for me, too. Especially getting my own family to understand my difficulties. Summer boat rides? I can't do them. I have a bad leg and use a cane (I have access to a walker if I need it) so the boat launch is inaccessible, staying on a boat for hours is not something I can tolerate, and then getting up out the boat is not something I can guarantee I can do. I missed a trip my family just took to a reindeer farm. The walkways weren't paved, everything was rough and natural then toss snow on top of that. There was no seating I could see in online photos so I couldn't even sit and watch my niece interact with the animals. So instead of my family understanding that I'm explaining that I CAN'T go, they just think I'm lazy and antisocial. I need to cheer up and be happy. That won't make my leg work better!

Also when I check to see if a place I want to go actually is accessible, I usually can't find the information I'm looking for. Yes, they may have a tab about accessibility that says they have disabled bathrooms, disabled parking, and maybe a couple other things. But I don't know about terrain, distances between parking and seating, if there's room to navigate my walker, if there are elevators, how steep stairs are, if there are ramps. It's usually a very lacking area on websites. Most times I go to Google and try to piece together a complete image of a venue with user photos. Unfortunately I live pretty rural so often times there's not a lot to work with. It's really helpful when users post all kinds of pictures. I wish that happened more.

And this hasn't been touched on, but the government help in my state is a joke. I spent a little over two years in Vocational Rehab trying to get assistance in getting a job. My first counselor told me that the average stent was a year, one contract, but I was very hireable so she didn't expect me to wait that long. But she left, her parting gift was getting me two weeks as a temp for work experience for my resume after it having a five year gap. After all the hoops I jumped through to get into the program, the evaluations I did, the appointments, the paperwork, the waiting for their office to restructure... I got stuck with people who didn't really care about me. 

My job advocate stopped advocating for me pretty quickly. Her perceptions of the working world were horribly outdated (I needed a feminine font for my resume, I needed to wear my hair pulled back in a bun to look like a secretary, etc), and she didn't listen to my wants or needs. My counselor was inept, must have gotten the most minimal training possible, and she steered me in the wrong direction a few times with incorrect information.

It was the last straw for me with Vocational Rehab when they not once but twice sent me to interviews for jobs I could not perform with my disability. They were supposed to go in, find out about the job, tell them about me and the program, advocate, then the job would choose whether or not to interview. Both times the person interviewing me had no idea who I was or that I was disabled. The second one didn't even know about the program. I cannot express how embarrassing and dehumanizing it is to sit in an interview and explain how you're not able to perform duties for the job you're asking to get! I apologized profusely for wasting their time. Both people were very nice about the whole thing. Even encouraging. I couldn't work with those people anymore.

Then my counselor lied to me about closing my case and about a month after we parted ways, she called trying to keep me on. Even though she didn't really address any of my problems and didn't even apologize for the last horrible interview. She had no information for me about housing, my main concern, or mental health solutions. So I quit for good that time and actually got paperwork. It was just such a mess that wasted time and resources for nothing. I'm still incredibly angry about and frustrated by the whole ordeal. I would not work with Michigan Rehabilitation Services in this area again. Maybe not at all. I filled out a survey and asked to be contacted by a manager but nobody ever reached out. I guess they want to ignore the bad stuff!

Instead of job hunting now I'm working on obtaining housing. An apartment somewhere not so rural. That has yet to work out. Housing is another issue but I have a roof over my head so I can't complain too much. I'd rather be away from a situation/people who aren't good for me but I'll hang in there. The waiting lists for housing are just really long waits because it's a resource that's very needed but there aren't enough apartments to go around.

Thanks for what you're doing. ",,,2,0,0,

Everyone loves gossip. But secretly everyone hates a gossip. Because the person giving you the latest scoop, is gonna badmouth you to someone else. 

Thank god for each day. Smile. Forget the haters. Ignore them and focus on what you can do, and ignore what you have no control over. I have SSI (Disability), Food Stamps, Medicaid, and am on waiting lists for Section 8. My family hates that I have psychological disabilities. They think I'm dangerous for having PTSD, or weak for having anxiety, or looking for attention with depression. My friends give me shit for getting aid from the Government. Same people who bitch about being rejected by FAFSA when their family makes 100K but can't bother to spend 2K on comm college. 

Anyone who matters will support you. Anyone who doesn't wont. You have a strong network on this sub, and I am telling you I support you. Don't tell people you're on disability unless it's relevant. That's what I do. I keep to myself, focus on my schooling and do occasional gigs off craigslist that I can do from home (for instance atm, I'm doing note-taking. So anyone who sends me an audio/video of a class lecture, I type notes and send and get paid) it's nice work, but irregular.  Sometimes I get 4-5 jobs a week, November I didn't get a job all month. 

Moms are huge gossips, Mine is too. But at the end I stopped sharing because I don't trust them. I'm focusing on moving out so I can be free of this drama. I've cut anyone who judges me for being on SSI. I still go to college, work, and try my best. The Government doesn't pamper us, it provides us with the necessities others take for granted, and have easier access to.

You HAVE to have medical records to back up your claims of disabilities. They have to be recorded by medical drs or psychiatrists. 

Then you can apply online, send them your records, get denied (everyone gets denied 1-3 times), file an appeal, and wait. 

After you've gotten your first denial is when most people find a lawyer to help with appeals and paperwork. If you get to the hearing stage you will definitely need a lawyer.

I think you have a stronger position than they’re letting on. If your sharing your uncertainties with them as you are us, then they’re taking advantage of your uncertainty to try to make themselves more money. It’s infuriating to hear them guilt you into thinking there are “greater good” arguments here. No, there really aren’t. And the cost differences are marginal too.

These middle guys are not the right venue for uncertainty. All those internal debates about how much your husband should help? Those should be debated away from the insurance vultures. This is not a game of figuring out with those people what you need. This is a matter of figuring out ahead of time, maybe with your primary doctor, what you need, utilizing the techs to fill in the details of precisely that and then knowing your rights with your insurance company. Knowing your policy helps you and your doctor write the prescription with the right buzzwords to trigger mandatory responses.

Taking a guess here based on my previous experience: it sounds like the weak link here is actually in the vagueness of what prescription for equipment your doctor wrote? There are 3 stages of people here. 1. Doctor. Writes a prescription for DME. 2. Prescription goes to DME techs, who fill in the details and work with your insurance. 3. Finally, there’s the insurance company and what they cover. 

The script your doctor writes in step 1 determines the scope of subsequent steps. If your doctor just writes something vague like “wheelchair”, then that can be interpreted down the line. But if your doctor writes “lightweight wheelchair with manual assist” then THAT is the scope of what the techs are looking at. Doctor’s often are amenable but need to be clearly guided. Any chance you can go back to step 1 and get a clearer equipment prescription?",,,8,0,0,

Wheelchairs and wheelchair accessories are qualified medical expenses according to the IRS which allows you to use a tax advantaged account to purchase them. And, since your insurance doesn't cover DME, you could use an LP FSA to pay for it.

I met someone with a power assist device on his manual wheelchair. It was Bluetooth enabled so he could control it with his smart watch and I think it cost him about $6,000. 

If you can pay for the wheelchair workout going through insurance, the manufacturer may have a discount for cash customers. My husband was able to pay $500 for an MRI instead of $1200 by paying upfront instead of going through insurance.

Also, the reason why the word ""handicap"" is not as big of a problem in your country is that possibly, your country does not have much of a disability activism scene yet or that the word itself or disability has very few if any negative connotations.

So in this game no borders, because the disability peoples has own avatars with special controls and special user interface. They can fight against the healthy people without problem.

Most of the player is healthy (I hope we will reach lot of players) and they are can be disability in game, if they hurts.

My daughter applied for Medicaid when she was close to two months pregnant with our local social services.  At 5 months, she had still not received her cards and her doctor was threatening to stop seeing her.  I told her to call and ask for a Medicaid supervisor, which she did, and the girl was really nice but said it had to do with their “partner insurance” which my daughter called for months and they kept blowing smoke up her ass. She was having a difficult pregnancy and had developed preeclampsia. At 7 months I called the director of social services at a suggestion from my boss. She said that he did not want to hear that his employees weren’t doing their jobs and that he would get it fixed. She’d had to call before. So I called him and left a message.  He called her back in 20 minutes and told her he would take care of the problem. Later that day the supervisor called and said that they had found the problem and that her application had somehow not been submitted. They sent a letter to give to her doctor explaining the situation and she had her cards in 2 weeks.

There can be a tendency to assume there's a ""normal"" nondisabled child locked inside a disabled child and that belief can be a problem. It prevents people from loving and accepting the person as they are.

There's also a belief some people have that everyone a skill that they're naturally above-average in. That's not really true. Everyone has *personal* strengths - skills that are better than expected *for that person*, but not necessarily *general* strengths - skills that are better than most other people. (Unless you count very personalized skills, like ""John is best in the world at making his mother smile."")  So can people with ID play to their strengths? Absolutely, but realize that for most people with moderate ID, their personal strengths are not above average.

That doesn't mean people with moderate ID can't gain and apply useful skills. Most people with moderate ID learn self-care skills, some applied skills, and some leisure skills. Many work successfully, usually in jobs where they do the same thing over and over again. Most live with some helpers, but a few live semi-independently. Some have romantic or sexual relationships. Some parent children.

There are people who were misdiagnosed in the first place. For example, if the child has a severe speech language problem, and the clinician didn't account for that when diagnosing, they might not have ID at all. There are definitely records of children with autism who scored in the ID range on IQ tests before starting treatment. They weren't talking at the time. After some intensive treatment, they were able to use language and follow directions. When the IQ test was repeated, it was much higher. Did the child's IQ rise, or was the first test invalid? Most scientists believe the latter.

You might also be talking about savants. Savants are people who have a developmental disability but have some abilities that are average or above-average. About 10 - 20% of people who have ID are savants; most of whom have ID + autism. You see savants on TV who have extraordinary abilities - concert pianists or incredible artists - and that does happen, but most savants are just a bit better than you would expect, like someone who has an IQ of 50, but can draw Disney characters pretty darn well.

But if you're asking whether ID can be ""cured"" the answer is no. If you're asking whether education is beneficial to people with ID, the answer is a resounding yes.

Edit: I'd like to respond to your comment, ""it just goes to show most people are incapable with children."" I don't think that's true at all. All the available evidence says that there is a very big difference between *bad* parenting and adequate parenting, but only a small difference between adequate parenting and *great* parenting. The same goes for teaching and schools. You may be aware of a few anecdotes of people raising their children in extraordinary ways, but that doesn't mean that those people are necessarily extraordinary parents. For starters, their children share their genes, so an intelligent, ambitious parent will tend to have intelligent, ambitious kids. Those same kids raised by other parents might have come out the same way. Second, you don't know what the negatives or downsides are. That's a problem with anecdotes. You don't have all the data. Third, you don't know what the long term outcomes are from anecdotes. Did those college ready teens complete college? Or did they drop out early? Fourth, even if everything was perfect in that story, what works for one family and one child doesn't work for another. Finally, if you judge good outcomes of parenting by ""unlocking"" the child's ""potential"", then you're going to miss a lot of excellent parenting in which the parent loves the child for who they really are, disability and all, and focuses on modest goals instead of tilting at windmills.",,,11,0,0,

431fb2c7-cdf0-49a7-9616-62cdfab3f6a7,1544983248,"(By the way, ""moderate intellectual disability"" which I described in my original comment means an IQ from 40 - 55. It would be very, very unlikely for someone with moderate ID to make it to adulthood without getting formally diagnosed - assuming the person lives in the United States or other wealthy country. Nearly all adults with undiagnosed ID have mild ID, or an IQ from 55 - 70.  Or they may have what's called a borderline IQ, from 70 - 85, which isn't ID but is low enough to make some things difficult.)

There's a lot of research about non-academic parenting outcomes, including self-care, coping skills, behavior problems, health, friendships, emotional skills, social skills, happiness, relationships, and so on. There are thousands of research studies conducted on all different aspects of parenting, so it's not all grades-and-income.

I can't speak to your wife's issues or her general level of intelligence. I can tell you that, on average, people with lower IQs have more problems with social and emotional functioning, not less. But if you're concerned about a specific person, the averages matter a lot less. Your wife may well be very much above average in her level of social perceptiveness. She may have a lower IQ, she may not.   There are lots of different things that could cause the problems you're describing and no one can do a valid assessment second hand over the internet.

IQ is a really good predictor of lots of things on the group level, but less so on an individual level. What I mean is that if I were buying a gift for a man I'd never met, I'd buy a shirt for the ""average"" male size. But if I knew the guy, I'd buy the shirt in his size, average be damned. It's the same thing with IQ. If I know that a stranger has a very low IQ, I'd guess that on average they will have more difficulties with social and emotional skills. But if I actually know the person, I'd put the average aside and just think about the person right in front of me.",,,3,0,0,

Michigan does it county by county, and there's a good deal of variation between counties on help available and services offered. There's been a lot of talk lately about stopping medicaid and cutting foodstamps for people who are not on SSI or employed. In my county unless you have kids, you will not get enough foodstamps. You'll get more if on SSI than if working for the same or less money, but still not enough. Most childless people I know making &lt;$500/month from employment receive less than $50/month in foodstamps, much less than the $160 my husband and I get with our sole income my $736/month SSI.

You didn't mention mental health, but just in case, fair warning: call your medicaid plan directly and see who and what is covered; stay away from the county mental health systems. They're under-educated and over worked, unable to devote adequate time or personnel to screening and so are prone to misdiagnosis and mismedication. Medicaid plans have to cover mental health now, so use them to go to an appropriate professional and skip the ""therapists"" still in school for social work and the overworked, underinformed psychiatrist expected to treat anything vaguely related to mental health, from brain injury, to developmental disorders, even substance abuse etc. because someone didn't grasp that there are different kinds of specialists for different problems and thought a psychiatrist was the go-to for ""mental health""

From my perspective it's entirely possible to be both disabled AND lazy. I've mastered that art.

there are three ways to deal with your particular situation.

1) work on your mental health and you will naturally start to take better care of yourself and your home as you get better.

2) will yourself to take care of your hygiene even though you are not well. this isn't going to be easy so just start small. maybe just focus on brushing your teeth every day. when you get that down you can branch out into taking care of other things. just make sure you are pushing yourself slightly out of your comfort zone. you will find that this will actually start to help you improve your mental health.

It means that you could execute through exerting will, but choose to conserve your energy. If any disability is a factor, then its not laziness. Of course everyone needs to push themselves to do as much as possible, but being compassionate with yourself and not beating yourself up is also critical.

A physically abled person has more spoonfuls of energy to use during the day, while a physically disabled person has less before they have to nap. Although people with mental illnesses (like myself) have as many spoons as physically abled people, and this spoon theory doesn't technically apply, using them can exacerbate our symptoms because it creates stress - even something as simple as brushing our teeth!

3381bfde-9ef1-45fa-a335-62d9be6203bf,1545191497,"Laziness is when you are perfectly capable of doing something and just don't. Mental illness is when doing the thing feels like an insurmountable task. Like, sometimes I just decide be lazy and play video games. I feel totally capable of doing something productive (and often end up doing it anyway) but I'm putting it off because I'd rather do something fun or relax. Laziness usually is pretty short term too, and self-interested like avoiding chores to watch TV, not so much avoiding bathing because that's got consequences for the lazy person (can't be lazy with friends if you stink). I feel okay if I'm being lazy as long as I do the thing I need to do at some point.

When I'm depressed, the idea of having to stand in the shower is just...too much. It sounds painful. It is painful. Moving is hard. I may cry before actually getting out of bed because it's just all too much. Everything feels like too much. I get exhausted from doing basic things. I feel guilty and pathetic. I feel like I'll never get anything done. I hate myself for being that way. It's just a different feeling, and that becomes obvious when a psychiatrist listens to you.

Life pro tip on hygiene: baby wipes. Keep them behind the toilet. Use them on your underarms and crotch/butt (and any skin folds or high sweat areas, like underboob or stomach roll if either apply to you) every morning, or morning and evening, when you can't bring yourself to bathe. Takes like 60 seconds. Keep shampoo by the sink and wash your scalp at least in the sink. Very fast. Keep floss picks near your bed. Floss when you hate yourself and can't get up. Keep a lil trashcan right by the bed for the floss picks. Have at least 14 pairs of underwear. Same with socks. That way you can change every day for 2 weeks even if you don't do laundry. And those things get stinky easiest. Wear different PJs every night so you don't get funky from just wearing pjs that are funky. Have multiple sheet sets for the same reason. Change the sheets every 2-3 weeks if you can. I frequently can get myself to do like, 1 thing that's productive when I'm very bad (haven't been that bad in a long time, hurray therapy and medication) like just change the sheets, just do a load of laundry (not put it away but hey the stuff in the dryer is clean). So I will do one thing. Having lots of sheets, towels, and clothes (well a decent amount at least) allows me to get away with the""one thing"" method for a while until I get better.

Welcome to severe depression hygiene 101. I've prefected my methods over the past 14 years of bipolar 2 lol.

For the record even when I'm well, I'm just kinda messy. The difference is 1 week if dishes in the sink versus 2 months worth and also possibly some new life forms. So you may never be Martha Stewart, but you should be in the ""acceptable"" range of messiness, and able to get things cleaned up pretty easily for company.",,,8,0,0,

Charismatic/Pentecostal Christians believe that the Holy Spirit heals today. Some believe that they are not trusting Gods power if they aren’t essentially manifesting healing when they think someone is in need of it using (insert magic words in fashion of the time: precious shed blood of Jesus, Holy Spirit cast our the devil’s power, yada yada). Encounters with these Christians have been the most awkward because they are usually in public and they tend to pray out loud in tongues. I find they are usually in earnest but pretty naive. 

The other is far more sinister. Those who are into the health &amp; wealth gospels of Joel Osteen and his like believe in a gospel infected by the idea that god blesses those he loves with wealth and health. If you have challenges, you must not be a good enough Christian. You must have sin in your life. Even mainstream evangelicalism has bits of this theology baked in. Many can’t understand how I could be satisfied to not be “healed.” Some are challenged that I could be born with a disease and be disabled but also believe and be happy.

1. There is biblical/theological basis for people wanting to ""lay on hands"" and pray for those who are ill/disabled etc. That said, it's not as though most folks think prayer is more effective this way, it's just part of the religious tradition.

2. Most Christians understand that this kind of ass-holery is inappropriate. Those that don't, need to understand that consent and acceptance are a higher priority (socially and theologically) than their desire to pray for you.

ba121482-bba5-46e8-9d27-3cf267a58af8,1545403526,"I wish there was an easy way to let providers know how they can help. 

The important part (to SSA) is how it's noted in the record; that's all they see. I know often docs say patient is ""stable"" even though their stable baseline is *really effed up* but ""stable"" sounds like they're not having issues.

Most doctors in my area will say that they don't help with disability claims. If they write that in the note, it could seem like they're not supportive. Doctors hear ""disability"" and they think about Worker's Comp Functional Capacity Evaluations which are only done by some doctors and paid for by the insurance carrier, or they think of Independent Medical Evaluations done in the course of a personal injury claim, or they think of all the forms that LTD carriers have them complete. Sometimes doctors even say in their notes, ""wants me to help with disability but told them I am not the one who makes the decision."" None of this is what SSA needs from them, and it isn't what you mean by ""helping"" with your claim, but providers don't know that, and patients think ""my doctor needs to say I'm disabled.""

The only way they can help is to document your signs and symptoms and give opinions about your _functioning_ (not your ability to work). Filling out a form or writing a letter about your functioning is helpful.

When it comes to assisting patients with disability claims, doctors are often concerned about liability. However, the Social Security Act states that providers who submit information to SSA on behalf of an applicant cannot be held criminally or civilly liable as long as the information was provided in good faith. (See Sec. 1157 [42 U.S.C. 1320c-6] of the Social Security Act.)

As far as your doctor disagreeing, unless they're really angry about it, they aren't going to make a big deal in the notes, as their notes aren't their personal journal.   They may make an unsupportive comment, but they likely aren't going to take any actions to tank your claim. And, if you think they aren't providing the care you need, find someone else. But I know it isn't that simple, and if they think you're exaggerating or malingering, stomping out because they won't help with your disability claim is not helpful. 

Also, as other commenter said, get objective testing for the FM. See specialists (neurologist and/or rheumatologist). I assume you've had sleep study and have a CPAP, are you using it regularly? Still having issues? Tell the doctor. A PNCV/EMG nerve conduction study will show how bad the neuropathy is. A neuropsychological evaluation tests memory and concentration and other cognitive functioning. Did you have medical evaluations for state disability or Medicaid? If so, get those reports to SSA. 

I do think that applicants get into a mindset of ""how do I explain to SSA..."" Which, over time, naturally, becomes, ""how do I convince everyone that I'm disabled,"" which can be really overwhelming and self-defeating. It's important to remember that disability benefits don't have to be permanent. SSA has a ""trial work period"" where you can keep your benefits while trying to return to work. There are a lot of people recently-diagnosed (young) who are able to work, and SSA sees that every day. I know there's no cure for FM, but chronic doesn't mean terminal. Apply at the state agency that does Vocational Rehabilitation. If you do some kind of work, keep a log of your absences and how they may accommodate you (extra breaks, different schedule, etc). Get all those records to SSA. 

Your initial question was, ""how do I get SSA to listen to me,"" and the answer is: through your doctors. So, now you know what SSA needs to know about you, talk to the doctors about those things. The things you described in your post, about having trouble concentrating, how your sleep affects you, etc. You need your doctor's opinion for the claim, but also to treat you. Ask your doctor, ""Can we do anything about my problems concentrating?"" If treatments don't help, or your condition doesn't get better, talk to them about how to deal with or get help with  your current baseline of [being tired all the time/can't focus/neuropathy hurts]. They'll note all of this in the records, and SSA will listen.

Or, like most approved claimants, you'll just have to convince judge at your hearing. Get a rep for that, contact NADR or NOSSCR (you can Google them) or your local Legal Aid office.

I'm a former regional medical contractor for psych and it can be helpful to think of it like going to court. Say you got a speeding ticket that you wanted to contest - it is simply not good enough to show up to court to tell the judge that you were not speeding. You need proof!

Similarly, when you apply for disability, the burden is on YOU to prove that you are disabled. It is not good enough to list your symptoms - your doctors have to list your symptoms and the effects they have on you as well. When you don't say anything to your doctors, you end up sabotaging your own application. Tell all your doctors everything and also let them know you are applying for disability.

Also, if you are ultimately approved for SSDI, back benefits are retroactive from the date of application, which is a godsend if you've incurred any debt, even if it can take years to come true. 

If there is a shortage of FM specialists in your plan, see if Medicaid will cover a visit to a university medical center's neurology dept just for a consult.

ba121482-bba5-46e8-9d27-3cf267a58af8,1545362545,"SSA doesn't care if you can find a job, get hired, get to work, etc, only if you can do the functional demands of _any_  unskilled job that exists in ""significant numbers"" in the national economy. This includes ""less than light duty,"" or sedentary work. 

When you have subjective complaints (symptoms) like pain, fatigue, and other things that can't be measured, it becomes a consistency and credibility issue. 

SSA does not care if your doctor says you're ""disabled,"" as SSA has their own definition of disability, but they do consider all medical opinions. For decision makers to ""listen to your symptoms,"" they need to be documented and supported by the entire record. 

In the medical record, your doctor will note your complaints and will also note any objective signs they find. So if you're not complaining about fatigue (maybe you're always fatigued and doc knows it so you guys don't discuss it), it won't be in the note. You may report swelling, but when the doctor notes your objective signs, if you aren't swollen then, your notes will likely say 'no swelling' and 'normal gait,' and this is where most people with subjective complaints lose. The doctor makes records for himself and other medical professionals, and isn't thinking about (or knowledgeable about) SSA. 

You have to show you can't perform the physical or mental demands of unskilled sedentary work. Think about the functions of work activity- sitting, standing, walking, lifting/carrying weight, postures like stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, bending, reaching... mental demands like concentration, maintaining a schedule, following instructions, interacting with others, and other work-related functions like: do you need to take many breaks, lay down during the day, elevate your feet during the day, would you have excessive absences, etc. If your doc would write about the _functional_ limitations you have, saying they're consistent with your diagnosis and symptoms, that would be helpful. 

I'm on my phone so I can't see your original post and I really got detailed there... Hope I covered enough to help. Something like 65% of initial applications are denied and even more appeals are denied. The 2nd appeal is a hearing, where more are approved. Get a Representative if you go to a hearing. Complain to your congressman about the wait for a hearing, and if you get a utility shut off notice (that you can't pay) or imminent eviction (that you can't remedy), ask the hearings office to expedite your claim.

I might get hate for this but news stories about kids with terminal illnesses still trying their hardest to live normal lives - stories that do keep the spirit of fighting for normalcy despite the circumstances, which are at the center of all these posts - have devolved now that literally anyone can post them to a wide audience via sites like Reddit and social media. Combine that with all the “share this post and (celebrity) will donate $1 for each share!” fake posts on Facebook, and bloggers/vloggers that cross the line and extort their/their children’s experiences for monetary gain, and we have what you’ve seen today.

People also feel guilty for *not* upvoting/liking/sharing since “it just takes a second” and “there’s nothing to lose” and “what a nice story,” and the cycle continues from there. This also goes into the lack of ability for a large portion of our population to either do basic research into a story before believing it wholeheartedly, or to understand the importance of doing so.

Part of this is because a lot of societies normalize men (even able-bodied ones) seeking out surrogates/prostitutes/sex workers or whatever terminology you wanna use. Society supports men sexually..insurance will often cover Viagra but not birth control (just one example). Dating disabled is different depending on gender too. If a woman is disabled people just assume she doesn't want to have a family, date, and they'll judge her to the contrary. This isn't the case for men really. 

A lot of the discussion around this issue is circular if you're for it you enable human trafficking and if you're against it you're not sex positive. 

For me, I am disabled and I don't think any loopholes should exist legally just because a person has a disability. Either sex surrogacy must be legal/illegal for everyone, regardless of whether they are disabled. Allowing such a loophole is a slippery slope I think. People debate about what a disability is or is not and what conditions/illnesses/disorders should be considered a disability. In the USA, from the standpoint of law, the act itself isn't illegal but the agreement or contract is. Therefore, just discussing terms and getting a mutual agreement of those terms (even unfulfilled) is illegal and that's grounds for charges right there. 

Even if it was legalized for people with disabilities somehow, society is unable to comprehend or cope with the fact that people with disabilities also experience sexual desires. We've come a long way but by and large, the disability community has to fight to be acknowledged on a daily basis. There are still battles concerning the our very existence and I just don't see society changing in respect to the issue you've brought up. ",,,2,0,0,

Generally, if you're using the cane for a specific leg and not just for ballance, it's best to use your cane on the opposite side to  the leg you are using it for. I use my cane with my right arm, as my left leg is where I have the hip pain. Though, it really comes down to the comfort of the user (I actually started using my cane when my right hip was my painful hip, but I was still using my cane with the right arm since I didn't have the strength to put the weight I needed to on my left arm)

If you have any friends with spare canes or anything, you may talk to them to see if you could borrow a cane for a bit to see how it works for you. If not, if you have about $20-30 you could spare to try out a cane, you can generally get a decent quality cane at pharmacies or online for about that price.

Do either of your siblings have your father as their representative payee? If yes, then that might be something that would need to be changed. 

Are they receiving Social Security Disability or Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? They might be receiving a combination of both. The rules are very different for each program. For Social Security Disability, the income of the household doesn’t affect payment. For SSI, the household income generally does affect payment as long as the beneficiary is contributing to the household expenses. 

It is also important to figure out if they have Medicare, Medicaid, or both. The Social Security Office can tell you about whether they have Medicare. Your State’s Medicaid agency would be the point of contact about what things in the household affect Medicaid eligibility.

I have been actively seeking help for my issues for 5 years now. Medications are ineffective. Therapy is ineffective. My therapist actually just recommended I don't bother coming anymore because they've tried everything I know (6 different therapists) and nothing works. My psychiatrist doesn't know what else to recommend because I've tried all the medications he's aware of. I've tried going in for ECT treatments, but my alter ego (anxiety) keeps canceling on me. I've tried diets. I've tried exercise. I've tried getting genetic diagnostics to explain why no medications work. NOTHING has helped.

If all this is actually true, and you have it documented then I don't believe you will be kicked off and should have nothing to worry about.  But your story seems very suspicious to me, as exercise helps for literally every single mental illness, and if someone had as severe mental issues as you, any competent therapist wouldn't tell them to stop coming in for treatment period (especially if you are on disability).  Not getting ECT by blaming your anxiety sounds like another excuse to me to not get better. 

Also seeing 6 different therapists sounds like a lot, but I saw over 25 doctors over a 10 year period before I finally got my autoimmune diagnosis and treatment.

My brother has ASD and he prefers ""differently abled"" because he is able, he just does it differently. I have a connective tissue disorder and I prefer ""episodic disability"" because when I can't do something, I seriously can't do it, my ability is completely dysfunctional. I need a major adjustment or accommodation.

My dad, who also has ASD but didn't get any help growing up and now struggles quite a lot calls himself ""handicapped"" because he feels he has a slight, but not complete limitation. Personally I find the word ""handicapped"" antiquated, in Australia we rarely use it and it's jarring when I do hear it, but as long as people aren't using it as a slur I understand why it can still have its place. Heck, sometimes I will call myself ""crippled"" because my legs are strapped up in braces and I'm in so much pain I feel like my body has been crumpled into its disability - but that's a personal label and I wouldn't want others to apply it to me without my lead, and I'd never apply it to someone else without their explicit permission.

It is an issue that in the fields of care, which all too prominently intersect with disability, the workforce and authority wielders are female. This creates a simple issue of stacked odds against you. Research with men's Sheds and other male-focused groups finds that the same issues si9mplpy don't arise with men.

Absolutely. It is part of Human Nature that ""The Disabled One"" is seen as having less value to others and groups such as Society in general. Males are also valued less than Women and Children.

The Human Rights and Equality bill of goods that has been sold in The Developed World for the last 100 years has not only emphasized hierarchy with the Disabled and Elderly at the bottom, but it has also empowered so many to claim they don't discriminate whilst they do it to your face. 

We unfortunately presently live in a Biazzrely created pseudo equality bubble where inequality, bias and discrimination can't be seen because of the ""Lunacy of Intersectionality"". If you are a white disabled male you are labeled as privileged because you are male and white, so discrimination against you is not about Disability it's justified retribution because you are male and white. I'm sick of this psuedo Marxist political shenanigins. 

After over 25 years of fighting Disability Discrimination in Europe and Globally, the intersectional schtick is making and has made Disabled Males and underclass that is ignored. 

So many are shocked at how [The Men's Shed Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_shed) has exploded in Australia, Australia, Ireland and The UK. I just see it as a necessary backlash and readjustment to the Equality Lunacy of the 70s, 80s, 90s and N""OO""rties. Some seem shocked at the idea that 30% of shed members are disabled males. Due to the slashing of support in the UK since 2008, disabled men have had zero support or resources, but cuts to women's services have been nowhere near as Draconian. The Men's Shed Organisation is most often the only venue where males are welcome at all, hence disabled men will use it.  

Examples of the entrenched discrimination that shall not be named or allowed to speak can be seen in the recent issues from California and Wildfires. Disproportionately, the disabled were the ones to die as Local Government had illegally failed to bother with Evacuation plans that meet Disabled People's needs. US law requires such plans to be in place, updated and maintained.... but who cares if it's just a few less cripples where federal mandate has been ignored. 

When Disaster hits that last group to be relocated and resettled are the disabled as they are seen to be more costly and long-term more difficult to justify the costs of. So many will scream that with Global Warming women are the most affected. They love screaming this to promote a Hierarchy of victimhood. Those who are fact-based rather than emotional abuse based know that the groups that will be thrown under the bus first are the Elderly and the Disabled. When disaster hits is the least mobile who survive let alone get help, and It's Women and Childen First, as it has been all the way through Human Evolution.

Ive called like 3 times already and they say they have all the information and it's still being processed.  She is able to absorb this for now but not long term.  If you live close to your food stamp/mediaid office and can get there in person to speak with the manager or someone who gets things done it could help.  (We shall see in January)

Also your state has attorneys who specialize in this and typically don't take any money unless you receive it.  Google Illinois medicaid food stamp attorney and give them a call.  They will be able to answer some of your questions on filling out paperwork.  (I know you said not to advise on calling people) 

You should also run through two scenarios 1. You go to their offices and they provide you with paperwork everything is good to go.  2. You don't go down there and it doesn't come through.  Not saying the 1st works but if number 2 happens you need to have a plan.
