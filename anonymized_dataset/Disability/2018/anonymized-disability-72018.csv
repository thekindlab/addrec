Here's my problem: I suffer from poorly controlled neuropathy that means sitting or standing for too long (any sort of continued pressure) causes rapidly escalating pain. I can't eat out if I can't sit there. My type of pain is often called ""Princess and the Pea Syndrome.""

But I don't want it looking like some clunky medical device. I want to be able to take this into a fine dining establishment and have it not be out of place. Bringing in a bunch of pillows from home is just tacky.

It would need to be nonslip on the bottom, so I don't fall out of the chair, but something gentle so I won't harm an establishment's furniture, and no so gentle that it will get caught on metal deck furniture... You're going to want to look at the variety of seating possible, from stools to benches, to chairs, wood vs metal vs plastic.

Something as a drape-over seat-back pillow would also help.

Then some people say you can work while applying for disability if you earn under the SGA. Other's say while that's true for some people it could backfire on others (I'd assume that invisible or mental illness would be harder to show a disability).

""The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Justice have held that ""providers may not require persons with disabilities to pay extra fees or depositsas a condition of receiving a reasonable accommodation.""[14] In 1990, a HUD administrative judge enjoined owners of an apartment complex from charging a disabled person a pet deposit fee.[9] The judge held that an auxiliary aid, like a service, guide, or signal dog, may be necessary to afford the individual an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling unit, including public and common areas.[9] Accordingly, when a tenant qualifies for a service animal or emotional support animal, a landlord may not charge the tenant additional fees in association with the presence of the animal in the rental property. This prohibition extends to pet deposits and fees, even when those fees are charged to other tenants who have pets.[13]""",,,3,0,0,

I can be successful and make no money. The rant is entirely about the fact that the disabled community face a large injustice in terms of needing to afford things to maintain a viable life on the daily. And upon making a certain amount, we lose all supports that then forces us to pay out of pocket for things that no one else has to. That’s the injustice. And fraud is not just getting on the system. It’s a numerous amount of things that cost on average, $251 billion a year in fraudulent claims made by people. As well as in NYC, nearly 40% of claims made by those under Medicaid, were suspicious of being fraudulent or indeed fraudulent. As well as there was a record high of people registering for SSDI in 2009 where the ratio was 1:14 Americans that were of working age and capability were on SSDI. It is a crutch for those who are injured and have to stay on until a recovery is able. Sure, in some cases the people are unable to ever work again, but there are those who refuse to go back to work, despite being able to. This takes millions away for those who need it more as well as the disabled community who need constant assistance that should not have to be forced to pay out of pocket for things that are necessary to survival when only those who are disabled need these types of things. Not to mention the inflation of prices for durable medical equipment. A new bed for myself, out of pocket, would be nearly $10k, despite the mass functions being used on normal temperpedic beds that the only differences are that one is labeled as a “hospital bed” and the other is that it can rise up and down via the electric controller. All I am saying is that it is not fair and creates an injustice for those who had no choice in their disability, yet we are left to pay the bill in many cases, where it is unfair to force that on someone who already has their fair share of issues and limitations as it is.

Boats are inherently unsafe for people in wheelchairs. They can be adapted so that people in chairs can use them, but it is always unsafe. People who need wheelchairs are *generally* not going to be great swimmers, and they’re often belted to the chair. Boats roll fast. Without emergency floats on the chair, she could be lost very quickly. When no one knows what to do for her, death in such a situation is almost a foregone conclusion (especially since she isn’t wearing a vest).

I was on a boat in my chair earlier this year. The *first* thing they did was ensure I wasn’t belted in if I didn’t have to be. Then they explained how an evac would work, had two sets of floats immediately next to my chair, and one of the crew was always nearby. It won’t be like that everywhere, but the difference between life and death for someone in a wheelchair can entirely hinge on how close to the (generally hidden) rafts or emergency floats you parked her.

IMO the only fair approach especially these days when both spouses typically worked for a lot of their lives, would be to split the countable assets in half and only expect the couple to spend down one half for the first spouse to need geriatric care, that way the one that survives them is still left with something for when its their turn.",,,1,0,0,

""A service dog is trained to perform a function, or do a job, that his or her owner can’t perform on their own due to a physical, intellectual, or emotional disability. These dogs may, of course, provide emotional support and comfort, but they are specifically trained to provide assistance beyond soothing benefits.
A support dog is a companion animal (not necessarily a work animal) that provides therapeutic benefits to a person with a medically diagnosed disability. Support animals do not have to be trained for their role, but medical documentation is required in order to receive this designation.
Service dogs receive more legal protections than emotional support dogs and are allowed in just about any and every public space, whereas emotional support dogs do not enjoy the same widespread access.""

And also,

""Emotional support dogs are companion animals that provide therapeutic benefits to people with medically diagnosed mental, intellectual, or physical disabilities. In order to receive an emotional support animal designation, the animal’s owner must fit the medical definition of a disability, receive a diagnosis by a doctor or mental health professional, and receive a letter stating the animal provides benefits to the owner with regard to the diagnosed disability. It is not merely up to the pet owner to decide whether their pet fits the standard.

Emotional support dogs and their owners receive fewer federal protections through the ADA than service dogs, and those protections extend only to housing and air travel. This means the owner of an emotional support animal must be allowed to live with a pet in a residence that would otherwise be pet free.

I replied to you as I had a different viewpoint as to why this is helpful to me, a person who uses a wheelchair, and thought you might like to hear it. If not please let me know, I can tag you to know not to do the same in the future. 

We can agree to disagree. I don't think asking for what people want in a review video is the same as dealing with an ethics committee in a published paper, which I've also worked with in the past. By presenting my opinion here I'm aware that the OP will take my ideas and use them, that's okay with me.

I'm overall very happy to give out ideas that will help make life for others more accessible. I give feedback to my engineer about my wheelchair use, report medication side effects to the relevant scheme, put reviews about wheelchair accessibility online...all without compensation or official ethical approval. If I can help to make a future person's life easier with information I already have, that's compensation enough. If it's not for others, they don't have to give their ideas away.

If you tell your examiner that you are actively suicidal, what they [are supposed to] do is call the police for a well check. Depending on if you're at home or somewhere else, they may try to keep you on the phone. Once the police are involved, you're looking at an involuntary hospital stay. 

From a purely disability application standpoint - lack of ongoing treatment is going to sink your case. I know that its difficult to access treatment without financial means, but you have to at least show SSA that you're attempting to improve your health.

 If you do end up inpatient during your application, expect that your decision will be delayed several months. They have to get the hospitalization records and at least one post-hospitalization follow up. Not sure who said it will speed your case up, that is false. Unfortunately, claiming suicidal thoughts during a disability application is a tactic people use to game their way onto the system.

I've been borderline legally blind most of my life, though I was incredibly fortunate enough to be declared legal when I was of driving age. I turn 23 in a few months, and I still wonder and worry about how much longer I will have sight.

My advice is talk with your psychiatrist about extending your disability (lucky to have that option in Cali or is that Canada, CO doesn't do anything for state disability). Explain in very explicit terms that you are seeking to benefit from different types of therapy but that you don't feel you can handle working just yet and ask for a possible extension and have a plan of attack to give him reason to see that you need to get your mental health under control before you can commit to a job without fear of not being able to hold down a job while seeking treatment.

bbed7c45-3d31-468c-817f-07be160ce6ca,1530671953,"\&gt; You're reading seems to be mostly outdated. It's true that in the past  BPD has been argued about, but now it's very well accepted and  understood as a condition and defined in the DSM as such (though the  exact causes of it are still being developed).

Oh, I totally agree re: well-accepted(ness).  I meant in practice.

I think it would be more accurate to say that the \*literature\* I'm referring to is outdated -- not sure I'd agree with that (some of it is fairly recent, just --- well, OUTdated in part because its quality is like, pre-millenium...), but the point is basically that the authors of those articles are mostly traditionalists and provocateurs trying to make a niche name for themselves.

\&gt; Also, many more doctors *don't*  officially label a patient because of the stigma the disorder faces,  there are only a small percentage of doctors who throw the diagnosis out  willy nilly.

I don't think that there's enough data on this for me to agree with you.  I agree that this problem has improved A LOT since, say, the 1970s, but I also strongly suspect that it's highly under-reported.

\&gt; Each of my other comorbid conditons do not explain my impulsivity, self  harm, fear of real or perceived abandonment, mercurial mood, my  limerence, my poor boundaries with others, my heightened  aggressiveness/anger, my instable sense of self, my destructive  interpersonal relationships or my ability to cope with and control my  emotions, my idealization/devaluation of people, my ""black and white""  thinking, unending thoughts of shame, or my risky behaviors.

I disagree with much of this.  PTSD and depression can both present in myriad ways - self-harm is pretty glaringly associated with depression, mercurial mood/heightened aggression are most definitely associated with PTSD, the interpersonal aspect is associated with both, etc.

I do agree with you that the constellation of symptoms is consistent with BPD, and that stuff like ""black and white thinking"" and inability to cope with/control emotions are both highly suggestive of a personality disorder.

The trouble -- which is frankly the medical establishment's fault - is that once we subtract the features that are ""better"" (not my word of choice) accounted for by xyz, the diagnostic criteria can't be met even if the \*other\* features that strongly suggest BPD are severe and debilitating.  \[Again, this seems to be a place where psychiatry is missing the forest for the trees.\]

\&gt; You keep referencing but yourl should be more focused on the DSM to draw your conclusions. [http://www.dsm5.org/](http://www.dsm5.org/)

I totally agree.  To be clear, I think that the diagnostic criteria (as described in the dsm5) is part of the trouble --- the language should be more mindful of the above, and far greater emphasis should be placed on the elegance of the whole picture.    


Unfortunately, I think that the APA gives a lot of lip service to the DSM being ""a guideline"" or some comparably innocuous sounding term, but realistically, there's just no way for an organization like the APA or the AMA to release a diagnostic manual without contemporaneously setting hard expectations for everything from administrative standards to legal concerns.",,,1,0,0,

A month is really not much time for weight loss at all. If she's making progress, however slow, she's doing the right thing somewhere. 

Unfortunately if she is small other than the gained weight she'll find it takes longer to lose.

Menopause just exacerbates that as muscle decreases with age.

8a065fbe-2d32-4eac-ad48-eda8ffd40536,1531189872,"&gt;What clothing or accessory items do you want that are missing?

I'd really like a hoodie that is heavier, like a weighted one that is reasonably designed and able to be worn by a young adult male without looking like a medicalised piece. I have some skate hoodies that approach, but they could do better. 

Also, although I have a solution to this currently - velcro shoes that are designed well enough that adults can wear them.

&gt;What is wrong that is out there?

A lot of more athletic (along the extreme sports line) wear isn't optimised for wheelchair use - for example, having strengthened panels or easy wash material for hoodies that could deal with mud being kicked up by your wheels. Jeans also can be problematic with button and zip flies both having their own specific difficulties attached to them. 

&gt;What would be a big step forward and complete your wardrobe?

A suit that is well cut and takes into account my usage of wheelchair i.e. the 'break' should be correct over the shoes, or the 'perfect' pair of jeans that I have yet to find that hang correctly and don't present any real issues with wear over time. I'm fairly satisfied by skate jeans (Element Kr3w), but thinking of moving to biker jeans for issues concerning wear and potentiality of padding. Because sitting all day, even with a good cushion, can present problems.

&gt;What clothing could ease your daily routine?

Socks similar to ski socks or hiking socks that have elastic in them that create pressure on the feet and hold them in a particular shape, almost like a very soft brace. Ski socks are okay at this, but pricing presents problems and tbh they could be tighter than this. The thickness also helps with allaying some of the problems that come with the pressure of AFOs.

&gt;What is the right balance of fashion in the pieces you look for?

I care a lot about colour and cut. I tend to look for a mix of fashionable or fashion forward but with a fair amount of durability. That being said, I do not want to look old, outdated or overly medicalised. So if I must pick between a t shirt that has a graphic that would be complementary and a t shirt with a bracing/cooling or other useful element, I will pick the graphic, because my impairment is predictable to an extent in it's current affects day to day, I can deal with it, but the effect of fashion is very important in the industry I currently work. Something that is unappealing aesthetically is going to cause me more issues than something that isn't, even if I pay for it in some other way.

I'm good to discuss this more over DM, or here! This is super important work imo, and the fact that Tommy Hilfiger Adaptive has such a limited run in terms of locations is very annoying.

My partner and I often joke that together we make up 'just about one functional human being'. This comes from me being badly organised while she is the organisation queen, whilst Im very empathetic whilst she is not. In this manner we compliment each other and keep one another grounded - she makes sure I don't ignore my emails etc. and I remind her to cut people slack etc.

There is a disparity in that I can't work at the moment and she is the bread winner. However she really values the fact (as do I) that she is able to look after me. I see my role as keeping the house looking good to the best of my capacity (this means mostly doing the dishwasher and not being a slob) and also to just be there for her and maker her laugh. She really values the emotional support I can give her and I value the nurture and love she gives back.

We are really quite symbiotic in this way and I know Im really really lucky. However it is about attitude partly as well as understanding and being able to talk concerns through with each other - it is the self doubt that will hold you back. Try to find that persons that makes you feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable in front of them. It is hard to let go at first and put yourself out there, however having that support of another human and supporting them can be so valuable and important. It is not easy but it is possible :) ",,,7,0,0,

However, income will directly affect SSI benefits while you need to work near or at the substantial gainful activity (SGA-currently like $1150 a month) before it affects your SSDI.  Social Security has a program called Ticket to Work that can help you get training and accommodations so you can return to work.  If you recover substantially or receive suitable accommodations , there should be nothing preventing you from returning to work in the future if you want to do so.

As far as your application, I would get all of your medical records yourself and submit them to the SSA office and confirm receipt.

Using SSI as an example, if you are considered two separate individuals you can each have 1-car and up to 2,000 in financial assets.

But if you get married you're limited to 1 car total and 3,000 in financial assets. So a couple is better off staying legally-single so that they can each have a car and an extra 1k in savings for emergencies.

Their rationale behind this is that couples can split costs by living together, which is true, but the asset limits are hold-overs from the 1960s that have never been updated to reflect things like 40 years of inflation.",,,4,0,0,

Join in with groups that will  work to explain the programs in your state that are being offered, enacted &amp; changed yearly. 

While I know you are reeling from all the unknowns at the moment, take time to think about your child's future economic needs.

Open a Special Needs Trust and start thinking of ways to fund it.

Set up the trust and let your family know how important it is to leave any inheritance to the trust. Many programs &amp; services are resource based. 

Fund it with the proceeds from life insurance, which at your age will be much more affordable.
 
Get ready to enter the world of government services. 

Go to the DHS / HHS and file disability early.  Some children are eligible for SSI at a early age. 

Don't try to do this by yourself.  Enlist help from Disability community and disability Advocate Services.   

Sign up for DDS Waiver Services, many states have waiting lists that #'s in the thousands, some taking 10 years or more to be approved.

I have never seen a cp child that wasn't happy. I think that comes with all the additional hands on care they receive.

Take special care of your marital relationship as your child's needs can be very disruptive. Don't blame your self for producing a disabled child. 

My wife had an IUD that triggered premature birth. 

People have said to me that only special people have special needs children. I would rather think that a good parent will rally to the best interest of their child.

No. You have kept the ability to write in your mind. You have kept yourself alive against all odds, ones I can't compare to surely. Anyway, me yelling at my suicidal tendencies.   


'Can you really do that to yourself? It isn't even the easy way out, it is what some of them wanted. The fuckers have been trying to push you, sometimes quite vocally, to kill yourself. Even if they never know, do you want to give them the satisfaction? It will prove nothing to them, minus whatever they end up telling themselves when they sleep at night.  


'Should you end it, your viewpoint is immediately silenced. You will never be able to knock away the arguments that would endanger your life. Your trauma and your pain should not block it, it should not destroy you, it should empower you. They are your weapons, they are your arguments against the bright light they claim to be. They might ignore your words, they might fight your words, but drilling it into the subconscious of this society is better than nothing! Which, should you give in, will be all you can give to the argument.'  


I annoyingly have had to do this very often. Especially when a doctor hand waves my disorders away, acts like the idea of the disorder itself is a myth, or just acts like i am lying to get drugs. Even if i just want a c1-inhibitor supplement so my body stops attacking itself the moment stress rears its head. Given my upbringing and situation involving my disabilities, my voice to that side of myself is a bit more brutal and venomous. Though it is just so i have a knee-jerk response when the situations that used to spur those emotions on come about.   


That side of me was given the mind of a warrior. An instinctual delight in winning the battle. The war may rage around them, the screams and cries of endless chaotic memories and dreams may burn against their ears. They keep fighting. They begin to, even if lying to themselves, act as if they enjoy the fight. Hold their arms out and fucking DARE life to try harder. Not to prove to it you can take it, but because fuck.

Even the ADHD, possibly. 

The thyroid has hundreds of functions in the body, and not all of them are fully understood. If you don't already, make sure you're followed by an endocrinologist and have them test your _Free_ T4 &amp; _Free T3_, not just T4 and THS levels (again, if they don't already). 

I've got pituitary dysfunction. If I listed all the individual diagnoses that fall out from that, you'd be begging for a tl;dr. The first 4 major fallouts are chronic migraines, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism and hypogonadism. It gets worse from there.

Point is, don't let it overwhelm you. This makes you a warrior. You're playing life on Expert Mode. Hold your head up high. Drawing the short straw is also the opportunity to be a hero.

Suggestion: if you met someone just starting with this struggle, what wisdom would you want to pass along to them? Write that down. The idea is this puts you in a position of authority and competence over your disease, plus in a nurturing state-of-mind that can help you recognize the many strengths you've built up.


If can be easy to feel lost in a sea of problems. We're always looking forward because we have so much with which to contend. However, don't overlook your wake: behind you are all your successes, all your problems = solved, all your accomplishments. You're going through hella rough seas, but you're cutting a path through.

One with a Motability focus would be particularly fab as there is a lot of choice and it's difficult to narrow down, particularly for people who've never had a car before. There were a few points that could have been covered better for me personally;

* **Transferring wheelchair into car** - You covered the boot space well and the self transfer but most of the time I'm going to be transferring, dismantling my chair, lifting it over me and placing in the passenger/back seat. How easily does the passenger seat move forward from driver position, how's the roof height, do standard 24"" wheels fit in the footwell easily, how much overall space is there to fling your frame into the back seat. Bear in mind that while some chairs have a back that folds down like your own, others are a fully fixed frame. Keep the boot section for people who have assistance or can walk from boot to driving seat. 

* **Boot height from chair** - Getting shopping into the boot is a nuisance sometimes from chair height, especially if you have to lean on the car to reach it really dirties up your clothes. 

* **Hand controls** - No mention of these. I appreciate you're a standard automatic driver and won't use these but a wee line about their availability in general would be helpful. A link to another reviewer who uses them perhaps? Or even to the very brief explanations on the Motability site. 

* **General hand friendly-ness** - Things like are the door handles easy to use (some are stiffer than others), where are the intuitive handholds (official or improvised), how easy is the seatbelt to reach and pull, what's the key fob like.  

* **Seat** - No mention of the seat height or recline adjustment options, though I do like how you covered the the forward/back motion and mentioned accidentally pressing the buttons with your arse. Totally something a lot of people who transfer will do. Does it come with lumbar support, AFAIK only some Motability vehicles come with this.

* **Doors** - This was very briefly covered in video at the end but nothing said about it! I find it helpful to know which way the doors open, how difficult/heavy they are and how far they open, as it makes a difference both for throwing in my chair and in certain parking spaces. 

I totally want the park assist though hahaha. How handy that looks!

Medical devices are tools. Tools to help you carve out the life you want. You can go through life without utilizing then and ""disabling"" your capacity further, or you can use what you need and kick ass.

I've found having a more visible disability actually makes things easier--you get to face people's assumptions upfront. You get to break barriers and stereotypes just by showing up and doing your job.

People who judge you for using medical devices that help you are not worth worrying about. Period. It's your life, their opinions are irrelevant. Do whatever increases your ability to function successfully.

I completely agree with everything you’re saying. I have been advocating where I can with the little notoriety I have in my local community as well as my university and law school too. I’ve met with people who have non profits for getting the disabled community out there in Hollywood productions, as well as advocating for equality on public transportation and stuff like that. But again, the biggest issue with campaigning is that, unless someone is in some form, affected by a disability directly or indirectly, not many will care about our fight, and that is the most difficult obstacle to overcome. Most people are more infatuated with the immigration reforms, gender equality, and LGBTQ movements, rather than disability rights. I must say, and I have said it before and will always say it, the disabled community are truly the last community to have systematic discrimination and segregation; either purposely or unconsciously. In public, it does not matter what gender, sexuality, race, or ideology you are, you can go into a public place, take public transportation without any issue, and not have to worry about accessibility. And because of that, I stand by my point. We cannot ride in UBERS or Lyfts, unless thee is a specific city with accessible cars (which I know the two companies have been testing this in major cities, but let’s be honest, not many own an accessible vehicle for a power wheelchair), or buildings that are grandfathered don’t have to be accessible and because many cities are old, most apartments and homes are not accessible. It’s a fight that will be around until there is robotics that allow a disabled person to walk again or be able bodied, or wheelchairs that can hover. I see those two possibilities happening before public policy creates true equality. ",,,1,0,0,

Most people are happy to chime in on these, there are plenty of comments and most posts are positively upvoted.

These people who are applying for benefits have disabilities themselves. It's very helpful to encounter someone who is in a similar position to your own and ask them about their journey both in regards to benefits and the treatments that are available after you are approved.

It's also said that these questions don't stifle other conversation. People do come here seeking support, but many have moved off to specialized subreddits like ones for chronic pain sufferers.

For instance, I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.  I do not meet the most recent diagnostic criteria, which was disseminated in March 2017.  However, the reason for this is that the 03/2017 criteria does not adequately account for paradoxical stiffness secondary to joint hypermobility, and place undue emphasis on cardiovascular problems.  This shortcoming is not that controversial, and many geneticists simply discount the points that would have been deducted by their flexibility metric - the ""Beighton score"" - in cases where muscle spasm is a well-documented and clinically significant factor.

What the people living with you own or are worth is irrelevant,  all they care about is what they give you for support, which is narrowly food and shelter, or cash.

There are a lot of things they don't count.  Consult the POMS link I gave you it details all the stuff you need to know. 

In kind support in your case, I will assume if you live with your parents and they pay for food and shelter, that counts.  I don't think medical expenses count, but I could be wrong.  

Living on your own has advantages but, when it comes to what it costs, what they will dock you for in-kind support as I said might be far less than rent and utilities on your own.

If your parents will rent you a room,  utilities included for one price, that is a viable option to run the numbers on.

If you are a tenant.... then technically, they are not counted as any sort of support.  If the room/apartment in their house is ""room and board"" that kind of lease can include rent, utilities ect ect.  And that can be technically any figure you agree on.  It has to be realistic.... of course. But, the cost of utilities for one or 2 rooms plus rent would be much lower than you going out and getting a separate residence. 

Look under the POMS and see what they consider in kind support... its very specific.  For example, anyone can pay for your phone, cable and entertainment and it is not counted. If they pay a credit card off, it isnt counted. Now if they pay the power bill water heat or rent... that counts.

It would only factor in if you were applying for SSI.  What will hamper your case is if you are working and earning close to or exceeding the Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) income threshold of $1180 monthly.  If you are, you will automatically be denied in most cases.  The SSA evaluates if you can do ANY type of work, not just your current or past jobs, to earn SGA.  So if you apply, you should strongly consider reducing your income to less than SGA.  I hired a lawyer right away and he said don’t work at all.

You’re likely looking at a long haul to approval.  I think you can handle the initial application yourself.  I hired a lawyer and he really didn’t help much at this point other than obtaining and forwarding my records to the SSA.  I suggest that you obtain and submit your own records to the SSA so you know what they’ve received and that in fact it was received.  As you receive more treatment, submit the relevant records to the SSA.  If you are denied, then you should seek out an attorney or advocate at that point.

I understand how you feel about the personal and financial uncertainty of this process.  I was the sole income earner for our family and after I got sick last year, it devastated us financially.  I was “lucky” because legal blindness meets a disability listing (yay me, I guess?!?), so I only waited eight months before I received my first check.

I can't drive and I live in an area that needs it to get around, so I'm kind of limited in meet ups. Maybe facebook is a good idea to find groups to talk with; kind of been avoiding that site to be honest. I've never actually met another person that has my disability.

I think urea would help correct your hyponatremia, how many grams of protein and sugars do you typically ingest? Urea is considered a waste product in mainstream medicine, even though it's known to be effective in many disorders. Urea and additional salt should help correct your hyponatremia. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/urea-for-hyponatremia-now-available-in-a-palatable-oral-form-300281528.html 

I think this is a good brand: it doesnt taste good, but it's ok in orange juice. I don't know id you can get a couple of sweet, ripe oranges and juice them yourself. Or, you can make capsules out of urea. For a dose, I'd say 12 grams 3 or 4 times a day should do the trick. If i had a hospital, i would have you on hypertonic iv sodium chloride, because that is a dangerously low sodium. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00I31U8S2/ref=sxts_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530986615&amp;sr=1&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65

I think it's important to ensure high, good-quality protein intake, and i would supplement that with sugar (not starch) in whatever form is palatable to you. Also i think you should avoid gums and carrageenan, just in case there's gi involvement. With sodium that low, i think it's good to be careful. When your sodium comes up, provided you have a good diet, i think you will notice some changes. 

Vitamin D: do you supplement? I think 15,000 ius/day would be a good dose for you.

For thyroid, free t3 would be a good test, but i think once your sodium gets stabilized you can just measure your own temperature and pulse to get a feel for your thyroid activity. I think part of the problem is that your body is breaking dowj its own tissue to make urea (from protein) and glucose. I think your creatine kinase will drop after you restore sodium amd increae protein amd sugar. Eggs, milk, collagen are good sources of protein. Target protein should be around 100 grams if you can do that, or at least 80, with plenty of sugar. The sugar will contribute to restoration of mineral balance. Are these labs recent? ",,,2,0,0,

Second, re: your repeat references to all this reading I'm supposed to do --- yeah, done that.  Promise.  MDD, PTSD, BPD --- super literate in all that stuff.  For sure.

I do not think that BPD is synonymous with any particular subset of PTSD, and I also do know what you're referring to.  (I'm assuming that ""complex"" PTSD is somewhere in there, among other things.)  I also agree that this is a point worth making.

BUT, I think that this is what you're missing about my comment:  I am not presuming to speak to the functional anatomy of BPD or the functional anatomy of PTSD/MDD/etc.  

Whether you agree with it or not, the fact is that diagnostic guidelines **do** advise against a diagnosis of BPD in the presence of other diagnoses - such as PTSD + MDD + GAD - that ""better"" (which, in effect, might as well read ""always"") account for a patient's symptomology.  Also, there isn't a gene test for the type of stuff that you're referring to, despite the fact that some research suggests genetic (even heritable) predispositions.

So basically:  By all means, totally feel free to disagree with the diagnostic guidelines, but um, that really doesn't change the fact that they exist, and that clinicians who diagnose BPD in the presence of these comorbid conditions have an impossibly high standard to meet.  That is why I very readily call the *diagnosis* into question.

I do not think that we disagree as much as you think we do.  If anything, we probably disagree about the ethics of making a BPD diagnosis under these particular circumstances and against guidelines.  I share your concerns about those guidelines, and I also recognize why those guidelines exist.  (As you probably know, BPD is oft thrown around - esp. by psychodynamic therapists - when a ""difficult"" patient presents, essentially as a kind of abusive psychiatrization.)

As for doing more reading on ""what BPD actually is"" --- I think you and I both know that there's no actual consensus about this behind closed academic doors, and that much of that reading would call the very existence of the disorder into question.  If you're not already aware of this, I suggest that *you* do more reading on ""what BPD actually is""...

You can thank me later for not having hopped aboard that particular academic freight, as we seem to take issue with the same psychiatric cabal.",,,1,0,0,

By the way, that's a very standard policy. Last time you were able to contact your boss, so, again legally, it appears that you understood the policy.

I don't see this as discrimination. It would be great if your boss could work with you on this.

I ended up hiding myself in the closet and he got furious trying to find me and ended up kicking me a lot, I told him I had a knife to leave me alone [lie] but he called some... emergency people [not emergency services but some sort of crisis people?] who said he said I was going to kill myself with the invisible knife I threated him with because he was KICKING ME because I was sleeping because my head was killing me!!!

If you meet the medical criteria for SSA disability benefits and the financial criteria for SSI you will be awarded disability benefits.
That being said because SSI is needs based you cannot have resources in your name over $2,000.

If you are living with your parents and not paying what SSA determines to be your fair share towards housing expenses (rent) then they will reduce your SSI benefit by 1/3 for what is called In Kind Support and Maintenance.

It would be in your best interests to file before the age of 22 as you will be considered a Disabled Adult Child (DAC) and may be eligible to receive increased benefits from your parents work record down the road. 

In some places it is also very important to receive SSI first before any DAC benefits as that secures your Medicaid status even if the benefit you would eventually receive based on your parents is over the Medicaid income limit.

I had to go through the same thing after 2 years. As long as nothing has changed, and you are still seeing your doctors, it would be hard for them to overturn it. You will probably just have to fill out paperwork, have your doctors fill out paperwork, and have a phone interview. Easier said than done, but try not to worry. You should get something in the mail soon explaining the next steps. Good luck! ",,,4,0,0,

Tsh is good to keep low but it doesnt have much to do with diagnosing hypothyroidism. I get my thyroid hormone from mexico, but there are other ways. Within the system, you'd have to find an independent doctor and pay them cash. Or you could import synthroid from mexico, just take enough to supress your glandular activity and raise your tsh, then you could get a prescription.

Regardless if your daughter is receiving SSI (Supplemental Security Income, Title 16) or SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance, Title 2), Social Security would never honor a garnishment order for a medical bill. Social Security will do garnishment for federal debts (like tax debts, federal student loans, etc) and some state debts (like child support), but a private collection agency would be out of luck. 

It is possible that the debt collector would bring a civil suit, but the “can’t get blood from a turnip” principle would still apply. It would also be costly for the debt collector, and they would still have a hard time actually collecting any judgement.

92bef5d6-3555-43f8-9598-b96fd91747d2,1532028447,"SSI (Supplemental Security Income or Title 16 of the Social Security Act) and SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance or Title 2 of the Social Security Act) have the same medical criteria for disability determinations. That means that if an individual meets the medical criteria for one program, he or she meets the medical criteria for the other program. 

They have vastly different non medical criteria, though. Title 2 (SSDI) is based on work history. It is pretty much the full retirement age benefit adjusted for fewer working months than the retirement benefit. Title 16 (SSI) is based on the income and resources of the applicant. 

So, if that wasn’t confusing enough, people can qualify for one, then the other, or they can receive both concurrently. The trick to knowing which program is which is to look at the letters after your Social Security number.

SSI: Usually has a DI, 999-99-9999DI

SSDI: Usually has an A, 999-99-9999A

Those are the more common BICs (Beneficiary Identification Codes), but there are around 40 or 50. Each means something different. 

Generally, people apply for both programs concurrently, and if medically approved, SSA works out how much money comes from each source for which period of time. 

TLDR: Social Security is very confusing, and even in the lengthy explanation above, I left out a ton of stuff. Also, there are a lot of exceptions to different rules. ",,,3,0,0,

I always feel that 'inspirational' is kinda, delegitimising the struggle and the disabled person's competence. Example, it was really hard for me- someone with dystonia/probable MS/ASD to get through university. That has been described as 'inspirational' 'brave' and all sorts of meaningless platitudes. However, I had a nondisabled friend who tbh, had just a rough time of it at this particular university. Her struggle was 'tough' 'hard' and she wasn't inspirational for getting through it, she was 'strong'. 

To call me inspiring takes the struggle away from me. It doesn't become me, and the odds being against me and my tenacity getting me through - it becomes the poor disabled guy, who by luck or fortune got through a very difficult-for-him (because he's crippled) degree. It makes the problem, not the degree itself, not the ableist views of society etc. It makes the problem me and my being disabled.

It makes the problem an issue with my assumed competence. 

Which is patronising as shit. 

I know these things are said to try and sympathise, but they ignore personhood or ... disabled people being adults, and being generally as competent as able bodied folks (excluding obvious things like, whatever your impairment is but I'd argue that's a variance issue not competence) - and, inspirational should be reserved for people who have actually done something so far out of the ordinary that it is actually inspiring. 

I don't know, I just hate it. But I agree with your last sentence- we can change how we react, and that's a very good thing to keep in mind.

While I am happy to chat to anyone or smile at them in the street, I'd find someone approaching me *just* because of my chair very offputting. 

If they're approaching to ask me about my wheels, clothes, the way to the bus stop or to complain about the heat because it's the UK and we're all doing that right now...that's fine. Approaching me to talk about my wheelchair use and disability is not appreciated, because I don't want to talk about that with anyone other than my friends and doctors. You won't hurt my feelings, I just don't want to talk about those things with a stranger. 

It sounds like what you want is a group to specifically chat about issues surrounding disability, presumably to empathise and have a bit of a chat/rant. That's fine! I'd suggest you look into disability support groups, your hospital may run one or there are many people that run local social groups - check meetup.com or have a search on Facebook. Some are for specific illnesses, others are a more general 'if you have a physical disability, go here'. Sometimes it's much more on the support side of things, in others it's an excuse to meet up for a pint and talk to new people. 

I wouldn't worry about your wheelchair use, people use chairs in different ways and I know several amputees that use their feet to move as well as pushing. People with incomplete spinal cord injuries/muscle disorders/neuropathic issues often have some use of their legs and use their feet when necessary. Not everyone uses a wheelchair full time and some lucky people can walk unassisted one day while rolling the next. Use your chair in whatever way is appropriate for your illness or injury and don't worry about it. 

Don't feel you have to limit yourself to disabled meetups either. You said you're into general conversation, there are groups for people that do exactly that, meet up for a drink or a quiz and chat to whoever is there. I don't know how old you are but once you're a bonafide adult, particularly past college/uni, it's hard to make new friends and you need to be more open minded about it. I've met some very nice people having a relaxing pint in the pub for example, or chatting to someone beside me at the supermarket, but you can do it in a more structured way like going to planned meetups. A note here that none of the people I've made friends this way have been wheelchair users! Be open to talking to any person and trying new things and you might also find new things that you're into that opens up another friend circle. ",,,5,0,0,

If your spouse is chipping away at your mental health while paternalistically phrasing it as ""getting better"" (this should be a *collaborative* thing and it doesn't just happen after a sudden loss of household income!) and you can't talk to them about it driving you to rock-bottom mental health, that is a huge communication gap that really needs to be addressed. 


Additionally, if you can handle the bills on your existing combined income, any SO should without a second thought prioritize their partner not feeling *suicidal* over extra spending money. That's not stupid or ridiculous or indicative of any laziness and the fact you're trying this hard to try to make this barista thing work says the exact opposite. It's time to work as a team.


I think having a talk about setting a budget, reasonable expectations for what side incomes (or none!) you can keep up over the long term with your disability, and judging the pros/cons of each, weighing the financial against the non-financial (mental health, physical health, time with the kids) in proportion to how your budget goes is the best way forward here.

First of all, phone adult social servies. Tell them you need a social worker and an assessment by an Occupational Therapist. It'll be a pain to deal with a social worker but they know the system and how to navigate it. Ask about an electric wheelchair. They might turn you down for one, but they might agree to get you one. A manual one (self propelling) isn't perfect but it means others can push you in it when you go out.

You might have to wait awhile to see the social worker because they're overloaded with work, but don't give up. Once they get going, the social worker and OT can help with all kinds of equipment.

Are you male? If so, buy a urinal bottle to save trying to make it to the bathroom for just a pee. And you might find it easier to transfer onto a commode if you're struggling with the bathroom.

Appeal against your benefits decision. On the forms, emphasise your worst days. Don't tell them all the things you can do, tell them what you can't. Also, ask your doctor, neurologist, and any medical people you regularly see if they'll agree to be contacted about your case.

I don't have a ton of specific advice because I grew up with these things from birth, but it helps knowing that you're still a person despite everything that's wrong with you. You might look funny or you might get fatigued way too easily or you might constantly be in some sort of pain, but underneath it all, you're still a regular person. I guess the easiest way to remember that is to prevent your entire livelihood from revolving around your conditions as much as possible. Ignoring them can obviously be dangerous, so don't do that, but they also don't have to consume everything you do.

Try to keep up your hobbies as much as possible. If you have a hard time doing your hobbies the ""normal"" way, then try to find a way to adapt them or even learn/try a whole new thing.

Some things I like are baking, crocheting, knitting, reading, and I even learned how to hand-bind books. When I was a kid, I really liked drawing and painting. I especially like baking, knitting, and crocheting because they're things that can be shared with other people, so that helps with the isolation that can come from being disabled. Spending time with friends or family obviously also helps with the isolation.

I also like makeup, clothes, and general self care like baths and skincare. I feel like these all help with the aesthetic limitations (I don't know what word to use here tbh) of disabilities. If my skin is moisturized or my hair is perfectly soft or my lipstick looks especially good or if my outfit is extra cute, it helps me know that my disabilities don't prevent me from looking or feeling beautiful.

I do not blame her at all. I think she saw a window of time to control her own destiny, because one more fall or just a bit more motor skill deterioration and she would lose that choice.

Something I see over and over in the disability community is people afraid to use aids and the services there specifically for them because of the judgment of able people. It makes me so angry and I mention it whenever I see it come up among healthy people lauding themselves for calling out people that don't look disabled enough yet I can't seem to get over it enough personally to not care. 

I use braces but even with those I feel like people will think I'm being attention seeking if they can see them which is totally stupid. Using a mobility cart or arguing for a seat on the bus for myself type things no matter how much I am suffering has so far been too scary for me. I'd have no problem standing up for someone else doing it though, ugh. It's getting to the point I don't think I'm going to have a choice much longer though.

If he looks like he's struggling with something, it's not super offensive to ask if you can help in any way, but he likely already has strategies to do things, especially if he's been that way since birth. 

If dating becomes a regular thing, finding small things you can help him with will be far less awkward. Maybe something like buttoning up a shirt or tying a tie, but there's all sorts of things he probably already does for things like this. Magnetic closing shirts, clip on ties. There's plenty of resources and items out there for people with disabilities to live normal lives, so there's no reason to treat him any different. 

Edit: and I don't mean this in a bad way / no disrespect to you. A lot of people ""just want to help"", but the biggest help of all can sometimes be a sense of independence. Maybe just a simple statement like ""don't be afraid to ask if you need help with anything"", but for the most part, unless he specifically asks for assistance, don't even worry about it. 

If it does come up in conversation, once he explains his condition or whatever, show interest but don't follow up with a million questions (especially not stuff like ""how do you do ___?""). Just simple acknowledgement is enough, or you could show genuine interest in how it's effected his life. Be straightforward if you go that route. Don't fall into the bullshit trap of talking about how ""inspiring"" it is that he can lead a normal life, but maybe ask him if he has any interesting stories he could share. ",,,4,0,0,

The main benefit I see comes from a term making it easier and more likely to talk about. I think the concept of relationships for people with disabilities is  complex and fraught with fears and misunderstanding. So the disability community owning the term and talking about it more can bring light to those negative stereotypes, and misunderstandings.

A key here is WE the disability community own the term first and can start defining it and its implications before it is used by general public. 

I would love to hear more about the struggles and triumphs of people on a similar situation. It would help me feel less alone and perhaps gain perspectives that help me better deal with it. I know my partner too has many extra stresses in her life, and perhaps questions, because of my conditions and think she might find benefit in hearing about others in her situation. More conversation could help make some of us feel less alone in our situation. 

I know a term is not a magic wand to make all this happen, but I wonder if it could make it much more likely to happen.  I don’t know, but think so.

fc5e5d3d-89e2-4aa3-974f-791028ff98cd,1532484549,"Hi, I've been a wheelchair user my entire life. Dabbling in mobility aids and walking throughout my childhood which i always thought was stupid as i felt more capable in my chair.

I work as an artist in disability arts so i have a huge experience with sign language interpreters. They are all lovely and what a great field to work in!!! 

Overall, i think you need to remove the idea of disability for a second and its viewpoint people have on you if you were seen as ""disabled"". It seems that a wheelchair would suit you best with the extra add on of a slot for crutches. My friend has this and it works very well for him. He also has learnt something crazy which i didnt realize he did until a few days into knowing him because it was so smooth but he places one of the crutches behind him, semi underneath one of his buttocks to create a type of seat. the other crutch in his hand. It allowed him to stay still with better arm movement.

Overall, your job mainly involves your facial expression, body language (which doesnt change based your disability as its about expressiveness. proven by how many people i know with different disabilities using sign language very well). The other part is of course, your hands. If you cant access a location that you should sign in, then you can make it work via crutches. request a seat there (high stool maybe for the best view for people). Wheelchairs also allow you to push and sign. It wont stutter the conversation. If anything (based on my experience) whist you sign for someone, you will be in the same spot so they can move around the room and they know exactly where you will be at all times. If the dynamic of the room changes such as everyone is having a chat in the middle then you can just move there and continue to sign in one spot.

Disability is about equal access to the world, the deaf community wont judge you for your access needs or how you adapt to give them as good or better experience than any other sign language interpreter. Really, the main thing you need is to do your job to the best of your ability!!! do not let your fear of what people will think about your disability set you back on the quality you can give :).
Prove them wrong on your disability and how good a sign language interpreter you are!

If you fear this, may be doing what i do will help which is i face each day i go outside with a ""fuck you, i can do anything and prove all your opinions on disability wrong"". and do you know what, even though i ask for a few access things and needs, i do a damn good job and i know i change peoples opinions on disability.

Another bit of advice I can give is, explore the mobility aids at home first. Get a good grip on them before you bring them into the workplace. This means you can gain a good technique in pushing a chair or using crutches. You wont be slow whilst in the workplace and you will have little tricks that make your life smoother and easier (such as the seat trick I mentioned or how to carry hot places in a chair etc). All of these things you will learn just through practice.

Success is measured in the ability to have a happy, sustainable life and you don't need a huge amount of money for that. I will be going off next academic year to do my masters, and continue my work in Disability-art.

Disability art in my life, thus far, has made me all of £300 over the last 4 years studying my contemporary performance art degree, but I wouldn't give it up for the world because what it has given me in terms of self esteem, representation and community is priceless. If I can scrape a comfortable living in this field, or the field of disability studies, I'll be happy and that'll  be my success, regardless of whether or not I am on benefits to support my living.

As an aside, my pursuit of happiness is limited not by my impairment, but by people's attitudes towards it, and those attitudes that cause issue include the ideology that a) we are only valuable in terms of labour and money and b) that the system of benefit, which is incredibly important, is abused to such an extent that we must 'weed out' the abusers - this attitude is playing into the hands of those who wish to deny us our rights to happiness and dignity etc, because it is divisive and ignores both statistical fact and the other fact that those on low income, who feel the \*need\* to do that are generally not doing it out of malice but rather desperation. I have yet to see anyone on benefit live the high life, as you yourself point out with the 66k remark. If 1 out of every 100 people (not an accurate stat, it'll be way lower) feel they have to commit fraud to get by, fine. I'd prefer they didn't starve.

Your capability, and support and educational achievement are not everyone's and you are not better than everyone for having circumstances that allow you to become an attorney.

And for the minuscule proportion of people who are committing fraud without a need? It is so low it's irrelevant.

You are right that the able-bodied don't understand disabled experience - but you acting in a manner that is divisive and combative doesn't help that understanding go any further.

TL:DR - redefine your ideals of success, they are hugely capitalistic. Pursuit of happiness is limited by this exact ideology of materialism. Not everyone is committing fraud, very few are (very difficult to assess, but it's no doubt low, it is very difficult to fake an impairment), not everyone has the circumstances you have that have allowed you to achieve what you have and being combative gets you nowhere with furthering understanding. As a future attorney you should know it's overly emotive and achieves nothing except angering your opponents.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1530882694,"The general rules for SSDI work credits is that a person has to have 20 credits within a 40 credit timeframe. Each quarter is a credit, so that breaks down to you have to have worked a total of 5 years within a 10 year timeframe. Once you've hit the 20 quarters, you become ""insured"" for SSDI. 

But, just like car insurance, you only remain insured as long as you're paying premiums. When a person stops working, a clock starts on that insured status and eventually the person will lose their insured status. This can take anywhere from 1 quarter to 20 quarters depending on a lot of factors. If a person waits to long to file, and they are no longer insured, a SSDI application can still be done, but that person will have to be found disabled **prior** to their date last insured. Depending on how long ago it was, it becomes nearly impossible. 

Now, the rules are different for people under the age of 31. SSA doesn't consider you to be 'working age' until you are 21. So for that initial 40 quarters/10 years of your working life, the number of credits required is lower. It roughly equates to half of the available credits since you turned 21.  So, lets say you are 25 - that is 16 credits (4 yrs) since you turned 21 - so you need 8 credits to become insured. 

Even if you are on SSI you can still work and build work credits, which can eventually lead to SSDI eligibility. 

Now, you said that you became disabled in your 'early 20s', was it before age 22? There is a subsection of SSDI called Childhood Disability Benefits (CDB) that is designed for people who became disabled prior to attaining working age, and allows them to use the earnings on their parent's SSN for SSDI benefits. In order to be eligible the disabled person has to be determined to be disabled between the ages of 18-22 *and* the parent has to either draw benefits themselves (retirement or disability) or die. 

The CDB benefits are roughly 75% of what the parent would receive (less if multiple people are drawing on the SSN) and comes with all the SSDI benefits like Medicare and no asset limitations. If the CDB benefits are low enough, you can also continue to receive SSI along side it (although your SSI will be lowered because of the CBD benefits). ",,,5,0,0,

Being disabled you're one of the lucky ones to learn that early.  I say that with only a bit of sarcasm.  
You learn your own vulnerability.  You reason that all people are vulnerable in one way or the other.  You learn empathy.  You learn the true value of trust.  You learn how to deal with that trust being broken.  If you're lucky again you've learned how to be a thoughtful, trusting, empathetic and forgiving person.  Pain and damage teach you about yourself and others.  How you deal with it defines you.  Do you want to live the rest of your life jaded and pissed off at 'a perception of' betrayal or become a beacon of forgiveness and understanding that we're all the same bits arranged a little differently.  
Forgiveness doesn't make you a fool, it makes you stronger.  
That said, don't be ignorant.  Being manipulated or abused, allowing that for the sake of maintaining a relationship, excusing behavior because you're in a  position of fear of being alone, that defines you too but not in a good way.

If you're in the US, very very few states actually have state based short term disability (STD). Most people (if they have an STD plan) have it through their workplace. If you do have STD through your work, your payment is likely about 60% of your regular pay for up to about 12 weeks. After that, it tends to fall under long term disability plans (LTD, also usually a workplace plan) until you've been disabled for one year. After you've been disabled for one year, that is about when you'll qualify for state based disability. 

You may qualify for state based disability sooner than one year if a doctor determines that it's extremely likely that you'll be disabled for one year or longer, but that is more common with extreme injury.

Your pay for state based disability (SSI or SSDI, I get them mixed up) will vary. One is based upon your age and work history/credits and the other is based upon your income.

My carer is allergic to chicken, I can't have pasta, potatoes, any kind of tomato product, vinegar product, acidic fruit products, water, milk, juice, tea or any other noncarbonated beverage, and much, much more. We live in Flint, in an apartment complex from the turn of the 20th century, where the water tests bad even when filtered through both a faucet filter and a pitcher filter, so we have to buy water at the store for all potable requirements, including washing dishes and brushing teeth, not just drinking. I also have to buy enough carbonated water or pop to not dehydrate in this heatwave, carbonated water isn't cheap here, it's $1.19 with deposit/lt., and pop just doesn't hydrate enough, I went into heat exhaustion yesterday and nearly went into heat stroke. 

Medicaid doesn't cover anything to do with my autism, they'd pay to have me mismedicated to a state worse than death, nothing more. To keep the $750 SSI, and therefore the foodstamps and medicaid for regular health care, I have to pay $400 every two months to see a neuropsychologist to be in ""regular care"". I also need to pay for all my sensory and adaptive devices, the cane they cover only works for the joint issues, I have to pay for one that reverberates to compensate for lack of proprioception, I have to pay for the yellow tint to be able to go into florescent light, I have to pay for the second entire pair of glasses and the red tint to be able to read, I have to pay for the ear protectors, and the fidget devices so the ignorant security guard doesn't try to call the cops on me again for flapping or rolling my fingers, I have to pay for the AAC device so I can communicate when I can't speak, none of it is covered. 

&gt; I believe the ability to do work (and by definition contribute to society) is on paper the most important quality in a generalized non emotional way.

That's fine, but I believe you're wrong. 

As for cigs, I don't spend any money on them. My brother in law supplies the 1/4-2 cigarettes a day I need to function well enough to get food, eat without puking from pain, and to remain able to see, hear, speak, etc. That said, the temporary slight increase in IQ that nicotine provides makes such a drastic difference in my ability to manually compensate for my sensory differences that it would be worth the cost if I had to, because I could not do what is required to obtain food or nearly anything else otherwise. Prior to such use, I was nonverbal 75+% of the time, had 7+ major overloads a day, and could not go out in public at all. 1/4-2 cigarettes a day took me down to 2-3 major overloads a year,  verbal 75+% of the time, and able to ride a bus, hear a siren, even navigate a store alone.  

Disclaimer: If I were not already manually processing my senses, they'd be useless, I do not advocate for, or suggest anyone take up smoking for sensory processing disorder, my personal judgment that the quality of life increase I receive is worth the potential health costs is in no way intended to influence someone else's decision on the matter. I have no interoception at all, I do not have the ability to receive the signals of physical addiction, withdrawal, etc. the body sends, which is extremely rare among communicative autistics, let alone verbal ones, if you can read this and type a response, chances are you wouldn't be able to stay at &lt;2 cigs. Seriously, don't smoke because someone online said it helped them, that's stupid, it's a bad idea and bad for you. ",,,1,0,0,

I can be lazy, I don't have to worry about my doctor saying I should get more exercise, people feel sorry for me and do shit for me because of it (sometimes this can be annoying, sometimes not, it depends).

I'm not sure what the mechanism of amitryptiline is for nasuea, as serorotonin is associated with nausea and that drug is a serotonin drug, but serotonin also stimulates gut motility, so basically the amitryptilline may make your gut move, and insoluble fiber can do the same thing. Raw shredded carrot, cooked bamboo shoots, or cooked wheat bran (simmer for 30 mins and rinse well, then 1/2 to one cup of cooked fiber). Another prokinetic agent for the gut is cascara sagrada. I think if those things work for you it would be better. Anyways, the sodium is essential to get up for a couple of reasons. The most important medically is that hyponatremia activates the Renin Angiotensin System and aldosterone.

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1532723502,"Oh yeah. I dated someone with fibro who was very upset I was much 'sicker' than they were. Their fibro was objectively very mild; no major pain, on no medication, only saw the doctor for the flu jab. They had the odd day with sore joints and occasional brain fog. As shitty as it is to have any health problem, she definitely ended up on the luckier end of that scale. 

Now I tried my absolute level best with this person, because we all have different tolerances and what one person can brush off will absolutely floor another. Like your ex I was born with my disability so I always take that into account. I grew up with my shit and am very used to it, someone who developed a disability in adulthood is *generally* going to have a harder time. 

So I listened to her always, offered advice when it was wanted, let her rant if it wasn't. Adjusted my exercise routine so we could do things together. When she said she wanted to lose some weight I offered to write recipes and cook. Went with her to the doctor when she asked, where the doctor was very surprised to see her and asked why she was there. I thought it was perhaps an anxiety thing, kept being supportive, hoping she'd chill out and get over the fact that someone was sicker than her. Anxiety can be a bitch and I try to be a patient person. 

But *every time* I had a bad day where shit truly hit the fan, she was ill. Every time. Shit doesn't hit the fan for me often, but when it does I really appreciate outside support from people I care about. I didn't get it and ended up giving it out instead. At first I brushed it off but looking back I was being slapped in the face with a big red sail and singing 'what a wonderful world' regardless. Every time *she* wanted to do something, she was fine. She'd complain about how bad her brain fog was while driving a car. When I suggested we get a bus or taxi out of concern for everyone in the vehicle, 'oh it's not that bad/it's fine/I can manage.' When I broke my wrist which is a *giant* pain in the arse with a manual wheelchair, suddenly her joints were just horrendous for the first time in months. If I was having a cry to myself in the bathroom because sometimes your fecking catheter won't go in right, she was suddenly in massive emotional upheaval. You get the idea. 

Objectively I am quite unwell, I had eight hospital admissions last year and several extra emergency room visits by ambulance for breathing difficulties. I average around four medical appointments a week. It's not a big deal to me, I run my life around it, but to someone else that's a nightmare to live in. I can understand that a lot of people can't cope with being sick. But when you are very unwell and someone - despite all your support and love and patience - tries to make it into a pissing contest, they can get to hell. 

As an aside I also dated a lovely gentleman who was had a disability much more controllable than my own and we got on fabulously. Don't let it put you off dating people with disabilities. Some people are just cunts. ",,,7,0,0,

0b3f9773-9aca-4ee7-b959-bc95295f98c0,1531803584,"me either! I’ve learned some of these differences just today lol. basically section 8 housing vouchers is like more of actually have section 8, it’s where you can go live anywhere that a landlord will accept your voucher, which is basically just having the government pay the landlord instead of you. project based means the section 8 is only in those areas, that’s where you get ‘the projects’. it’s usually apartments and housing and you apply to live in them, and some are for seniors only or disabled people, and when you get accepted then you are consisted section 8 and you get your rent paid for the same, but you’ll only be section 8 for as long as you live there. it’s quicker to get into more often than when you apply for the section 8 housing vouchers. 

and then the HUD housing is a little different, I’m still confused on that as well. I believe it’s income restricted and low income too, but it works different somehow. I think it’d just that they allow a little bit of a higher income, but since I pretty much have no income I’m not sure if that’d be a good option for me. all of this is super fucking confusing though for sure lol

But they don't have legal power over her.
We rely on him paying rent to keep the house, but he isn't paying rent. And if we... I say we but I have nothing... but if we don't pay the utilities, the HOA will take the house away. 


Las Vegas is the most corrupt place I've lived. When we had my room built on, the contractor kept saying, ""I'm sorry about this but the HOA is demanding more money or they are going to stop us from working."" Our HOA is despicable.


So we need to... figure something out with him until.... or if I'm able to get on disability. I say or if because my stepdad has given me bad anxiety about that and everything. ""No cares about you. You need to work even if it kills you. You're a lazy ass. You're worthless. They're going to deny you."" Actually... my mom has said that they'll deny me too... despite being told by doctors and a state social worker that I need to be on it... I'm horrified they'll deny me or make me do another LP. My mom and gramma both tell me I'll need to do all the testing I've already done by state appointed doctors before they'll accept that I actually do have IH... that scares me so bad because it's so much travel, waiting in loud and bright offices, and doing that over and over and then another LP... it was just my head until after that then my spine started hurting so bad since. Now even sitting hurts bad and my brother who is a massage therapist say's I'm so tense in my back and neck he can't even work on me.


Do you... I'm guessing when you say IH fam you mean you have IH too, right?
Do you have a shunt or anything? Everyone keeps telling me not to get one, or a bilateral craniotomy [sp?] because they get infected. I was told one thing that is safer is a shunt that drains into the heart or stomach. 


Are you able to do stuff? I've heard some people can... ugh... I've heard it can vary big time for different people. I met a nurse who was born with IH and has had pressures in the 80s!! She was actually the most knowledgeable person I've talked to about it. She said some people might have normal levels and not be able to function, some people might have levels that are too high or even too low and be just fine. She's able to work the long hours that hospital staff do but I keep losing active time as the years go on, down to a couple hours of nonphysical [[with pressure of 24 as it was tested a few years ago]]... or rather... of sitting time a day, and far less of standing... I actually need to monitor my time to see exactly how much time I have. I watch tv, youtube, browse reddit, ect, laying down. But doing stuff sitting hurts more and more to the point I end up getting really annoyed at everything and can't concentrate. 


I used to do things. I used to go rock climbing and would bike every day. I'd go to the skate park. Work hard at everything I did, whether chores or jobs. I could speed read, or read a book at a decent speed while watching a show and be able to tell you what was happening in both. My memory was perfect... but now it feels like it was someone else. I remember being able to remember, and sometimes still remember things in perfect clarity, but it feels wrong. Now I'm lucky if I don't forget what I went to get three times before finally remembering. If that makes sense? 


And the anxiety. I never used to get anxious. Actually I used to be kind of an ass about my honesty and how sure I was about everything. I got kicked out of classes a lot because I would correct teachers and only a few were humble enough to admit fault... and for someone with autism to get kicked out of class for knowing more than a teacher, that's a betrayal and I got suspended a few times because I yelled at teachers or principals and said they were idiots. Complete. Unfiltered. Honesty. But only if I knew something. If I didn't I just wouldn't say anything and until I found the internet, I would believe everything people told me. After I found out you can fact check with the internet, and found out people BS a lot, I fact check EVERYTHING! [for example, ""You have Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and Vertebrobasilar Insufficentcy. No no, Idiopathic means we don't know what causes it."" first thing I did when I got home was Google both of those diagnoses AND idiopathic to see if the doctor was being honest. Then I forgot I had Vertebrobasilar Insuffiency for like six months until I called the doctor and asked if he could confirm to my gramma that I have it and they said both of those... because my moms husband said I was lying. And he was there when I was diagnosed. AND he said he knew I would die in the heat because I have these... yeah... he's a jerk.]


Now... like even this I'm anxious about hitting send.... or... save. Because I'm afraid of being called a liar or... another one my moms husband says a lot is, ""It's not as bad as you say!"" Yeah... I just like sleeping most of the day and not... literally EVERYTHING else... biking, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, trying and failing to talk to women who aren't family or friends... er... or friends who I would like to be more than friends? I feel like now, that last one would be selfish of me but people keep telling me I'm worth it... like... really? I snap at people for no reason, I've been told I look and sound like I'm in pain. And that's WHEN I'm awake. 


Sorry... I get lost sometimes when I'm typing.


The question I had was... what are you able to do? I know each person with IH might be able to handle more or less, but... are you like me? Do you push yourself? IF you do push yourself, do you pay for it? If you do pay for it you'll know what I mean. Are you able to be active or are you stuck sitting and laying? What do you do for fun? What's the best distraction you've found? Have you found any that don't take their toll? Have you found any that you can do for a longer amount of time than others?


I get that some of those questions might not apply depending on how it effects you, and that depending on that, your answers might not be able to help me, but maybe they can help someone else that reads it or maybe I'll meet someone and be able to give more answers than just, 'sleep, eat, lay down, audiobook, music**, tv, darkness, videogames [monitor down to dim but not so dim you strain your eyes cause that's just as bad as bright] until it hurts bad enough that I know if I continue I'll be pretty much dead for a few days [sleeping, bathroom, snack/drink, sleeping, bathroom, for days!... yeah I refuse to push myself anymore.]


**the music I used to love was rock, indi rock, metal, ect. Now I listen to Australian hip hop. Always hated hip hop but there's something about it that... I can handle it. I still try to listen to rock but it's just... it can be hectic and that's not great. I think that's why hip hop is ok, it's fluid but not overwhelming.


OH! The bright stuff! You ever get the bright stuff? Swirling stars? First few times that happened I loved it now it's just a big nussance.... spelling?. The ones that just hang around forever suck too, bright ones, dark ones, ones that are semitransparent but not really dark or light? And the bright white flashes when the pain is REALLY bad... that sucks big time. Sometimes that happens without the massive pains and I think there's lightning... but that's only happened a couple times.


Oh! And there's a weird thing I've had happen a few times where one eye will see things in more a cool blue hue, and the other will see things in more a warm, orange or yellow hue, have you ever had that? THAT I actually like... I wish all the visual problems could be like that.


I haven't talked to anyone with IH in a while... and only the nurse I mentioned earlier... sorry that I typed so much, I know that reading can hurt and... I just hope you have a higher tolerance than I do... or don't read everything I typed. I just went and double spaced between paragraphs/segments... hopefully that helps.

Doctors dont appreciate the danger of hyponatremia, principally because when diuretics hit the market im the 1960s, drug salesman told people to avoid salt, to adhere to a low-salt diet, which resulted in much suffering and sold a lot of diuretics. Doctors presume that sodium is ""normal"" but that the patient is hypervolemic, so they dont even consider sodium physiology or what it means, they just prescribe diuretics. There's a lot of problems with blood pressure that can occur because sodium associtates with albumin in blood, and those two things together are what create the osmotic pressure in blood, so if the sodium is low that's a dangerous situation hemodynamically. You're more likely to be hypovolemic vs hypervolemic, and that probably contributes to your blood pressure abnormalities. When tood isnt digested well, bacteria have more time to make nitric oxide, and nitric oxide creates a positive feedback cycle that often results in chronic low blood pressure with gut conditions, because nitric oxide isna vasodilator, but it also slows metabolism and does a lot of damage. Im sure that nitric oxide is involved in your condition, and in addition to the profound hyponatremia, i think correctingbsodium, increasing protein and sugar could do a lot. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2257702/

5a85cc23-cac6-4358-ba44-d2cce5e0725f,1531965208,"Yea I'm on SSI (autism/nerve damage/ptsd) and trying to find a way off it.  CBD oil is helping with so many problems, now I have free time and don't know what to do with it.  I want to move to a legal state where I can grow cannabis and take care of animals.  I had to get over the relationship thing to be able to be happy being with myself.  If we don't love ourselves, we can't love another person.  We often think ""if I had this, I would be happy"" but there are plenty of negatives with marriage.  The problem is we don't take account for our blessings right now.  Most of us have tremendously better lives than people did 100 years ago.  To even have SSI is the equivalency of royalty in the 1800's.  

But not having purpose or spending money is frustrating.  Just remember to acknowledge every day your blessings or everything will seem pessimistic.  Being pessimistic is something we slowly choose but often don't realize it.  The behavior can be modified. 

A woman won't make you happy.  Falling in love would for a few years, then slowly fade away as this person slowly becomes an elderly person.  Hollywood lied about the romance stuff, it's way overblown and is there so we continue to reproduce.  I know I couldn't reach myself in my 20's so at 35 I know I can't make a bit of sense about anything to anyone.  I just see so many problems in society but no position of respect for my thoughts to matter.

If you don't think you have it good right now and you aren't suffering physically, that's a huge problem, lack of appreciating what you already have, life won't give you more until you are managing what's around you, the little things.

Also being disabled can be an identity thing, where we never try anything because it's hard, and blame it on the disability.  Even a rape victim has to get over being a ""rape victim"" and overcome that.  Even the disabled can overcome the disability, and those people get honor and respect by society, doing things normal people couldn't.  We have a chance to overcome everyone who had things easier.

Pick anything and run with it hard.  Even if that's reading 1 chapter in a book on a topic you enjoy.  Do that and wake up earlier, at the same time every day.  I would also recommend looking into CBD oil https://www.lazarusnaturals.com/cbd-info/  and vitamin D supplements.  If you aren't getting in the sun, you aren't getting enough vitamin D and that affects mood.  Magnesium is also great to take for stress.

If there's a way, try and take care of an animal, try to find ways to end suffering in humans and ainimals, even if that's going and spending 5 minutes a day on /sucidewatch and help someone in distress.  This can give you a feeling of purpose so you can live with yourself.  I've done horrible things and have hated myself many years.  Also organic vegetables, and cut out all processed sugars, soft drinks, synthetic junk.  Having a few living plants in your living area can make a tremendous difference, they are alive.

I'd definitely ask your PATH program and see if they know of any SOAR workers taking new cases... I'm sure they can also do the referral if one is needed. It's possible your PATH program also does SOAR, or something similar.

Basically what SOAR workers do is just help you fill out the application, but they help you fill it out suuuper in depth -- they provide tons of information so that Social Security has enough information to hopefully approve your SSI quickly.

First, SSI and SSDI are totally different animals, handled by in the same way. 

SSDI, is when you have enough working credit, that you can then withdrawal from the account, in which you put taxes into all those years. In essence, SSDI isn't determined by spouses income, but your ability to continue to work and maintain income. You are disabled.

The second is SSI, and that is when you don't have enough working credits or haven't work. SSI is strictly needs based.
You must have less than $3,000 in assets, and a very low income. Which is why people are telling you you shouldn't bother with SSI.

Judging by your situation you wrote, unless you worked quite a bit in the last 10 years, then SSI isn't going to happen. You make way too much, and if you have a car, boom that's probably more than 3k in an asset.

Some people get confused between SSI, and SSDI and assume it's the same thing, but in fact isn't.

These regulations revise the definition of service animal and add additional provisions.

Definition

A service animal is any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not considered service animals.""

""A public place is generally an indoor or outdoor area, whether privately or publicly owned, to which the public have access by right or by invitation, expressed or implied, whether by payment of money or not, but not a place when used exclusively by one or more individuals for a private gathering or other personal purpose.""

You more than likely signed what is called a ""two tier fee agreement."" Fees for disability claims are usually 25% up to $6k. However, due to the significant amount of work that goes into AC appeals (5+ hours to file on average plus a remand hearing), the $6k cap is lifted and fees up to 25% are payable, but they must be approved by an ALJ first. At this point, your attorney will file a fee petition in which he will request a fee based on an hourly rate that will not exceed 25% of the back due benefits. You will have the opportunity to submit a comment to the ALJ as to what you feel is equitable under the agreement. Back due payments and the attorney's fee will be issued after the fee agreement is approved, but you should start receiving monthly payments before then.

I went from like 6-21(6 isn't a typo), being intensely suicidal, unable to answer a phone call, unable to work, dropped out of schools multiple times, unable to have a relationship.

I felt so broken and wrong. Therapists didn't get me. They made me worse. I felt blamed and fucked up. And like the posion is the current stuff under those therapies made me worse. I would come out more broken.

I tried to make phone calls for like.. years and it just kept getting worse and worse. Three therapists, three years. Just for that.

But when I got into a ten week DBT course which had two weekly appointments and phone coaching... I was able to make phone calls.


I was still pretty suicidal then and I HAD to go to therapy every fortnight or else I felt completely overwhelmed and like I had lost all progress, but my therapist changed jobs and was able to see me for free, weekly for two years. And I got to be able to not be actively suicidal in the first time in my life.

So types of therapy and how intensive it is can change things.

If you have to be able to drop everything at any point to run to someone, you can never get invested in your own life. Unlike paid care workers, a partner doesn't do shifts and never gets a break from the emotional toll. 

It makes their life revolve around yours, basically she gave up her life to look after you. It destroys friendships because the carer is not consistent with their friends. They can't plan any of the things they want to do in case they have to run home. They can't even go too far from home for the same reason. If your girlfriend worked that puts strain on her professional life because no-one would ever have been able to rely on her. If she didn't work she would be worrying about financials.

Compassion fatigue is very real and it destroys the best people. When I have had partners give intensive care I arrange for respite in the form of part time care, weekends away without me, nights out with friends...the normal things people do are so much more important when an individual is caring for someone they love. 

If you don't consider yourself very, very lucky to have had that level of commitment from someone, you might want to reconsider it for your next partner. What your girlfriend gifted you with is not the norm.

The end result is many couples being forced to break up, live apart or live in secret OR, even worse, unequal power dynamics within these sorts of unequal relationships can end up leading to abuse. We all know it, nobody talks about it and nobody campaigns on it.

The way I understand it is that the eligibility for SSDI requires fewer credits the younger you are because your window of opportunity for earning them through work is shorter.  Since you applied and were denied SSDI and awarded SSI, I guess there may be a small chance to go back and try reapplying if you have sufficient records from the time period you were eligible.  You’d probably have to argue that you can prove you were disabled at the you were eligible  and that for some reason, the records were not properly considered.  However, the SSDI benefit you receive might be low and thus be supplemented with SSI anyway.  

By any chance, were either of are either of your parents  receiving Social Security retirement or SSDI?  You might qualify for disabled adult child benefits if you meet the guidelines.

If you can go to college, this to them demonstrates an ability to work and be self sufficient.  Nobody goes to college just to past the time and not utilize the investment.... in their view.

So, if you work... you don't need SSi. If you can go to college and get a degree for a career or job, you don't need SSi.

They do, however, have programs set up for you to get ahead, plans for self sufficiency, ticket to work, a grace period to work and have the option to go back on SSi.  You can get ahead, you just can't do it and stay on SSi. If you work they deduct their math, you keep a % and a % is cut from your check. You can get ahead by working.... in very small increments.  Until of course your income hits that red line and you are no longer eligible.

There for, one has the choice.... get ahead or stay on SSi.  If you want to marry, marry someone very very poor, so their income is so low it is not deemed. Or... marry someone on SSi and take the eligible couples reduction.

I think in the 21st century, with the level of money we shovel at every other country and issue around, we could make the SSi rules a little more forgiving.

fb329841-4772-486c-a6a4-6c0284d71b52,1531098218,"Hey OP,

I'm right there with ya, I'm 31 and have five diagnoses, three of which I got in the last 3.5 years. Not surprisingly due to my genetic bad luck, the drugs I need for one condition prevent me from fully treating another. This semi-untreated problem, in turn, prevents me from working. I absolutely drew the short straw in life but over time, I've found ways to still enjoy much of what it has to offer.

Now I'm not saying I don't wish I was in better health; please know that you are completely entitled to feelings of frustration, despair, fear, anger, etc. Those are normal, healthy responses to what life has dealt you. But a word of caution: playing the victim will only make things worse.

You mentioned how fortunate you feel that things aren't as bad as they could be. Brava! I, too, feel this way most of the time. But sometimes it's reasonable to compare your experience to those around you and not the starving children of Africa. Damn it, it's frustrating to have to sit out of certain activities that my cohorts are doing. It's frustrating to lose a career. [And it's especially frustrating to be ***young*** and sick.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201403/the-extra-burdens-faced-young-people-chronic-illness)

With that in mind, it'd be unhealthy to endlessly mourn the loss of these things. I grieved the loss of my career. I had always been a work-oriented person. And not working left me bored out of my mind, which only made ruminating on my loss easier. But like with the loss of a loved one who will be forever missed, the loss of one's health shouldn't forever be mourned. I still miss working, but I no longer grieve for it.

One of the things for which I'm grateful is the example my mother set for me when she went on disability for what has become a 25 year battle with cancer. Remember that genetic bad luck? It started when she was only a little older than we are now. In 25 years, I have never once heard her ask ""why me?"" She says it's because allowing yourself to be victimized by yourself is preposterous. In her footsteps, I often joke that I have autoimmune problems because the only thing tough enough to kick my ass is me!

Now, she's not unsympathetic to those healthy feelings of frustration, despair, fear, anger, what have you. She even stresses that everyone's pain is relative. I once tried to apologize for expressing that some stitches were hurting. I felt bad for complaining when she regularly experiences excruciating pain. But it didn't even occur to her to play ""who has it worse?"" by reminding me of her pain. ""Frankly"", she says, ""no one wants to win that game."" When I asked her to elaborate, she told me that the fact that she was likely in worse pain than I didn't negate the fact that I was feeling pain. Nor did it invalidate the reasonable emotions associated with it.

But her overwhelming sympathy for that is shattered by what she perceives as a people who victimize themselves. Giving in to those otherwise healthy feelings leaves you with a worse position on a world that keeps on spinning. If I'd let myself wallow for too long after losing my career, the sadness and boredom would've triggered my mental health issues. And then I'd be fucked.

So I started as you did, by reminding myself how much worse things could be. It helped, but I still hurt. Next, I reminded myself that my illnesses are only one facet of who I am as a person. They don't, in any way, define me. With this in mind, I took matters into my own hands to figure out who I was. I worked as hard as my mind and body would let me (while staying within the confines of my limitations) to find new things to do. New things to provide me with meaning. It took time, but I found those things. I still wish to be in better health, but I damn it, I have limited energy and wasting a bit of it wondering why all this happened only results in having even less energy to do what I *actually* want to do.

So look at the problems you're facing and see what *might* be within your control. As for the things that aren't, try to grieve as you would a lost loved one. Death is out of our control, so is health (at least in most cases). Mourn, but over time, remember that doing so for too long will only make things worse. Consider getting professional help to work through these feelings. Lean on family and friends. Practice self-care. Whatever you think will work for you!

I moved to an entirely new (and much more disability-accessible) city to restart my life among friends who had for too long been geographically-distant. Over time, I found new hobbies, new opportunities, and new friends. This is what worked for me, but there are a lot of ways to both change the things you can, and accept the that which you have not. \*Insert Serenity Prayer Here\* You'll find that path. I believe in you. Feel free to PM me anytime.

tl;dr: Mourn, but whatever you do, don't play the victim. It will only make things worse.",,,4,0,0,

She uses a swim diaper, tankini top and then baggy men's trunks over the diaper. I wear trunks over my costume too to cover some treatment scars so when we go together we look awesome. Mens trunks have so many nice designs on them and if you remove the net on the inside there's a lot more room.

I don't have faecal incontinence but I do have urinary incontinence and use pads along with intermittent catheters. I pop off to the bathroom a fair amount and take my cath bag with me, it just looks like I'm redoing my hair/makeup. I've found I'm way more aware of it than other people, especially in a group no-one really notices you nipping off to the loo more often. I wouldn't worry about changing off by yourself either, I saw this at the gym all the time. Some people just prefer their privacy rather than changing in an open room, and that's all I would think if I saw you leaving to change with your bag.

I agree that it's difficult to have a disability that affects your continence. People who are fine talking about neuropathy or vision loss or mental health still go 'ew' when it's a continence issue. Regarding partners I take a very matter of fact approach when it comes up; I use this medical device to deal with this medical issue, nope it isn't a problem. I normally need to cath before sex but men and women both have that 'I'm just going to nip to the bathroom and tidy myself up' moment so I sort it then. Regarding other adults I make it clear I need access to a bathroom when we're out somewhere - I use a wheelchair so I have it easier than yourself as no-one really questions it.  

I have had a couple of accidents around people. Once in bed and all I said was 'sorry about this, I just need to strip the bed and put new sheets on'. New partner as well. Was not a problem, well I guess not as we moved to the shower then he came back for more lol. Once was when my cath bag burst as I was using it in a public bathroom. That was pretty horrific as I had to go ask for a mop - I really didn't want a staff member doing that. It happens and it's embarrassing but if you have a solid mindset around it it's so much easier.

I always say that if I just had one thing I could still work, but I have a bajillion conditions all interacting with each other.

I spent 3+ years chasing quacks for the promise of a recovery, but obviously nothing planned out, and after applying for SSI I became extremely depressed and went through a ton of therapy (CBT and DBT) to help gain coping mechanisms.

The things that have helped me the most are:
1. DBT
2. Finding an in-person support system (I found it by converting to a religion despite being agnostic—it’s liberal Judaism so even most of the rabbis are some level of agnostic, lol ��)
3. Finding crafts I can manage to do so I feel productive (I cross stitch and cook/bake on good days)
4. Mindfulness meditation

But the biggest thing? DECENT PAIN MANAGEMENT 

When my pain is out of control I’m suicidal. It constantly preys on my mind and I get sucked into the “life isn’t worth living anymore” narrative.

When my pain is managed/controlled (aka consistently under a 4 out of 10) then it’s much easier for me to talk back to that voice with the evidence: my cats, my roommate, my friends and community, my partner, etc.

But even then it took me years to get to this place. I spent two solid years mourning my life (and my friends abandoning me when I dropped out of college) and playing WoW 16hrs a day to distract myself. But now, 8 years later, I don’t even have a WoW subscription anymore. ��

1:

If your parents are already retired or are drawing from their Social Security, you may be able to piggy-back on their benefits. Children of retirees or disabled parents can use their parents’ work credits to receive up to 50% of their parents’ benefits for their own disability. One way for this to work is if you are under 18. The minor children of retirees can claim these benefits through their parents if they are disabled.

2:

Many children and young people with disabilities have faced these hardships their entire life. Many disorders, like Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, are the result of genetic disorders we carry since birth. Children who received their disability before they turned 22 years old can typically claim disability through their parents. There may be reductions in the amount of benefits if they are claimed before the parent reaches full retirement age. It is important to talk to a disability attorney to understand how this works.

I had to go into the er because I was extremely dehydrated and my blood pressure was seriously low.  My boyfriend called an ambulance and I was taken in on a gurney because I was to weak to stand. They took my blood pressure in the ambulance and it was something like 27/50.  They refused to admit me to er without taking my weight (they had it on file as I had seen a doctor 2 days earlier and it was recorded then). The admit nurse kept demanding I stand up and get on the scale.  I kept trying to tell them I couldn't stand because I would pass out and could injure myself.  It wasn't safe.  Well I finally gave in because she refused to admit me ave I needed fluids desperately.  As soon as I stood I passed out.  As I was falling the emts grabbed me by my arms and ended up dislocating both my shoulders but yanking me up (EDS). This was the last straw in a long line of bad things being done to me there.  So now iv basically told everyone that unless I'm unresponsive and they really think I'm going to die,  no matter how sick or injured I am never call an ambulance or take me to the er. Oh also I used to be on a fentynal patch but when I had a really bad dislocation I had to go into the er to have it set, there was a note in my chart to give me 2ml dilaudid before setting.  Some newbie doctor saw I had a history of coming in and getting the dilaudid and marked my file as a opiate addict and drug seeker,  he than gave me naltrexone without telling me and basically killed my fentynal patch.

Everytime I'm seeing a new provider, they ask what my living situation is and I always just say ""I live with my partner"" and never thought twice about that terminology. Why should I specify my partners ability?

But recently I've been trying to secure a support worker to help me with errands since I'm struggling with things like shopping and hanging laundry now that I'm using crutches full time, and my occupational therapist asked quite bluntly ""why isn't your partner helping you with these simple tasks? Does he just not lift a finger around the house?"" and that's when it dawned on me that by not mentioning my partners abilities, my healthcare team assumed he's able bodied. He's not, he has fewer limitations than I do, but he has his own restrictions and difficulties due to his own health. 

So I've started saying ""I live with my partner, he has a similar illness"" whenever a new provider takes my social history. Or ""I live with my partner, as a partner, he's not a carer or support worker and neither of us want him to be"" depending on why they're asking about my home life (eg: when I was discharged from hospital and told not to lift anything over 200g, they then asked if I lived alone, I said I have a partner, and then they discharged me, I asked how I will manage the things like cooking and laundry because that's all over 200g, and they said ""your partner can help you, right?"" um, no, he also has limitations, why do people always assume my partner is both able bodied and willing to basically be my sole carer. They had to shred the discharge paperwork and start again, writing ""lives with equally disabled partner"" all over the place so that when they faxed the paperwork to the district nurse company to organise a temporary support worker it wasn't immediately dismissed with ""the patient lives with others, they should help, we're busy with people who have no one to help them"" ",,,3,0,0,

i have the diagnosis of cfs and fibromyalgia and have the symptoms documented but I just still feel it’s not enough for some reason. and I’m really scared of the examiner just saying no because they can, does that ever happen? is it for sure they will just ask for the exam instead of just denying it?

I’m sorry I’m asking all this because you probably didn’t want to get into all this lol. also please if i can ask one more thing, because my examiner won’t talk to me lol, my parents are paying for everything right now so will that automatically disqualify me? and if it doesn’t and I get a low ssi amount, how do i go about raising it so I can try to live alone because that’s my goal and what I need to do.

Take copious amounts of notes, get names, locations as to which office they are working out of as the general hotline will patch you through to any state, get employee ID numbers or any identifications, and record the times and dates from when you called, left messages, etc because they have all calls and messages recorded and on record and they cannot deny you if you do request that they check back on a previous call so to prove your point if they gave misleading or just false information, whether it be on accident or not. I’ve done this and I’ve caught some reps in their own words after they tried saying something else or that I didn’t call or send the necessary information, to which I quoted them a date, time, who I spoke to, the fax confirmation that they received whatever papers, or certified mail receipts of delivery.

An ESA only has housing and airplane rights. They are considered a pet everywhere else. If the FHA applies to your apartment, then your landlord cannot discriminate against you, charge you a pet fee, or pet rent. If your ESA is excessively loud, pees or poops where it shouldn't (or you don't pick up after them), or causes damage to the apartment, you will be responsible for all applicable fines, cleaning, and repairs. Your landlord may be able to evict you if you have an unruly ESA. You will need a note from a mental health professional to get an ESA.

A service dog has rights to more locations. It may be prohibited from food preparation locations (eg the kitchen of a restaurant) and private residences. It also has housing rights through the FHA. A business cannot ask what your disability is but they may ask what tasks your dog is trained to perform. Notice that""tasks"" is plural. A service dog is a trained and well behaved animal. You may be asked to leave the premises of a business if your dog is ill behaved, pees or poops, or acts violent, loud, or unprofessional. You are allowed to train your own service dog and your dog is not required to wear a vest.

There is NO registry for ESAs or service animals. Any one that claims you need to have your animal registered as an ESA or service dog is misinformed.

Keep in mind that a dog is a fair financial and time commitment. If you are unable to give your dog the training, exercise, or stimulation it needs, you may need to hire a trainer, dog walker, or pay for doggy daycare in addition to paying for food, vet visits, toys, and other dog items.",,,6,0,0,

Once you have a valid DP placard, DP plates, or DV plates, you may park:

In parking spaces with the International Symbol of Access (wheelchair symbol).  

Next to a blue curb authorized for persons with disabilities parking.  

Next to a green curb (green curbs indicate limited time parking) for as long as you wish. There is no time limit with a DP placard, DP license plates, or DV license plates.  

In an on-street metered parking space at no charge.

In an area that indicates it requires a resident or merchant permit.  

In addition to parking privileges, service stations must refuel a disabled person’s vehicle at self-service rates unless the service facility has only one employee on duty.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1532944883,"Can someone explain for a foreigner how the Disability parking works in the UK?

In Australia you get your doctor to fill out a council form that basically says ""does this person need disability parking permit? Y/N. Why do they need accessible parking? [reduced mobility / requires proximity / needs additional space / needs increased time /multiple factors]"" and then a section specifically about adapted cars and chair lifts.

Basically, if you need it, hidden disability or visible disability, you discuss it with your doctor. Your doctor helps to decide if you need it and then just vouches for you via the forms. You apply either as a driver or a passenger.

Nobody at the permit office knows your medical information, they just need ID, and the letter from the doctor saying ""this individual needs a disability parking permit"".

So I'm curious how the UK system works. How do people acquire permits to park in disability accessible spaces, how would someone with an invisible illness get a permit, someone with POTS for example would likely need proximity parking, that's very understandable, but how/why would someone with depression that doesn't impact mobility or punctuality somehow get access to a permit under the UK system?

I don't have a permit, I use crutches and occasionally a walking frame but I'm always a passenger so if space is tight my partner will just let me and my aid out before he pulls into the space.

I've actually had people see my mobility aid and tell me I should be using the Disability space, but I don't have a permit, so that's illegal even though my disability is visible.

Are there no permits in the UK or something? Is it like an honour star? ",,,1,0,0,

The thing to remember is that with both MD and menopause, your client will have a low BMR and a low TDEE, so they will need a very low calorie diet to loose weight at a fast rate.

For example, If your client is burning 1400 calories a day, and they are eating 1200 calories a day on their diet, that's a 200cal per day deficit.

To loose 1lbs, you need to burn approximately 3500 calories.

So at 200cal burned per day, it will take 17.5 days to loose 1lbs.

So if your client has only been dieting for a month, a slow rate of weight loss isn't uncommon.

What is their TDEE according to your best estimate (based on current weight, their height, and activity level) and what is the calorie goal they are aiming for with their budget.

1-2lbs per month is a healthy rate of weight loss for a menopausal woman who only has a few pounds to lose.

It's a sad fact, but many of us with disabilities have to be slow and steady to win the battle of the bulge. Increasing your TDEE through activity to help induce a bigger calorie deficit isn't easy when exercise itself isn't easy. So the only way to induce a large calorie deficit is to eat less. That said, for short women, don't go below 1200cal a day without your doctor or a registered dietician's medical support. For tall women and men in general, talk to your doctor before going below 1500cal a day.


Menopause changes fat distribution, abdominal fat can become a problem in menopause. Physical activity can help with fat distribution.  You can't ""spot reduce"" fat, but you can build muscle in the areas you feel are the most flabby. Building muscle will be incredibly difficult with MD, it might even be an unrealistic goal depending on her progression, so ""maintaining and supporting muscle"" might be better terminology to use. But the fitter you can keep your client through exercise, the longer she will be able to maintain her current BMR, as the more muscle she looses, the lower her BMR will become, as lean muscle burns more calories than other tissues like fat at rest.

My gramma can't handle... she has lung problems, blood clots, and is getting memory problems. She says she's going to die in this house and I'm worried even if we could move somewhere she could afford a bit easier... she can't travel and would probably get confused, forget how to turn on her new light and then fall down. The doctors say if she goes into the hospital again she's not going to come out, because she can't handle it. She's fine around the house but even going to the doctors is too much for her, she comes home confused, hardly breathing, and very weak.

So we need Rolf to... in his words, ""MAN UP!"" and stop... this. This cruelty that he's doing. He and my mom have brought my gramma practically to bankruptcy, she's not able to sleep because she's stressed... and he doesn't care because he wants everything. 

But unless he and my mom... my mom lives here at the house btw and now Rolf is refusing to pay rent... but unless he and my mom either start paying rent again or pay her for the truck insurance and the money they lost her... AND he refused to pay last months rent because he bought four tires that only needed to be replaced because my gramma can't park in the garage... and the car only really gets use when Rolf uses it when he's here and then he leaves it empty a lot saying, ""Oh I only drove it today and it was at half a tank!"" even though it was at half a tank because of the last time he drove it!

It's like he stresses my gramma out on purpose.

OH! But a social worker came to talk to my gramma already about them because Pricilla [she's like a PR person or something for her general care doctor at CareMore? She's nice.] my gramma had me go in and we both told her what my mom and her husband have been doing and she said she had to get a social worker out... but it's Vegas so nothing was done. I don't actually know why nothing was done...
My gramma wanted me to talk to her too but the social worker looked angry at me and only said she wouldn't talk to me, then she looked angry some more and went to talk to my gramma then she left. My gramma gets more confused than I do so I think maybe she didn't tell her exactly or as close to exactly what my mom and Rolf do and say. She always only ever says he went through all her papers [bills, checks, medical, ect]

But we need... we can't... keep living without his help. I think that's what he wants, the power. I'm sure eventually he'll tell my gramma that if she kicks me to the street, he'll pay rent. He wants me dead, he's said so... he can't stand people that ""refuse to work"". He says if you have a disability so bad you should just die so you aren't a burden on the system.

I don't know why he is ok with my gramma not working but she's actually said to him and my mom that she'll get a job. She only says that because she knows his stance on ""useless"" people and she says she can't work so she must be ""useless"" too. He doesn't like when she does that. I'm not.... for sure why. We think he wants to get rid of me so he can control what my grammas will and trust say and then kill her. So yeah... he's not going to get his way but at some point I'm sure he's going to tell her to get rid of me and he'll continue helping. And he doesn't want her to get a reverse morgage because he thinks he'll be responsible for paying it eventually.

I work in a ""right to work state"". So while they can not come out and say ""You have Parkinson's, we don't want you, your fired"". Everyone agrees that is wrong.

What does happen ""We regret to inform you that your job is redundant and you are being let go with 10% of the workforce"". Nothing can be done. You'll be on unemployment, have COBRA, but the bottom line is you are no longer employed.

For me, in the office, it was suspected I had an alcohol abuse problem. The catch was I would work at my desk, eat in the break room, and very productive. HR couldn't figure where I was drinking. They kindly offered information about programs about alcohol abuse and consoling. It was Parkinson's as my gait and slurred speech wasn't realized it was a medical condition.

That was the time to come clean and disclose medical issues. The good part for me is I have an excellent employer, four years later still working (but from home) as they realize the stress of commuter traffic is too much. I'm highly technical but meet with my manager monthly for feedback both ways.   It has worked out great.

I have disability insurance (pays 70%) but honestly, enjoy working. I could go on disability, but medical insurance isn't covered. I know the moment I stop working I'll deteriorate without the mental challenge. So, for the time being, I'm happy where I am at.

792f3385-0f6b-44ce-8fd1-0266ded346ee,1532462447,"Hey, I've got EDS and POTS and just stopped using my wheelchair of 4 years. I got a chair after my physical therapist prescribed it to me, but I honestly would have benefitted from having it way earlier. I likely could have kept working longer if I had one and could ask accommodations instead of feeling like I had to be perfectly abled or quit. 

For me, having a wheelchair was a very positive experience. I was bedridden, and my partner was carrying me to and from appointments. I could never leave on my own, and spent 2 years trapped in the house. The chair greatly increased my quality of life, and if I'd done it sooner it would have saved me a lot of trauma and my partner a lot of burden. 

Despite having been in the chair and found it useful, I have never felt comfortable using it part-time *because* of how non-wheelchair users react. When you're in a chair, people get more violent with you because they see you as vulnerable. I was constantly terrified if I twitched my legs someone would assault me, and I had several close calls. 

Because of that, when I started getting a bit better I quit using the chair 100% instead of just using it on bad days. And for health reasons, this was honestly a bad call. But I had that fear, ""what if I use the chair and someone saw me walk before and then..."" 

I can say, for me, using a chair was an immensely positive experience. Non-wheelchair users, however, are awful. I recommend making the decision by evaluating how many things you will gain, and now be able to do (ex. Not as much pain, can stay out longer, etc.) versus your worries and concerns about people's reactions.

2) Your GP. They should be able to get you a lot more help than you seem to be getting. Change your GP if they're not being helpful.

3) Adult Social Services. Even if they don't recommend any changes, you can probably embarrass them into helping you if you enlist the help of your MP and your local councillors. You can usually find out who your councillors are via the Council's website.

Just about everyone's experience of claiming PIP is that the assessors know nothing and they deliberately lie, miss off important information, misrepresent facts and just fuck you up so much that you can't bear to go on. If you have the mental strength then APPEAL, and APPEAL and APPEAL. The CAB can help, as can other charities, but the CAB are very good on the issue of PIP appeals. If you get to a tribunal, you can also ask for any award to be given for 5 to 10 years, that way you don't get re-assessed every 2 years as happens now.

It's not easy, it does take a lot of mental strength, but you can beat the bastards. Try to keep a diary of your issues to present as evidence at future hearings. Create your own narrative of what your daily life is like and then attach that narrative to every form you get sent and that way your truth will get printed along with the lies from the DWP.

163647d1-f2f0-4a21-935e-00ab093190e8,1531592545,"Hi. Sorry to hear about your situation. I just got approved for SSI. It took almost 3 years but that’s because my jurisdiction is really backlogged. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis, Borderline Personality disorder, and narcolepsy with Cataplexy. Those are the disorders that social security deemed to be disabilities. I also have add, anxiety with dissociative episodes and severe anxiety attacks. I respond okay to my meds, but I still lack the ability to adequately function.

People have provided some really great recommendations here. Since you have access to the internet, hopefully that will help you reach out to organizations that can help. One thing that helped me win my case against a judge notorious for their lack of compassion was the overwhelming amount of evidence from multiple doctors. I have been diagnosed for 11 years, but when I was first diagnosed the nurses in the psych ward told me that a disability is a disability whether you can see it or not. I didn’t believe them, but they helped me realize that documentation goes s long way towards proving something that can’t be seen. Showing that you’re doing everything you can even if it’s not working will help your case immensely. 

Document everything you can. Getting Medicaid/Medicare (I forget which it is) was great advice. A lot of times talking to one agency can help you connect to others like getting food stamps and/or welfare. Get doctors to start documenting and giving you records of that documentation - electronically is great because then you always have access. Try to get a primary care physician, but until you do get the name of every doctor and practice you go to for help with your disabilities. There are also lawyers that can help you appeal if your SSI case gets denied. They do it for free unless you win and then they collect a percent of what you are awarded. It sucks, but it works. 

Keep track of everything you do to help your functioning like trying to get Medicaid, find a doctor, and get a roof over your head. Get everything written down if you can. If you stay somewhere for a night, have the person/organization write a brief statement. “I (persons name) am writing this note as verification of (your name) housing at (organization title/or my home) located at (address) from (date/month/year) to (date/month/year).  (Persons signature) (persons name written out again) (date they signed it)”  While a hassle, these kinds of statements help to build a paper trail of you and what you’re going through. 

When I was 18, I didn’t think anyone would help because I was dealing with things that can’t be seen. It took me 9 years to finally apply for SSI. I didn’t think I would get it, but I needed to try. Having “invisible” disabilities will probably always be a battle. I still struggle to help people understand that I am sick and need help. There are people who don’t think mental illness and other things are invisible. They want to help. While the stigma of mental illness still lurks, people are advocating for our rights. But the only way they can help us is if we ask. Please continue asking for help and advice. You are not alone. ",,,3,0,0,

You should also talk to your doctor about the prescription -- maybe there is something better that can help you since it sounds like it is hormonal as well as mental. 

I think you should be honest with your manager at Starbucks about your struggles (you might qualify for vocational rehabilitation which can help advocate for you too) and try to stick it out. Positive affirmations and trying to talk down all the negative thoughts. These people won't hurt you and you're safe.. if you make a mistake and are embarrassed, everyone makes mistakes because we're not robots. Laugh at yourself and try to move on (easier said than done I know) and try to remember that your interaction with customers is just a blip on their radar in their lives and they're not thinking about you two seconds after they step away from the counter. 

If it were me, I'd really put in a lot of effort because financial stress leads to the demise of a lot of relationships and it'll be even harder for you to make it if you're divorced and living alone. 

I'd consider seeking out more therapy and make an active effort in making it ""stick"". Look for the right therapist to help you and ask for their help in tools to make things ""stick"". You definitely owe it to your family to try and your husband is telling you he's worried about finances which to me is never a good sign, especially if you can't/won't contribute. I think part of overcoming struggles is finding the right manager who has empathy and is encouraging. You'll never know if you don't try. 

I mentioned to a former manager about my cerebral palsy. She was firstly surprised because I look so abled and then she asked me a handful of questions about what my life has been like with CP, how I learned to adapt, etc. and then I found that when my coworkers knew about my CP and decided to tease and taunt me about it, she swiftly fired them. Being open and honest with her made my life much much much easier but you have to find the right people to tell. She mentioned to me that her daughter was a physical therapist and had worked at a clinic that I went to for PT so I felt like she'd be more accepting and supportive --- turned out that her daughter was my physical therapist. ha! 

I worked at a financial services firm with a coworker who has similar struggles. After mastering her job in the office, they allowed her to work from home exclusively. She still has to call clients sometimes but she can prepare for the call.. amazingly, in that kind of environment, the nicer you are to clients, the more pleasant they are and you rarely, if ever, get yelled at. I knew people were frustrated when I had to call and tell them they'd filled out paperwork wrong or missed something so I'd try to show them empathy and say things like ""well gosh, this seems silly but you forgot to check this box here so I can't process this paperwork without some additional documents from you..."" We only really had client contact when there was a problem so we were basically solution advisors for people which often times made them thankful etc. 

I worked a temp job once where all I did was type things from paper into Excel. I had minimal contact with the manager, they even stuck me in my own office, and I just zipped through the work all day. I had another temp job where I just filed stuff all day... again, minimal interaction with anyone outside of the beginning part we'd like you to do xyz and let me know if you have any questions. sometimes employees would come up and say something small to me because I was in the way of everyone walking past or they'd offer to grab lunch for me or something but in general I was pretty well left alone. I had another temp job where I organized a file room for a big company. They were unhappy with the way the files were being organized and stored so I came in and overhauled the whole place. Spent months organizing and rearranging things and then created a short instruction booklet on how the new filing system works and how to locate things. I labeled everything very clearly to make it as easy as possible. This was like no interaction with anyone.. they just said can you figure out a better way for us to do this and let me get to work. 

In short, don't give up on yourself, you can break the cycle -- you just need to find the right pieces to get the puzzle put back together. A good therapist will give you the tools and help you follow through. Also, look into vocational rehabilitation, they might be able to help you.

I felt like I was the only one, when I started - in my big fancy ass school- doing performance work and work around performance and disability. There was one other person with a physical impairment, and she was an actor and I'm sitting in the contemporary art department and everyone is able bodied, very physically capable and extremely socially privileged. 

So, I started making work about my life - at first about my being autistic, and then as my physicality started to enter more into the equation (returned full time crutch use in 2014) about my experience surrounding impairment. They hated it, they hated any work in which I didn't speak like they did (my speech id gradually becoming more dysfluent), didn't move like they did, brought attention to the oddities and confusions of my body and social position. They pulled me into so many meeting to discern whether someone like me could study there, it I was 'fit' and every single time, it came out that I was. 

So I kept making work. Got some contacts, did a placement with a good Disability-led company and now work for them part time. I got a piece that's gonna be developed for show in 2019 with a leading artist, and I'm now using a wheelchair, and becoming more comfortable with myself as a disabled person. But, it took resistance, existence and being stubbourn af to get here. 

I'm the only artist trained to the level I am trained to in my country right now. That's insane. But, someone in my first year had crutches - so even in completing the degree successfully, I've managed to convince the institution that maybe getting some physically impaired people in is all right. 

As for the next stage of education- Disability Studies is a great field, and studying Medical History through that lens could lead to some fascinating results. I don't doubt I might be the only guy in a wheelchair in the institution, but that's one more guy in a wheelchair in a fancy school - and one more who gets published and has an education.

I'm surprised all attorneys don't do this because it must improve the chances of a favorable ruling. My judge found fully in my favor. 

My meeting with the attorney explained what would happen at the hearing, what questions would be asked and we reviewed my conditions. Here are some things we talked about, it might help you prepare

I brought up a condition that I never mentioned before because it wasn't disabling, but he included it anyway because it helps my case. 

He asked me if I shower every day and my knee-jerk response was yes, but of course I don't. I had to retrain myself to be honest about what is going on, not try to surgarcoat everything. 

I was asked if I care for the pets, water the plants, make dinner, do laundry, etc. I do all of those things but I had to explain HOW I do them. So I keep the food right by the pet dishes and feed them, but my family helps with walks, and handling litterboxes and dogpoop. I water the plants in stages, a few at a time and I mentioned that I have to stop after a certain amount of time. I can make dinner, but I have to stop and make it in stages or make only simple things. Make sure to explain how your disability affects your chores and tasks. 

Don't ever say ""yes"" or ""no"" when asked a question. Always explain and add details. For example ""Can you bathe yourself?"" my answer was ""Yes, but I have to take cold showers and can only stand for a few minutes and usually I can't dry off before I have to lay down so I put my robe on when I'm still wet"" 

If you can't sit comfortably for an hour...DON'T. My hearing was on a webcam with an ALJ at another location but my attorney explained to me he had clients that couldn't sit, so they would ask the judge if they could stand and change their position. He had a client that was turned down once because he was able to sit the whole time and on appeal the audio recording showed that his client didn't sit the whole time and had to change position multiple times. Don't force yourself to suffer through pain or anguish because you are embarrassed or used to it. Be honest about your pain and comfort because this is your only chance to show the judge what you are experiencing. 

I was asked about work history and the tasks I performed at my job. This was used to determine my skills and what current jobs are available now that can accommodate my disability and that I can do with my job skills and abilities. A vocational specialist was on the phone at the time listening to everything and at the end he provided a list of how many and what jobs were out there for the specifics the judge used. 

For me I realized that I was used to living with the condition and just trivialized things that were a part of my every day life. These things are important and my lawyer helped me focus on what I was doing to live with my disability that made it more manageable and recognize that I had to mention those things, not just say ""sure I unload the dishwasher every day"" when the reality is, I actually let dishes pile up, and can only unload the dishwasher a little at a time and have to stop throughout the process and lay down. 

It took over two years for me to complete this process. It was an absolute nightmare and I can't imagine what people do who don't have support or resources to wait. ",,,3,0,0,

I was homeless and disabled and met my partner doing disability advocacy only to find that he'd also been homeless at one time and campaigning for disabled rights in shelters. It was a bizarre coincidence. We both are on the autism spectrum and are totally in love. I've been on SSDI since a young age and he struggles with employment.

I understand this isn't the norm and I never want to suggest ""there are so many fish out there in the sea"" because if you're disabled, no, there's not, absolutely, but you can meet other people like you, who understand you and have been through the same things, and it brings you even closer.

I know a lot of people don't get married but in some places domestic partnerships are still an option, and you can look into the ABLE savings plan to keep from losing your benefits, although I don't know how that mixes with marriage exactly: http://ableforall.com/

I don't really hang out with people who don't feel ""safe"" to me anymore, who haven't gone through a lot and/or have some experience with chronic health/homelessness/disability issues. The things you are feeling, that no one would want you, that you're terrible for not working, that you have nothing to give, slowly have gone down over time since I've chosen carefully who I've interacted with. I always used to think, ""If everyone's the asshole, then I'm the asshole"" but that DOESN'T HOLD if you are a minority that suffers discrimination due to your disability and classism. Just like you would go mad trying to integrate yourself into a fundamentally racist society as a person of color you tend to go a bit mad hanging out constantly with people who are very ableist and don't know it. You can't get away from it entirely but you can choose who to keep close and they will not say things that keep you down like that because they've been there. If there is any disability community or activism in your community I highly recommend it :)",,,3,0,0,
f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1531968933,"I completely understand how someone with a disability can become emotionally and physically vulnerable within a relationship.

For me personally, I've only experienced financial vulnerability that leads to emotional vulnerability. If I move in with a partner who's income is over $36k (which is most people, median income in my country is $64k) then I instantly get cut off from my welfare payments because the government assumes that my partner will pay for me. That's not the kind of relationship I want, I don't want the person I'm dating to be the only person responsible for my basic needs. That's how you become trapped, get little sway and no control, that makes me feel emotionally  vulnerable. But it's also not affordable for them, Along with cash welfare, my disability status lets me get discounts on public transport, discounts on medication and healthcare appointments. While I receive $12k a year in cash payments, I easily utilise $20k a year in subsidisations. So If I move in with my partner, they'll need to have 32k disposable income, Or i'll need to make big lifestyle changes, and since most of those subsidies are for healthcare, that's not something I *want* to compromise on. I want to get the treatment that helps me, I don't want to have to beg a partner to budget *their* money for my health. I know that marriage is ""I sickness and in health"" but I'm not looking to get *married* and i'll never be ""in health"" so it's all just very hard to accept emotionally.

I feel like I can't ever move in with a partner, no matter how long term we are, and if I do move in, I feel like I'm giving up what little independence I have left.

Yesterday I forgot my wallet in my other bag when I went out to dinner with some friends and my boyfriend. I was allergic to everything on the menu anyway so I'd eaten before and was just planning on having a soda, but when I realised I forgot my wallet I stuck with the table water. My friend kept making jokes that My boyfriend should buy me a drink. Why should he? I don't need a drink, I didn't work for his money, he did. It was so uncomfortable, I told my friend I didn't want a drink and she started guilting my boyfriend into saying ""It's really awkward that you wont buy her a drink, she's not even eating anything"" and that was emotionally manipulative for him, He kept asking me all night ""are you sure you don't want a drink? they're only $3"" and I kept having to stand my ground. Sure I could have just accepted a drink, But there was so much emotional weight to that, it felt like accepting that he has to take care of me. I've worked so hard to not need to make my boyfriend my carer (physical therapy, claims and appeals for home help, etc) to take his money feels like making him my financial power of attorney. I'm not ready to give anyone else power of attorney over anything, that's the Independence I have left and I want to keep it as long as I can.

But I love him, we cohabitate well, I want to live with him. But Financially I don't know how I'll ever be comfortable with that.

I lived with an ex for a while. I lost my payments, We broke up for various reasons, But I had no income, he was paying my rent, He needed me to move out so that he wasn't stuck living with his ex, but we struggled to prove to the welfare department that we were broken up because they just kept saying ""well you used to date, and you're still living together"" ... right, because where else was I meant to go?

His new girlfriend moved in, I slept in the garage, They were the best of people because they never made the environment toxic, But you can see how if they we'en't the best of people that situation could have gotten very toxic very fast. Thankfully her moving in helped the welfare department see that I was single, and I received a 75% payment, It was just enough to get a room in a sharehouse and start rebuilding my life.

It makes me think of stay at home mums that become divorcees, they have huge gaps in their resume, they don't have an established career, they become trapped. But many of them *can* work, and many may feel comfortable accepting alimony or child support if they're not co-parenting, But many get trapped, emotionally and physically stuck because of financial hardship.

If you have a contact number, you can always call in advance to ask their policy. However, the idea is to get a sense of your child’s functioning based on what they can observe and hear from her directly. In short, by all means you can help provide some history and encourage your child to answer the questions, but do not take over and not allow your child even a chance to respond. The more that can be gotten directly from the child, even if it is their difficulty in responding or the level of support they need to respond, the better. 

They will probably give a WISC too just based on what you’re saying. That is something for just them and the examiner.

Some very good comments here.


Umm I have LS hemiplegia from a car accident I was involved in when I was younger. Living with it is challenging. My life is pretty much normal, despite the recurrent pain I experience and the emotional impact is can have on me and the lagging of my LS.

I honestly dont think I have much of a support group other than some family members and the “on and off” counselling Ive had.  I agree its definitely very hard living with a disability, when you haven’t got anyone who is experiencing something similar to empathise with you.
So far I have really been ignoring my disability and trying to live as normal a life as possible. Though this is not really the best way to live with it (from my experience). As I tend to break down or have low periods when things get really bad....

Anyway what Im trying to say is sometimes the best way to handle or deal with your disability is to have a support group around you. Whether family etc or counselling. As well as staying positive by setting achievable goals for yourself, working towards them and constantly reaffirming your value and worth to yourself and believing them. ALSO try not to compare yourself to others ESPECIALLY those who dont have your disability. Realise you’re on your own journey/path x

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1532778073,"This is really something you need to speak to your PT about. If you don't have one I suggest asking your doctor to refer you when you speak to them. Doctors are wonderful for many things but mobility aids are not one of them, it's really a PT's area of expertise. All the below is written on the assumption that you are still encouraged to move as much as possible in a gentle manner.  

I would speak to your doc/PT and listen to what they have to say first. They'll know if you need support on one side, to both sides, in front, unevenly, if you need different sized handles or cuffs or height. It sounds like you've already looked into the options pretty well. Standard canes or [quad canes](http://www.mvmsinc.com/images/products/detail/NO5620BRZ.jpg) if you have poor balance, elbow crutches and [rollators](http://images.millercare.co.uk/product-images/1000-1000/rollator-R8-Blue-Black-Wheels-one.jpg) are all options depending on your level of mobility. Rollators are good for many people as they provide multiple functions - support if you need it, just push if you don't, a seat if you need a rest and a bag for your shopping. They're also very easy to transport on buses or in cars.

From how you've described yourself I would personally not touch a manual wheelchair. As you've said the more you keep moving the better, and you want an aid that will encourage you to get walking when you can. If you start using a chair for short periods you're likely to have a cheap and cheerful job that won't support your back and hips correctly and will be heavy and uncomfortable to push. Efficient wheelchair use takes time to learn as you build up muscle in your back and arms, if you're not using it every day you're not going to build that strength. And the more you're sat on your arse, the less progress you're going to make long term. 

The exception is shopping. Stores normally provide manual wheelchairs as well as the scooters, but they may be tucked away somewhere so don't be afraid to ask! If using a wheelchair would help take the strain while shopping, go for it. Indoor floors are smooth and easy to push and you'll be going at a very slow pace without the strain that would happen outside. Have you looked into online grocery shopping in your area? When I was in a similar position to yourself I got the heavy items delivered but deliberately omitted things like a loaf of bread. Something small but essential so I had to go out and get it (therefore actually leaving the house) but that didn't take the time or energy of a full shop. 

I would also ask your doctor about some different pain relief. Opioids don't help, that's fine. Has anyone ever suggested a neuropathic drug like gabapentin/pregabilan or an antidepressant? Certain antidepressants can be very effective painkillers and doctors are much happier to prescribe drugs like these as they don't have the abuse potential of opiates. If you can it would also be worth seeing a pain clinic. They do medication but may cover further medical treatments and physical therapies like an exercise plan, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy. Behavioural therapy to help adjust mentally and learn pacing skills, as living with a chronic illness is shit. Some offer group support. What is available depends on your clinic and there is normally a considerable waiting list, but they can be very helpful. 

I know that disk pain is...crushing (lol?) and if you can get that under control your mobility will likely improve too. It's amazing the difference it makes, you get so used to pain and don't realise just how it's affecting your movement until it's gone and you can move that little bit freer. Also just checking...are you taking the naproxen and ibuprofen together at all?

It sounds like you could do with some adjustments at home too. You said housework is difficult, what specifically do you find difficult about certain tasks? Which ones *need* to get done first and what do you struggle with. Someone here may have a suggestion to make it easier. Same goes for cooking. I became a master at super low effort meals so that I was still eating something nutritionally valuable when everything was a mess.

I just started using the naproxen recently. I used to use it years ago, almost exclusively, to treat my muscle pain but it started hurting my stomach.  I stopped taking it around 10 years ago.  For the last year, I’ve just been using ibuprofen which helps with some of the pain, but isn’t really helping the pain in my leg muscles or my lower back/hip pain.  So I decided to try the naproxen again about a month ago. I’ve been alternating days. Actually, that’s not really true as I’m still using ibuprofen on more days than the naproxen.  Im not taking them on the same days as I was trying to see if I had better results with one than the other.  I can’t really tell, which is frustrating. I’m just trying to make it to the dr appointment where I can discuss better options.  

One of the meds I was put on during that downward spiral was gabapentin.  I was under the care of a new neurologist. Originally I was on Requip for the Dystonia, and had been, with great results for 4 years.  I took Requip, topimax (epilepsy and cluster migraines) and Tizanidine (muscle relaxer). That was it. No pain meds and I was up and walking/hiking 6 miles twice a day, every day.  Then my Neuro retired and I started seeing the new one. She had me stop requip without tapering off and start a very high dosage of gabapentin with out titrating up (1800 a day).  The results were not good.  It is the bleakest and darkest time of my life.  My entire personality changed. I wasn’t functioning, physically or mentally.  Within weeks, I couldn’t make it through a mile of my walks. I was in so much pain, and I felt like I had completely lost myself mentally.  I started locking myself away from everything and everybody.  I didn’t trust myself to be around people.  My thought processing was way off and I had these waves of rage that I felt were uncontrollable.  I begged to be takin off the gabapentin for months. When she finally agreed, again she had me stop taking it cold turkey.  No tapering.  The withdrawals were agonizing (which is really an understatement, but I’m gonna leave it at that).   I was then put on cymbalta.  Again, I just wasn’t tolerating it well.  I started having these brain zapps, kinda like someone set off electric shocks in my head.  With the help of my PCP, I tapered off after 6 months.  I’m still not sure if the issues with cymbalta were residual issues from the gabapentin, or if I was truly reacting to it as well.  I’m not willing to try it again though. Under my PCP, we’ve tried a couple depression meds and anxiety meds without success.  

I was under the care of a pain dr for about 2 years.  I went in the hopes that we could find a treatment to replace the opiates.  I live in a small town, so went to the only pain clinic here.  All I was offered were the opiates and shots, but I couldn’t ever get a real answer to what the shots were so I passed on them.  When I asked to taper off the norco, he upped my prescription.  At that point, I decided to not go back and tapered off, again under my PCP’s care.   I would love to find a pain management clinic that offers some of the things you suggested.  Pretty much all those things would be beneficial.  I’m willing to try anything and everything that might help me regain some mobility.  I know my biggest hurdle is pain management. 

I have utilized the manual wheelchairs at stores from time to time.  I prefer them over the motorized carts. I’ve never tried to use it alone though. I’ve always had someone with me to push if I get worn out to quick.   Mostly, I try to walk every time.   I was dead set that I was going to stay moving, without help, for as long as possible (forever, cause I’m stubborn)... BUT my daughter has taken to holding my hand the entire time we are out, because she’s worried I’m going to fall.  She’s 12.  It took seeing the concern in her eyes to wake me up. I don’t need to be putting her in this position.  

Doing stuff around the house differs every day.  I have a hard time with any tasks that requires me to stand for longer than a couple minutes.  I have a stool I use in the kitchen to help while I’m cooking.  I can’t do anything that requires bending, without help.  And sweeping is the worst thing ever.  Laundry has become a family activity (which is actually a good thing as they all know how to do wash now).  I don’t do any dishes anymore, except for the occasional washing of a pot. The kids handle all of that.  But, there are lots of things that aren’t getting done regularly.  (Specially if mom’s in bed with a flare up lol) I notice all of these things, because.. well I feel guilty that I can’t do them. My husband and the kids don’t have any issue with a cluttered home, and are happily just living life.  :)  We’ve discussed hiring someone to help a couple times a month, but just haven’t done it yet.  


I was down similar to this once before, though not to this severity.  About a three year time period before being put on the Requip in 09.  So I know, in my head, that I can come back from this with the proper help.  I’m worried that the longer I’m down like this, the more permanent it becomes.  At the least, I desperately want to stop the progression.  

Ok, I warned you that I would ramble.  Lol. I’m not even sure if I answered any of the questions, so I’m going to stop here for now.  Again, Thank you for your reply. You’ve given me a lot to consider in regards to treatment and options that could help.

However, for a few months, I had a broken hip, was completely incontinent, and had other problems. I had to wear diapers all the time. That was a problem, I can understand how a 13-year-old boy would be mortified. Even as a 19-year-old girl I felt the same way. The only thing I can suggest is to check out places you would be planning to go for adequate facilities. For example, ""family"" or unisex restrooms, or at least single-user restrooms can be a big help. The guys I date check out restaurants and other places to make sure that they are accessible (the restroom accessibility can be the big problem).

I hope that this is, in fact, temporary and he will get out of the cast. If so (based on his doctor's opinion), remind him from time to time that things will improve. It is much easier to deal with any problem when you know that it is temporary.

A student with a learning disability has a few weak areas, like dylexia or dysgraphia, but generally keeps pace with the general curriculum.    With accommodations and effective early intervention, students with learning disabilities should be able to get a standard diploma, although they may work far harder for it than their peers.

I’m in my twenties in a wheelchair with depression. Yeah, I felt the same for awhile before lots of meds.  

For me, I feel like some things are just the way they are? Some people get dealt with very interestingly messed up hands, but the upside is your labels don’t have to be your entirety.

What helps me find my identity is knowing that there’s still something I like or love or hate? Outside of the disability? I like writing, cookies, or a person. I hate when people chew gum too loud. That’s the you beneath all the apathy. Give yourself the things you care about.

I soldier on because spite, mostly. I want to be more than what other people think of me and what I think of myself. I don’t want to be what the disability made me into.",,,3,0,0,

I have a kickass pair of Killstar leggings which have an occult print on them. They're high waisted and made of very soft fabric, but I think the waistband could do with being made of slightly less strong elastic, maybe flatter elastic too. An adjustable front sounds heavenly: I have endometriosis, so when I have a bad flare, I bloat like nothing else. An adjustable front would be lovely. I could accommodate the endo belly easily then. 

As for underwear, there's a particular set I have that are very flat elastic around the back, short type design, and a lovely, elastic lace part on the front. It's like a band about an inch thick. I've worn those  ones so much because the scar I have lower on my abdomen is still very sensitive, so having it lie flat and not push is super nice. Higher waisted underwear is also an absolute godsend, because of endo belly (again), but also because I place heat packs on the inside of my clothes. A lot. They're stick on ones, so I have to be careful that there's enough clothing between me and the pad, or I burn. That's happened before! 

As for patterns/designs, I like tighter leggings/trousers for winter, and looser stuff for summer. I have a really nice pair of hareem pant type things which are loose, brushed cotton type fabric, and have a lovely flat waistband. They're great in early summer. Pattern wise... I do like my clothes to have personality. I have another incredibly comfortable pair of leggings with skeleton legs on them, and another with bats all over.

You will organize things differently, have different routines, and struggle a little while you figure it out but that’s ok! You will have 25 eager helpers when you need them and will be giving these kiddos a huge gift of learning that different people have different abilities and you will get to help grow that empathy inside them. You’ll be great! 

As far as line walking goes teach the kids to stop at check points. Tape a star and a happy face on the way to PE. When learning routines have the line leader stop at each one at wait for you to say it’s ok to go on. You can walk in the back and side to keep an eye on them. Make a HUGE deal in the beginning of the year about keeping their damn coats off the floor and always pushing in their chair. Kids love to touch the wheelchair- teach them hands off. Teaching them to watch their fingers and toes so they don’t get pinched. Assign a door holder and teach them to open the door ALL the way. 

You will figure things out and it’s totally ok t try something and say “well, that didn’t work “ and try something different. Ask the kids what they think they can do to help. Obviously they love this because it makes them feel empowered. “Kids I’m having a hard time passing out papers, how do you think we can solve this?”. 

They will have plenty of questions so be prepared to establish what your personal boundaries are with that.

The only part of medicaid that I find kind of sucky is that it is state specific so I have to be in my state of residence to get medicaid to pay for anything. Originally they figured ""hey this is for people so poor they're almost homeless, so its not like they're traveling around the country."" Its a reasonable assumption but if you live on the boarder with another state, sometimes the closest hospital in an emergency is going to be across that state line. So you have to hope you don't have an ambulance take you across the boarder to an adjacent state in an emergency or you could get stuck with all the bills! It also means if you visit family in another state well-within reasonable driving distance, you have to high-tail it back home if you need to see a doctor about something.

Also: In my state medicaid doesn't seem to pay for therapy so IDK how that works for people whose disability is psychological (luckily my problems are all physical). It will pay for any psyc meds you want, but if you want to see a shrink you're on your own.

Then there's the whole estate recovery thing that will fuck over anyone you leave behind if you die first. Have a house? any vehicle? That goes to the gov when you die to reimburse medicaid. They can and will evict anyone who was living in a house you owned (jointly or solely) to auction it off to real estate speculators. They will delay the auction to let a widow or disabled child live out their years there, but if you were cohabitating with nondisabled children, siblings, cousins, whatever they end up on the street.",,,2,0,0,

If I were to guess its probably because the part you are quoting **is** credible.

Yes, disabled people get the same marriage ""perks"" (like cheaper car insurance), but our social safety nets expect the healthy-spouse to basically ""adopt"" your financial needs by usually taking away the disabled spouse's eligibility for things like SSI, EBT, medicaid etc.

That's a net-loss, and a very very heavy net loss that causes disabled people to be left out when it comes to marriage or even long term relationships because nobody wants to take on a heavy burden like that.

Its one thing if you're already in a relationship with someone and then they become disabled. You love them, you've got a history together, so sometimes you can stick together and tough it out. But if you were disabled from birth (or ""something like that"") through no choice of your own, you're completely screwed in the love &amp; relationships department by the way these programs work.

Someone who can put in enough ""work credits"" can get SSDI, and then they can contribute to a relationship by paying their fair share. But nobody on SSI can pay their fair share. Hell, SSI enrollees are actually exempt from having to pay child support because the system figures its so hard to support even one person on SSI that taking away a single dollar per month to give it to your own child is an unreasonable burden.",,,1,0,0,
